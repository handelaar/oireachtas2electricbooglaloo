    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 26 January, I received on 12 January a letter signed by Mr. Gerry Adams, in which he raised a number of matters pertaining to the Joint Declaration. These generally related to the issues, notably self-determination and consent, which I have addressed in my post-Declaration statements to the Dáil and Seanad, in my recent address to the Irish Association, and in my speech at the Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh Memorial Dinner. He also raised allegedly contradictory interpretations by the two Governments, and the further steps envisaged in the peace process.</P>
      <P>On 28 January, I sent a letter and a memorandum containing a detailed response to Mr. Adams which dealt with many of the principal points he raised in his letter and in his public speeches. I have sought to provide as much explanation and clarification as possible in order to assist the process of deliberation, by trying to clear up any genuine doubts or confusion regarding aspects of the Declaration.</P>
      <P>In my letter I expressed my conviction that the Joint Peace Declaration provides a framework for democracy that is fair and balanced for all, and which deals with the key principles involved in the situation. However, naturally, I could not pre-empt matters that are properly the subject of future all-party negotiations. I put a strong positive case for acceptance of the Joint Peace Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accompanying memorandum deals more specifically with the points raised, along the lines of my public statements and speeches since 15 December 1993. Nevertheless, I do not intend to depart from the long-established practice of respecting the confidentiality of correspondence <Col N="815" /> between the Taoiseach and another party.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive clarification has been given, as incorporated in my letter and in the numerous public statements which both I, the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have made. It is important to recognise that the Declaration can be clarified or explained authoritatively by either Government. In this context, let me state clearly that none of my public statements relating to the contents of the Declaration has been rebutted by the British Government. It is my hope that all these detailed explanations and elaborations will expedite the process of deliberation, and that the process of internal debate within Sinn Féin and the IRA will lead to a response soon.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of fact that there is a British military presence in Northern Ireland. There are also two sets of paramilitary organisations, Republican and Loyalist. I have already said that there can only be a mutual process of demilitarisation through confidence-building on all sides. What is needed is a basic framework of democratic principles for peace and political progress, that apply equally and impartially to both communities, which will allow a permanent cessation of violence on all sides.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the Government has not set a specific deadline for a response from Sinn Féin. We understand that the process of internal discussion, debate and consideration takes time in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I look forward to an early and, I hope, positive, response. Naturally, much attention is focused on the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis at the end of this month and perhaps some response may be forthcoming by around that time. I have said on many occasions that no party or parties can have a veto on political progress. In the meantime, preparations for the resumption of the three strand talks process continue between the two Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be calling <Col N="816" /> Deputies in the order in which their questions appear before me on the Order Paper. I call, first, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Will he accept, from the point of view of reducing suspicion and building trust and confidence, that a case can be made for publication of the correspondence between himself and the President of Sinn Féin and that to a degree it enters into the public domain? Would the Taoiseach say this, not in any accusatory sense, but from a genuine feeling that it could help to build trust and confidence not to have documents that at present are confidential or secret? I encourage him to rethink his approach on that matter. On the question of the position of the Nationalist minority, on the one hand we have cast iron guarantees on the central issue so far as the Unionists are concerned &mdash; the question of the continuance of the union unless a majority in Northern Ireland decide otherwise &mdash; but can the Taoiseach now say loudly and clearly, on behalf of the Government, that he is fully satisfied the Declaration respects fully the Nationalist minority's sense of identity and aspirations, culture and traditions and equally guarantees their economic and political rights?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning that it may be a small minority that is holding up the acceptance of the Declaration? Does he agree that it is totally wrong that a very tiny group should virtually hold the country North and South to ransom because they are not prepared to row in with the huge majority on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of Deputy O'Keeffe's question, I have no evidence to support the speculation in one of the daily newspapers. Consequently I do not propose to speculate on that speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other aspects of Deputy O'Keeffe's question, in the Declaration there is clear recognition by the British Government of the rights and <Col N="817" /> identity of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland. They can rest assured that their full rights are recognised impartially by the British Government, the equal rights of the two communities are clearly enshrined in the document and that they can pursue their legitimate political objectives through the democratic means. Whatever agreement is reached between the two traditions on this island, the British Government has, for the first time, said it will underpin it and legislate for it.</P>
    <P>As to the publication of correspondence, the well-known principle has always been adhered to that correspondence between any party and the Taoiseach remains confidential and I do not intend to depart from that very dearly held principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the main problem for Sinn Féin seems to be the question of self-determination? Indeed, the Taoiseach said this is one of the matters on which Mr. Adams sought clarification. Does the Taoiseach accept, from the comments made by Mr. Adams in the United States and supported by Mr. McGuinness last week, that Sinn Féin believes that a minority on the island as a whole cannot have a say in relation to constitutional change? That being the case, will the Taoiseach confirm that in his correspondence with Mr. Adams he indicated that he believes there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the wish of the majority there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always made clear the Government's position in relation to self-determination and the definition of it. Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement enshrines the principle of consent. There is no departure and will be no departure from the principle of consent. The Deputy can feel assured on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point, I do not propose to comment on statements or parts of statements made by Mr. Adams in the United States. I will await the response <Col N="818" /> to clarifications that were sought from me and which were given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept as true the statement made by Mr. Gerry Adams while in the United States that Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA are two entirely separate organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on that statement any more than on any other statement of Mr. Adams. I got a letter from Mr. Adams to which I have responded and I await his response in relation to where his organisation proposes to go from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in expressing the hope that the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis will repeal its standing resolution to the effect that all Sinn Féin candidates must support the &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it quite clear, without even waiting for the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, where I stand in relation to violence and that I genuinely believe there should be a permanent cessation of violence in relation to all matters of conflict on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred in his response to there being three parties to the conflict &mdash; the British Army, the Loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA, the Republican paramilitaries. Does the Taoiseach accept that the British Army which is the legitimate army of Great Britain, there under the authority of the Minister of Defence of the British Government, cannot be equated with the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries? Would he accept that using language that equates the three is unhelpful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact that there is a British military presence on the streets of Northern Ireland. It is also a matter of fact that there is violence coming from two paramilitary organisations, but I want to put it clearly on the record of this House, as I have done on many occasions, that I and this <Col N="819" /> Government fully support the impartial enforcement of the rule of law both North and South and that I condemn illegal violence from wherever it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the Taoiseach's reply, Mr. Adams has now received the clarification he sought. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is now no necessity for clarification and therefore no reason for a continuing demand for clarification from either Government? Would the Taoiseach further agree that his statement yesterday to the effect that talks in the absence of a cessation of violence could not resolve various issues that would arise in talks is effectively handing a veto to the paramilitary organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the Tánaiste have made it clear on a number of occasions that the Government's position is that no political organisation should have a veto on the talks or on political progress in Northern Ireland. That is our position; it has always been our position and it will remain our position. On the question of clarification, I have given extensive clarification. The Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has made it clear that he will respond in public speeches to some of the issues that have been raised with the British Government. In the last few days he has put it on the record that the British Government will be persuaded by an agreement among the people of Ireland, among the two traditions on this island and that the British Government will legislate for and underpin whatever agreement emanates from those discussions. He has referred also to some other aspects. Some of the issues that have been raised are matters for discussion and debate when all parties are around the table and some of the issues are for negotiation with the British Government after a cessation of violence has been declared. The Declaration stands on its own feet. It is not, and never was, put forward as an overall solution to many of the issues that are being raised. Those issues are rightly to be negotiated <Col N="820" /> around the table with other parties present. Some of the issues are matters for the two Governments individually and collectively, but they are not matters that can be dealt with in advance of the acceptance of the conditions of the Declaration, namely, a permanent cessation of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Séamus Mallon has on a number of occasions quoted from what he has said is paragraph 5 of the Hume-Adams Agreement. Would the Taoiseach confirm that this is an accurate quotation and that there is no difference between that paragraph 5, where there is reference to the Taoiseach, and the Downing Street Declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have at all times said that I would not get involved in the Hume-Adams talks. It is a matter for them to publish any documents in their possession if they wish. That remains the position. I made it clear from the start that we would not publish that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to look to the future, hopefully a peaceful one. The Taoiseach is to meet with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, next week, when, presumably, Northern Ireland will figure largely on the agenda. Can the Taoiseach indicate what will be his objective at that meeting? Does he intend to focus on the Downing Street Declaration and its aftermath or will preparations be made for a resumption of the three strand talks? What is the immediate future in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are continuing between the two Governments in relation to the resumption of the talks process. The meeting on Saturday week between the British Prime Minister and me and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will involve monitoring the position, updating ourselves on the matter, a general review of the progress of the Declaration and how we should proceed <Col N="821" /> in regard to the three strand talks process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the nature and extent of the coverage given to the visit by Mr. Adams to the United States was very damaging? Was the Government consulted before the visa was granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said, time and time again, this was a matter for the American Administration. It made its decision and that was that. We do not tell foreign Administrations what decisions they should take or expect them to tell us what decisions we should take. The question of the extent of coverage is a matter for the media and the US Administration did not have control over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will remind the Taoiseach that December was not the first time the British Government stated it would facilitate, by way of legislation, the wishes of the people in Northern Ireland who want to be part of a united Ireland. Does the Taoiseach share my concern &mdash; and that of many people inside and outside this House &mdash; that democratically elected leaders, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the Taoiseach, should be played with for so long by somebody who believes that the armalite has equal value to the ballot box and that it is time it came to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is unnecessary because the Government has repeatedly made it clear that it does not go along with any point of view which states that the armalite and the ballot box should be used to pursue political means. The purpose of the Declaration was to signpost and show a new way forward for the pursuance of legitimate political objectives for the Nationalist community because they have been dominated for a long time, and although Stormont has been dissolved many people in the North would like to have it restored, even at this <Col N="822" /> late stage. We have never encouraged violence as a way of pursuing legitimate political means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there is growing impatience because there has been no discussion between the Northern Ireland political parties in the three strand talks process for the past 15 months and that this has created a huge political vacuum which has been filled by the Provos, which is unhealthy? Will the Taoiseach say when he would like to see the three strand talks recommence?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it incredible that no representations were made to the American Administration in regard to Gerry Adams's visit in view of the fact that successive Irish Governments have campaigned vigorously in the United States in regard to preventing IRA fund-raising and that some Irish diplomats have been involved full time in that matter? That has been an ongoing concern of Irish Governments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We appreciate the clear support for the Peace Declaration of the American Administration by President Clinton and those who were <Col N="823" /> signatories to the attempts to secure a visa for Gerry Adams to enter the United States. That was the position and continues to be the position. Deputy Bruton knows as well as I that financial support from the United States to a large extent has dried up and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ready at all times to pursue the three strand talks process. We have always said we do not regard the Peace Declaration as standing in the way of the resumption of talks. The two are complementary and not in conflict with each other.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my earlier question, the Taoiseach stated that it would not have been appropriate to lobby the American authorities in relation to Gerry Adams's visa. Did the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs not inform this House that they were lobbying the American authorities in respect of visas for Irish soccer fans wishing to travel to the World Cup? Surely it was irresponsible of the Taoiseach and the Government not to lobby against the granting of that visa which has done a great deal of damage to Ireland in the United States.</P>

We will continue to do our best in respect of securing visas for people wishing to attend the World Cup.</P>

      <P>In relation to the talks process, does the Taoiseach agree with the statement by Sir Patrick Mayhew that the Declaration should not be seen as an alternative to talks? Will he clarify &mdash; to use the phrase that has many connotations at this stage &mdash; his statement that the Declaration provides a new starting point for the talks? Is he implying that the ground already covered in the three strand talks will be set aside or will they restart from the point at which they finished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that the Peace Declaration was in conflict or in competition with the three strand talks process. Our position has always been that if we could get agreement on the Declaration it would provide a new and peaceful environment and give the talks process a better opportunity of success. I want to make it clear that a certain amount of ground has been travelled in respect of the Declaration, it would be incredible if we ignored how far we have gone in that regard and recommence the talks process at the position we were at prior to the Declaration. The Government is committed to the three strand talks process and is ready to participate as soon as other parties are ready to do so. That was our position before the Declaration and it is still our position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 7 and Oral Question No. 38 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons on the live register averaged some 294,000 in 1993. This was 15,000 lower than the figure forecast in the 1993 budget. The total number on the live register on 28 January 1994 was 297,000, a reduction of 100 over the corresponding December figure. The seasonally adjusted figure for January shows a reduction of 6,200 over the December figure. As such, these figures represent some of the best news on this front in over three years.</P>
      <P>While we will all welcome these encouraging figures, they do not afford any basis for complacency or for jumping to premature conclusions. One swallow does not make a summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment of the present magnitude <Col N="828" /> is and remains wholly unacceptable socially, economically and, indeed, politically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment is beginning to use very flowery language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for it are multiple and complex. They include cyclical factors such as developments in our external markets as well as the deeper, or structural, reasons such as the shake-out in agriculture which still continues and various factors which have weakened job performance on the industrial front, particularly those which were highlighted in the Culliton and Moriarty reports.</P>
      <P>The main policy inferences which can be drawn, in my view, from the unemployment figures for the past 13 months and from other economic data such as the preliminary results of the 1993 Labour Force Survey are, first, that the broad thrust of current employment policies and programmes appears to be correct, and, second that the challenges facing us as a society to promote growth, competitiveness and employment while protecting the interests of the unemployed and the disadvantaged are very formidable.</P>
      <P>The Government, in its policies and actions since coming into office, has given a lead. The National Development Plan represents the broad strategy. Government decisions on the Culliton-Moriarty reports are central to its policy on industrial development and the promotion of enterprise. The economic fundamentals are right, helped by a very good budget. Now is the time for all sections of our society, including the investment community, to participate fully in the common effort to utilise all our resources and to maximise employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the stability of unemployment during 1993 was achieved primarily through increased emigration? Will he not agree that the latest figures show that total employment in 1993 grew by only 7,000 at a time when we know the natural <Col N="829" /> increase in our labour force was 25,000, a difference of 18,000? Those figures indicate that a substantial number of people emigrated. Will the Minister not agree that emigration is a factor and that the figures he takes succour from may give him mistaken encouragement? While we have regular figures on employment in key sectors, will he not agree that many industries in our key sectors are in decline? For example, employment in the building industry in 1993 decreased by 6,000 compared to 1992. The manufacturing industry is in decline and has enjoyed no growth. This is at a time when our manufacturing industry and the economy as a whole is enjoying the highest rate of economic growth in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions. I am not sure that we can identify one dominant cause for the relatively poor performance of those sectors. While recent figures give some cause for comfort, we cannot afford to be complacent. I do not agree with the Deputy that emigration is one of the major factors contributing to the amelioration of the problem. Economies in the two destinations to which Irish people have traditionally emigrated are in serious decline. Our evidence indicates that emigration is not the dominant factor which the Deputy suggests. A number of different factors influence the relative performance of the labour market. I reiterate that, while the figures give some cause for encouragement at this time, the overall figure is unacceptable and Government policies are designed to reduce unemployment further.</P>

      <P>Unemployment figures in the UK are falling rapidly for the first time in a long period and it is known that Irish unemployment figures normally fall in sympathy with those of the UK. Will the Minister not agree that the increase of 7,000 in employment recorded last year is equivalent to the 7,000 extra people who <Col N="830" /> participated in social employment schemes? Will he not also agree that those schemes, while admirable, in some respects, essentially are playing snakes and ladders with the unemployed in that the people on those schemes are out of a job after 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree. In many cases the people who participate in the unemployment programmes and schemes to which the Deputy referred would not secure employment in a vigorous labour market. Those schemes were established to enable the unemployed to enter back into the world of work. The straight correlation which the Deputy makes is a mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may need time to consider this suggestion. Is he aware that in the past five years ten times as many jobs were created in the service sector as in the industrial sector? The service sector employs twice as many people per £1 of output and sources 50 per cent more of its purchases in Ireland than the industrial sector, yet it is forced to bear four times the rate of profit tax. The Minister's Department and other <Col N="831" /> Departments lend little support to the efforts of employers in this sector to start up and make a success of businesses. Will he not agree that there must be a strong presumption in favour of establishing a division of this nature in his Department to redress some of the bias against this important sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in what the Deputy says. I am not in disagreement with many of the observations he has offered to the House. The small business task force under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, is about to complete its deliberations and I will await its recommendations. Many of the small businesses represented on that task force are in the service sector.</P>
      <P>There is merit in the recommendation that there should be greater focus and emphasis on the role played by the services industry in creating sustainable employment in the economy. However, I make a distinction between internationally traded services and domestic services within the Irish market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12, 16, 40, 66 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of AIB Bank on 28 October 1993 to convey disquiet at the adverse effects which the new level of bank charges would have for business and consumers, particularly because of the multiplicity and proliferation of such charges. Bank charges are now becoming an increasing burden on business costs and household income, especially at a time of low inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the difficulties which are created for the consumer when faced with increased new charges for various services. Bank charges are regulated under section 28 of the Central Bank Act, 1989. Each holder of a banking licence is required to notify the Central Bank of every proposal to change or impose a charge, and the term or condition applying to the provision of a service. In examining proposals to increase charges the <Col N="833" /> Central Bank must take due cognisance of a bank's cost base.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Governor of the Central Bank regarding the more effective regulation of bank charges. Following this meeting I am now considering the most appropriate way in assigning a role to the Director of Consumer Affairs under the recently published Consumer Credit Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not indicate to the public by way of an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 23 October that tough new controls would be introduced in the Consumer Credit Bill? That Bill has since been published and under the key sections dealing with control of charges and interest rates the banking sector has an exemption from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in effect a separate question. The Consumer Credit Bill will be introduced this week or early next week at which time there will be extensive discussion on it. Perhaps the Deputy is under a misconception in this regard? The Consumer Credit Bill was drafted following an EU directive on money lending. There are very tough controls on moneylenders, particularly in terms of differentiating between legal and illegal money lending, and the Director of Consumer Affairs has power to deal with misdemeanours in that regard. It would never be considered that bank interest charges, one of the issues raised by the Deputy, would be dealt with under the Consumer Credit Bill. That is a matter for the Central Bank, a macro-economic matter, which does not come under the consumer credit remit.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a role for the Director of Consumer Affairs with regard to bank charges and to that end we are considering an amendment for insertion in the Consumer Credit Bill. On the basis that the draftsman had completed the Bill it seemed that the most appropriate way to deal with the matter was by way of an amendment.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for coming to my rescue. I strongly envisage, and I have constantly said that I see the Consumer Credit Bill as being tough on enforcement. I very much look forward to Deputy Bruton's support for the amendment to give to the Director of Consumer Affairs a role for the first time, in consultation with the Central Bank, in bank charges. I have not heard the Deputy express that point of view before. It is very welcome to me and to the Department that the Deputy will support my thrust in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 19a, 26a, 39a, 39b, 54a, 56a and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment which will commence on 1 March 1994 is a developmental and social employment programme which will both subsume and constitute a qualitative upgrading of the existing social employment scheme, the Community Employment Development Programme and Teamwork. There were 23,876 participants on these three programmes at the end of December 1993 who will transfer as appropriate to the new programme and the target is to <Col N="837" /> increase this number to 40,000 by the end of the year. Community employment will build on the experience and strengths of the three existing programmes and will provide part-time work opportunities in areas such as community services and other necessary activities for persons who may not otherwise be likely to enter gainful employment.</P>
    <P>The programme will give participants a better chance to compete for long term jobs as they become available by enabling them to stay in touch with the labour market, practise work skills and learn new skills. Development modules will be phased in over 1994-95 for participants on projects of 11 participants or more and amalgamation of smaller projects to reach this level will be facilitated by FÁS. Development modules will include personal-employment skills, technical skills relating to project work and support for own time development.</P>
    <P>Community employment will be open to persons 21 years or over in receipt of unemployment assistance, persons in receipt of unemployment benefit for over one year, persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance for over one year and other special categories such as those referred by the National Rehabilitation Board. Eligibility is not restricted to persons on the live register although it is likely that the bulk of participants will come from the live register.</P>
    <P>The Deputies can be assured that the operation of the programme will be kept under review to determine if it is meeting its objectives of assisting persons who are long term unemployed regain a foothold in the labour market having regard to economic conditions generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir. I will not quote but it said there was a major plan to create 40,000 training places and job opportunities. Instead the number has turned out to be 16,200 because all the existing SES and CEDP people are included. Will the Minister acknowledge that this will make no dent on the scale of the unemployment black spots? Will he agree that when he was chairman of an all-party committee during the last Dáil the proposal was to create 50,000 such posts? Will he reassure the House on the precise arrangements made in terms of incorporating the provision for the training element which will be necessary and say how much is funded from Europe? Finally, is the big deficiency of the scheme not the fact that once again the people concerned are turfed back on the dole queues after 12 months on the scheme? The CMRS proposal and the proposal put forward by Democratic Left sought to create a structured programme which would break the cycle of unemployment and provide a better opportunity for people to get back into some kind of sustainable work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions to which I will try to reply. First, I am not accountable for the accuracy or otherwise of Independent Newspapers. The Deputy should perhaps spread his custom around other newspapers if he wishes to avail of such information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be able to do that soon if the Minister does not act under the mergers and monopolies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If such an application comes before me the Deputy can be assured that I will act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the numbers, the programme is a qualitative change on what already exists. Like other Deputies, the <Col N="839" /> Deputy will be aware that building-in and working-up to numbers as extensive as 40,000 will take time. It makes sense to integrate those on the existing three programmes, Teamwork, the CEDP and the SES. Of course, we would like to have more places and it is my intention to look for more as we gain experience. This will require us to look in an innovative way at locations for such employment throughout the country. I will come back to the House in respect of that in due course. As both the Deputy and I learned from our time on the all-party committee, the capacity and demand for such employment is enormous, and in excess of 40,000. Nobody in this House, least of all me and my two colleagues, would disagree with that.</P>
    <P>With regard to funding, apart from the training element very little of the scheme is directly funded by the European Union &mdash; the rest does not fall to be funded from the European Union in the normal course of events. The final details in respect of the exact programme have not yet been finalised with the Commission.</P>
    <P>The reference to people being on the scheme for one year is no longer accurate as some people will be able to stay on it for two years and we hope others will be able to stay on it for three years. The intention is to ensure that people enter a path where they can progress from one step of employment to another until hopefully they finally gain full time long term employment. Our experience from the social employment scheme is that at least 25 per cent of the people participating in it go on to full time employment in either the public or private sectors. I hope that the introduction of the development module will facilitate and assist people to make that progression and transition into full time employment. The responsibility for such training will be carried by FÁS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my supplementary to the point made by the Minister about one year participation on the course. Is it not the case that the leaflet distributed by the Minister on <Col N="840" /> budget night expressly stated that participation was for only one year and that there would be what he called a limited opportunity to extend that period where FÁS agreed? The phrase used was &ldquo;and may be re-engaged by sponsors for a second year with the agreement of FÁS in the following limited circumstances&rdquo;. It talks about a couple of supervisors, etc., which is extremely limited. I accept the Minister's good wishes and good intentions in the matter but it seems the experience will be the same as that in regard to the SES and CEDP schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I earnestly hope that the experience will not be the same and that we have all learned from the operation of the existing schemes, particularly the SES which has been running for more than ten years. In cases where the sponsor indicates clearly that a participant would benefit from another year on the programme that person will be able to stay on it. I am looking at the cost implications of this and trying to match the desires of people who are not currently at work and who wish to participate in such a programme with the availability of spaces, as against the desirability of allowing someone to continue for a second or, as in some cases, a third year if it meets both their needs and those of the sponsor.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to widen the scope of the question. The Health and Safety Authority takes its duties very seriously. When I visited Cork last August I pointed out strongly to the relevant firms that they needed to be more open in terms of their procedures with the wider community. I am very glad that in the budget the Health and Safety Authority received what amounts to a not inconsiderable boost to its income, allowing for the employment of more inspectors and staff.</P>

      <P>With regard to the incident in County Cork, which is also the subject matter of Question No. 19, will the Minister accept it is of fundamental importance that not only the safety of the environment is protected but that the jobs of the workforce in the plant are protected, bearing in mind that all the employees are the bread winners in their families, have young children and big mortgages? The Minister's Department has an obligation to give whatever advice and assistance it can to ensure that the jobs of these workers are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One needs to strike a proper balance when dealing with such issues within an industrial environment. Of course, the Department of Enterprise and Employment wishes to pursue all <Col N="842" /> avenues open to it in an effort to maintain existing employment and to add to it whenever possible. When I visited Cork I also met the union representatives of the firms in question who made points similar to those made by the Deputy. I am very much aware of the need to strike a balance in this area, keeping the safety remit strongly in mind at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with some aspects of the Minister's reply. For example, she did not indicate whether the Department has learned anything from these incidents or whether it intends to utilise the information which has been accumulated from the investigations. She said that the number of inspectors in the Health and Safety Authority would be increased. Has the Department any view on its role in this matter? I know there is a concern about job protection in the Department. Will there be an element of that in any future legislation or regulations which the Department might introduce in this area?</P>

In reply to the wider question posed by Deputy Quill, in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, as in any Department, a sense of balance must be constantly maintained in regard to issues such as this. The Health and Safety Authority, like any other body, learns from experiences. Therefore, I am sure notice will be taken of issues which may arise from these incidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided that the Employer-Labour Conference would consider all the issues involved, including the operation of the joint labour committee system, in regard to a statutory minimum wage and prepare a report for the constituent bodies of the conference. I have no role in relation to the conduct of the business of the Employer-Labour Conference; this is a matter for its constituent bodies. However, I understand that the conference has not reported on this matter. For my part, I have no proposals to put to the Government concerning the introduction of a statutory minimum wage.</P>
      <P>I should point out, of course, that the position of low paid workers has been addressed in recent years in a number of ways. The joint labour committee system has been extended significantly and it now applies to some 100,000 workers. In addition, the position of low paid workers will be further improved through a number of specific measures brought forward in the budget. In particular, the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy, the exemption from both the health and the employment and training levies for those employees in receipt of £173 per week or less, the improvements in personal tax allowances and the widening of the standard rate tax band, will significantly improve the position of those on low incomes.</P>

He indicated that he does not intend to put any such proposal to Government but has the Government in the Social Chapter made a commitment to the introduction of a minimum wage?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a minimum wage is fraught with many complexities and difficulties as the Deputy, who is a professional economist, will readily agree. For that reason it was agreed by both the social partners who would be directly affected by this, the trade unions and the employers, that the matter should be considered by the Employer-Labour Conference. It has not, as yet, reported back to me in this matter or, indeed, issued a report. I would have to have regard, in many respects, to what it may or may not recommend before I would bring proposals to Government since the matter was brought up in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I would be prefer to wait and hear what the conference has to say on this issue before I bring forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister wanting to consult with employers and unions but I wish to establish the Government's position. It is all very well to consult with the social partners but has the Government a position on this? What position does it adopt at EC Council of Ministers' level when such proposals surface?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unsure if there is a formal Government position; I am not aware of one if there is. However, I will obtain that information for the Deputy. On the question of the introduction of a minimum wage, I would not bring forward proposals without having full consultations with the trade unions and the employers. I am, therefore, awaiting the <Col N="845" /> views of the Employer-Labour Conference on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that according to the latest EC data, the Republic must endure the ignominy of having the largest relative low pay problem in the Community, compared even to countries like Portugal and Greece? While the concessions made to the low paid in the budget are welcome it would be wrong to exaggerate the significance of them and say they lift people on low pay out of the poverty trap. Would the Minister agree that if, at the negotiation of a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the employers were opposed, the trade unions were in favour and set up a committee to examine the issue, the Government has a function and a role to play? I wish to press the Minister further in regard to the Government's position on a statutory minimum wage, such as that which obtains in many of the more successful economies in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we have minimum wages to the extent that the joint labour committees, with which Deputy Rabbitte would be familiar, cover just below 10 per cent of the workforce at present. I would be more inclined to look at certain sectors of the economy and consider how we could ensure a minimum wage in them, provided that such an intervention does not minimise the prospects of employment for people seeking work and does not distort the competitive basis of the Irish economy relative to other markets with which our employers and workers have to compete. I am in favour of a minimum wage if it can be seen to work economically and efficiently. I am totally opposed to an artificial minimum wage which is set as a national statutory minimum and is circumvented illegally, as has been the experience in many continental countries. For example, in Portugal the minimum wage has been undermined and breached on many occasions. If we are to have minimum wage levels they should be transparent, enforceable and focused on areas where <Col N="846" /> the normal process of effective free collective bargaining can function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument is reminiscent of the argument of the Tories in Britain in regard to the competitive situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> other economies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that much of the focus of this low pay problem is on the domestic sector of this economy where we are not in competition with anyone? If one considers the rag trade, for example, which is a relatively low paid sector, it is unlikely in the main to be as low paid as some of the domestic sectors. Is it not the case that by and large the joint labour committee mechanism is not very effective? It is built on voluntary agreement and; if the voluntary agreement of employers is not forthcoming nothing can be done about it. It applies to a very small proportion of workers in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept what the Deputy said. As I indicated in my reply, the joint labour committee system covers 100,000 workers. I would be open to suggestions to extend that in certain areas where a case could be made that the normal process of free collective bargaining is not applied. I do not accept the Deputy's contention that in some areas of domestic services these are not internationally traded. The cost of such services has to be borne by the companies who are trading and all wages must be paid out of the wealth that is created by the enterprise. The experience over the past 18 months, particularly during the currency crisis, demonstrated, in a manner that none of us previously realised, the vulnerable position of large numbers of Irish indigenous industries having regard to the competition from, in particular, the United Kingdom which remains the dominant market for almost all such companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not about to introduce a minimum <Col N="847" /> wage system which will have the effect, before a short period, of reducing the number at work. This Government's priority is very clear; we want first to ensure that those at work obtain a fair wage. We want to focus income tax relief on the low paid and we did that successfully in what was an excellent budget. We want to ensure that employers are encouraged to take on more employees and we took a step towards that by reducing the PRSI contribution for employees earning £9,000 or less, which is a relatively small sum of money. To bring in a minimum wage on a national statutory basis, which could be construed by some people, in the absence of scientific data, as going against the thrust of that co-ordinated Government strategy, would not be in the interests of those seeking employment. It could, in some cases, endanger the employment security of those at work. In principle, I would like to see people working, earning more money and paying less tax on that money. I would like to see those people not at work getting into work. I do not propose to introduce legislation of the rigid nature this question refers to. The joint labour committees are an effective mechanism for introducing a legal floor for wages in those areas where the free collective bargaining process has not been functioning in the past. I will be open to suggestions from Members of this House, or from members of the public, to extend the remit of the JLCs into areas where a case can be made, but not at the expense of employment generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Companies Office is an important source of business information in Ireland and has a function in the provision of public access to companies <Col N="849" /> information. The office makes extensive use of modern technology to enable it to efficiently carry out its functions. Documents filed are scanned into an automated document imaging system and stored in a database for public access. This was outlined in the companies report for the period to 30 June 1993 &mdash; known as the &ldquo;green book&rdquo;&mdash; which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in November 1993.</P>
      <P>For the automated scanning system to operate to optimum efficiency it is essential that documentation being filed adheres to certain minimum standards of presentation. Accordingly, the office has established requirements in that regard, including the use of black ink and requirements on the size and quality of paper and print. These requirements are well known and generally respected by those responsible for filing company data.</P>
      <P>Should the Deputy have a particular case in mind where difficulties have been experienced, I would suggest that he or she bring the matter to the attention of the manager of the CRO for consideration.</P>

      <P>I must ask the Minister to accept that in these days of advanced technology it is an absolute nonsense to have the kind of machinery that will not accept ink other than black. I have a number of cases I can bring to the notice of the Companies Office, particularly of people in small businesses and self-employed who have spent a lot of time and trouble in completing forms only to have them returned. Would he accept that this does not happen in the odd isolated case only? This was part of a presentation made to a number of Cork TDs by the Cork Chamber of Commerce when a number of their members complained that extensive documentation has been completed very accurately by employers but returned by the Companies Office. They considered this to be wasteful and wilful bureaucracy gone mad.</P>

      <P>The reality of modern technology, as the Deputy will readily appreciate if she goes to the nearest photocopier in this building and puts a blue felt pen signature on a document to be copied in that photocopier, is that it will not record the image of that signature with the same degree of definition as it would if one used a black pen of similar type and make. It is in the interests of the companies filing the data, on which legal obligations rest, that that information be accurate. Every day of the week we are requested to fill out details on forms in block letters. I think this question is frivolous beyond belief, contending that somebody cannot read the instructions on the form and fill it out with a black pen or, preferably, type it out. It is in their own interests to do so. The idea that the Cork Chamber of Commerce &mdash; whom I will have the pleasure of meeting later this week &mdash; could go to the point of making a presentation to elected Members like Deputy Quill and say that this was an instance of bureaucracy is the height of nonsense when we have state of the art technology installed, ensuring rapid processing of the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There must not be any Chamber of Commerce remaining in the country the Minister has not met by now. I welcome the Companies Office laying down requirements that information furnished be clear; but it is a very recent conversion on the part of the Companies Office that they are into such high technology and clarity. The backlog to within a couple of years ago was such that records were not up to date. I ask the Minister to join with me in welcoming the fact that the Companies Office is now automated, incorporating the latest technology, if that indeed is the case.</P>

      <P>I must ask the Minister to accept that the question was not frivolous in intent. Nobody disputes the fact that material submitted to the Companies Office must be clear, legible and precise in all its elements, but it is a matter of extreme annoyance to companies, particularly people in small firms and businesses, to have documentation on which they have spent time, trouble and money returned to them by the Companies Office. I do not think it is unreasonable to put in place the kind of machinery that will accept blue ink, which is almost standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with the Deputy in that. Although the question has not been tabled in her name, clearly she owns its thrust very energetically. The machinery installed in the Companies Office is state of the art. I would invite any Member of this House to visit the Companies Office and see the manner in which these matters are processed. It is a function of modern technology that it can read with clarity certain depths of ink as part of the colour spectrum but cannot read with clarity other types of ink because of the use of light to transmit the relevant information.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable that instructions be given to people completing forms. The use of the colour would be fairly basic. Forms were returned to companies in the interests of the companies themselves. It costs the Companies Office money and time in sorting out such forms, re-posting and so on. I regret that some forms had to be returned but this was to protect the interests of those companies and to ensure that the information was 100 per cent accurate. Otherwise it could have been misinterpreted if photocopied again by somebody conducting a search in the Companies Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts by the Companies Office to improve its operations are in line with Government policy to render it easier for people to do business. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Séamus Brennan, will be bringing forward the task force on small business fairly soon, <Col N="852" /> when we shall outline other areas in which we hope to assist. I trust that small business people would recognise that we are endeavouring to help them to do their job with this new technology which is paid for out of taxpayers' scarce resources.</P>

I hope that the experience, skills and the marketing expertise which Kentz Corporation has acquired over the years can be salvaged in the most efficient manner possible to ensure that a very substantial international engineering company, operating from Clonmel, can continue.

Because of the rapidity with which the problem emerged, the early warning system, the CEPU &mdash; the competitive and employment protection unit &mdash; was not directly involved and not contacted.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not carried out an audit of the cost to small business of compliance with tax and other regulations. A study of the compliance costs of PAYE was undertaken on behalf of the then Department of the Public Service in 1984. One of the key findings of the study was that these were regressive with smaller firms incurring proportionately higher costs.</P>
      <P>On the basis of a survey of 119 enterprises, the study estimated that the gross compliance cost was approximately 4 per cent of the total PAYE liability for firms with fewer than 25 employees but just under 1 per cent for firms with over 400 employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administrative burden on small business under the tax code and other regulations is one of the main issues being considered by the Task Force on Small Businesses. The task force is due to report later this month and it would be premature to comment on the areas in which deregulation might take place in <Col N="855" /> advance of the receipt and evaluation of its proposals.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced a number of measures designed to reduce the administrative burden on small businesses under the tax code. These include the introduction of a single tax registration form, a single tax clearance certificate and the revising of VAT thresholds. As the Minister for Finance acknowledged, these measures broadly follow recommendations made in the task force's budget submission.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the University of Bath conducted a study which arrived at the conclusion that compliance costs on traders were just under £8 per £1,000 of goods sold. In companies with a turnover in excess of £10 million it estimated that the compliance costs were about 3p per £1,000 of goods sold. These are tentative figures and I am not sure whether they are useful statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in dealing with the problem of compliance for small business, which has become a major issue, and on which he has taken a very high profile position, it is essential to have some idea of the extent to which burdensome obligations are placed on companies? Otherwise we could well embark on substantial changes and, at the end of the day, have no firm grounds for believing we were improving the position. Will he also agree that, <i>prima facie</i>, if the PAYE wage bill is costing 4 per cent more for smaller employers, VAT and withholding tax burdens and other regulations related to business must be adding substantially more than 4 per cent? Finally, will he agree that it would be worthwhile to carry out such an audit on a small sample basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues have moved on from an audit. Having discussed this matter with the task force on small business, who have been working for some months, the case is proven that small business disproportionately bears the cost of regulations and compliance. <Col N="856" /> It is clear that the percentage for smaller firms is considerably higher than for larger firms. Without wishing to demean the Deputy's suggestion, an academic assessment at this stage might be comforting but I am virtually certain it would merely support what the task force on small business said, that they bear an undue proportion in regard to compliance and regulation.</P>
      <P>I am more interested in getting some practical results. The task force made a pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy will be aware the Minister announced seven measures, arising directly from the task force, specifically to assist smaller firms. He increased the VAT threshold, reduced capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 27 per cent; incorporated roll-over relief; changed the cash receipt basis for VAT on turnover up to £250,000; amended the BES scheme to take account of smaller firms; allowed a PAYE allowance of £800 for the children of proprietary directors; amended the PRSI percentages and announced a small business expansion loan of £100 million which is proving useful to small industry. Those seven items are now in place. When the task force reports I expect to have a similar number of measures put in place because small business wants action, not further academic studies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are currently under way <Col N="857" /> to ensure the maximum co-ordination of effort by the Department of Social Welfare and my Department in conjunction with FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is hard for the public to understand why placement officers should be in both FÁS offices and social welfare offices? If the location of placement officers in labour exchanges is beneficial why can the Minister not arrange to have such officers in labour exchanges? Would he not agree that social welfare officers do not have the training in employment placement or the familiarity with the work place that the specialist officers reporting to his Department have?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That view has been expressed, but as against that there is a need to ensure that those who are signing on regularly in conditions where the only transaction that can be done in many of the social welfare offices is simply to sign on and to collect the money, can be identified and guided to the FÁS offices. In many cases the research has pointed out that people who are signing on consistently in social welfare offices are not making any effort to go to FÁS offices. This is an attempt to co-ordinate the two activities. There is no great duplication but there is a certain overlap for the purpose of ensuring that people who are signing on regularly and who could find suitable employment are encouraged to start looking for it. In many cases the experience of the placement officer in the social welfare system has been that people are not looking for work.</P>

Is it not true that the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the placement service very much resented the establishment of the job of facilitator and that proper discussions had not taken place between the Minister's Department and the Department of Social Welfare with a view to bringing this idea to fruition? Would the Minister not agree that where placement officers are in any case involved in trying to plan training courses, it would be preferable by far for the Social Welfare office to refer such people to the placement officer should they require advice to facilitate them in getting a job, and that the establishment of this job of facilitator is an entirely unnecessary exercise?</P>

      <P>I will try to reply to the question. The people to whom the Deputy refers, the FÁS placement officers, are in offices to which many of the customers, or the signing on applicants in the social welfare offices, never go in the first instance. This is an effort to ensure that there is co-ordination. I am well aware of the disquiet expressed by some people in some of the FÁS offices throughout the country. I suspect that the Deputy, because of his experience, is more aware of it than I am. We have an obligation at national level to ensure co-ordination between people signing on and looking for work through the FÁS network. I accept that there is a degree of duplication and overlapping but it is minimal relative to the objective of ensuring maximum efficiency in the operation of the labour market.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland has proved to have the worst record in Europe at turning economic growth into growth in jobs.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland does not have the <Col N="862" /> worst record in Europe at turning economic growth into growth in jobs.</P>
      <P>The relevant NESC study, Report No. 94 P1 94, &ldquo;The Association between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland&rdquo; certainly indicated that, over the period 1960-90, the employment intensity of our output growth was well below the average for OECD countries as a whole and some way below the average for &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; countries. However, at least three other member states of the present European Union, Italy, Spain and Greece, were further below the OECD average than Ireland over that period. Data were not available for all members states. In the more recent period, 1987-90, Ireland, while still below both the OECD and European Union averages, was ranked ahead of France, Italy and Denmark.</P>
      <P>A major factor in our performance relative to that of other countries generally, over the 30 year period, was the massive decline in agricultural employment here. The impact of this decline in slowing the rate of growth of total employment was much more pronounced in Ireland because of the relatively large share of the workforce employed in agriculture at the start of that period.</P>
      <P>In the more recent past, 1987-90, the NESC study identifies three factors in particular which has set Ireland apart from most other countries in terms of the structure and composition of its recent output growth. These are (i) the exceptionally high, and growing, share of output growth accounted for by manufacturing industry in Ireland; (ii) the very rapid rate of productivity growth in Irish manufacturing industry; and (iii) the unusually severe contraction in the non-market services sector in Ireland during the second half of the 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC study presents the first stage of a two-stage investigation of links between economic growth and employment growth. In the next stage, the focus will be on interpreting and explaining the different development patterns <Col N="863" /> described, and drawing implications for policy formulation.</P>
    <P>Some important policy implications of the trends described in the NESC study have already been drawn by Government. If we are to achieve significant net employment growth, we will need sustained high rates of output growth. In addition, we need significant growth in indigenous enterprises where employment intensity tends to be greater. We also need to pay more attention to the services sector and we are re-focusing industrial policy to take account of that. Overall, we need a balanced approach in which all sectors capable of contributing both to economic and employment growth are encouraged and assisted to the maximum extent possible. That is the objective at which current policies and programmes for the promotion of enterprise and the creation of employment are aiming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's complacency about our performance in this area is disturbing. I refer the Minister to a recent study by the European Union entitled <i>Employment in Europe</i> in which employment versus growth performance of all Community countries in the period 1983-91 is outlined. Ireland's dismal failure, at the bottom of the league, was remarkable in that during that period we enjoyed the highest rate of growth in Europe yet we were the only country that experienced a decline in employment. Would the Minister agree that we have to take this issue very seriously? If other European countries had enjoyed our rate of growth, 24,000 jobs per year would have been created, which, coincidentally, corresponds to the growth in our labour force. Would the Minister agree also that during recent years we have had massive contributions from the European Union &mdash; 11 per cent of GNP in the past five years &mdash; and that we cannot afford to allow policy to drift? We must take another look at the manufacturing sector and be much more radical in the area of services than the Government has indicated to date. Does the Minister recognise that <Col N="864" /> employment targets have not been met in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy to the extent that none of us can afford to be complacent and I certainly am not. If I have given that impression. I want to correct it immediately. The Deputy's question asks the reason Ireland has proved to have the worst record in Europe at turning economic growth into growth in jobs. My reply is based on the reports of the NESC and OECD which do not agree with the assertion in the Deputy's question. We recognise that indigenous industry needs to be given greater assistance and for that reason we have implemented within the space of one year the recommendations of Culliton and Moriarty with regard to focusing the domestic side of the IDA, now known as Forbairt, to do precisely that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Brennan, has identified the particular role that small businesses can play in relation to employment. There are 100,000 small businesses and if even one third of them could create a sustainable job and employ a person, we would have a net addition of 30,000 jobs. In reply to three earlier questions the Minister detailed seven explicit and detailed measures that the business sector requested be implemented and which the Government has implemented. In addition, the Taoiseach's office set up the task force on services; we have published its report and, in reply to a previous question from Deputy Bruton, I indicated that we will be responding within a matter of weeks on the role envisaged for services. To suggest that either we are not aware of the problem or we are complacent in responding to it is not in accord with the facts given this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the reasons the Minister gave for our problems are interesting. He highlighted the fact that the decrease in the numbers employed in agriculture has contributed to the problem. However, as a result of the GATT and CAP reforms there is no doubt that <Col N="865" /> there will be a further decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined changes in taxation and, in particular, VAT which will help small businesses but obviously we will have to wait for some time to see if that will be the case. The Minister needs to be more enthusiastic about creating opportunities for employment because in my book it is not sufficient to fiddle about with the system. Recently I visited a factory where the workers have been replaced by machines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us hope because that is what the 300,000 unemployed people are looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is barely one year in office and in that time it has done a number of things that people had been seeking for many years. In the area to which the Deputy referred we have made available a fund of £100 million to small businesses for working capital and expansion at 6.75 per cent fixed for ten years &mdash; something that is not available anywhere else in the European Union. We responded to the repeated cries that the local community had within itself the seeds for employment creation and established county enterprise boards throughout the country with clear democratic representation, a local community focus and a fund of at least £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is shaking his head but I would have thought that in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, of all constituencies, the ability of entrepreneurs to create business and jobs from the agricultural sector is a lesson for everyone to follow. Across the spectrum, in taxation, compliance and the refocusing of the IDA, the Government has been implementing a co-ordinated and planned strategy that is addressing the <Col N="866" /> needs of those who say that given a little help they can do the job. We have put in place a well thought out co-ordinated programme and it is up to the communities who have been looking for such initiatives to run with the ball.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that part of the difficulty in translating the very impressive growth rates into jobs stems from the fact that excellent recommendations made by experts or committees of experts in relation to budgetary adjustments are not acted upon at budget time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is implementing the recommendations of an array of experts and is doing so in a co-ordinated manner. If the Deputy wants to hear chapter and verse I am ready to quote them. The fact is that many of the things people were looking for in the area of employment creation are being done. However, the fact remains &mdash; all Members know this &mdash; that our collective performance relative to other economies in turning economic growth into jobs is extremely disappointing. There are numerous reasons as to why that is the case. Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Cox from the Deputy's own party, my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke and I debated this at length at a seminar in Donegal two summers ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take both questions together.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the failure of South Dublin and Fingal County Councils to adopt their estimates of expenses and strike rates for 1994 after a series of six meetings by each of the councils. The adoption of annual estimates is one of the fundamental responsibilities of local authority elected members and where a local authority fails to adopt an estimate, within a reasonable period, steps must be taken quickly and effectively to avoid causing serious hardship to the general public and to employees of the local authorities concerned and to those in other employments, whose jobs are dependent on the continuance of essential local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my duty as Minister to supervise in a broad sense the manner in which local authorities carry out their responsibilities <Col N="869" /> and I have to step in where there has been a serious failure on their part. The ultimate sanction provided by law would involve the removal of councillors from office and their replacement by a commissioner who would discharge the functions of the elected councillors.</P>
    <P>My Department has received reports from both county managers outlining the factual circumstances of the failure of both councils to fulfil their statutory duty to adopt estimates. The managers' letters also convey requests by the chairmen of both councils for an extension of time to afford the councils a further opportunity to consider the matter and in the case of South Dublin I was also requested to receive a deputation but I declined this request.</P>
    <P>Such is the extent of my concern and disappointment in this matter that I have indicated publicly I would have no alternative but to remove the councillors from office in the absence of a clear and unambiguous commitment from these councils today that they are willing to discharge their statutory obligations in a responsible manner by the adoption of estimates of expenses.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I will make grant assistance available to the new councils to contribute to the once off start up costs. In addition, I arranged for the payment of rate support grant instalments for the first three months of the year to the new councils to assist cash flow requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make special grant assistance available to the councils to eliminate existing deficits since these deficits are related to outstanding arrears owed to both councils from a variety of sources. Realisation of these arrears owed would eliminate these deficits.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable regret that this situation has arisen. The councils have abdicated their responsibilities but I have a responsibility to act in the public interest and I intend to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a number of other local authorities outside Dublin found themselves in a similar position in the past and, indeed, <Col N="870" /> earlier this year and that in all cases he granted extensions of time to the local authorities concerned without imposing any preconditions? What is the reason he is taking a different approach towards the new local authorities in Dublin and imposing a precondition?

Second, did he convey the views that he has now expressed, which clearly are the views of the Government, to the Labour and Fianna Fáil members on each of the relevant councils and tell them that it is now Government policy that such charges be imposed and that if they are not, the councils will be abolished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The final contributor to this debate on Thursday last was Deputy <Col N="1028" /> Callely who was very upset with members of the Labour Party who had dared to break ranks in respect of the property tax debacle. He contended that as the budget was a joint effort between both parties there should be joint responsibility for it. He expressed disappointment that members of the Labour Party should attempt to disclaim responsibility in the matter. Little did the Deputy know that the floodgates were about to open. His colleague in north Dublin, Deputy Ray Burke, on Rodney Rice's programme on radio on Saturday stated categorically that the property tax would be abolished and that there would be a radical rethink within Government circles in respect of it.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Deputy McDowell of the Labour Party, he defended largely what was proposed in the budget. However, I was tempted to phone RTE at the time and suggest to the Deputy that since he was so good at defending the indefensible he might rush out to Landsdowne Road, don an Irish jersey and go in as a defender for the Irish Rugby Team. In such event our fate on the day might have been somewhat better.</P>
      <P>The Sunday newspapers carried reports of various Deputies disapproving of the proposed change in the property tax but the most significant development was when the Minister for Finance, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, more or less declared that the whole thing was a storm in a teacup. He said he would change the proposal in the Finance Bill. At this stage one must ask what status the budget has if parts of it can be discounted on foot of an announcement by the Minister on a radio programme? Will the Government have to go back to the drawing board in respect of the budget?</P>
      <P>This issue raises many questions. At this stage I am not sure of the relevance of the debate considering the discussion which has taken place relating to a few aspects of the budget and the various responses from Government representatives that certain aspects of the budget will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was heralded as being a <Col N="1029" /> budget for jobs, but it is merely a tinkering with many sectors of our economy and the taxation system and it does not contain any real reform. It gives small concessions to many interest groups who lobbied the Minister but, unfortunately, it contains no real worthwhile changes which would have any lasting effect on or for maintaining existing jobs or creating new ones.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in employers' PRSI for employees earning under £173 per week, but on discussing this aspect of the budget with employers in my locality I learned it will benefit only a small proportion of those employed. Employers with whom I spoke could find no incentive in the budget which would encourage them to take on more employees. They said the reduction in employer's PRSI would not enable them recruit additional staff. I hope my straw-poll is inaccurate and that this budget will have the effect of creating lasting jobs for some of the 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of Mullingar in the proposed urban renewal programme due to commence on 1 August next. Mullingar had sought inclusion under the previous programme but, unfortunately, was overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, in his speech, indicated that urban renewal has created long term jobs in many sectors. I agree with him. In Mullingar a section of the town centre is crying out for renewal. Under this new scheme I hope the property owners concerned will put together imaginative plans to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I would put down a marker that urban renewal schemes are so designed as to eliminate dereliction in towns and cities. They are not and never were intended to be an extra bonus for developers and speculators to enable them create alternative town centres and, with the incentives available to them, to be able to undercut the existing traders and put many of them out of business. Urban renewal is welcome where it creates new jobs but if it merely transfers <Col N="1030" /> jobs from one part of a town to another because of better tax breaks, and puts many traders in the old part of town out of business, it will not be welcome.</P>
    <P>The commitment to the commencement of 3,500 local authority houses during 1994 is welcome also. Westmeath County Council is proceeding with plans on the basis of an allocation of 50 houses for the county. I acknowledge that this is a major improvement in the building of local authority houses. However, I must point out to the Minister that County Westmeath has a waiting list of approximately 330 family units and if that list was to remain static and house-building was to continue at its present rate, everybody on it would be accommodated within seven years. That is an unacceptable waiting time for housing and must be improved.</P>
    <P>I contrast this with the position which existed in County Westmeath in 1986 when there were 70 family units on the approved waiting list and Westmeath County Council advertised in the local papers for people who wanted to take-up tenancy of local authority houses. The position has deteriorated dramatically in a short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the purchase of existing houses by local authorities around the country. The Minister should have this matter examined carefully. The last batch of local authority houses built in Mullingar cost approximately £43,000 per house. They were well-built and well-finished houses on a green field site. However, former local authority houses are now available in Mullingar which can be bought for under £20,000 each. They are also well-built houses and are in good condition. Surely, it makes good economic sense that the local authorities should have a mandate to purchase back many of those houses to get better value for tax-payers' money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should put more resources into improvement works in lieu of council housing. This is a worthwhile scheme and should be extended. This matter has been addressed to a certain extent in County Westmeath, but there <Col N="1031" /> are many more houses that could be improved in a short period. Such improvement works would be cheaper than rehousing people in local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, in her speech, placed great emphasis on promoting equality in education and outlined the measures she thought were important in reaching this goal. An increase in capital expenditure in the primary sector is welcome. However, the sum allocated for 1994 is still short of the 1986 allocation under the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Cooney. Under the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made savage cuts in capital expenditure for education and, having regard to the large number of substandard schools and the fact that many children and teachers are accommodated in appalling conditions, we are still paying the price for those cuts. Parents groups around the country are complaining on a regular basis on television programmes about the terrible conditions in their schools. This position reminds me of the time when money was withdrawn for capital expenditure in primary schools. The Fianna Fáil Government of the day must take responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that all present posts in primary schools were to be retained and I would like her to clarify what she means by that statement. I, and I am sure many Deputies, have in the past year been inundated with representations from schools because their enrolment number fell a little short of the retention figure for a particular number of teachers. Their contention would be that if the Minister is realistic about retaining those posts those retention numbers should be lowered to facilitate what may be only a temporary decline in numbers. It is difficult to understand how teachers are losing school posts and being transferred when the Minister indicates that she intends to retain the number of teachers. I would appreciate if the Minister would explain this position.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to resources <Col N="1032" /> for disadvantaged schools. Will she clarify what she means by &ldquo;disadvantaged schools&rdquo;? What criteria are used for measuring a school as disadvantaged? How important is the level of attainment of the pupils and the numbers in need of special attention in designating a school as being disadvantaged? Is the quality of the school building important in designating it as being disadvantaged? How important is the socio-economic profile of the parents of the students in designating a school as disadvantaged? How and by whom are those factors measured?</P>
    <P>It is disheartening for rural primary schools to find that, despite their best efforts, they still do not have the service of a remedial teacher. I carried out a survey of primary schools in the midlands some time ago and revealed that rural primary schools are severely disadvantaged in relation to the appointment of remedial teachers. Educational and social disadvantage exists in primary schools in rural areas just as in large urban schools. Will the Minister also outline to us her criteria for the appointment of remedial teachers? Are they based on meticulous records and testing carried out in the school and assessed by her Department? What role does the local inspector have in the appointment of the remedial teacher? Are those appointments made in a politically expedient manner? A review of the allocation of remedial teachers per county certainly points to such political interference.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in her statement to increased capitation allowance for special schools. I look forward to receiving details on this allowance and would remind the Minister of a submission I made in relation to St. Brigid's special school in Mullingar. At that time I pointed out the anomaly which existed in relation to special primary schools.</P>
    <P>In relation to second level schools, I was disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the optional transition year from September 1994. What resources has she put in place to make the transition year a real option for students? <Col N="1033" /> Will money be available for extra materials and accommodation so that schools will be in a position to say to their pupils that they will or will not have the option of availing of a transition year? How many schools will have to decline on this option because of lack of availability of resources from the Minister? For how many pupils will there be no option due to lack of resources? We are all aware of overcrowding in many of our secondary schools and if the option of a transition year is to be real we must improve the resources to make it available to pupils.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed the Minister did not address the major problem of the inequalities which exist in terms of the allocation of third level grants. This system is totally inequitable and militates very severely against the PAYE worker. I recently spoke to a couple in my area who, on a salary of merely £22,000 per year, had put their four children through third level education at a cost of £52,000, with no tax relief and only a partial grant for one year for one of the students. The remainder of the total outlay was raised through a series of loans and remortgaging their family home. Is it reasonable to expect a couple in that position to put their children through third level education with no help from the State?</P>
    <P>This budget is anti-family. There are marginal tax reliefs for everybody. However, it has failed to recognise, by way of tax relief for children, the tremendous expense incurred in having and maintaining a family. When one considers that mortgage interest relief and VHI relief is to be reduced to the standard rate, this will quickly wipe out any marginal tax relief which might have been available for families. Coupled with those changes, the proposed residential tax will, even on modest houses, impose a further tax penalty. These measures are very hard to take when one recalls an advertisement in the national press on 25 November 1992 headed &ldquo;An important message from Dick Spring&rdquo;. This advertisement gave absolute promises that Labour had no plan to introduce a new property tax or house tax. The advertisement <Col N="1034" /> went on to say that Labour would not reduce mortgage interest relief and VHI tax relief. Is it not ironic that, within 15 months of making that commitment, the Labour Party, in Government with Fianna Fáil, has reneged on its promises? Then we listened to Deputy Jim Kemmy, that great guardian of all that is right, say on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently that these promises were made in the &ldquo;white heat of an election&rdquo; and hence were not to be taken seriously by the public. A statement such as this is pompous in the extreme and demonstrates the disdain with which Deputy Kemmy treats the public.</P>
    <P>Is it not a demonstration of his pomposity that, despite all this, he is now presenting himself before the electorate to be their representative in the European Parliament? How can he have any credibility? Will he use the Labour phrase &ldquo;Put trust back into politics&rdquo; on his election literature for the European elections in June?</P>
    <P>I, like many other Deputies, got a very worthwhile briefing from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry concerning the difficulties encountered by the motor trade. They set out very clearly the declining job opportunities within that trade and they made an excellent presentation on how new vehicle registrations could be dramatically increased, with more job opportunities in the motor trade and increasing revenue to the Exchequer. I welcome the reduction in vehicle registration tax and the consequential cheaper car prices. I also welcome increased capital allowances for companies buying new cars. However, the Minister has failed to take the decisive action which was needed to put the motor industry back in a strong commanding position. We had 33,000 imports of second-hand cars last year. Some of those cars had failed the MOT test in Northern Ireland or the UK. In reply to a parliamentary question by me, the Minister for the Environment dodged the real question and put the blame on the garage industry for allowing defective vehicles on the roads. This is not the case, because many vehicles are imported by <Col N="1035" /> individuals rather than through the motor trade and hence the garages have no role to play in the matter. A vehicle testing procedure for imported second-hand cars would certainly be a step in the right direction. It would improve the quality of vehicles on our roads and would provide much-needed jobs in the motor industry. The further increase of 7p on a gallon of petrol and diesel is an unwelcome step in terms of the motor trade.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment by the Minister to increase social welfare payments by 3 per cent. Within the last hour I met a delegation of widows who visited this House. They talked about the £1.50 increase they would get in their pensions next July. These ladies' husbands had served in the Defence Forces and because their husbands had opted out of the pension scheme, unknown to them, those ladies are now confined to social welfare pensions of only £62 per week. A 3 per cent increase for them is not very much. The point has been validly made that these increases should take effect immediately, as is the case in the UK, rather than having to wait for a number of months before the increases are put in place. The Minister should indicate clearly to the House why the July date has been chosen for the increases to become operative.</P>
    <P>Whereas everybody in this House would welcome the introduction of a widower's contributory pension, many of us abhor the small print in the Minister's speech which indicates that widows' and widowers' pensions will henceforth be means tested. This is a very serious proposal by the Minister which will have far-reaching consequences. No doubt there will be a court challenge to it and I believe the courts will overturn the decision of the Minister. It is surely a dramatic break with precedent that people who have contributed towards a pension find that this pension is to be means tested. This is totally at variance with natural justice and is something which we in Fine Gael will fight at all costs to have reversed. This is just another indication of the anti-family budget with which we have been presented. It seeks to means test a contribution <Col N="1036" /> made by a spouse for his or her partner for a pension after his or her death.</P>
    <P>The state of county roads has reached an all-time low. This results from the failure of successive Governments to allocate sufficient funds to local authorities to maintain county roads to a reasonable standard. The resurfacing programme runs in a 25 to 30 year cycle and the damage caused to county roads in the meantime is beyond estimation. Compared with other counties the roads in County Westmeath are in a reasonable condition, although many of them are poor. We have a serious problem with pot holes and there is an urgent need to strengthen and resurface many of our roads. The £15 million allocated in the budget, when divided among all the local authorities, is a mere pittance.</P>
    <P>There are of course many sectors which received no assistance under this budget &mdash; I refer specifically to the clothing trade. This sector experienced a huge hike to 21 per cent in VAT charges in the last couple of years. We saw the loss of a staggering 1,140 jobs in this sector in the past 12 months. The Minister has not done anything to maintain the existing jobs in this industry. The reduction in the level of employer's PRSI for employees earning less than £173 per week will be of some help, but much more needs to be done. There is a strong possibility that upwards of 1,600 jobs will be lost in the clothing industry during 1994. The Minister needs to take cognisance of these figures, which have been produced by the industry, and to examine what can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has once again ignored the confectionery industry which is facing huge competition from its counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The products produced by this industry in the North and Great Britain have a zero rate of VAT, thus giving them a decided advantage over the products produced by our home-based industries. Jobs in this industry are being eroded steadily, yet the Minister has again decided to ignore the people working in this sector and to let them fend for <Col N="1037" /> themselves. The newspaper industry has also once again been left out of the equation. The continued imposition of VAT on newspapers gives imports a decided advantage over our national papers. These imported papers are continuing to increase their foothold in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>The budget was a major disappointment. The Minister had room for manoeuvre with the amnesty windfall of £230 million but he failed to avail of the opportunities presented to him and has done nothing to create much needed jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate on the budget affords me of speaking on certain aspects to the Votes for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>One of the commitments in the Government's Programme for a Partnership Government was to draw up a five year corporate strategy for the Garda Síochána to enhance its capacity to fight crime in present day conditions. In making this commitment, the Government's aim was to provide the citizens of this country with the level of security they need to go about their daily lives without fear for their person or property. I am happy to say that this commitment has been honoured in full with the publication last year by the Garda Commissioner of a corporate strategy policy document for the years 1993-97. The Commissioner's objective is to improve the performance and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. I welcome this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, recorded indictable crime increased by 1 per cent in 1992. Final figures for 1993 are not yet available but I am aware that they will show a further increase on the 1992 figure. Crime in our modern society is a very complex matter and is multi-faceted in origin. If we are to tackle crime successfully, it is necessary to have regard to its wider socio-economic causes. This means that we must, increasingly, take account of the inter-relationship between the economic and social policies that are pursued and the criminal and anti-social <Col N="1038" /> behaviour that is manifested in our community today. Law enforcement policies can only be part of the Government's response to that behaviour.</P>
    <P>For my part, Deputies will be aware that I received the approval of the Government last December for a package of law and order measures which I am confident will make a very significant contribution towards tackling the existing crime problem. The package will cost almost £66 million in the period up to 1997. These measures, which, by any standard, amount to a major initiative by the Government against crime, are essential to confront the criminals in our society who prey on law abiding people. On the Garda front, the package will provide for accelerated recruitment of gardaí this year; further recruitment of gardaí during the next three years; an increase in the number of civilian staff employed on clerical work in the force; recruitment of civilians of certain specialist-managerial posts in the force; replacement of the Garda fleet on a five year basis, and increased use of information and voice technology.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to accelerate Garda recruitment, the Government has approved my proposal to complete the intake from the current recruitment campaign by 1994 rather than 1995, as originally planned. This will result in 407 gardaí being recruited this year. This will represent the highest intake of recruits in any year since 1983. The present recruitment campaign will now end in December 1994.</P>
    <P>The present strength of the Garda Síochána is about 10,900. In addition, the employment of almost 700 civilians to perform clerical duties has led to the release of gardaí to perform the outdoor operational duties for which they were specially selected and trained. I will shortly be announcing details of another campaign to recruit 350 members in each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997. This should ensure that there will be no decrease in Garda numbers when the current campaign comes to an end and that Garda numbers will be maintained up to <Col N="1039" /> the end of 1997 at a level of approximately 11,000.</P>
    <P>The package provides for recruitment of 200 civilian staff for the Garda Síochána between 1994 and 1997 to undertake clerical and administrative work. This will increase the number of clerical civilians in the force to 900. By releasing an equivalent number of gardaí from administrative duties to outdoor police duties, this measure will also increase the operational strength of the force by 200.</P>
    <P>This is a key strategy to obtaining greater effectiveness and policing presence on the beat from within existing Garda numbers. The operational strength of the force is now at its highest level ever and the further civilianisation of administrative posts that will take place will boost the operational level even further over the next few years. In addition, I propose to recruit civilian staff for certain key areas within the Garda management structure where special qualifications are required. The areas involved include personnel, financial control, organisational development, and press relations.</P>
    <P>I am committed to improving the organisational structure of the force. It is important that the available resources are deployed in the areas where they are most needed. I know that Garda management shares that view, and is studying the issue. It is my intention to establish a research unit for the Garda Síochána shortly. The purpose of this research unit will be: to establish the best practices for response to particular crime situations; to analyse the causes of crime, and to identify ways in which crime can be reduced. Arrangements are already at an advanced stage to recruit civilian staff to fill the senior positions in this unit, those of head of research and civilian researcher.</P>
    <P>The package provides for the purchase of approximately 80 additional vehicles, including specialist vehicles, for the Garda fleet during 1994. This is over and above the normal fleet replacement requirements and will ensure optimum <Col N="1040" /> replacement of vehicles in the Garda fleet over the next five years.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to use the most modern technology to combat crime, the package provides for the installation in 1994 of closed circuit television cameras in two areas of Dublin to combat crime in the city centre. The operation will be totally under the control and management of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, I have made traffic law enforcement a priority for the Garda and I have endeavoured to see to it that it has the necessary resources in terms of personnel and equipment to carry out this essential and vital task. In particular, I am anxious that the Garda is in a position to fully exploit modern technological developments in this area. For instance, the use of in-car cameras by the traffic cops has had a major impact in the fight against speeding and reckless driving. There is, of course, no room for complacency, as the accidents which occur on our roads all too frequently show. It is a sad and disturbing thought to recall that no less than seven persons died on our roads last week-end, a statistic which I find unacceptable. I assure the House that the Garda remains committed to maintaining the ongoing and rigorous enforcement of road traffic laws.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is involved in two very successful youth diversion projects in the Dublin area &mdash; the Killinarden Engages Youth project &mdash; the KEY project &mdash; and the Give Ronanstown A Future Today project &mdash; the GRAFT project. Funding is provided by my Department towards the running of these projects. I consider these projects to be a very worthwhile experiment and I am delighted to say that there has been a substantial decline in crime in both of these areas since the community-based initiatives were introduced.</P>
    <P>In line with the thinking outlined in the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder, I have received increased funding for such initiatives in the period 1994-97. This will allow a further four or five new projects <Col N="1041" /> to be set up in the kind of deprived urban areas which were the subject of that group's attention. In another initiative, a pilot scheme involving juvenile liaison officers and professional social workers will be introduced to concentrate on the drug problem among juveniles at risk in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I stated in the House on numerous occasions the priority which I give to dealing with the drugs problem. The Garda authorities also treat drug law enforcement as a priority. In this respect, all members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area and there are now gardaí specially trained in this area in every Garda division. In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway and small specialised units are in operation in various parts of Dublin. It is apparent from the reports I am getting that these squads and units are having considerable success in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>In order to deal with the drugs situation as effectively as possible, it is of course important that we have the highest degree of co-operation and liaison between the relevant agencies involved. For this reason, I have requested a senior official of my Department to prepare a report on the matter. The report will examine various aspects of the drugs problem, including the organisational structures that are needed, and will address the optimum way of achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response by the law enforcement agencies to the drug trafficking problem. In preparing the report, discussions are being held with senior management of the other Departments and State agencies involved in the area, including the Revenue Commissioners. I expect to have the report very soon and I will then consider it as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In October 1993, the Garda authorities set up a divisional task force to combat and stem the worrying number of armed raids on financial institutions. The unit, which has become known as COBRA, operates under the auspices of the serious <Col N="1042" /> crime squad at Harcourt Square. The general function of the unit is to prevent and detect crime by the building up of intelligence and the targeting of known suspects. I am glad to say that the unit has had a number of notable successes to date.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to mention the vital work of the forensic science laboratory in bringing successful prosecutions against criminals including drug cases. Since coming into office, I have been detemined to ensure that the laboratory has the necessary funding to carry out its essential task in helping the gardaí in their investigations and in the presentation of evidence in court. The laboratory plays a central role in the criminal justice system. In order to fulfil this role the laboratory requires highly specialised equipment and I am pleased to state that £270,000 will be allocated this year for this purpose. This will allow the laboratory to continue providing the gardaí with the quality service that it has provided since its establishment in 1975.</P>
    <P>Two areas deserve special mention. The role of the laboratory in the fight against drugs is pivotal. In drugs prosecutions, the State must show that the accused was in possession of the items seized and that the items seized contained a controlled substance. The number of drugs cases dealt with by the laboratory has risen from 1,285 in 1988 to 4,914 in 1993. This has placed a tremendous workload on the laboratory and I am happy to report that the director and the staff have more than risen to the challenge.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to mention is that of DNA testing. This technique will greatly increase the amount of information that it is possible to obtain, particularly in sexual assault cases. In order that we can fully benefit from this advanced scientific development, the laboratory has been provided with the necessary state-of-the-art equipment at a cost of over £100,000. Following the building up of the necessary data bank of blood samples, testing is now being carried out here in criminal cases. Prior to this, it was necessary to send all samples to <Col N="1043" /> Britain for testing. Accordingly, the number and range of offences to which the technique can be applied will be greatly extended.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to drugs, two social workers will be employed to coach selected juvenile liaison officers in drugs counselling and related work, under the special law and order package.</P>
    <P>An issue which is very much to the fore these days is that of violence against women, both within and outside the home. Indeed, all of us will be familiar with some very serious cases which have featured prominently in the public domain in recent years. I am encouraged that the level of reporting of this terrible crime is on the increase and that as a society we now appear to recognise that violence against women in whatever form, or wherever it occurs, is completely unacceptable behaviour which must be reported to the appropriate authorities. The gardaí have made tremendous efforts in this area lately, in co-operation with the public, and are continuing to devote considerable resources to addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>In this respect, a new woman and child unit in the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters, Harcourt Square, was established last March and is staffed by gardaí who are highly trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults. The functions of this unit include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children in the Dublin Metropolitan area. Enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders are also carefully examined.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recommendations of the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud, the package of law and order measures provides funding for the recruitment of two additional detective inspectors and three professional accountants for the Garda fraud squad and to purchase specialised fraud related information technology equipment. These measures form part of plans to <Col N="1044" /> establish a national bureau of fraud investigation headed by a chief superintendent. I also intend to introduce legislation this year which will comprehensively amend the law on fraud and dishonesty.</P>
    <P>Information technology has the potential to make a significant contribution to the work of a police force. This has been long recognised by the Garda Síochána but their existing computer systems, which served them well in the past, are now very old and are based on the more rigid technology of previous decades, which severely limits their usefulness. A comprehensive information technology plan for the Garda Síochána has, therefore, been drawn up with the assistance of outside consultants.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on this plan will be in the region of £26 million and, as I announced in December when unveiling my comprehensive package of law and order measures, £2.4 million has been made available this year to start the implementation of this plan. This information technology plan will make a substantial contribution in the years ahead to the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána by enabling gardaí to spend more time on out-door policing duties and less time on paperwork; increasing the crime detection rate through improved quality of crime intelligence information and computerised fingerprint identification facilities; providing faster and better quality information to improve overall Garda responsiveness; providing improved management information to enable more effective deployment of manpower; providing information to enable the gardaí identify people at risk and keep in touch with them; and providing traffic accident patterns and information essential for the enforcement of road traffic legislation. Work on implementation of the plan is already underway. For example, tenders have been sought for a major consultancy project which the plan identified as essential and tenders for this project are due in by 15 February.</P>
    <P>The need to up-grade the Garda communications network is also being <Col N="1045" /> addressed. A sum of £0.5 million has been provided this year for this in the package of law and order measures in addition to the normal provision for Garda communications equipment. The increased provision will enable a more modern communications system to be provided for Cork city and Garda radio hand-sets and car-sets purchased in the early and mid eighties, to be replaced with modern equipment.</P>
    <P>All of these initiatives in the Garda area, including further recruitment after 1994, increased civilianisation and the implementation of the information technology plan, will significantly increase the operational strength of the Force in the years ahead. This will mean more gardaí on the streets in our cities and towns throughout the country, providing a more effective service to the public. I want to take this opportunity to reassure Deputies from all sides of the House that this Government is committed to winning the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of prisons and accommodation for offenders. The package of law and order measures outlined a significant decision by Government in terms of prison accommodation &mdash; the provision of 210 additional prison spaces at a total estimated cost of £25 million. A total of 150 spaces will be allocated to male offenders; the other 60 spaces will cater for females. The women's facility will meet a long-recognised need in the prison system &mdash; a self-contained women's prison designed to meet the specific needs of women prisoners. The intention is that the project will also involve the provision of adjacent hostel-type accommodation to meet the needs of women prisoners who do not need the secure facilities of the prison. The initial planning work on the provision of the new spaces has commenced. It is anticipated that construction work will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>A provision of £12 million has been made in my Department's 1994 Estimates to cover the portion of the costs of providing the additional spaces which will fall due this year and also to continue a <Col N="1046" /> programme of ongoing major improvements to our existing prison stock. Apart altogether from the essential improvements in our prison system which these developments will bring, there is the important bonus of a boost for the construction industry stemming from the level of moneys being made available. The impact which this will make in terms of jobs is something which every Deputy in the House will welcome.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to say a few special words about the proposed new women's prison. I am determined that it should be designed and organised with an ambience, activities and facilities which will give women prisoners maximum help to cope with their personal difficulties and every assistance and encouragement to lead them to a more constructive lifestyle. The first step in this process has been my setting up an expert steering committee to advise me on the best options to take in relation to the design of the women's prison and I look forward to receiving their considered advice as quickly as possible. The steering committee has, by way of public advertisement, invited views from interested parties and I am most anxious that we have as broad a consensus as possible on the type and design of the facility to be provided.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the new women's prison will be complemented by the provision of adjoining hostel accommodation and that special efforts will be made to develop and extend the range of community-based sanctions for women prisoners. The House will also be aware of my support for the &ldquo;New Opportunities for Women&rdquo; project under which a specialist training and education centre will be set up in the community for the benefit of women offenders. The project is being supported by European Union funds. It represents a very positive development in the overall treatment approach to women who come in conflict with the law and will also, in a way, complement the development of the new prison.</P>
    <P>I now turn to our efforts to reduce offending in the community. I am pleased <Col N="1047" /> to say that the number of probation and welfare officers will be substantially increased over the next four years. Not only have I secured Government approval in the context of the package of law and order measures to employ an additional 50 probation and welfare officers, but I have also obtained approval to fill 20 vacancies. Thirty probation and welfare officers and three clerical staff will be recruited this year alone. The total of 70 represents an increase of more than 40 per cent in the level of the service by 1997.</P>
    <P>I have every reason to be satisfied with this development. I am confident that the service will be well placed as a consequence to meet the additional work load which it is being asked to undertake. The increase in staff numbers will improve the probation and welfare service's capacity to deal with offenders in a non-custodial setting and improve the range of alternatives to custody available in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>My overall strategy is to increase prison spaces and, at the same time, develop a system whereby planned and programmed releases can be resorted to under the close supervision of the probation and welfare service. Half of the extra 50 staff will be charged with the task of closely monitoring and supervising prisoners on release in the community. Assignments for the remaining staff will include development of the treatment programme for sex offenders being set up in Arbour Hill Prison; improvement of the response to requests from the courts for pre-sentence reports; provision of after-care for long term offenders returning to the community and provision of an enhanced probation and welfare service to prisoners while in custody.</P>
    <P>Additional probation accommodation and day attendance facilities at a capital cost of £2.5 million are also to be provided. These centres will facilitate more effective supervision of offenders in the community. Offenders will be engaged in constructive activity at these centres and receive counselling about their offending <Col N="1048" /> behaviour. Approaches of this kind can be very successful in diverting serious offenders from a criminal lifestyle at a cost which is considerably less to the tax-payer than that of custody. Provision of these new facilities and upgrading of existing facilities will take place in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the intensive supervision scheme under which more than 100 offenders have been taken from prisons or referred by the courts to be intensively supervised in the community by the probation and welfare service. The scheme will be expanded in 1994 with the purchase of premises in Dublin and the recruitment of additional staff. Under the scheme, there is a concentration of effort on occupying offenders and engaging them in constructive activity during their time in the community. Offenders are required to attend a centre on a number of days each week for 18 weeks and to accept supervision thereafter. They are encouraged to discuss, in a group setting, ongoing difficulties and issues arising from their offending behaviour, awareness of dependency on alcohol or drugs, health issues, lifestyle and stress issues. I am satisfied that the scheme is working well and that it can play a useful part in the overall alternatives strategy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the courts and their vital role in the administration of justice which, in turn, affects the maintenance of law and order. In the recent package of law and order measures, provision is made for the appointment of three additional judges &mdash; one to the High Court, one to the Circuit Court and one to the District Court &mdash; to address the present delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the Central Criminal Court, the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the Dublin Metropolitian District Court. Delays in the hearing of criminal cases, in effect, means that defendants released on bail, whose cases cannot be heard for lack of a judge, are free to commit further crimes because of the excessive delay in the disposal of their cases. This is very serious and could not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> I welcome greatly developments in the courts whereby procedures have been put in place which facilitate victims appearing in our courts as witnesses and which emphasise the impact of crime on the victim. A video-link system has been introduced on a pilot basis in the Dublin Metropolitian District Court, the Dublin Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court. This audio-visual system is used in cases involving sexual offences and offences involving violence. It enables witnesses under 17 years of age to give evidence and be cross-examined outside of the courtroom setting while allowing court proceedings to be conducted as if the witnesses were giving evidence in the court itself. I have also signed the necessary regulations allowing witnesses to give evidence through a live television link at the preliminary examination of cases involving physical or sexual abuse before a District Court and also allowing for the transfer of proceedings to those District Courts which have the necessary technical facilities. It is proposed, depending on the volume of business, to introduce the video-link system in two provincial courts at a later date when the system in Dublin has been fully monitored and assessed.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the House that permanent accommodation has been made available to the Irish Association for Victim Support in the Four Courts in Dublin and facilities are made available, as required, at other venues. Special consideration is being given to similar facilities in all courthouse renovation projects.</P>
    <P>In the context of sentencing, I am pleased to hear that more judges are seeking reports on the impact of crimes on victims before imposing sentence. This very welcome development is one which I wholeheartedly support.</P>
    <P>The efficiency of all aspects of the courts is of great concern to me. A review of the District, Circuit and High Courts to assess both the impact of the altered civil jurisdiction of the courts introduced by the Courts Act, 1991, and to look at the hearing of family law cases in the courts has just been completed in my Department. I am at present examining <Col N="1050" /> the results of this review to ascertain what additional resources must be made available to the courts to eliminate undue delays in the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>I am also actively addressing the problems of court accommodation. Much of the court accommodation around the country is seriously inadequate and does not provide the facilities necessary for persons coming before the court, members of the legal profession or court staff. Budgetary constraints in recent years meant that limited funds only were available for courthouse projects. I am glad that this year I have secured an increase in the allocation for expenditure on court accommodation with £4.25 million being provided for capital works and a new allocation of £1 million being made available for maintenance projects in provincial courts. This increased funding will allow new and refurbishment projects to proceed this year on a number of courthouses, including Galway, Cork, Donegal, Athlone, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Shannon, Carlow and Longford.</P>
    <P>In addition, other courthouse projects are being identified and a planned maintenance programme will be put into operation which will include, for the first time, maintenance of provincial court accommodation. I am in the process of recruiting a building officer with relevant architectural or engineering qualifications who will be responsible for implementing the courts safety, health and welfare at work policy and for advising on the courts building programme. I intend to seek a substantial improvement in the standard of court accommodation through the country during my term as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I am happy to mention a major initiative in the courts designed to ensure that the service provided is effective and accessible to all. The small claims procedure &mdash; which was established on a pilot basis in four District Court offices in 1991 &mdash; was extended nationwide in December last following a full review of its operation. This extension will enable persons in all District Court areas to avail of the small claims procedure. The procedure, which is consumer orientated, <Col N="1051" /> provide people with a means of processing small claims cheaply, speedily and informally. Following the review of the pilot scheme, I decided not only to extend the scheme nationwide but to extend its scope to include rent deposits and minor damage to personal property. In addition, I propose to increase the monetary limit on claims from £500 to £1,000 by annual instalments of £100 over the next five years.</P>
    <P>My Department is also watching with interest the operation of pilot multimedia systems in other jurisdictions such as developments in court stenography and the use of closed circuit television linking courthouses, prisons and hospitals which may contribute to more efficient use of court time and resources.</P>
    <P>I am committed to providing an efficient and effective court service. I will continue to take whatever measures are necessary within the resources available to me to maintain and improve the service provided by the court system.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have indicated on a number of occasions my strong support for the Irish Association for Victim Support. I was delighted therefore to be able to inform the association that I secured approval from the Government for the 1994 funding to the association to be increased to a sum of £110,000. Provision for this amount is made in the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice. The association has plans for the development and expansion of its services to the victims of crime and the sum of £110,000 will assist these plans. I also take this opportunity to compliment the association on the very important and vital support it gives to victims of crime. This is a matter of great concern to me because of the serious consequences crime, particularly crimes involving violence towards people and to property, has for the vulnerable sections in our community.</P>
    <P>During 1993, I pressed ahead with this Government's programme of criminal law reform. The record speaks for itself &mdash; in my area of responsibility five Bills <Col N="1052" /> were enacted, and a further three have been published.</P>
    <P>Of the five Bills enacted, perhaps the one that will have some of the most far-reaching and beneficial effects on the operation of the criminal justice system is the Criminal Justice Act, 1993. This Act was designed to make the criminal justice system more victim orientated and to redress the balance towards the needs of oft-forgotten victims. The Act focuses on the rights of victims. It enables unduly lenient sentences to be reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal at the instance of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It places an obligation on sentencing courts to take into account any effect a violent or sexual crime has had on the victim. It also authorises criminal courts to require offenders to pay compensation to their victims for an injury or loss.</P>
    <P>A second major reform was the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunication Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993, which places on a statutory basis the conditions under which the power of the Minister for Justice to issue warrants authorising the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages is to be exercised, and regulates the procedure for the issue of those authorisations. The Act also introduced a number of important safeguards against any misuse of ministerial power.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, repealed the old laws that made homosexual acts between consenting mature adults a criminal offence and thus, among other things, brought our laws into compliance with the European Convention of Human Rights. The Act also offers protection to neighbourhoods where prostitutes, their pimps and clients cause annoyance by their public soliciting and loitering and it provides protection to prostitutes against being coerced or compelled into prostitution by others.</P>
    <P>The fourth Bill enacted relates to suicide. As a result of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, 1993, it is no longer a criminal offence to commit suicide or attempt to commit suicide. It is, however, still an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of any person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The fifth Bill enacted was the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, which provides remedies in cases where it is alleged that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and the existing appeal procedures have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>In the summer of 1993, I presented the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill which was passed by this House last November and is now before the Seanad. The Bill contains proposals on the updating of the law in relation to public order offences, an offence specifically aimed at racketeering, and the implementation of certain recommendations made by the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control. It will go a long way towards equipping the gardaí with the necessary powers to deal with the problems of public disorder which, understandably, have given rise to such concern in our communities.</P>
    <P>In December last year, I published the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993. That Bill provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crimes, the creation of an offence of money laundering and gives effect to various international instruments on drug trafficking, money laundering and mutual assistance in criminal matters. A measure of the comprehensive nature of the approach being taken in the Bill is that, when enacted, Ireland will be able to ratify three international conventions in this area as well as give effect to the EU Directive on money laundering.</P>
    <P>The large volume of criminal law reform measures brought before the Houses last year is probably unprecedented. Much of the credit must surely go to the members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, without whom so much progress simply could not have been made and also to the many diligent employees in my Department who have worked hard to enable me to produce this legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning now to legislative proposals in 1994, I should like to assure the House that the progress made in 1993 will not be a once-off. I propose to continue at this pace throughout, and to put in place <Col N="1054" /> the legislation to which all of us are committed by virture of the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Already this year I have published the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1994. I will shortly be publishing the long awaited Solicitors Bill. I say &ldquo;long-awaited&rdquo; because I am only too aware of the acute need for a Bill of this nature. The Bill will afford greater protection to the clients of solicitors in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and ensure that the profession maintains the highest standards of conduct. It will contain a substantial revision of the disciplinary and complaints arrangements for solicitors. New powers will be given to the Law Society to intervene in the practice of solicitors in the interests of clients and the High Court's supervisory powers over the profession are being increased. The Bill will also update the Law Society's functions in relation to the education and training of solicitors and promote competition in the provision of conveyancing and probate sevices.</P>
    <P>Another 14 Bills are at various stages of preparation in my Department. These include a new Juvenile Justice Bill, a Bill to provide a statutory framework for applicants for refugee status, a Bill to allow qualified applicants for citizenship who applied prior to 31 December 1986 for registration but who were not registered by that date to be registered as Irish citizens, a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill designed to achieve savings in costs and Garda time, a Bill to amend the law relating to criminal insanity, and a Court and Court Officers Bill.</P>
    <P>I am giving special priority to the publication of a modern Juvenile Justice Bill. In that Bill, I will give particular attention to defining the role and responsibilities of parents.</P>
    <P>The time available has enabled me to outline to the House the broad thrust of the policies which will apply in 1994 in relation to the activities falling within the ambit of my Department. These policies and other aspects of my Department's Estimates can, of course, be more fully examined by Deputies when, in the <Col N="1055" /> coming months, individual Votes for which I am accountable come to be examined by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>The budget, being the starting point for the Government's economic policies each year, is the subject of today's motion and I accordingly commend to the House the Government's policies set out in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties will remember the 1994 budget for a long time. Coming up to budget day there was not a cloud in the sky or criticism from any quarter. The budget figures were better than anticipated, income from direct taxes had increased, the basic infrastructure of the economy was sound and, generally, we were conditioned into believing it would be a good give-away budget. According to the spin doctors this budget would achieve something which no other budget ever aspired to. The present low interest rates together with low inflation, taken in conjunction with the lower level of day to day borrowing requirement, would form the launching pad for an attack on unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said he would restructure the tax code, ensure that the provision and take up of jobs was made easier and tilt the balance towards getting people off the unemployment register and into a jobs economy. Having studied the figures, I am afraid the budget will not work that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of income derived from the tax amnesty the Minister could do things which were not possible previously. However, the innate begrudgery that consumes Labour in regard to people who own anything raised its ugly head. The Labour Party wanted to stamp its authority on the Government and this budget appeared to them to be the perfect vehicle. They decided that a new and insidious twist was required to the existing residential property tax so that middle income house-owning families would pay the piper. The Minister for Finance thought when the electorate <Col N="1056" /> heard of the anticipated income from the new levy &mdash; only an additional £5 million &mdash; there would be little hostility and it would be soon forgotten. How wrong can one be? The Government has forgotten that the people who live in 95 per cent of these houses are up to their ears in loan repayments. They are the people who have family members at university or at secondary or national school level. They have to pay for everything. They are not prepared to be beaten into the ground. Furthermore, because of statements by the Minister for Finance in regard to ongoing discussions about broadening the tax base it became apparent to many house owners, whose houses were valued at only half the £75,000 threshold, that their day for paying the residential property tax was not far off. There was more bad news for such householders. It became apparent that all income, irrespective of the source, from family members would be computed for tax purposes. This could have an appalling effect on the family structure. Family members would not return to their home and this would put pressure on rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Not content with the residential property tax, the Minister said he would restrict mortgage interest relief. This was yet another attack on the middle class house owner. The Government was fully aware once it decided to reduce dramatically the threshold from £91,000 to £75,000 and reduce the income threshold from £28,100 to £25,000 that the public would see this was rates by another name and they have reacted accordingly. The Government should not be surprised by the ferocity of the opposition to the residential property tax. The pleas for help, and, more importantly, the plea for recognition of their particular circumstances from the middle class group is understandable.</P>
    <P>Taxes should always be sought on the basis of ability to pay. The fact that a person lives in a house worth £75,000 in a certain area and the family income is in excess of £25,000 does not mean there is surplus money in that household. There is a huge difference between a family who <Col N="1057" /> are entitled to a third level education grant over a three to four year period and a family which has to fund a member, at a third level institution, at a cost of £4,000 to £6,000 per year. I acknowledge that many families in the lower income group could not possibly allow their sons and daughters to attend third level institutions without a grant. Many householders shuddered at the interest rates they were paying only a year ago. Who is to say that high interest rates will not recur in 12 months' time and stay with us for five or ten years? Nobody can tell us that, and still the new residential property tax will bite. First time purchasers or builders of their own houses will get mortgage interest relief for the first five years but it is a case of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; after five years, irrespective of interest rates. How can anyone know what unemployment will be like? Will many more people lose their jobs as they have done over the last three years, and then mortgage interest relief will assume a new importance?</P>
    <P>The Government has disgraced itself in trying to nail people who are trying to make a living and not depend on handouts. It is a typical Labour response to the people who try to make their own way. This will not be easily forgotten by the people of Dublin who are obviously in the forefront or by people throughout the country who have gone to the trouble and expense of trying to build their own homes. This is a bad signal from this Government and it does not augur well for what it might do in the future. Let us be realistic. The Government can do whatever it decides, by virtue of its parliamentary majority. This tax represents pure arrogance.</P>
    <P>The Government has skidded on another banana skin in this budget in deciding to rape the social insurance scheme. This is not the first time a Fianna Fáil dominated Government has done this. This insidious tendency was started by Deputy McCreevy as Minister for Social Welfare when he had the brilliant idea that if a redundant person got more than £12,000 redundancy he would not be entitled to employment benefit for the <Col N="1058" /> following nine weeks. This was an attack on the social insurance scheme because that worker had joined the scheme on the understanding that on becoming unemployed he or she could call on the social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>There is now an earnings limit of £16,000 above which a widow will not be entitled to her widow's contributory pension, even if she has paid PRSI contributions for the last 30 or 40 years. This is a lousy mean trick and when it is considered that a person has no alternative but to pay into the social insurance scheme, it means that it is taking money from citizens by sleight of hand. The woman has the huge personal disaster of losing a husband and if she happened to have a job which paid more than £16,000 a year, irrespective of her family commitments, she will not be entitled to a widow's contributory pension. The Government will pay dearly for this.</P>
    <P>The Government has recently been putting great emphasis on the 36 county enterprise boards as being vehicles to generate economic recovery in the regions. I always maintained that it was vitally important to keep the old county development teams. If the new beefed up county enterprise boards deliver on the ambitious targets originally set for them, I will be delighted. However, I do not share the optimism that the boards are in a position to deliver jobs in the numbers required. I have a number of questions for the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment about these bodies as a result of the budget. The boards were first conceived in August 1992, the day after the worst jobless figures announced for years were announced. The Taoiseach and the Government panicked and within a few hours the county enterprise boards were born. They have gone through a tortuous journey since &mdash; a change of Government, a change of emphasis, changes of personnel in many cases&mdash; but at the end of the day not many more jobs have been created than would have been created by the old county development teams. Unless the new county enterprise boards are able to help financially in the service <Col N="1059" /> industry sector which has the greatest job growth potential in the regions, particularly in the west, we will not progress. If the county enterprise boards cannot deliver cheap loan facilities without security to individuals who want to start new projects on a small basis, there will not be a sizeable increase in the number of jobs created under this heading.</P>
    <P>Great play was made prior to the last election of the importance of county enterprise boards for local employment. It was suggested that millions of pounds were available from banks and other lending institutions. Will an individual with a good idea be able to walk into a bank on the recommendation of the county enterprise board and get a loan covering a pre-determined length of time at a pre-determined low rate of interest without security? The day I see that happen is the day that I will believe that the county enterprise boards have more power and influence than the old county development teams.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge, as do all those who comment on agriculture, that 1993 was a good year for agriculture, not because of anything the Government or the EU did. A variety of factors worked in a certain way to influence market prices, particularly for cattle and sheep and to some extent for milk. There is no doubt that once the ship sails with live cattle, one will see a brisker trade for cattle throughout the country. I put down a benchmark. There is a lobby which believes that neither cattle nor sheep should be exported live in any circumstances. However, competition is the life of trade and the day that factories gain control of the meat industry I will worry, but not half as much as farmers will worry. It is very important that that live trade be left open. It does not seem to matter whether or not huge quantities are being exported. It is the fact that there is another purchaser at the ring or at the factory and this is what keeps prices up.</P>
    <P>The devaluation of the Punt in early 1993 contributed to an 11 per cent increase in farm incomes in that year. This is not something that will happen in <Col N="1060" /> 1994. As well as that, compensation was made available following the reform of the CAP and this helped to boost prices. However, cattle and sheep prices are artificially high and it is only when prices begin to tumble towards world prices that we will begin to see the knock-on effects of the CAP reform and the GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>Farmers are being treated to a circus with the announcement of EU schemes that are coming on stream. The Government is making full use of the spin doctors.</P>

      <P>Every day you open a newspaper, a new scheme is being announced but when you read further you realise you have heard it 20 times before. The Government spent a year and a half introducing the farm retirement scheme and only God knows how long it will take to introduce the environmental scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many farmers are led to believe that all they have to do is to open the door and the £5 notes will flow in. That is nonsense. I am afraid the Government is over-selling what is available. No doubt some of the schemes being implemented are very good. The farm retirement pension scheme is good but I believe its uptake will be very slow after the initial phase. This will be due to the enlargement clause which will militate against small farmers in particular because the son or daughter on the farm will not have the option to buy or lease extra land on a long term basis. Indeed, we could have a rerun of the debate on long term leasing of land &mdash; this was a matter of importance to me in the 1980s. Now more than ever we need to put the emphasis on the necessity to have five, seven or ten year leases instead of 11 month leases. There is a fundamental flaw in the scheme as it will affect part-time farmers. In the west there is a great deal of off-farm employment <Col N="1061" /> and many of the families who believe the scheme is tailor-made for them will be very disappointed because seven out of ten of those who believe they are eligible to avail of the scheme will be blocked by bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>In more recent weeks we have heard about the environmentally friendly scheme.</P>

      <P>The sum involved is £231 million. It is significant that the scheme is coming on stream before the Euro elections on 9 June. There may be more details available after 9 June&mdash; but that is another story. Nobody can deny that the objectives of the scheme are very good but how it will work at individual farm level is another story.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that the budget, in conjunction with the funding from the Structural Funds, does not augur well for investment in the west. As Members will be well aware, an impressive document entitled <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> was presented by the Developing the West Together Group last week in Castlebar. This very comprehensive document calls for a huge increase in resources to stop the ebb of population from many parts in the west. I compliment the western bishops and the core groups for their outstanding report. It is an outstanding resumé not only of problems but it puts forward possible solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the budget nor funding from the Structural Funds will close the gap between the west and other regions not only in Ireland but in the Community. The west is in a state of crisis and unless investment becomes a reality it will be impossible to revitalise it. At the launch of the document in Castlebar last week the Archbishop of Tuam remarked that we are not speaking about depopulation but disappearance. In many parishes there has been a huge population haemorrhage. Everyone can point to thriving towns, such as Castlebar, Galway and Sligo but in many towns and parishes in between the only barometer of population <Col N="1062" /> is that the local GAA or soccer team is not able to field the full complement in under-age, minor or senior teams and games have to be called off. It was against that background that all the interest groups met last week.</P>
    <P>It is not enough that the west gets its share. We got our share before but with each passing year the region has become poorer. People will say this is the result of competition between the west and the east but the problems are different. It can be argued that in Dublin there are too many people whereas in the west there are too few. When an area is denuded of its population almost all activity ceases. It is against that background that I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to help. The Taoiseach was in Castlebar to hear the pleas of the bishops and he should know what they are talking about because he was born in the region.</P>
    <P>The cynics may say that the people in the west are always crying about something but if a person has pride and sees the population in the west dwindling he must stand up and say this far and no further; we will not allow our area to be further depopulated. I will illustrate my point by referring to statistics. In Connaught and Donegal there are 42,200 unemployed, of which 20,000 are unemployed for more than 12 months. Since 1980 the number of long term unemployed as a percentage of the total number registered as unemployed is higher in Connaught and Donegal then elsewhere: 47.1 per cent compared with 43.6 per cent. The total number of smallholders and non-agricultural self-employed people in receipt of unemployment assistance was 7,500 in October 1992. When this figure is added to the number of registered long term unemployed the total is 27,500, by any standard a huge figure.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that people in the west depend on farming but recent statistics from Teagasc in the national farm survey of 1991 show the average farm income in the west is only 43 per cent of the income in the east. Given that the region is losing its population in unprecedented <Col N="1063" /> numbers, that it is predicted that this will continue and that the normal distribution of available resources has landed the west in this predicament, it is easy to see there will have to be positive discrimination to ensure that the region can regenerate itself.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that there is a huge number of small farm holdings in the west, 56 per cent of which comprise less than 30 acres whereas the national average is 45 per cent; only 20 per cent are in excess of 50 acres while the national average is 33 per cent. There are at present 6,000 milk producers in Connaught or less than 12 per cent of the national total. A total of 68 million gallons of milk are produced in the province which represents only 6 per cent of the national total; 84 per cent of producers have quotas of less than 20,000 gallons whereas the national average is 60 per cent. There is a need to ensure that quotas remain in the west and increase significantly.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry say on a number of occasions that every effort was being made to ensure that additional quotas would be made available to small producers but there is no point making them available if a person does not have the resources to buy an extra milk quota. A scheme will have to be introduced where small milk producers in the west will be able to buy available milk quotas at low rates. There is also a need to ensure that farmers in other areas are not allowed to plunder quotas in the west. This is on the cards.</P>
    <P>We have one final chance to secure development in the west. In this regard, I could point to a number of positive trends. One of the recommendations made by the group to which I have referred is that a western development board should be established headed by a Minister to take overall responsibility for a given period to bring the various strands together at community, semi-State and national level to ensure there is a massive onslaught on the problems I have outlined. I hope the Government will give <Col N="1064" /> this recommendation serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that such a board should be established. Similar proposals were considered by previous Coalition Governments but they never came to anything. I sincerely hope that such a board will be established because it appears everybody has an answer to the problems of the west. However, nothing seems to be happening. While no one can guarantee its success, we should start from that point.</P>
    <P>This plan contains over 100 proposals. No one expects them to be implemented within a short period but at least a framework could be put in place under which a concentrated effort could be made to solve the huge problems which beset us and which are getting worse year by year. However, given the way the Structural Funds are to be distributed during the next five to six years, I am afraid the necessary investment will not be made. Nonetheless, I hope some of our people will come up with imaginative ideas and that they will not get bogged down in bureaucracy. In this regard, I have always said that the pilot project undertaken in County Mayo under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was a very good one. People with ideas &mdash; people in higher places would not even consider this over the years &mdash; should be allowed to draw the dole and retain benefits such as a medical card while developing these ideas. All I am saying today is that we should put this plan into action very quickly because the worst that could happen for that particular area would be for it to die a slow death. That is what is happening now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget which has as its central theme a strategy designed to give a substantial impetus to sustainble employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The Minister for Finance in the budget recognises that there is no simple policy action that will resolve the problem of unemployment but that systematic and sustained effort will improve the competitiveness of the economy and create the conditions for the translation of growth into fuller employment. The budget contains a balanced set of measures which will, I believe, strengthen prospects for sustainable growth in employment in the years ahead. As well as the measures in the budget to increase competitiveness, I would like to particularly welcome the new community employment programmes which have been introduced to give the unemployed a better chance to compete for long term jobs.</P>
    <P>This budget is a further step in the implementation of the strategy for economic and employment growth central to the Programme for a Partnership Government and is consistent with the aims and objectives of the National Development Plan 1994-1999. Furthermore, the budget has largely copperfastened the new economic and social agreement. A consensus among the social partners which has in the past proved very successful in the management of our economic and social affairs will further strengthen prospects for sustainable growth in employment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I now propose to look at the budget in the context of both the Marine and Defence Votes. I continue to be convinced of the potential of our marine resources and of our capacity to translate this potential into real and sustainable jobs. The fisheries sector is important for the economy not only because it provides more than 15,000 jobs and contributes to the balance of payments in the form of about £200 million worth of exports every year, but also because much of the economic activity and many of the jobs generated are in remote or peripheral areas. I believe strongly in the political philosophy that the least well off and the more remote regions of the country should be given greater support by central Government. Therefore, during my <Col N="1066" /> time in the Department of the Marine I will concentrate on these regions. The fishing industry is an important employment generator and an important means of keeping communities together in these areas.</P>
    <P>I will seek in 1994 to deploy the resources, both human and financial, which are at my disposal to achieve the maximum return in terms of jobs, full-time and part-time. The key areas for investment and expansion are fisheries&mdash; a carefully targeted investment to maintain and strengthen the fishing industry's contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities; ports&mdash; to ensure an adequate infrastructure to facilitate the growth of industry, agriculture, fisheries and tourism and to assist regional development; and tourism angling&mdash; to improve the quality and level of facilities available to anglers thereby increasing tourism angling revenue and related job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn in particular to the fisheries sector. Deputies will be aware that, whereas there are certain influences which the Government can have on the fisheries sector at home, there are also constraints imposed at Union level. Decisions taken in Brussels under the Common Fisheries Policy generally have major implications for the industry here and in other member states. In Ireland's case these have not always been for the best.</P>
    <P>Ireland's current difficulties with regard to its position under the CFP stem from two factors &mdash; the adoption of the principle of equal access by the &ldquo;Six&rdquo; in 1970, and the historic under-development of the Irish fishing industry at the time of the adoption of the CFP in 1983. It is fair to say that the principle of equal access has operated in a manner which amounts effectively to a traffic system with the greater balance of that traffic going in to the Irish zone.</P>
    <P>I also have concerns about the level of our quota allocations. Quotas are allocated in accordance with the principle of relative stability. Three factors were taken into account when allocating the <Col N="1067" /> original total allowable catches. They are traditional fishing, populations dependent on fisheries and compensation for certain member states arising from the exclusion of their vessels from third country waters as a result of the extension of fishery zones to 200 miles in the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with an under-developed industry, had a low level of traditional fishing activities and so our allocation under this key was limited. While some minor compensation was achieved under the key of local dependency on fisheries, these are the principal factors which have militated against the development of the Irish fishing industry and which I have attempted to address since taking office.</P>
    <P>Another major development at Union level which has serious implications for Ireland is the accession of Spain and Portugal. Under the Iberian Act of Accession the fisheries aspects of the Act fell for review by the end of 1993. As Deputies will be aware, Spain and Portugal are to accede to the full benefits of the Common Fisheries Policy by 1 January 1996. However, since no final decisions were reached the review is ongoing. The terms of the Act provide that the Irish Box is due to lapse by the end of 1995. The effect of this would be full access for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets to all EU waters outside 12 miles.</P>
    <P>This matter has been discussed at recent Councils of Fisheries Ministers where I have taken every opportunity to indicate that any significant change in the present arrangements, including any changes to the Irish Box, would have major direct implications for control, conservation and territorial fishing patterns in the Irish zone. In this regard I wish to express my appreciation of the solidarity and the unity of purpose shown by the fisheries organisations throughout that December Council which was a historic council and may be seen as a watershed in the contex of this country's approach to fisheries and fishery development.</P>
    <P>I have explained to Council the importance and sensitivity of the issue to the <Col N="1068" /> Irish Government and Irish fishermen. I stressed that, from a control perspective, the track record of the Spanish fleet in the Irish economic zone was most unsatisfactory. In particular I pointed out that one out of every two Spanish vessels boarded is detained for serious fishery offences; nearly three-quarters of these vessels were in breach of the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession; apart from these breaches, the vessels concerned also had serious infringements relating to log books and undersized fish; since accession, 40 per cent of the vessels on the basic list have been arrested for serious offences and recently, a new problem &mdash; secret holds &mdash; had come to notice and eight vessels have been detained over the last year. I have also stressed that the capacity of the Spanish fleet far exceeds the resources available to that fleet.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to follow the review of the Iberian Act of Accession are not yet agreed at Council. In view of the risks posed by the heavy concentration of fishing effort by certain vessels to the south-west of Ireland at the perimeter of the box and the extreme pressure on fishing resources, I am pursuing at Union level proposals to adopt specific control arrangements to ensure the conservation of stocks in these areas.</P>
    <P>Further hard work is in hands in relation to the negotiations with the EFTA countries on the enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>I have recently established a review group to examine and report on the role and functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; BIM &mdash; as the principal State development agency for the sea fishing and aquaculture industries. It seemed to me that the time was opportune for such an exercise, particularly in view of the new challenges facing these industries and developments at European Union level. What I was doing was simply giving BIM a new mission, a new focus, a new direction.</P>
    <P>I must stress that when announcing the review it was not my intention to seek to bring functions currently carried out by BIM back into the Department of the <Col N="1069" /> Marine. Nonetheless there appears to have been some misunderstanding on this point and I hope that my statement will clarify this matter once and for all.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the central objective of the review is to examine all aspects of BIM's operations, including its management, services, funding, efficiency and effectiveness, with a view to bringing forward recommendations for whatever changes are considered appropriate to help modernise and streamline BIM's mission.</P>
    <P>It is clear that much will have to be done to ensure the future development of the Irish fisheries industry. For too long, successive Governments have paid lip-service to the importance of the industry to the economy of coastal areas and, indeed, the country as a whole. More recently, we have begun to act rather than talk about its development.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the stances I have taken at recent Councils, to the increased discussion and liaison with the industry and the fact that it was only after the establishment of the Department of the Marine that the sector had a permanent representation in the Irish Mission in Brussels. That is a measure of the attention successive Governments have paid to the fishing industry and, in retrospect, one does not wonder why the fishing industry has been seen as the poor relation in the general economic strategy of this nation.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the second area of my responsibility, Defence spending and Defence generally. In 1994, within my area of responsibility as Minister for Defence, the Exchequer will spend a net total of £353 million on defence, together with approximately £53 million on Army pensions. Careful management will be exercised to contain defence spending within these figures. Expenditure programmes have been reviewed to ensure that strict control is maintained over costs. The Defence Forces &mdash; with a total of nearly 13,000 personnel serving in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps &mdash; constitute a large organisation operating in a high technology environment. The <Col N="1070" /> Defence Forces undertake a wide range of essential duties both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>I would like to again place on record the Government's deep appreciation of the work done by the Defence Forces &mdash; the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps. They are unsung heroes at home and abroad. They are our extra arm of diplomacy in the areas they serve in the national interest, in the interest of the UN and for the greater good of Ireland and the international community.</P>
    <P>The Army carried out the following operational commitments in 1993: Military parties for Border operations, 8,400; Joint Garda Síochána Border patrols, 10,700; Border check-points and searches, 15,700; cash security escorts, 2,000; explosive security escorts, 380; and EOD &mdash; bomb disposal &mdash; searches, 150.</P>
    <P>During 1993 the Naval Service boarded 697 vessels and detained 61 of them on suspicion of illegal fishing. The Naval Service also assisted the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners in anti-drug trafficking. The most significant operation in 1993 was in the recovery of £12.5 million worth of cannabis from the seabed in November and December. The Naval Service also assisted in 21 search and rescue missions. In the recent past the Sea and Air Rescue Service within the Department of the Marine has done a magnificent job as has Sikorsky Helicopters, the subsidiary of Aer Lingus at Shannon, in addition to the wonderful courageous work being carried on without too much fuss by our Air Corps. My congratulations to all of them.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, there has been a sharp reduction in the number of personnel leaving the Defence Forces, largely as a result of the improved rates of pay and conditions of service as well as difficult economic conditions. This has reduced the need for recruitment but has had the effect of increasing the age profile of members of the Defence Forces which need a regular injection of young blood to maintain operational effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In order to redress this situation I recently initiated a recruitment drive that will see 500 new recruits enlisted in the <Col N="1071" /> Defence Forces this year &mdash; 420 to the Army and 80 to the Naval Service. These recruits will be enlisted for a fixed period of five years and this will allow greater scope for regular intakes of recruits each year.</P>
    <P>The large number of applicants for these jobs &mdash; some 10,000 &mdash; is hardly surprising as they will be entitled to the same rates of pay and conditions as other full-time members of the Defence Forces and over the five years they will be able to avail of valuable training and experience.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of prime importance to me, both as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine, is ensuring that the Defence Forces are fully equipped to protect our maritime resources. Two new purpose built maritime patrol aircraft &mdash; CASA CN 235's &mdash; have been ordered and will be delivered later this year.</P>
    <P>This project represents the largest ever investment in aircraft for the Air Corps. When the two new aircraft are delivered, the Air Corps will have an enhanced capability to conduct extended aerial reconnaissance to the edge of the 200 mile limit. This, together with our seven Naval Service fishery protection vessels, will ensure that our valuable natural resources are protected and that we fulfil our obligations as a member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There is more to good management than maintaining expenditure within budget. The emphasis throughout the public service must be on finding ways of achieving more while consuming less. As a result of the Gleeson commission which reported in 1990, a number of organisational changes have been implemented within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The efficiency audit group has already completed two reports in the Defence area. The first report completed in 1990 dealt with the civil branches of the Department of Defence and the second report completed in 1992 dealt with administration in the Defence Forces. Arising from the reports, the Government approved proposals to give greater financial authority to the military authorities <Col N="1072" /> and these proposals are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the Government approved of the efficiency audit group conducting a radical overhaul of Defence Forces structures and systems based on a redefined statement of roles. This statement of roles, which was approved late last year, reflects more accurately and realistically what the priorities and functions of the Defence Forces should be having regard to the current security situation both internally and worldwide. The efficiency audit group engaged the services of Price Waterhouse, management consultants, to carry out the review. The consultants commenced work at the beginning of January 1994 and will have completed their task by mid-year.</P>
    <P>Reports from Somalia indicate that the Irish transport unit serving with UNOSOM II is performing a very worthwhile and courageous task for the local population and the NGO's and has established excellent relations with the local community in Baidoa. It services 4,000 UNOSOM troops in an area of 80,000 square kilometres.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, requires that I report to the Dáil on our overseas missions. In preparation for this, I will be visiting the United Nations Headquarters in New York later this week where I will have discussions and briefings with UN personnel on all peace-keeping missions that have an Irish involvement, with perticular emphasis on the position in Somalia. Following my return I shall provide a full report to the Dáil at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the budget, the Government has had to balance a number of conflicting objectives. The desire to minimise the burden of taxation has been weighted against the need to fund adequately the whole range of essential public services which are provided for the community. Notwithstanding the difficult constraints which had to be faced, through prudent management, the Minister for Finance succeeded in drawing up a budget which provides adequate resources for essential services without <Col N="1073" /> resource to excessive borrowing or taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Andrews, for allowing me to make a brief contribution to this debate. It is fair to say that the process of hauling back the Exchequer finances continued in this budget. One need only cast one's mind back six or seven years to realise that the problem of the national debt was a major focus of debate in this House. Members who contributed to this budget debate accepted the problem in relation to the national debt and with the passage of time we will come to terms with the problem in its totality.</P>
      <P>One of the most welcome initiatives in the budget is the effort to motivate small businesses here. I will briefly outline some of the provisions introduced by the Minister for Finance in that regard. The interest subsidy of 3 per cent on a special loan fund of £100 million is welcome as the cost of finance has always been a major problem for small enterprises. An £800 PAYE allowance will be made available to sons and daughters of the owners of small business firms. We tend to underestimate the contribution made by families to the well-being and proper running of small businesses. The reduction from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent of employers' PRSI contributions on incomes up to £9,000 is very welcome. Up to now the level of PRSI has been a heavy weight for those on low incomes and a positive disincentive for employers considering investing in mechanisation, automation or much needed jobs.</P>
      <P>The increase in the £40,000 and £20,000 thresholds will eliminate thousands of small businesses from the VAT net. We regularly hear complaints from owners of small businesses about the huge administrative burden associated with collecting taxes for the State year after year without proper compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most public representatives who are members of local authorities will welcome the £100 million payment to health boards to eliminate the debt burden that, effectively, has been an albatross on the finances of our health boards. Those are <Col N="1074" /> only some of the major initiatives which the Minister, Deputy Ahern, introduced in the budget. The culture of this budget is geared towards making the environment better for small businesses. If we are to tackle our major unemployment problem we will have to encourage small businesses to expand, increase output and employ more people.</P>
    <P>The budget reflects our caring attitude towards the less well off in our community and the 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments will be welcomed by those dependent on social welfare payments. While the specifics of the changes in respect of the carer's allowance are not yet clear, a problem exists for carers whose spouses work while they take care of their bedridden relatives or those who cannot look after themselves. Changes are required in that area, but we will have to await the publication of the Social Welfare Bill to know exactly what the Minister for Social Welfare has in mind.</P>
    <P>Equality in the treatment of widows and widowers is welcome. Many widowers have had to give up work to care for young families following the tragic death of the mother. Those people are in a difficult financial position because, in many cases, they gave up well paid jobs to care for their families and when their families grow up it is not possible for them to get back into the workforce. An anomaly which has always existed in the social welfare code is the fact that the position of widowers has not been given due recognition.</P>
    <P>Most Members will welcome the additional provision towards the post-primary school building programme. A total of £37 million will be made available this year compared with £26 million in last year's Estimates. The availability of additional resources will enable schools to build necessary extensions. That allocation will provide a stimulus for small contractors who depend on such public contracts.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3 million in respect of sport and recreation is welcome. The Minister of state with responsibility for that area who is in the House will be pleased to have that sum available to <Col N="1075" /> allocate to voluntary organisations. Fund raising has not become any easier and the availability of grant aid under this heading will be welcome. Adequate facilities are desirable to cater for our young people who now have more time available for leisure pursuits.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will welcome the introduction of the early retirement scheme for farmers. The Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, who has special responsibility for that scheme has organised information meetings around the county. Judging from the large attendances at such meetings one can glean the public interest in that scheme by the farming sector. The budget provides that this scheme will commence in 1994. The process of rationalisation in the industry calls for an injection of young blood with improved management techniques. Those who had the opportunity to attend agricultural institutions will benefit the industry in that they will bring new management skills to the industry and this will lead to a more streamlined sector.</P>
    <P>One of the major schemes in the area of rural development is the Leader programme. It was introduced on a pilot basis in the past number of years and has proved very successful. All the indications are that the Commission will agree to its introduction on a countrywide basis. I hope the introduction of the Leader programme, phase two, will add momentum and thrust to rural development.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the process of depopulation taking place in rural Ireland. There is a need for investment in developments and enterprises that will provide a sustainable income to keep people in rural Ireland. We have a thinly spread population compared to other countries in the European Union. However, the movement of population towards the east coast is not a desirable development. It is important that as many people as possible remain in a rural setting. If the rural population decreases the financial investment in rural infrastructure, whether in schools, industry, business, etc., will be wasted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> I wish to refer to the additional provision in the budget for non-national roads. Most public representatives will have first hand knowledge of the problems of our roads having regard to the high level of rainfall this winter. Many non-national roads have taken severe buffeting. Roads carrying heavy volumes of traffic are more severely affected than the non-national roads which do not carry a similar volume of traffic. We should consider allocating increased funds to those local authorities with responsibility for roads which carry the highest volume of traffic. It is not sufficient to provide a block grant in respect of non-national roads in particular counties. Recognition must be taken of the severe strain on roads due to buffeting and the heavy volume of traffic specifically in the north-eastern counties &mdash; my county of Louth and counties Monaghan and Meath. I thank the Minister for sharing his time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regretfully, I must give a thumbs down to a range of issues in this budget, primarily those in my areas of responsibility, namely, unemployment. A number of half-hearted measures have been introduced to deal with some employment problems, specifically those relating to employers' PRSI. Having regard to the proposals surfacing from the Government's task force on employment, that measure was weak in addressing the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force on the service sector indicated that a radical restructuring of employer's PRSI in respect of the low paid was needed to make that sector competitive with the UK. The UK has a structure of phased levels of PRSI; the average PRSI liability for lower paid workers is 6 per cent. The budget measure only goes part of the way towards addressing the issue and leaves employers, particularly those involved in vulnerable sectors, such as the clothing and footwear industries, liable for PRSI at a rate which is 50 per cent higher than that of their competitors in the UK. During the past 12 months we have lost major employers in those vulnerable sectors and others have said it would be more profitable for them to <Col N="1077" /> move their operations to the UK. That was the main issue with which the Government was asked to deal. It made a move in the right direction but it is a half hearted move.</P>
    <P>Those who looked to this budget for a first step in a radical new strategy for the service sector were dismally disappointed. The task force on service flagged what needed to be done and pointed to some areas that needed to be addressed. Few Members appear to realise the key potential role which the service sector could play in our economy. During the past six to seven years the private service sector has created ten times as many jobs as the industrial sector; it has been the employment growth area. It employs twice as many people per £1 of output spent in that sector and sources 50 per cent more of its inputs in Ireland compared to the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>The service sector has strong linkages with the domestic economy, yet the Government, in its wisdom, has decided to single out that sector to bear four times the rate of profit tax compared to that imposed on the industrial sector. It is difficult to justify and explain that measure to people who are trying to create service employment. Many service activities pay 21 per cent VAT which represents a progressive move in recent years. Governments have increased VAT to the upper rate for various service activities in virtually all areas, including professional services, personal services and so on. Most service areas have witnessed an increase in the rate of VAT in the past ten years. Those involved in that sector are now being asked to pay 21 per cent VAT, 21 per cent PRSI and 40 per cent profits tax. If the Government takes 60p of every £1 spent by a consumer in a shop or business premises, what chance has a person of creating a thriving business? The Government's task force calls for reform of the VAT code to support the labour intensive end of the service sector, and to reform the corporation tax code to reduce the corporation tax rate for particular areas of the service sector, namely, those with potential for employment growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Those very justifiable calls were endorsed by a high quality group called together by the Government. It is amazing that a couple of weeks later the budget made no reference to this fact. Since it is well known that the Taoiseach had sight of the recommendations long before the budget was introduced, it was not justifiable for the Government to say it did not have time to plan these issues. We have allowed another year to slip by while the service sector will remain the Cinderella of industry.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a perception in Merrion Street that it is much better to produce a drug than to provide home nursing, that providing a service to support people is inferior, that we should produce goods rather than services, that to produce a book is better than to teach someone a skill and that to produce an engine or a piece of equipment is better than designing a power station.</P>
    <P>However, the reality is that in the modern world high quality, well paid employment is in the area of design, teaching and information technology, providing services based on skills etc. These are not only the highest paid areas but they are the areas in which Ireland has the competitive advantage which gives us an edge. Yet that is a critical area where the Government has missed a very valuable opportunity in this budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the more controversial areas of the budget. As regards residential property tax, one suspects this proposal was primarily motivated by the Labour Party who included it in its programme in 1990. From the way Labour and Fianna Fáil, in the last general election, exchanged slurs, innuendoes and downright lies about one another, the public believed that neither party would dream of expanding the residential property tax. However, we only had to wait 13 months for the reality to emerge.</P>
    <P>There are many inequities about this tax as it is proposed to be extended. No account is taken of the extent of a mortgage on a property. For example if a person lives in a £100,000 house and owes £60,000 by way of mortgage, they really own £40,000 worth of the house <Col N="1079" /> but they will be taxed as if they owned the £100,000 worth and the money must be paid from earned income. If a member of the family, a son or daughter is also working their earnings will be taken into account. Frequently a person on average industrial earnings with a son or daughter earning an average industrial wage will be pushed into this so-called wealth bracket and they will be liable for this tax. I see no justification for that. We all know that in most cases sons and daughters are working towards buying a house of their own. To be penalised for that and told that unless they leave the home a residential property tax will be imposed on the house is unfair to families who are struggling in very difficult circumstances to get by.</P>
    <P>That philosophy is evident throughout the budget. The Government is withdrawing from people on middle incomes certain concessions, such as mortgage and VHI relief. People's entitlements to claims on their medical expenses are to be withdrawn, or subject to a £300 minimum contribution. That would be all right if the 48 per cent tax band applied to only a minority of people. However, the reality is that a single person on £12,000, a widow on £13,000 and a married couple on £20,000 are included in the 48 per cent band, as is a person on a very modest income with substantial child dependant allowance. To suggest that these people can afford to have these concessions withdrawn is not facing reality.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the exception in Europe in that people on low income pay the top rate of income tax. Until we reach a stage where the vast majority of middle income earners do not have to pay the top rate of tax, we have no right to withdraw their entitlements to mortgage and VHI relief. After all, these people are willing to stay off the housing and public health lists and to provide for their own housing and health needs. They are willing to do this and we are slapping them in the face for doing so.</P>
    <P>Another major disappointment was the tax amnesty. I believe it was unacceptable in every respect. It was thumbeing <Col N="1080" /> the nose at complaint taxpayers, making fools of people who religiously fill up their forms annually and pay on time what is due. A sum of £240 million was collected from people who thumbed their nose at the tax code over the years. The Labour and Fianna Fáil back-benchers who pushed this idea could have defended it to the ordinary taxpayer if, at the end of the day, the money was spent on a worthwhile project that would otherwise have gone without. If, for example, it went to meet the needs of persons with a mental handicap, if an extra £23 million was spent each year on these services, etc., Government back-benchers would have been able to say that something worthwhile was achived for some of the people who are struggling in our community. However, that is not what happened. The money went towards wiping out the overdrafts of health boards who failed to live within their allocations over the years. That could not conceivably justify an amnesty. For an amnesty that was flawed and immoral in the way it was put together, the final flaw emerged in terms of how the money was spent. The introduction of the amnesty showed little sensitivity to the needs of people who are trying to manage without relying on the State. It was a serious error.</P>
    <P>There has been adverse reaction to the residential property tax. People feel they are being got at once again, that the Government continually relies on the same pool of resources.</P>
    <P>As a representative of Dublin for 12 years, I know Dubliners feel particularly aggrieved about this matter which is one of a long string of decisions that seem to be anti-Dublin. Ministers seem totally unaware that in the last ten years Dublin has lost one-third of its industrial base; half the jobs in the clothing and footwear industries have disappeared. The Government, not content with the attribution of Dublin's industrial base, decided to move 4,000 public employees from Dublin under the decentralisation programme. It appears that massive job attrition is a systematic part of Government <Col N="1081" /> policy. Dubliners believe it is time to call a halt. We have rightly heard the call from those living in the west for proper regional autonomy whereby regions would have some control and say in the way their future is shaped. This is needed in areas apart from Dublin.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns, in the strongest possible manner, the failure of the Government to provide immediate and adequate resources to bring the local road network system up to an acceptable standard, particularly having regard to the economic and social hardships being caused by the continued underfunding for the maintenance of our non-national roads.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I call on the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, to put in place a ten year rescue programme or plan for the maintenance of our non-national roads, the county, regional and often forgotten urban roads. I call on the Minister to acknowledge the major crisis due to progressive cutbacks and many years of under-funding. I call on him to give some indication that he cares that the elderly and, in particular, the very young who are often prisoners in their own homes after dark because of the treacherous condition of the road outside their gate or hall door. He should show he understands that these are &ldquo;the vital transport arteries of the local economy and often the sole means of access for economic activity&rdquo;. I am quoting from the Government's National Development plan, which further states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> Non-national roads have a very important economic role in Ireland because of the dispersed nature of the population and industrial development, the importance of agriculture and tourism as generators of wealth and employment and the increasing attention being given to rural development and urban regeneration... Their improvement is a vital complement to the development of the national road network.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that the Minister understands the meaning of the word &ldquo;vital&rdquo;. Will he, in his reply, concentrate on the issue of non-national road maintenance, potholes and surface dressing? He should not attempt to confuse the beleaguered public&mdash;with 9 June in mind perhaps I should say the electorate&mdash;by quoting at length the moneys for improvement works, &ldquo;specials&rdquo;, co-financed work or expenditure on our national networks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should read the wording of the motion which concentrates on the maintenance of county and non-national roads. I ask him to please stick to that wording.</P>
      <P>We do not need a re-run of the terms of reference of the National Roads Authority. Commendable as all these figures are, we really want to know the Minister's policy in regard to the filling of potholes in counties Wexford, Cork, Limerick, Kerry, Tipperary, Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; every county is in crisis in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only figure we need from the Minister is what he is prepared to spend immediately on alleviating the crisis on the roads to avert a major collapse and wholesale abandonment of these roads by local authorities. A sum of £28 million is provided for the work this year. While <Col N="1083" /> this is a vast improvement on last year's figure of £12.3 million, it is still only a paltry increase. The additional £15 million provided in the budget is taken from a fund of £250 million in amnesty money. The Government lost a major opportunity to ensure, without any pain to the complaint taxpayer, that the proceeds of the amnesty were used to fill the potholes, maintain our county roads in a passable condition and effect a reduction in the present appalling surface dressing cycle of between 27-30 years in different areas.</P>
    <P>During the mid-1970s the surface dressing cycle for county, regional and urban roads reached the norm in engineering circles of ten years. The persistent under-funding and progressive cutbacks in the discretionary block grant for maintenance has caused a deterioration to at least a 27 year cycle for surface dressing. A sum of £1.09 billion is now needed for a county and non-national roads maintenance programme just to achieve the position which obtained in 1978. The Minister expects headlines and plaudits for spending £28 million this year. However, this should be put in the context of the funding required and the opportunity which was available to him through the once-off amnesty moneys to put a rescue programme in place.</P>
    <P>We need a rescue plan or programme for our non-national and county roads phased over ten years. I will be reasonable &mdash; we do not expect a sum of £1.09 billion today or some time in 1994. We need a ten year plan with annual spending on the maintenance of county, regional and largely forgotten urban roads of approximately £300 million per annum to get back to the acceptable cycle of ten years. I say &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; not merely because of the social and economic hardships caused by pitted lunar landscape-type roads in every county but, more importantly, to ensure skid resistance levels on their surface which comply with acceptable safety standards for drivers and commuters generally. As the surface dressing cycle has increased from ten to the present 27 years, road surfaces have <Col N="1084" /> become increasingly shiny and accident rates have increased accordingly in rural areas. I am talking about lives and personal injury as well as economic and social hardship.</P>
    <P>After one of the wettest 12 months on record, roads have never been in such a bad condition nationally. The key to maintaining a good road is proper drainage. As part of a rescue programme for these roads I urge the Minister, in co-operation with his colleague, the Minister for Labour, to concentrate Social Fund moneys on a social improvement scheme or a new CDP scheme to keep the drains and water courses on these roads clean. We undervalued the work done in this area when labour was plentiful. It is not long since Wexford County Council had 700 outdoor staff working on its 1,800 miles of non-national roads. Today the number of workers has dwindled to 180, one man for every ten miles. This is an impossible job. Indeed one could say one man for every 20 miles is necessary when one considers that both sides of a road have to be maintained. This was cost effective work and prolonged the life of the road surface by preventing water loggoing and continuous flooding.</P>
    <P>If the Minister disputes any of my figures he should speak to the author of the most up-to-date report on these roads, the county engineer for north Tipperary who, in his capacity as chairman of the County and City Engineers' Association, delivered a report to the annual conference of the Institute of Engineers. That report is the source of my figures; it is not any political or make believe source &mdash; those are the facts. I recommend that report to the Minister. I know there is no shortage of reports but I have no evidence to suggest that the Minister takes any notice of the professionally documented concerns of local groups, engineers or the tourism or agriculture sectors.</P>
    <P>I have a report on the infrastructural requirements of the Gaeltacht areas of County Kerry. Every county would have one &mdash; or several &mdash; reports of this kind. Page 24 of the report refers to the tourist routes and the major problems in some areas. Perhaps the Minister could explain <Col N="1085" /> why an important area such as Slea Head has been closed since before Christmas. I believe it is due to a mudslide. Why should an area like Dunquin, which depends so much on its infrastructure, be so disadvantaged by constant neglect from this Government?</P>
    <P>The conclusion of this report states:</P>
    <P>The effect of the chronic state of the infrastructure in these areas is exacerbated by their location and total dependence on inward and outward flows of people (tourists) and produce (milk, fish exports etc.) for survival.</P>
    <P>The few resources that the areas have, the few aspects in which they have any competitive advantage, are the only basis on which they can survive economically, and thus socially. The ability of areas to capture the benefit of these resources is inextricably linked with infrastructure such as roads and ports.</P>
    <P>There is a window of opportunity from now until the end of this century to achieve adequate provision of such basics. It should be seized with determination.</P>
    <P>The report is referring to basics such as roads and ports.</P>
    <P>The local councils take the brunt of the palpable anger of the public because of the condition of these roads. The Minister for the Environment is content to allow them take the stick. If he reneges on his responsibility in this area and fails to show his immediate commitment to resolving the crisis of our county roads, I will ensure that he and this Coalition Government get the direct blame for the breakdown of our road network in rural Ireland. If the Minister fails to act he deserves to take the blame and the public deserve to know that he, and not the local councillor, is the person to whom they must direct their anger.</P>
    <P>Bitumin has never been cheaper. Surface dressing at £1 per square meter is very cost effective and far better value than pothole filling at £3 per square metre when surface dressing has been neglected. A total of £28 million for 1994 is being allocated for the maintenance of <Col N="1086" /> our non-national county roads. The need is in the area of £300 million to begin to resume the surface dressing cycle. In Wexford alone, we would need £8.5 million this year to get back to the 1978 position and we are regarded as having some of the best roads. Even in Wexford, 23 per cent of our non-national roads are classed as critical or impassable. A further 17 per cent rate as fair. Our minor county roads are appalling.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Euro buzz words &ldquo;Maastricht&rdquo;, &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo; and &ldquo;social exclusion&rdquo; mean nothing to the Minister. There is no indication that he even understands them. The Minister should not forget about the £250 million once-off amnesty money. The complaint taxpayer deserves to benefit from that ill-gotten money by having it spent on their county roads. That money is available this year and as the Minister who presided over the total collapse of our national roads system through sheer neglect, the Minister for the Environment is the only person who will take the blame ultimately if he fails to live up to his responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>The motion in Deputy Doyle's name is self explanatory. I note that the Minister has not bothered to take notes of any point that Deputy Doyle made in the first 15 minutes of this debate. That does not, of course, mean he is not aware of the validity of the points she has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environemnt presides over the worst non-national roads situation that we have ever had. Daniel Corkery wrote a book entitled <i>The Hidden Ireland</i>&mdash; the Minister may have read it. The hidden Ireland is alive and well; it is hidden behind mounds of bushes, shrubs, grasses and inaccessible roadways. We have 3,000 miles of non-national road in County Mayo, many of <Col N="1087" /> them built over poor bog foundations, and I am inundated with complaints from doctors, travelling shop owners and bus drivers about their inability to travel on a substantial amount of that roadway.</P>
    <P>Through Government policy and private incentive there has been a huge increase in the amount of private and State planting under Coillte Teoranta. The output from the province of Connaught will more than double in the next five years. I am not sure whether the Minister understands the significance of doubly laden articulated trucks removing timber on sub-contract from private or State forests and the damage they do to a road structure that was never designed or intended to carry such weights. The damage is scandalous and there is nothing the local authorities can do about it. They bring in certain by-laws and regulations and hope for the best but that does not work.</P>
    <P>In our county the local authority is required to resurface the roads every 29 years. As someone said to me last week, even a kitchen floor would wear out in 29 years with only a single individual walking on it. I remember the Minister's predecessor, now EC Commissioner Flynn, broadcasting to the nation that war was being declared on potholes&mdash; they were to be banished. There would never be a pothole again in Ireland. He has lost that argument by ten million to one. As the comedian said, there are no more single potholes; they are all married with large families.</P>
    <P>We have 3,000 miles of road in our county. We proposed, through work similar to a social employment scheme, giving a person a five mile stretch of road to open the water tables, improve the drainage, trim back the verges and the bushes, thereby creating employment for 600 people. That was objected to officially by the union who promised an all out strike if the work commenced because it would interfere with the work of the permanent staff of the county council. There are insufficient permanent staff to carry out this work and, as the Minister is aware, if the grass verges and <Col N="1088" /> bushes are not cut back the drains block up which leads to a build up of water on the roads and together with bad weather and heavy weights, the structure of the road simply collapses.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has ever heard of places such as Dereendafderg, Tawnyculawee, Aughaloíntín, Srahtaggle, Drumminahaha, Corrnagushlawn, Clogher, Ballyglass or Cappanacreha? These are English-Irish names. I would ask the Minister to step out of his State Mercedes and drive in any other vehicle through any of those villages. He will find that these roads are practically impassable because this Government has neither the concern, the initiative nor the wit to provide the necessary method of employment and divert sufficient moneys into the saving of this county roads structure. He will rue the day that the ordinary people of this country are left, in the words of a Fianna Fáil Deputy last week, with &ldquo;motorways for the traffic and muckways for the people&rdquo;. It is simply not good enough. In 1994, the citizens who pay high insurance and high taxes are entitled to a decent roadway upon which to travel to their homes and carry out their daily business. For example, surveys undertaken in Germany show that an average day's driving in a German car on Irish roads is about the equivalent of six months driving on similar category roads in Germany. This clearly shows that the Minister for the Environment presides over a disaster. If he does not do something about it, or convince his colleagues in Cabinet to do something about it, he will be letting everybody down when, far from being at 50 per cent in the polls, he will sink into the morass through which people have to wade daily. I remember travelling by Glenamoy in the course of constituency work and being faced with the most unlikely sight of three bullocks drinking from the one pothole in the middle of the road. Presumably the Minister for the Environment would not like to preside over that type of scenario. I hope it has been rectified since.</P>
    <P>In the words of Deputy Doyle's motion this evening, the Government stands condemned <Col N="1089" /> over what is now the worst non-national roads network condition that ever prevailed here. Yet there are 300,000 people out of work and we were promised again this evening, on the six o'clock news, another 100,000 jobs through the community enterprise boards and so on. A child in a sixth class said to me the other day, that the theme of the Olivia Newton-John song &ldquo;Take Me Home Country Roads&rdquo; no longer applies because one would now need a hovercraft to gain entry to some of our villages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard on the Government back benches knows what I am talking about, as does Deputy Hughes. Every rural Member clearly understands its impact at their clinics, advice centers or however they may describe them, with a constant stream of people complaining about the state of the roads. Indeed, a former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, when he sat opposite pronounced to this nation in presidential tones that the war was on against potholes. The present Minister is carrying the banner and must bear responsibility. To date he has let us down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The concluding remarks of Deputy Kenny afford me a good introduction for a letter I received from a constituent which, with the Chair's permission, I should like to read into the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Creed,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was walking down the road this morning near to my house and was trying to avoid the potholes when I fell. A small part of the road had given way from under me. I hurt my knee, not badly, but I was rather shaken. The road has eroded due to water pushing up from underneath, I think. My argument with the council is that the road needs resurfacing, not repairing in patches. At the time of writing two men are filling in potholes in the rain, hence the holes are full of water and likely to reappear. I am nearly 70 years old and virtually a prisoner in my own home at night as I cannot venture out <Col N="1090" /> due to the state of the roads. I live alone and cannot afford to have an accident as there would be no-one to look after me. I am sorry to keep worrying you over this matter but it is really quite a problem.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>That letter could come from any parish or townland in rural Ireland today. The reality is that the Government is about to preside over the greatest spending spree on national primary roads while the rural roads network disintegrates to an unprecedented level. This serves only to highlight the extent to which the Government is out of touch and, consequently, its faulure to match scarce resources to real needs, representing a missed opportunity in rural communities of enormous proportions. In a nutshell, the Government has more money than sense.</P>
    <P>In an effort to stifle the voice of the people local authorities have been by-passed as the National Roads Authority prepares to ride roughshod over local communities, throwing money around for by-passes and motorways like confetti. For example &mdash; and on this matter I am in correspondence with the Minister which I hope will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion &mdash; on the N22 the twin villages of Ballyvourney and Ballymakeery are about to be by-passed on the strength of proposals on the part of the National Roads Authority despite the fact that probably this represents the best stretch of national primary route on the N22 between Macroom and the county boundary, and that all members of Cork County Council in the area and the local community are opposed to this development. Local democracy, common sense, value for money, all valuable criteria, have been thrown out the window.</P>
    <P>There are numerous examples of roadways nationwide that would benefit if we could match scarce resources to the real needs obtaining. In the example I cited it would be much more beneficial if the resources being thrown at a non-existent problem were allocated towards resolving a very serious problem on a major tourist route, the road between <Col N="1091" /> Blarney and Killarney and from Blarney to Macroom. That road takes more traffic than many national primary routes but, because of its designation, will not benefit one iota from improvements to be carried out through resources available to the Department of the Environment. Likewise, the road from Macroom to Bantry via the villages of Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary is desperately crying out for improvement, yet not one penny will be earmarked from the increased resources available to the Department for it.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that a compulsory MOT test of all motor vehicles will be introduced in coming years. If the rural roads network continues to deteriorate at the pace it has in recent years it is highly likely that not one car will pass that test without enormous annual investment on the part of owners. We must remember that the rural economy is dependent on milk lorries, ration lorries, fertiliser lorries, cattle lorries traipsing over inadequate rural roads.</P>
    <P>It is high time we matched scarce resources to real need.</P>
    <P>The best value for money that can be obtained by local authorities would be through an investment in manpower to restore their local area offices to the level of employment that obtained prior to the redundancy package of the late 1980s.</P>
    <P>In my local area office, out of a total of 15 employees in 1987, almost half opted to accept voluntary redundancy and very few of those people have been replaced. Even with unlimited financial resources for goods and materials, this creates a demand which cannot be met due to inadequate levels of manpower. If resources become available to the Minister's Department he should immediately allow local authorities to deploy additional workers on roadways, opening drains or clearing dykes thereby ensuring that water is kept off our road surfaces.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council is in the process of formulating a detailed submission to the Minister's Department in an effort to secure additional finance for the deployment of employees on our roads. I hope <Col N="1092" /> that submission will be favourably considered by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. Last evening I attended a public meeting in Ballyduff in County Kerry, attended by more than 100 people. The people in that small parish expressed their indignation and frustration at the condition of the county roads in their locality. Since the Minister was not present last evening I am sure that some of his party councillors who were present, as was a Senator of his party, will advise him of the level of frustration and bitterness displayed at that meeting. I have rarely attended a public meeting where such anger was expressed. It is an example of the feeling in rural communities. The Minister knows that a major scheme of road strengthening must be carried out on the non-national roads. Our county road network is vital for the economic well being of rural Ireland and for tourism. Because of Government neglect in recent years thousands of miles of our county road network have disintegrated and are now almost unusable at severallocations. The funding for county roads falls abysmally short of what is required.</P>
      <P>The county roads system was not designed to cater for the loading, frequency and speed of heavy traffic. The sustained usage of poorly constructed roads by heavy articulated trucks, school buses, cattle lorries, heavy goods vehicles and so forth is causing and will continue to cause severe structural damage to roads and bridges. There have been shortfalls in local authority funding for several years. These have been reflected in greatly reduced annual programmes of bitumen surface dressing and road strengthening. Surface deterioration inevitably follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of our tourist attractions are on non-national roads. Tourists are becoming increasingly frustrated because of damage caused to their cars by punctures, blowouts, etc. Our image abroad will suffer if we do not improve the standard of our roads. We expect tourism to grow by over 50 per cent during the next five <Col N="1093" /> years and to produce in the order of 35,000 jobs. Surely county roads play a major part in the growth of our tourism industry. They are a vital part of the necessary infrastructure for the development of tourism. It is important that county roads are not seen in isolation but as a part of the overall infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Doyle referred to the serious problem at Slea Head. It is ridiculous that the Slea Head road, from which you can visit the Blasket Islands and the new interpretative centre at Dunquin, is closed to the public. A special grant should be made available immediately to have the matter rectified. I am seriously concerned about the general condition of our county road network throughout County Kerry. I am constantly reminded, as I was last night in Ballyduff by individuals and communities, of the low level of service which our roads can provide.</P>
    <P>The county road network in Kerry consists of approximately 2,400 miles, 2,300 miles of which have been surface dressed. The network varies considerably in quality and carrying capacity. There are several hundred miles of county roads which are up to 20 feet wide and are subject to increasingly heavy traffic volumes. This increase can be attributed to a large extent to the changes in farming methods during the past 20 years, for example, bulk milk collection and bulk delivery of fertiliser.</P>
    <P>In excess of 75 per cent of county roads in Kerry are constructed on boggy foundations. This leads to the deterioration of road surfaces under heavy loads and to the deformation of the road embankment in times of dry weather when the peat foundations tend to dry out and contract. A recent survey carried out by the county engineer indicated that 50 per cent of our county road network or some 1,200 miles are at a serious risk of disintegration. The cost of refurbishing 1,200 miles would be approximately £24 million at present costs of £20,000 per mile. To strengthen these roads would cost £9 million. It is a welcome departure in the budget that county roads are recognised but the allocation will prove to be minuscule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The Minister for the Environment will recall addressing Kerry County Council, the first holder of that office to do so. We appreciated that and we requested increased funding for local improvement schemes and for the discretionary grant. A few months later we received a decrease of £200,000 in our discretionary grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this year's allocation and to compensate, in some way, for last year's shortfall. Of the £15 million granted this year, I hope County Kerry will receive in the region of £800,000. This would allow for £200,000 for each of the four engineering district areas in the county. When that sum is broken down further, it allows for about ten miles of county road strengthening. Without fear of contradiction I can say that 90 per cent of the county roads of North Kerry, which amount to about 400 miles, are disintegrating. It is impossible to drive at speed over those roads &mdash; 40 miles per hour would be the maximum &mdash; without destroying your car. Despite what the Minister thinks about the road conditions in County Cavan and elsewhere, the county road network in north Kerry &mdash; my own constituency and that of the Tánaiste &mdash; is the worst in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are great autobahns stretching across parts of the country. While it is nice to brag about these autobahns in Europe I think we have gone overboard to some extent. I would be the first to recognise that we need good national, primary and secondary roads systems but some of these roads are over-engineered. We need good national thoroughfares to move goods throughout the island to our <Col N="1095" /> ports and so on, but too much money is being put into these roads to the neglect of our country road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a major investment in the country road network over a sustained period, rural areas will suffer further depopulation and isolation. A good country road network is essential to the continued survival of rural Ireland. That contributes as much to rural regeneration as all the grants we receive from Brussels through the various schemes. Investment in the roads network is crucial to the future of rural Ireland. I hope the Minister will take on board the suggestions made tonight and will note the local arguments put forward.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the financial commitment of the Government to assisting local authorities to maintain local roads in a satisfactory condition and, in particular, notes:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the substantial level of grants provided by the Exchequer for this purpose in recent years;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the increased funding allocated for non-national roads in the National Development Plan;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of £86.9 million made for such roads in the Estimates for 1994;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the additional £15 million provided in the budget for the maintenance of such roads, bringing the overall provision for State grants for non-national roads to the record level of £101.9 million in 1994.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put a few basic facts on the record of this House, facts that speak for themselves, facts that make nonsense of the preposterous allegations made by Deputy Doyle and some of her colleagues about the Government's position on the maintenance and improvement of non-national <Col N="1096" /> roads. I rest my case on these facts. Not one penny was paid by the State by way of grants for maintenance work on county roads in the years up to and including 1988. Total grants paid to county councils for all works on non-national roads came to £39.3 million in 1988. In the five years 1989 to 1993, grants paid to county councils for non-national road maintenance and improvement works totalled £336 million, or £67 million a year, on average.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How much for maintenance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking account also of the contribution from local resources, total expenditure by county councils on non-national roads in the past five years was well in excess of £600 million, or more than £120 million per year, on average.</P>
      <P>For every pound spent by county councils on non-national roads in 1988, the State paid just over 70 pence. For every pound spent by county councils on these roads last year, the State put up nearly £1.40.</P>
      <P>Total grants to all local authorities for non-national roads this year will be £101.9 million. This is £26.6 million more than the amount provided in 1993 and it brings State spending on the maintenance and improvement of these roads to an all-time record level.</P>

When it is said it takes 27 years to resurface a road, that means that the relevant local authority has received during that period for that road £54,000 for that kilometre.</P>
      <P>These figures clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment in recent years to the provision of the maximum possible funding for non-national roads.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the dispersed nature of our population and industrial development and the importance of these roads to agriculture, tourism, rural development and urban regeneration. Many of these roads are vital arteries of the local economy, and their improvement and maintenance to a good standard is necessary to complement the development of the network of national roads.</P>
      <P>Spending on non-national roads must, of course, be seen in the context of spending by local authorities generally. In 1994, total spending by local authorities will amount to more than £1.6 billion, broken down between current spending of about £1,100 million and capital expenditure of about £500 million. Roughly half of all this spending is funded by a series of different grants from the Exchequer amounting to about £850 million this year, all non-repayable grants, nearly all of which comes from my Department. Almost all of the capital spending is funded by 100 per cent State grants, covering the cost of major construction works on roads and water and sanitary services facilities and much of the housing construction programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be expected that, in an effort to improve and expand the range of local <Col N="1100" /> services, local authorities would wish to have the level of State grants increased, but we must be realistic about what we can accomplish with the resources available to us as a community.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for funding work on non-national roads have evolved over a number of years. State grants to county councils towards the cost of works on county roads have, since the early 1970s, been provided almost exclusively through a block grant mechanism with special grants for specific improvement works in exceptional circumstances. In the period up to and including 1988, block grants could be used to supplement expenditure from county council's own resources, including rate support grants, for the maintenance and improvement of regional roads and the improvement of county roads. There were no grants for county road maintenance in the years up to and including 1988 and Fine Gael had better listen to that because when they were in charge they did nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1989 it was decided to combine the old block grant with funds that had been available since 1986 for strengthening country roads and to form <Col N="1102" /> a new block grant for the improvement of regional and county roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a block grant for the maintenance of regional and county roads. This is the first time grant assistance was made available for maintenance works on county roads. The old block grants could not be used for that purpose.</P>
      <P>These changes coincided with the commitment from the Government to make available £150 million over the three year period 1989-91 in discretionary block grants to county councils to supplement their expenditure on maintenance and improvement work. In the event, discretionary grants paid in those years totalled £182.4 million, and the high level of assistance has been maintained in 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>Advocates of increased funding for road repairs or other maintenance work on non-national roads regularly tell us that European Union sources such as the European Regional Development Fund or the Cohesion Fund should be drawn on for this purpose. The reality is that neither fund will assist maintenance expenditure.</P>

      <P>Limited European Regional Development Fund support was received for improvement projects on non-national roads, subject to conditions established by the European Union Commission, in the period 1989-93; this amounted to approximately £34 million, only a small portion of total spending in that period. Cohesion Fund support is, of course, confined to projects on national primary routes forming part of the trans-European roads network; it is of no relevance to our non-national roads. The fact is, therefore, that when it comes to providing grants for maintenance work on non-national roads, the Exchequer alone has to meet the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, discretionary grants totalling <Col N="1103" /> almost £62 million were paid to county councils for the maintenance and improvement of regional and county roads. When special grants for individual improvement projects and grants paid to urban authorities are taken into account, a total of £75.3 million was paid in grants to local authorities to assist them in meeting their responsibilities in respect of non-national roads.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the heavy rainfall in 1993, notably in mid-June, early October and especially in December and January 1994 resulted in serious damage to roads in many areas. Rainfall in December was over 150 per cent of normal in most of the country, while many parts of the north and west had double the normal amounts. With the costs arising from earlier bad weather, many local authorities had insufficient contingency funds in reserve to carry out necessary repairs and maintenance towards the end of the year. In the circumstances, the Government decided to use some of the revenue generated by the amnesty to increase by £15 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be notifying discretionary grant allocations to the local authorities shortly. In addition, a scheme of specific grants is being introduced this year to meet 100 per cent of the cost to local authorities of individual road improvement projects.

      <P>The programme as a whole will be targeted at regional and local roads of importance to the generation of economic activity and jobs in industry, tourism, fisheries, forestry, agriculture or rural development. Guidelines on the nomination of projects were issued to local authorities last week and it is now open to them to nominate suitable projects which meet the criteria laid down.</P>
      <P>This new scheme of grants will help to meet the objectives of the National Development Plan as regards the tourism industry and the promotion of development generally. Local authorities have been asked to ensure a reasonable spread of proposals relating to the various economic sectors and to engage in consultation with relevant sectoral interests for this purpose. The overall aim will be to achieve a package of proposals which can best meet the individual needs of each local authority area.</P>

      <P>Overall, between 1986-94, State grants for non-national roads, including urban roads, have gone up from £40.48 million to £101.9 million, an increase of 152 per cent. This is the real indicator of our commitment this year and over the next six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The total of £101.9 million which is being invested by the Exchequer in non-national roads this year amounts to £1,171 for every single kilometre of the non-national road network &mdash; or £1,874 for every single mile. These are staggering figures, and I suspect that many road users would find them hard to believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crucial that the taxpayer gets the best possible return from this investment and I will, therefore, be pursuing this aspect with the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is also imperative that local authorities maintain their own commitment to investment in the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and that the substantially increased contribution from the State is not used by them as an excuse to reduce funding from their own resources, as some Fine Gael councillors tried to do in the past week.</P>

      <P>We have also seen a dramatic shift in the balance of funding for non-national roads since 1986. In that <Col N="1106" /> year, grants accounted for one-third of total expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of these roads. By 1993, the State contribution had risen to 55 per cent and it will increase still further this year, given the record level of grants. In the case of regional and county roads, the State contribution increased from 29 per cent of total expenditure to 58 per cent over the period since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The data available indicate wide variations among county councils in the provision made in their estimates for maintenance and improvement work on regional and county roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On a cost per kilometre basis, councils with the highest provision are spending up to eight times more than those at the other end of the scale. While I appreciate that needs will vary somewhat from one area to another, it is very difficult to account for variations on this scale.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to become involved in reviewing the level of spending on a service which I regard as the preserve of local authorities. However, I have no intention of continuing to pay out ever larger sums in grants to local authorities who, by the standards set by their own colleagues, are not making a reasonable effort to contribute to a solution of the road maintenance problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend, therefore, to examine the options I might pursue to secure an adequate commitment of local authorities' own resources to work on local roads, and to explore the possibility of linking road grant allocations to each authority's own level of funding, instead <Col N="1107" /> of the mileage related basis adopted up to now. The Exchequer is simply not in a position to shoulder a constantly increasing proportion of the costs associated with the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads, and I am not prepared to ask the taxpayer to contribute further for this purpose, unless there is genuine additionality in all areas.</P>

Of course, Deputy Yates tried, like his colleagues, to have things both ways, by stating that Fine Gael would support a proposal to devote a large portion of the tax amnesty proceeds to the resurfacing of county roads. Even this suggestion by Deputy Yates is itself doubly inconsistent. It ignores the fact that his own party fought bitterly against the introduction of the tax amnesty.

      <P>In conclusion, let me quote for Deputy Doyle a passage taken from the report of the Commission on Renewal of Fine Gael which I would commend strongly to her:</P>
      <P>There is a lack of consistency in the message emanating from the Party to the public and a tendency for individual members of the Front Bench and the Parliamentary Party to address issues in an unconsidered way, failing to recognise when it is in their interests, and the interest of the Party as a whole, to either consider more carefully what is being said, or indeed, to remain silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Given its long and vast experience in Opposition, one might have expected better from Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take a trip down the country to assess the scale of the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One might have expected it to put forward policies which at least contain a thread of consistency or which are based on conviction but it is flailing and flying in all directions in a desperate attempt to come up with anything that would make the headlines and score a point against the Government. <Col N="1110" /> A prime example is its attitude to public expenditure. On the national stage it would have everyone believe that the Government should further cut public expenditure but at local level Fine Gael Councillors are calling on the Government to increase urgently expenditure on county road maintenance and a host of other public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <P>This is borne out by the increase of 152 per cent in State grants for non national roads between 1986 and 1994. I quickly checked the document <i>Building on Reality</i> published by Fine Gael and Labour when in Government in 1985 and in the section on roads there was no mention of the importance of the non national road network. The calls made tonight by Deputy Doyle and her colleagues ring hollow when one considers that the priorities indentified by that party when in Government were, according to that document, the provision of an adequate inter-urban system for the major towns, ports and airports, the elimination of traffic hold-ups by the provision of bypasses for towns on national roads and the reduction of urban congestion.

      <P>In the case of my own county he had a most productive meeting with council members and officials and made it his business to assess at first hand the difficulties we are facing in County Cavan in relation to roads. I believe the Minister and the Taoiseach ensured that provision was made in the National Development Plan for partial funding of the non-national road network using Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent debate on the Supplementary <Col N="1112" /> Estimate for the Department of the Environment the Minister indicated that particular problems were being experienced in County Cavan and that it was a special case in relation to funding. The county needs a substantial increase in its allocation for roads this year and I look forward to the Minister providing us with the help that we need.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on the local authorities' own contribution to the cost of roadworks. Cavan County Council has consistently increased its allocation from own resources. Its service charges are the highest in the country. We are paying our share and the council does not leave it to the last hour before discharging its statutory responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Particular difficulties are being encountered throughout County Cavan. In a survey carried out in 1991 the county engineer identified the main factors contributing to the deterioration in road standards. These include weak saturated drumlin soils covering 77 per cent of the total area of County Cavan; poor drainage conditions; increased allowable axle loadings under Europeans Union legislation; intensive agricultural activity &mdash; 15 million tonnes of material are transported along the regional and county road network annually; the large volume of cross Border heavy commercial traffic; and the lack of a railway system, which has led to increased heavy axle loadings.</P>
      <P>There is an unanswerable case for increased investment in our regional and county road system. This would lead to a reduction in costs for industry, agriculture, tourism and general road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the heavy rainfall in the latter half of 1993. In the north-west there was double the normal amount. This contributed significantly to the further deterioration of the road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the number of Border <Col N="1113" /> crossings from 14 to four has led to intensification to traffic along the routes that are still open. As I indicated earlier, we have no railway service and it has been estimated that the lack of such a service has led to a 10 per cent to a 17 per cent increase in heavy axle loadings on the roadways in County Cavan. Since the rail network was closed in the county almost 30 years ago all goods have to be transported by road. This has added greatly to the already significant infrastructural deficiencies in the county compared with most other parts of the country. The county has had a hard uphill battle to attract industry and to develop its enormous tourism potential which, thankfully, has gained recognition in recent years. The county is dependent to a large extent on the agri/industry and the major co-operatives sited along regional and county roads. It should be remembered that the intense agricultural activity is spread over a wide area and access to the farmyard is as important as access to the place where farm produce is processed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the development of tourism, the roads tourists become most familiar with are minor roads and laneways leading to waterways in the county. Those involved in tourism in Cavan-Monaghan are aware that the principal complaint of many tourists relates to the unacceptable condition of some access roads and this may cause some damage in developing tourism.</P>
    <P>The importance of non-national roads is highlighted in the National Development Plan which states:</P>
    <P>Non-national roads have a very important economic role in Ireland because of the disperse nature of population and industrial development, the importance of agriculture and tourism as generators of wealth and employment and the increasing attention being given to rural development and urban regeneration.</P>
    <P>The European Union's commitment to rural development will mean nothing unless it is prepared to provide substantial funding to provide access to rural areas and to ensure that those projects <Col N="1114" /> under which employment is being created and revenue generated in rural Ireland are not placed at a serious competitive disadvantage due to transport costs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I make a special appeal to the Minister to increase substantially the 1994 allocation for roads in County Cavan. This money would be spent well by the county council.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time with me. I support the amendment tabled by the Minister. During the past six months there has been unparalleled rainfall. This has caused some problems even in my own county where there is an excellent road structure. I have no doubt, having regard to the funding that is to be made available by the Minister, that these will be resolved in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>To say the least, Fine Gael has a cheek to table this motion, given that when it was in Government between 1983 and 1987 it provded no money for maintenance works on county roads. The Minister outlined the record of his party since 1988 when £40 million was made available for county roads, while £336 million was made available in grants between 1989 and 1993. This works out at £67 million a year. A total of over £600 million was invested in roads during that five year period.</P>

      <P>It is clear that there is confusion among the members of Fine Gael, given the opposing views expressed by Deputy Doyle and Deputy Yates. Deputy Doyle has called for more expenditure on top of the £26 million increase already announced in this year's budget. <Col N="1115" /> Deputy Yates, Fine Gael's finance spokesperson, continues to criticise the Government and describes it as a high spending Government. Is it any wonder that Fine Gael are floundering in the polls with 16 per cent support given that the people who lead that party speak with forked tongues?</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cullen. I am pleased that this crucial motion on county roads has generated heat and caught the interest of Members. I hope that interest and the anger expressed will be reflected in future years in the amount of money invested in the non-national road system, the county road structure in particular.</P>
      <P>The deterioration in the surface conditions of county roads throughout the country is the clearest indication of the erosion of the quality of rural life in the past 15 years. Our centralised system of Government has, for years, set itself an entirely different set of standards from those which rural Ireland would set for itself. The centralised Dublin Government sees a need for modern motorways along our east coast connecting harbours from Belfast to Cork, and modern highways connecting the larger urban centres, but has never seen the concurrent need to maintain good access roads between the homes of rural dwellers and their local market towns. The priority for rural dwellers has been decent roads to their homes from the main roads and good main roads to the local urban centres. Central government planning has been continuously in conflict with the needs of our rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two separate sets of priorities exist. <Col N="1116" /> Government Departments see the need for modern inter-connecting highways as the only priority to the practical exclusion of the real needs of the majority of rural dwellers. The funding of the county road system has been neglected, resulting in rapid deterioration of the condition of the pavements. This neglect adds hugely to the transport costs of rural people who suffer constant damage resulting in the need for expensive repairs to their cars. This, in turn, has turned rural living into a nightmare, adding to despondency, driving away investment and discouraging young people from settling in rural areas. The very fabric of society is endangered due to the neglect of the county road system; this point cannot be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have championed the cause of rural Ireland and highlighted the importance of maintaining good local roads. I raised this issue with Ministers for the Environment over the past 15 years and I regret that any increases, reluctantly granted, were minimal and unrealistic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister that the allocation this year for non-national roads and in particular for county roads will be increased substantially. I am conscious that he has an opportunity to do so because of the exceptional funds available from the tax amnesty, whatever we may think about it. I am concerned that this increase is being funded from an exceptional source and that there is no assurance in the Minister's speech, or in the National Development Plan, that there will be a higher level of commitment in future to meet the needs of the county road system which has been deteriorating at an alarming rate. What is needed, therefore, is a rebalancing of the Government's priorities in regard to where it spends the moneys available for road improvements, road maintenance and new road construction.</P>
    <P>In view of all the heat generated here tonight, I should remind the House that the most savage cutbacks in rural investment, in county roads, were experienced when Fine Gael was in Government with <Col N="1117" /> Labour. I am here long enough to be able to make that statement with some authority. It may suit Fine Gael's cause today to promote this motion in its strident terms, and my party will support it, but I hope that during this debate we will not hear Deputies Dukes, John Bruton or even the echoes of Richie Ryan making cynical contributions. It would be hypocritical to do so as they, when holding the Finance portfolio, deliberately starved the county road system of funds.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the ruination of local Government in this country was Deputy Dick Spring's decision, as Minister for the Environment in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, to remove the statutory obligation on the Exchequer to allocate rate support grants in lieu of the amount which would have accrued to each local authority if rates on houses had still been in place. Until the funding of local government is put back on an equitable statutory basis, the erosion of services, the deterioration of our roads and the increasing ineffectiveness of the local government system will continue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's favoured fundamentals are really irrelevant if the number of people out of work continues at an unacceptable high level. The fact that the Minister quotes various sums of money now being invested in county roads can also be irrelevant if their condition continues to deteriorate. This year's increase is welcome but there is no commitment to an ongoing investment which would deal with the extent of the problem, and the problem is far greater than the Minister acknowledged in his contribution. Juggling with figures and thinking that because an increase will apply the problem is being dealt with is not logical or enough to satisfy us that the continuous deterioration in the road network is being tackled.</P>
    <P>In effect, the motion is about our great national embarrassment, potholes, which are the evidence of neglect of a most valuable national asset built up over the decades with the hard-earned money of taxpayers who for years now, have seen their investment destroyed due to negligence. There has been a lack of staff to <Col N="1118" /> keep the water tables open to drain the water which lodges and softens the surfaces which are then pounded by the one million motorcars that travel that 46,000 miles of county roads. Damage is also caused by the heavy trucks which travel rural areas as a result of advances in industry and forestry and the activities in dairy co-operatives. All these developments place a new strain on the fragile road structure that keeps rural Ireland operating. The Minister did not give a commitment to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>In all there are 57,687 miles of public roads reputed, as the Minister said, to be the highest road density in Europe relative to our population. Of this total, 2,200 miles are designed as national primary and national secondary roads. These national roads comprise only 5 per cent of our total road network, yet the Minister has committed £1,299 million, mostly European Union funds, to be spent on major improvements on the national routes over the next six years under the National Development Plan while at the same time planning to spend only £475 million on the 54,487 miles of non-national roads over the same period. From these figures it must be clear that there will be no great change of policy. The national highways will get the money, the non-national roads will continue to be starved of money.</P>
    <P>There is a serious imbalance in the Minister's priorities between national and non-national roads. Indeed, anybody travelling our primary roads over the past year has seen an extraordinary wastage of funds, perfect road pavements have been ripped up to be replaced by expensive tarmacadam surfaces where no immediate or astonishing improvement is deemed to have taken place. Yet over the past six months these private contractors have been out on our highways, on our main roads where millions of pounds of EU money is being invested at a pace which would seem to indicate that there is no shortage of funds. The ripping up of perfectly good surfaces to be replaced by a higher quality finish is an extraordinary extravagance in a country where non-national roads are collapsing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> There is a stark contrast between investment in our primary routes and that in our non-national routes. There is also a stark contrast in respect of the Minister's priorities as to where funds should be spent, how they should be spent and the balance to be maintained in relation to our road requirements. The Minister's quotations in respect of the ability or inability of local authorities to invest more money in the system are pathetic when one considers how strapped local authorities are because of the current system of funding. Until a fundamental change is made in the way in which local authorities are funded, a Minister cannot call on them to invest more money in roads. They do not have the capacity to collect funds. The Exchequer grabs all the money for central Government and starves local government, the level of government which is, perhaps, the most important, because of its closeness to the people. That is a serious fault of Government administration which has been highlighted in the Barrington report and other studies. Only when the Government is prepared to tackle that issue will we be able to make the progress of which this country is capable.</P>
    <P>A former Minister for the Environment, Padraig Flynn, once said he would fill in all the potholes, but he failed, took off to Brussels and joined the Commission of the European Union, who now dictate that Structural and Cohesion Funds must go into national routes while the potholes in rural Ireland get bigger and bigger. The Minister, Deputy Smith, recently told us that it is pointless filling in potholes and that people will have to wait several years more before they can expect county roads to be repaired.</P>
    <P>The Connemara people were the first to revolt against potholed roads. They formed an organisation called Cumhacht to agitate for better county roads. I recall the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, as Minister for the Environment, refusing to meet members of that organisation. They contested Galway County Council elections <Col N="1120" /> and elected their own councillor, Councillor Peadar O'Toole, who highlights the pothole problem at every opportunity. They also elected a member to Údarás na Gaeltachta, denying Fianna Fáil a seat on Údarás for its Connemara candidate &mdash; a history making event.</P>
    <P>The people of Cavan have revolted and have had four councillors elected to Cavan County Council. The latest county to revolt is Longford, the Taoiseach's county. I expect it will not be long before their revolt will begin to hurt where it counts, in the electoral arena. Rural Ireland is awakening to the power of the ballot box and no doubt the European Parliament elections will be the next opportunity rural dwellers will have to tell this Government it must heed the needs of our people or suffer electoral consequences.</P>
    <P>One million car owners paying £209 million per annum in road tax are very angry at the Government who are prepared to pay £6 million per mile on a highway but will not provide a penny for major improvements on county roads. How can the Government justify spending £1,184 million on 250 miles of primary routes over a six-year period, while 56,000 miles of roadway will remain potholed during the same period?</P>
    <P>Lest anyone might think I exaggerate the extent of the problem or the importance of county roads, I would like to put on record the report of Galway's county engineer, Mr. Flood, a man not given to exaggeration. He stated that the road structure in Connemara is particularly poor and many of those roads are used extensively for tourism, aquaculture, fishing, forestry and so on. He stated also that the county council's overall employment rate dropped by 60 per cent in the past ten years and that no surface dressing has been carried out on regional or local roads in County Galway since 1986, except for that carried out in conjunction with strengthening or surface restoration. He concluded his report by stating that unless a rescue package is put in place for regional and local roads the deterioration will continue, resulting in a total collapse of the road network in parts of that <Col N="1121" /> county. The Minister's announcement in the budget and the Minister for the Environment's announcement tonight can in no way be considered an adequate rescue package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister continues in office for much longer he will not have any responsibility because he finds a mechanism to fob off responsibility, mainly to local authorities, for every issue raised in the House. He reminded the House this evening that the statutory responsibility for county roads still rests with local authorities. That is true, but they do not have the funding or the means of raising funds. It is easy to say where the responsibility lies when the Minister holds the purse strings. It is no longer acceptable for local authorities to be put through the hoops, as has been the case for the past number of years. The most important report received by the Minister was that prepared by the city and county engineers, namely, the development plan from 1990 to 2009. That report sets out the statistical figures and the direction in which we should be heading in the coming years and it states that the minimum figure required is £179 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The reality in regard to dealing with our county and regional roads as opposed to our national roads is that if adequate funding is not provided now those roads will deteriorate further and the cost of rejuvenating them will increase substantially. This is not similar to a Department or Minister deciding to shed a programme of activity for one or two years because of a lack of resources and picking up where he or she left off in one or two years' time. I do not know how the Minister for the Environment at the end of this decade, whoever that might be, will deal with the reality of our county and non-national roads. The problem is getting worse. I welcome the Minister's announcement in the budget that extra money will be provided, but it is inadequate in the context of the job to be done. The argument put forward by the Minister this evening that it is not his responsibility is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> Does the Minister believe that the main companies and industrial concerns which generate the most jobs are located along our national primary routes? Does he not realise that that is not the case and that county and regional roads play a major role in the delivery of goods and services to our national routes? Does he not realises that much of the chaos and the increased cost factor in regard to our road network lies in the fact that the county roads which deliver the services to the national primary routes are in a deplorable state?</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the EU, the Government has been pouring money into various projects, one of which is the regional airport in Waterford. We are grateful for that. In spite of difficult times that company has survived. However, we cannot construct a road to the airport. At present the road to the airport is similar to a boreen. Successive Ministers for the Environment have promised funding for that road, which serves a large region.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the Department provides funding for the completion of that project, the money already spent on the airport by the Government and through EU grants will not bear fruit. The allocation for county and regional roads is unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter of considerable importance for many thousands of Irish families and emigrants who have found it necessary to leave this country. It is sign of the times that we are obliged to be vigilant in regard to changes in the British social security system. Due to the failure of the Government to provide economic opportunities at home many thousands of Irish people are forced to emigrate to the United Kingdom and, regrettably, too many end up dependent on the social security system there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The announcement by the British Social Services Minister, Mr. Peter Lilley, that he intends to review the guidelines governing eligibility for the three main means-tested payments under the pretext that foreigners were abusing the system is an alarming addition to the outbreak of xenophobia initiated by his Government colleague, Michael Portillo. It is estimated by Mr. Lilley that this review could result in 100,000 people losing their entitlements and a large proportion of those people would be Irish. I am referring to the equivalent of our supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The three main benefits include income support which amounts to approximately £38 sterling per week, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposed development requires an immediate and stern response from the Irish Government. Our hand is strong in this matter. The arrangements here for UK citizens means that we can approach this matter from a position of strength. I understand that non-nationals who present a claim for supplementary welfare in the UK are obliged to register as aliens, but UK citizens resident here are not obliged to register as aliens because of a special arrangement. If the local community welfare officer is satisfied as to the applicant's means those people are entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, should seek an immediate meeting with his UK counterpart to express our reservations and pending the outcome of the meeting consideration must be given to challenging the proposals through the European courts. We have failed those who will be affected by the proposals and I hope we will not fail them when they are living abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the possible implications for Irish citizens if the British Secretary of State for Social Security proceeds with the introduction of a residence test for people seeking certain social welfare payments in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> My Department has received from the British Embassy a statement which confirms that the Secretary of State intends shortly to announce the introduction of an habitual residence test which would apply when assessing entitlement to three payments &mdash; income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</P>
    <P>It is as yet unclear what form such a test will take but our main concern must be with the position of young emigrants who go to Britain seeking employment and who find themselves, at least temporarily, dependent on social services. The statement indicates that claimants will have to have a close connection with the United Kingdom and steady employment before they will be entitled to these benefits. Later it is stated that the change will, &ldquo;in practice have less impact on Irish citizens than at first sight. They are likely to have more ties with the United Kingdom than other EU nationals: they may have lived or worked in the United Kingdom before, or may have family there with whom they intend to live, and thus have little difficulty in satisfying the habitual residence test.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What this suggests &mdash; although I cannot of course confirm this in advance of publication of the proposals &mdash; is that long term residents of the United Kingdom who continue to hold Irish citizenship and Irish citizens returning to Britain who have worked there previously will not be affected by the new measures. Hence our special concern for young emigrants.</P>
    <P>CSO figures for last year put the number of Irish emigrants to Britain at 18,500 and there is an expectation that this figure may rise if British economic growth improves over the course of this year. It is impossible to estimate what share of these emigrants would not have pre-arranged employment or accommodation and would fall into the group potentially affected by the new provisions. In comparison, our own social welfare records show that some 32,000 emigrants returned to Ireland last year, mainly from the UK. The Deputy will appreciate there are frequent movements to and from the UK and hence there are close ties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> Officials in our London embassy have been in discussion with the Department of Social Security over recent days. I also understand that there will be a process of public consultation over the proposed changes and that the Federation of Irish Societies will be involved in this process. It is clearly of the utmost importance that we both establish the extent of the potential problem and seek, via discussion with the British authorities, to minimise the negative impact on our citizens.</P>
    <P>There is a European Union dimension to the proposal. The Treaty of Rome contains a guarantee of the right to free movement of workers which is at the centre of the whole European enterprise. The European Court of Justice has determined that this extends to the right of European Union citizens to travel to seek work in other member states of the Union. However, the entitlement of job seekers to the social protection of the member state in which they are seeking work is far from absolute and is not comprehensively provided for in the law of the Union.</P>
    <P>I have instructed my Department to raise the question of the new regulations at a meeting of the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers which is taking place in Brussels today and tomorrow. My concern is to seek, as is our right as a fellow member of the European Union, the fullest clarification from the United Kingdom and to ask the European Commission to investigate whether the proposed measures, when clarified, are in compliance with European Union law.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of the utmost importance to me to ensure that the social welfare rights of our emigrants, both here and in the country in which they are working or have worked, are protected and preserved. In addition to the now extensive body of rights which has been built up within the European Union. I have negotiated bilteral agreements with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, including Quebec, and Austria which allow for the mutual recognition <Col N="1126" /> of rights built up during periods of work abroad.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to ensuring that our emigrants are made aware of their entitlements. Officials of my Department recently visited prominent Irish communities in the United States to publicise the Irish-US Bilateral Agreement. Today two officials took part in an information session on social welfare rights in an Irish women's centre in London.</P>
    <P>For a long time now counselling centres on both sides of the Irish Sea have sought to drive home the message to young people considering emigration that they should not set out with the intention of relying on social welfare. It is now even more vital that this message is clearly understood.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that I will continue to work at all levels and in all possible ways to protect the rights of our citizens abroad. I will certainly take action to allay the Deputy's concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. Existing Garda Síochána regulations specify that a man cannot be admitted as a trainee garda unless he is five feet nine inches in height while a woman can be admitted provided she is not less than five feet five inches in height. The regulations also obscurely require that both men and women be &ldquo;built in proportion to their height&rdquo;. It is unclear in what circumstances applicants are regarded as disproportionate, and perhaps the Minister will explain that to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations are inappropriate, discriminatory, bizarre and largely irrelevant. For example, how can anyone seriously argue that it is in the public interest that a man of five feet seven inches be disqualified from joining the Garda force because of his height when a woman two inches smaller experiences no such difficulty? Men and women who wish to join the Garda should be treated <Col N="1127" /> equally and their recruitment should be based on their ability and capacity to be good members of the Garda force.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister for Justice would be here to explain why there are different height specifications which unfairly discriminate against men. Nevertheless, I am happy the Minister of State is present. Perhaps he will explain why it is essential and in the public interest that men are at least an extra four inches taller than women and why the Government insists on height requirements that have long since ceased to apply to police forces in most countries throughout the world?</P>
    <P>When this anomaly was brought to my attention it occurred to me that if this requirement was a prerequisite to a person's appointment as Minister for Justice, a number of the Minister's predecessors would not have been appointed and probably would have been disqualified from the parade ground for gardaí newly admitted to the force on the celebratory day when they are accompanied by their families.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The Minister has insight, from an internal perspective, into the workings of the Garda but he should not assume that forever more he will be a Member of this House.

      <P>The height differential between the sexes is permitted by section 5 of the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985, which amends section 17 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, to provide that orders, regulations, rules, directions, instructions, arrangements or schemes to which that section applies shall not treat men and women differently except, <i>inter alia,</i> as to requirements relating to height. Section 17B (2) (a) of the Act applies this provision to the Garda Síochána.</P>

The different height requirements for men and women in the Garda Síochána, which arise from the particular nature of the employment, are not contrary to equality law at present.</P>
    <P>The practical reality in the Garda Síochána is that, because of the nature of the employment, the requirement is that persons recruited should be of a minimum physical stature and physique to meet the day to day challenges which they encounter in the course of an ordinary day's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice could just as well be asked to consider raising the height requirement for women to the men's standard &mdash; I could also make the point that equal does not necessarily mean the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. The pig production sector on family run farms is in serious financial crisis. Since September 1992 producers in this sector have been making losses on every pig produced as a result of a highly adverse price ratio between pig <Col N="1130" /> and feed prices. For 1993 pigmeat prices per kilo were more than 13 per cent down on 1992 levels. Prices in 1993 were lower than they had been since 1985 and reached an absolute through in October 1993. During 1993 when pig prices fell by 13 per cent compared with the previous year, feed prices showed a decline of less than 1 per cent &mdash; the difference between those two reductions is the squeeze on pig producers' margins. For 1993 the pig price to feed price ratio was at its lowest level since 1985, falling from 6:2 in 1992 to 5:4 in 1993, reaching a trough of 5:1 in October-November 1993. Therefore, there is no prospect of any margin in those conditions.</P>
      <P>It is reckoned that in order for our pig output to be competitive with UK product, feed prices here would have to be £25 per tonne less than currently. As a result of those conditions huge numbers of family run units are on the verge of collapse. In recent months significant numbers have been bought out by what I would describe as the corporate sector. This is not a new phenomenon but is new in terms of the scale in the last few months. The owners have been forced to sell due to the crippling losses they have been incurring for quite some time.</P>
      <P>The Government could do a number of things in the short term to alleviate this problem and give some breathing space for medium to long term planning. In the first instance &mdash; this is directly within the control of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; the veterinary inspection fee of £1 per pig could be suspended for 1994. Second, family-run units of, say, up to 300 pigs &mdash; should be eligible for the small business subsidised loan scheme recently announced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. The scheme was originally announced by the Minister of State at that Department but some days later it was found that the details of the scheme had not been tied up and it was announced again by the Minister. This scheme, which is designed for small scale enterprises, would be of particular assistance to family-run pig units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the family-run pig production <Col N="1131" /> sector should be given the same tax status as the corporate sector. Without action of this kind the family-run sector will simply disappear from pig production. I should like the Minister to tell me his proposals for dealing with this problem. It is not as if he does not know what the problem is. Representatives of the sector have spoken to him and his colleagues in the Department on a number of occasions during the past year. So far they have received no reaction whatsoever. I should now like to know the measures the Minister proposes to take to give some breathing space to the family-run pig production sector for medium and long term planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, confirmed last month and as commentators are agreed, 1993 was a record year for farming. Pigmeat was the one sector which had a very difficult year due to depressed European markets.</P>
      <P>The pigmeat sector in Ireland and in other member states of the European Union has been the victim of its own success in increasing pig numbers and pigmeat production to the point of temporary overproduction. In so far as Ireland is concerned, increased production has to be exported either to markets within the European Union, or to third countries, with the help of export refunds.</P>
      <P>It is useful to remind ourselves of the progress in exports which has been made in recent years. Since 1988 export volumes have increased from 45,000 tonnes to over 100,000 tonnes, with corresponding export values of £70 million increasing to over £170 million. While these figures are impressive in themselves they reflect an industry which represents only 1 per cent of European Union production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first half of 1992 was a good period for Irish pig producers and for producers throughout the European Union. However, from the late summer onwards <Col N="1132" /> pig prices began to fall not only in Ireland but in other EU counties. There was a slight recovery in mid-1993 and again at Christmas. The period after Christmas is traditionally slack, and January this year has been no exception.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1993 the European Commission took a series of market support measures at the behest of member states, including Ireland. In March an aids to private storage scheme was introduced which removed 80,000 tonnes from the market. In May a special scheme of export refunds for the export of 30,000 tonnes to Eastern Europe was introduced and a further such scheme also involving 30,000 tonnes was introduced in September.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Union was faced with dealing with classical swine fever outbreaks in Germany and later in Belgium. This was done by the buying up at EU budget expense and the slaughter and removal from the market of substantial numbers of pigs &mdash; up to one million in Germany and half a million in Belgium. These measures all had positive effects on market prices.</P>
    <P>The continuing difficult market conditions have been the subject of discussions at EU Council level, most recently at the Agriculture Council in October and November 1993. In addition the Minister, Deputy Walsh, raised the need for the Commission to take additional measures at a bilateral meeting which took place at his request with Commissioner Steichen prior to the January meeting of the Agriculture Council. This was followed by a discussion on the subject at the Council. As a result, the Commission has introduced a further special scheme of export refunds for the export of 40,000 tonnes to Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>On this occasion I would like to thank publicly the Commission for bringing forward this measure which has already had a positive effect on European prices. However, I would stress the need for continuing Commission support in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The major modernisation and rationalisation plan for the pigmeat sector carried <Col N="1133" /> out in recent years with considerable national and European Assistance amounting to 75 per cent of the capital cost has resulted in a modern and highly competitive industry with the emphasis on value added products aimed largely at the export market.</P>
    <P>At the same time modernisation on the processing side has been at least matched by developments at production level where we now have very intensive specialist producers who have achieved an efficiency standard which compares very favourably with any other member state of the EU. Government commitment to the industry is clearcut. I refer Deputies to the <i>National Development Plan 1994-99</i> where policy for the development of the food industry is summarised and which provides for the continuing expansion of the pigmeat sector.</P>
    <P>All indications are that the market imbalance which has caused the recent difficulties will right itself later this year. In the meantime, the special sale to Eastern Europe is already having an effect on the EU market. I will be monitoring the situation closely so that the case of further action by the Commission, if necessary, will be put forward. When the cyclical upturn comes, I have no doubt that the Irish production and processing sectors, which as I have already said represent only 1 per cent of Union output, will be very well placed to avail of and profit by the increased opportunities arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a young 17-year-old girl who suffers from severe epileptic fits known as <i>petit mal</i> and <i>grand mal.</i> I do not think it is appropriate for me to read into the record of the House the medical circumstances of this girl or the personal circumstances of her family. In view of the fact that he is now fully aware of the very difficult <Col N="1134" /> circumstances which apply in this case and the long time her family has waited for the Department of Education and the Department of Health to make a decision in regard to this application, I appeal to the Minister to make available a grant of £30,000 to enable this young girl to attend St. Piers Lingfield Special School in England where she can receive beneficial treatment and benefit from the special facilities and techniques available.</P>
      <P>I find it very strange that this family, which has a very difficult time because of the poor health of this girl, has been left for so long without a decision being made by the Department of Health. I have in front of me letters dating back as far as March 1993 which state that the Minister for Education is looking into the matter. The delay in this case is extraordinary. All other treatment has failed and the facilities available at St. Piers Lingfield Special School would be of great benefit to this girl. Her family cannot possibly afford to pay the cost of keeping her at this school for the intended period of two years. It is believed by the experts, the doctors and the social workers, that she would benefit greatly from attending this school.</P>
      <P>This 17 year old girl has spent the last three years lying in bed all day with absolutely no future and it is believed these facilities would greatly help her if she could only gain admittance to the school. Her parents have asked me &mdash; I spoke to them a short time ago on the phone &mdash; to appeal to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health to approve this application and not to leave them in agony any longer.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this case, as is the Minister for Education, and it is receiving urgent attention in the Department. From the Deputy's contribution he is obviously aware that another Department is involved in this case and we hope to have the necessary information from it in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education responds to the special educational needs of children with disabilities by providing <Col N="1135" /> an extensive network of special schools and special classes in ordinary schools. Resources for the operation of these facilities are provided by the Department. As well as teachers, such children may require the support of medical, therapy and care personnel on a continuous basis and these are generally provided by the health authorities.</P>
    <P>The student in question is 17 years old and has been assessed as functioning within the range of mild learning difficulties. In addition she suffers from epilepsy. She attended a special school for a number of years and latterly attended a special class for pupils with mild mental handicap. Her difficult epilepsy created problems during the last few years and because of this medical condition her parents were obliged to withdraw her from the school.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the question of funding educational placement of a pupil outside the jurisdiction requires detailed consideration. In particular, it is necessary to establish that no <Col N="1136" /> suitable facility is available within the State which can meet the needs of this pupil, educationally and medically. This has necessitated detailed consultation between the Department and the relevant health authorities.</P>
    <P>As part of this process it is necessary to have regard to up-to-date medical and psychological assessments of the pupil's needs and to the adequacy of available support services in this jurisdiction to meet them. Information presented to the Department to date in these areas has not been sufficient to clarify these matters and further data is awaited from the health authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the additional information requested will be made available to the Department in the next day or so, and I assure the Deputy that upon receipt of this information the Department will act with all possible speed in deciding on this request.</P>
    <P>I will advise the Deputy of the outcome.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 February 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>I have advised the chairpersons of all county enterprise boards that they should proceed on the basis of a grant approval capacity of £500,000 which will be subject to review depending on performance. Furthermore, I have directed that my Department introduce a procedure aimed at ensuring that clearance procedures in relation to county enterprise fund grants/notifications of £10,000 or less will normally be completed within four working days of the application being received from the county enterprise board concerned. Larger grants, of between £10,000 and £50,000, will normally be cleared within ten working days of the application being received by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards approval procedures at county level, Deputies will understand that these are primarily a matter for the individual county enterprise boards and their evaluation committees. It is understandable that there may have been some problems in establishing this system in a way that will guarantee both the proper evaluation of projects, and the necessary speed of response. However, I understand that most boards are well on the way to achieving this, ensuring that the <Col N="876" /> county enterprise initiative is fully operational at all levels in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that at present, the county enterprise boards are operating on an interim basis, pending their establishment as independent legal entities. I am determined that this be achieved at the earliest possible date, following which it will be possible to devolve the grant approval process fully to the boards.</P>

      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has made inquiries in the matter and has found that traditionally Irish consumers, unlike most of their European counterparts, have tended to purchase higher grade petrol in the belief that their cars run better using premium grades. This tradition has extended to the newer unleaded petrols. Because of this smaller retail outlets, limited in the number of grades of fuel they can stock, have tended to sell the higher grades of petrol. This may have had more to do with consumer preference than with any attempt to force customers to pay higher prices.</P>
      <P>The director's inquiries indicate that this situation is changing with more Irish consumers moving towards the lower grade of petrol and that petrol companies have reacted by making the cheaper grade of unleaded petrol more widely available. The latest information available indicates that three out of four petrol stations nationwide are now stocking the lower grade unleaded petrol.</P>

      <P>I have already advised the INOU that direct funding is not available from my Department's Vote for the organisation and suggested that contact be made with the Ministers of State at the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance with a view to exploring ways in which those Departments might be able to provide funding. In this connection, I understand that the Minister for Social Welfare recently decided to allocate funding of £24,000 to the INOU to assist with the employment of a resource worker to co-ordinate the provision of advice and information to the unemployed. The organisation will, of course, be able to participate in the Community Employment Programme in respect of suitable projects.</P>

      <P>The job creation targets <Col N="882" /> for industry in the period 1994-1999 are set out in the National Development Plan. The plan, which sets out the Government's strategy for the deployment of the Structural Funds, states its central objective as follows: &ldquo;to ensure the best long term return to the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs&rdquo; (p7).</P>
      <P>The plan set out the following targets for job creation in industry:</P>
      <P>&mdash;an average of eleven thousand jobs per annum in indigenous firms, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;an average of nine thousand jobs per annum in overseas firms (both green field start ups and expansions).</P>
      <P>The overall target, therefore, is for the creation of one hundred and twenty thousand jobs in the period 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>As the Culliton report on industrial policy made clear, the performance of industry is dependent on a wide range of economic, infrastructural and institutional factors. The National Plan seeks to influence these positively within an Irish context in pursuit of its overall objective. However, as a small open economy, Ireland is also dependent on the broader international environment, and this factor must not be ignored when considering targets such as these.</P>
      <P>I would also recall to the House that job creation is only one aspect of industrial policy, albeit a most important one. Industrial policy also seeks to strengthen the competitive advantage of existing Irish firms through reduced costs, improved quality, more rapid product development and a greater level of innovation generally. In some cases the effects of such improvements will be to retain, rather than create jobs. Nevertheless, I am sure that Deputy Callely would agree that the maintenance of existing employment must be accorded a high degree of priority. The broader business focus created through combining the strengths of IDA and Eolas in Forbairt will assist in achieving this aim.</P>

      <P>It is difficult at this stage to quantify the likely overall impact on employment which the GATT deal will have on the textiles and clothing sectors. During the negotiations particular attention was paid to the sensitivity of these industries for Ireland. Our overall objective was to ensure that the gradual integration of the Multifibre Arrangements (MFA) into GATT would be linked to a strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines and a satisfactory outcome to the market access package. This has largely been achieved. It is hoped therefore that any job losses which might arise will be kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>The gradual 10 year integration of the MFA into GATT which is expected to commence in 1995, will allow the textiles and clothing industries sufficient time to restructure and reposition in order to concentrate on the higher quality segment of the market.</P>
      <P>Competitiveness is the key issue facing these sectors and the House is already aware that in August 1993 I announced that a sum of up to £5 million would be made available to fund two special initiatives designed to help companies in the clothing industry to become more competitive. They are</P>
      <P>(i) a research and development scheme which operates under the existing R and D programmes run by the industrial development state agencies and</P>
      <P>(ii) a FÁS training support scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition a number of measures such as the reduced Employers' PRSI, removal of levies and widening of the <Col N="884" /> tax band have been announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The combination of these special schemes and the budget provisions should provide the necessary impetus for the maintenance of employment and indeed the future development of both sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral Questions Nos. 57 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>An independent survey of motor insurance claims closed in 1992 showed that 65 per cent of the claims were in respect of property damage and 35 per cent related to personal injury. However, the survey also revealed that the cost of personal injury claims accounted for 66 per cent of the total cost of claims in 1992. Property damage claims represented only 13 per cent of the costs and the balance of 21 per cent was made up of legal and associated costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The results of the survey, therefore, underline the need to address the issue of the high cost of personal injury compensation claims in this country. In this regard it has been further established from an analysis of personal injury awards by the High Court that the pain and suffering element of these awards constitutes 75 per cent of their total cost.</P>
    <P>As I have previously informed the House, my Department is currently examining ways and means by which the pain and suffering element of personal injury claims might be reduced and I hope to have proposals brought before Government by the summer. As the implementation of any such proposals might involve legislation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in advance of consideration by the Government of whatever proposals emerge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, the Commissioner indicated that the member states of the European Union would need to create at least 20 million jobs in order to achieve a target of 5 per cent unemployment in the Union by the year 2000. In this regard, he outlined a number of suggestions and ideas for change including: greater income moderation for those at work; strengthening efforts to re-integrate <Col N="890" /> the long term unemployed; looking at the organisation of working time; strengthening employment prospects for women; greater labour market flexibility; strengthening the role of local development.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of these ideas and suggestions are very much in line with our own employment policies and programmes.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner's speech was, in my view, a very valuable and constructive contribution to the on-going debate in Europe and indeed around the world in relation to the employment-unemployment situation which, at long last, is at the top of the international agenda.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 19 October 1993 from Deputy Cox in which I provided a full list of the members of the County Enterprise Boards and the organizations which they represent.</P>
      <P>In May 1993, the Government agreed that city and county managers should be charged with the key task of identifying and nominating a panel of local decision makers who might serve as members of the boards. These panels comprised 14 members including up to four elected members of the local authority, representatives of the social partners at local level (IBEC, ICTU and farming organisations) identified by the relevant national organisations, and officers of relevant State development agencies (e.g. Forbairt, FÁS) together with community interests drawn from the voluntary sector (e.g. Chambers of Commerce, Leader Groups, <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Partnership Companies and individual entrepreneurs).</P>
      <P>In addition, specialist evaluation committees have been established to assist each board and to make recommendations on the most appropriate level and form of assistance for projects, having regard in particular to the prospects for attracting other sources of funding. These evaluation committees include persons with banking and accounting expertise and experience in assessing the quality, local relevance and cost-effectiveness of project proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> Furthermore it is a matter for each board to make recommendations regarding the need to co-opt new members. It is also likely that the boards will be giving attention shortly to the organization and management of their work programme by means of sub-committees which may provide an opportunity for co-opting persons with special areas of expertise.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the members of the County Enterprise Boards have the right mix of skills and experience to enable the boards to achieve their objectives, which are to focus, develop and support local entrepreneurship and enterprise within the framework of a coherent, integrated county enterprise action plan so as to build a local economy of real strength and permanence which will give jobs and wealth sufficient to its needs.</P>

      <P>The ERL report was commissioned by the Department of the <Col N="893" /> Environment as an input to the preparation of a national strategy for recycling which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals for the establishment of a de-inking plant under consideration by the industrial development agencies. The establishment of such a facility may be considered in the context of a recycling strategy rather than as a commercially viable proposition. In this connection I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the response of the Minister for the Environment to Questions Nos. 21 and 91 on 20 October 1993 in which he indicated that a recycling strategy under preparation in his Department would address all major issues related to the promotion of recycling in Ireland.</P>

Other outstanding issues relevant to the Deputy's question include reviewing the system of taxation and rules on court costs, the matter of joint legal education and training, greater mobility between the two branches of the profession and the appointment of solicitors as judges.</P>

      <P>The Government's position on the continuing war in Bosnia was set out in my reply to Questions on 27 January. I also outlined the broad considerations which govern our approach to the use of air-power in Tuzla and elsewhere in Bosnia.</P>
      <P>The UN Secretary-General has now outlined his approach on the reopening of Tuzla airport and on the rotation of the UNPROFOR contingents in Srebrenica and Zepa. He wishes to achieve these objectives through negotiations and with the consent of the parties. Should this consent not be forthcoming the objectives will be pursued by UNPROFOR supported, if necessary, by air-power. If military force is used against UNPROFOR, the Secretary-General will revert to the Security Council and seek its authorisation for additional troops and equipment which would be necessary to achieve the objectives.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Secretary-General's approach is both prudent and measured. The prospects for the rotation of the troop contingents have improved in recent days. An advance party of Dutch troops has recently entered Srebrenica and Zepa without opposition. The Secretary-General hopes that the troop rotation can be completed before the end of February. Negotiations on the reopening of Tuzla are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I utterly condemn the ruthless and barbaric acts of violence against the population of Sarajevo which has continued <Col N="898" /> for almost two years. These actions, for which no justifications can be offered, and none accepted, are designed to kill, maim and demoralise the civilian population of a beleaguered city in the heart of Europe.</P>
    <P>The international relief organisations have indicated that it is very difficult to calculate precisely the number of people who have been killed in Sarajevo. But the systematic and callous onslaught directed against Sarajevo's population by heavy weapons, mortars and also by snipers' bullets, has clearly been at enormous cost to that city's population. I am aware that Bosnian Government sources estimate that 10,500 people have been killed, and perhaps 58,000, wounded in Sarajevo.</P>
    <P>The death and suffering which has been inflicted on Sarajevo was, once more, graphically highlighted by the barbaric killings in the central market on 5 February. This left 68 people dead and scores more maimed and seriously injured.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for this attack has not yet been determined by the United. Nations. But the UN Secretary General has concluded that the continued mortar attacks against civilian targets in Sarajevo, at least one of which has been established by the UN to be the work of Bosnian Serb forces, make it necessary to prepare urgently for the use of air strikes to deter further such attacks. He has therefore asked the Secretary General of NATO to obtain at the earliest possible date a decision by the North Atlantic Council to authorise the Commander in Chief of NATO Southern Command to launch air strikes, at the request of the UN, against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo which are determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets in that city.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers of the European Union meeting in Brussels yesterday condemned the recent brutal shelling of civilians in Sarajevo. In the light of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the request of the Secretary General it supported an early meeting of the North Atlantic Council <Col N="899" /> to consider measures to bring about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. I understand that such a meeting is to take place shortly.</P>
    <P>I hope that even at that late stage the parties to the conflict, in particular the Bosnian Serbs, will realise the futility of continuing the war, and that they will return to the negotiations on Thursday determined to find a negotiated solution.</P>

    <P>The 1994 estimates do not show any significant increase, due to the fact that no cost change is expected in the majority of posts concerned. The 1994 pay estimate for this Department was, of course, prepared in advance of the new pay agreement for the civil and public service.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>This year's budget provides for a 3 per cent increase in all weekly social welfare and health board payments with effect from July. In addition a further 3 per cent increase will be given to all short term weekly payments (i.e. 6 per cent in all), to bring them up to the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates. The personal rates of disability beefit, unemployment benefit and injury benefit are being given a further special increase of £2.10 per week. Improvements in child benefit were also provided viz. the higher rate of £23 will be increased to £25 and in addition is being applied to the third and subsequent children from September.</P>
      <P>The cost of these measures is over £57 million this year and almost £122 million in a full year. It is estimated that it would cost approximately an additional £45 million to bring forward the 1994 rates increases to April.</P>
      <P>The rates increases for old age pensioners will cost £12.45 million in 1994 and approximately £30 million in a full year. To bring forward the increases from the end of July to 1 February would cost approximately an additional £13.5 million.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly in the pension scheme for self-employed whereby people who were older than 56 years when this scheme was made compulsory do not qualify for benefits in view of the fact that they will not have been contributing for ten years before reaching 66 years of age, that is, anyone born before 1932 will not qualify; the steps, if any, he will take to allow such people to qualify; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has <Col N="907" /> been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to the pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career. This condition applies to self employed people in the same way as it applies to all insured people. Self employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not, therefore, qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are, however, insured for widows' and orphans pensions.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension. Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered social insurance less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Costings made in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the group of people concerned. The additional contribution which would need to be paid by self employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has benefited from the Irish/Canadian Agreement. She has been awarded free electricity, free television licence and free telephone rental allowances. She also holds a free travel pass. Her application to my Department for a fuel allowance was disallowed recently as her means, based upon the Canadian pension income, exceeded the maximum limit for entitlement to this allowance.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for a living alone allowance, a person has first to be qualified for a relevant Irish pension. Under the provisions of the Irish-Canadian Bilateral Social Security Agreement, a person resident in Ireland can be entitled to a pro-rata Irish contributory old age pension based upon Canadian social security contributions and-or periods of residence in Canada after reaching age 18. The person must also have at least 52 weeks of social insurance contributions paid in Ireland since 1953.</P>
      <P>People over age 66 who qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> Irish contributory pension under the Agreement will also qualify for a living alone allowance if they are residing alone. An application for a contributory pension has not been received from the person concerned. My Department will however write to her to determine if she meets the contributory pension conditions.</P>
      <P>As soon as inquiries have been completed, she will be notified of the outcome without delay. Her entitlement to a living alone allowance in addition to any Irish pension will be determined then also.</P>

      <P>The Government provided for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7. The necessary provisions are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 which came into force in June 1992, These regulations entitle married women affected by the delay in implementing the Directive to the higher personal rate of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit and to the extended duration of unemployment benefit. The regulations also entitle married women to dependency increases in the form of a household supplement and to unemployment assistance. There is no provision in the regulations for the payment of the alleviating payments. The legislation provided for the payment of arrears on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Claimants with potential entitlement <Col N="910" /> to arrears were identified from my Department's records and were issued with claim forms in mid-1992. A total of 70,500 claimants were entitled to payment. All arrears due were paid in 1992 and 1993. The final phase of arrears was not due to be paid until 1994. However, as the Deputy will be aware I made special arrangements for the arrears due under this phase to be paid before Christmas 1993. A small number of claims are still being received and these continue to be processed.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the retrospective legislation legal proceedings, which are being defended by my Department, have been initiated in about 60 cases involving some 5,000 individual plaintiffs. The number of women involved in these proceedings resident in Kilkenny and Carlow is not known.</P>

The proposal has been pursued within the context of the restructuring of the industrial development agencies and the creation of the new bodies, Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland, which commenced operations on 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>Forfás has been assigned specific responsibility for policy advice and co-ordination and will, through its members, constitute the advisory board in industrial policy. The membership of the Forfás board is given below.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Culliton report are set out in full in the report itself which was published in January 1992 under the title &ldquo;A Time for Change &mdash; Industrial Policy for the 1990's&rdquo;. The implementation of these recommendations was the subject of consideration by the task force established by the Government under the chairmanship of Dr. Patrick Moriarity. The response of the Government to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report was published in &ldquo;Employment Through Enterprise&rdquo; (Pl. 9763) in May 1993.</P>
      <P>Over 100 separate recommendations are dealt with in &ldquo;Employment Through Enterprise&rdquo; and it would not be practicable to describe in this reply the progress which has been made in relation to each of them. My Department is monitoring the position closely and I am satisfied that considerable progress had been made in the period since last May, including in relation to the formulation and implementation of industrial policy, the restructuring of the industrial promotion agencies, taxation policy, the environment and competition policy.</P>
      <P>I am in touch with the other Government Departments involved and it is also my intention to publish a full account later this year of the progress made in respect of each recommendation.</P>

      <P>In the case of companies approved for assistance by IDA and SFADCo, the two industrial promotion agencies under the control of my Department in 1993, job creation targets are normally scheduled over a number of years, in line with the projected patterns of growth and development in the companies concerned.</P>
      <P>While there were many IDA and SFADCo assisted projects during 1993, which were not the subject of public announcements, projects with a total potential of 6,965 new jobs were publicly announced by myself and-or the industrial promotion agencies during the year. These new jobs will be created over a number of years, in accordance with agreed targets. According to IDA's and SFADCo's Annual Employment Surveys for 1993, a total of 17,091 jobs were actually created during 1993. These jobs arose from projects approved in 1993 and in previous years.</P>

The special arrangements under sections 44 and 45 of the Local Government Act, 1991, apply in circumstances where a planning authority either wishes to depart, exceptionally in relation to a particular development, from the terms of the development plan, or wishes to direct the manager to grant permission for a particular development for which permission would otherwise be unlikely to be granted.</P>

The allocations for the remedial works scheme in 1994 are under consideration and they will be notified to local authorities as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that Irish certified marine engineers continue to be accepted for work on Canadian registered vessels.</P>
      <P>At present, any person who wishes to work on a Canadian registered vessel must be a Canadian citizen, or a landed immigrant in Canada, and hold a Canadian marine engineer certificate. Holders of Irish and certain other foreign marine engineer certificates may currently have their original certificates exchanged for Canadian certificates following a five day marine emergency duties training course in Canada.</P>
      <P>Inquiries made of the Canadian authorities, through diplomatic channels, confirm that the introduction of an additional examination requirement in such cases is being proposed. The Department has requested formal clarification of the nature, extent and time-frame of the proposed changes in order to assess their implications for Irish certified marine engineers with a view to addressing the concerns raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>A range of preventive and contingency measures to minimise the possibility of a major marine pollution incident in Dublin Bay and environs are in place and are kept under continuous review.</P>
      <P>Monitoring, inspection and traffic management systems are operated by the Dublin Port authorities for ships carrying dangerous or polluting cargoes. The objective of these preventive measures which are in line with current international standards is to minimise the risk of pollution from traffic operating into and out of the Dublin Port area. Initiatives under way at EU level to develop enhanced management and reporting systems for such traffic as well as for transiting vessels will, when finalised further enhance our ability to minimise the threat of such pollution incidents in the first place.</P>
      <P>Contingency planning, in the event of a major marine pollution incident, has been developed for the Dublin Bay area under the aegis of the Irish Marine Emergency Service of the Department. IMES is responsible for the direction and co-ordination of marine pollution response and oversees the development and exercising of major marine emergency contingency plans by port and local authorities together with other relevant agencies. A wide ranging training programme for local and port authority pollution personnel is also ongoing under the direction of IMES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the present arrangements ensure that there is a capability to prevent and respond to major <Col N="939" /> marine pollution incidents in Dublin Bay, prevention and emergency planning in this area will continue to be kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>As outlined in reply to a parliamentary question on 27 October 1993, the building, the property of Teagasc, was too big for that organisation's requirements. Accordingly Teagasc placed it on the property market. I pointed out also in the reply that the disposal of assets surplus to requirements is essential in order to ensure that Teagasc operate in a cost effective manner. In common with all public bodies. Teagasc must ensure that the sale of assets realises the market value. The sale of the building in question was recently completed.</P>

    <P>EU regulations preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium scheme before 1 November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances. Disadvantaged areas headage payments other than for sheep are normally on the basis of advances. It is estimated that the total value of the 1993 headage, deseasonalisation slaughter premium, suckler cow premium (June-July) and special beef premium (January-February and June-July) schemes is of the order of £220 million.</P>
    <P>Payment of the balances in respect of the disadvantaged areas headage schemes will commence shortly. Payment of the balances in respect of the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him/her in the course of 1993 have been processed. This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March. Payment of extensification premium is expected to commence in April.</P>
    <P>A large number of unpaid special beef premium cases involved various problems such as incorrect tags, no cards or incorrect cards, no herd number, incomplete application forms etc. It had been necessary to write to 40,000 individual farmers in order to process the cases for payment. In many cases there had been a long delay in getting responses from farmers to the queries raised.</P>

      <P>During 1992 a geographically-based national survey, which will run over several years, was initiated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII). Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above the 200 Bq/m3 reference level in each national grid square to be predicted.</P>
      <P>In early 1993, randon detectors were sent to 142 householders in County Donegal, south of a line between Glenties and Ballybofey. A further 411 households in other parts of the county have recently responded to an invitation from the RPII to participate in the survey and radon detectors are presently being issued to these homes. All measurements are for a 12 month period and, once completed, will identify any areas at particular risk from indoor radon.</P>

      <P>The Farm Electrification Grants Scheme (FEGS) was introduced in 1990 to subsidise the cost of installation of electricity supply to farms, in disadvantaged areas, without supply or with inadequate supply. The scheme is a carry-over of the EC Funded FEOGA Western Package which was discontinued due to exhaustion of its financial allocation.</P>
      <P>The present scheme is wholly State funded. ESB and the Department contribute 60 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, of the total costs of connection, leaving 20 per cent of the costs to be borne by the applicant.</P>

In 1988 and 1992, under the auspices of this Department, the then Minister published comprehensive assessments of scientific research on electromagnetic fields and on the positions being taken by other Governments and international health advisory organisations.</P>

    <P>These reports, which are available <Col N="980" /> from the Government Publications Office, demonstrate that there is, as yet, no widespread agreement among research workers that electromagnetic fields from powerlines present a potential hazard to the health of people or animals.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the ESB is committed to designing and operating its networks in accordance with the most up-to-date recommendations and guidelines of the various expert and independent international bodies in this area, such as the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to the switching of high voltage power lines from overhead to underground. This is a matter for decision by the ESB in consultation with the appropriate Planning Authorities. I am advised, however, that underground cables are up to 10 times more costly then overhead lines, and are only considered to be a viable option in densely populated urban areas.</P>

      <P>The outturn in respect of the three persons concerned was £77,475.08.</P>
      <P>The projected expenditure for 1994 is £94,139.08.</P>
      <P>The difference between the 1993 projection and the actual outturn was mainly due to the fact that one of the persons concerned took up duty several months later than expected.</P>

The studies referred to have been noted. However, research in this area is on-going internationally, and the general body of evidence to date has not established a causal relationship between this <Col N="996" /> form of radiation and cancer. The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, has also pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power lines in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.</P>

      <P>The General Register Office fulfils a very important and legally sensitive public function. It's relocation from Dublin will represent a major change which needs to be planned for in some detail. In considering such a change, there was an onus on my Department to examine all of the implications with a view to minimising any disruption of service to the public and the costs associated with the move.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department carried out a detailed analysis of the implications of eight separate options effecting the relocation of the General Register Office. The analysis took into account factors such as the impact on service to the public, the need for legislative change, staffing, cost, timescale and so on.</P>
      <P>In the course of this exercise, it became clear that the extent to which the registration system can be computerised is a significant factor, particularly in ensuring an adequate and efficient service to users of the registration system. Following a feasibility study, the initial steps in computerising the system are now being taken. My Department has also commissioned a review of the overall operation of the registration system, again with a view to ensuring an adequate and efficient service to users of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is to be expected that there would be a range of age and ability among pupils in special schools, as is the case in ordinary schools. The extent of that range would depend largely on the enrolment and staffing in each school. As a general rule, the smaller the number of pupils, the smaller the teaching staff and, consequently, the wider the range of age and ability in individual cases. In those circumstances, school authorities would be expected to adapt the curriculum and develop strategies to suit the needs of their particular pupils.</P>
      <P>The placement of children with special educational needs should be based on the assessed needs of each child. Such placement should also take account of the range of services available, professional advice and the preference of parents.</P>

    <P>The capitation grant for voluntary secondary schools has remained static since 1990. This year the capitation grant provision is being increased by nearly £2.8 million which represents an increase of 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increased provision will be distributed with particular emphasis on disadvantaged schools. The details of the disbursement are being finalised and I will be making an announcement on the matter shortly.

      <P>As you are aware, in the recent Green Paper &ldquo;Education for a Changing World&rdquo;, there was a strong reference to the need to promote the development of critical thinking and problem-solving <Col N="1011" /> abilities in pupils. Teachers need to keep this actively in mind in their work. Many of the activities and strategies recommended in various systematized programmes used elsewhere are in fact in use in many areas of the curriculum in our schools. They are generally used incidentally and informally to teach concepts, skills and attitudes implicit in the curriculum. The development of pupils' cognitive abilities is already a key aim of the primary school curriculum, not merely with pupils between the ages of nine and 11 years, but right through the entire 8-year cycle of primary education and beyond. It is felt that the development of pupils' ability can best be promoted through the medium of the normal curriculum rather than through introducing a new curriculum area of course.</P>
      <P>The primary curriculum is at present under review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. It has established expert course committees representative of all primary education interests to look at the various areas of the curriculum including those aspects which develop the ability of children to think critically and creatively. In that context I do not think that it would be appropriate to establish the task force referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>There is a close liaison between my Department and the Department of Health in order to support schools in the introduction of educational programmes on substance abuse. These programmes deal with abuse of all drugs, including alcohol. All schools, both primary and post-primary, and third level colleges, have been provided with information on the dangers of substance abuse to assist in countering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major pilot project on substance abuse has taken place over the past two years focused on post-primary schools. This project was carried out in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre, Clonliffe Road, Dublin and with support from the European Union. The outcome of this project, including educational resource materials, will be disseminated <Col N="1013" /> to all post-primary schools during the current school year. A related programme of inservice training for teachers has begun this year.</P>
    <P>My Department co-operates as well with the regional health boards and with voluntary agencies such as youth organisations and parent groups in initiatives aimed at alerting young people to the dangers of substance abuse. In all projects undertaken, schools and teachers are advised to consult with parents and to inform them of the educational activities in schools.</P>

      <P>Teachers may avail of compassionate leave, subject to the approval of the board of management, in the case of the death of a member of their immediate family, a near relative or in-law. Leave is also sanctioned in the case of a teacher who is tending to a seriously ill member of the immediate family or in-law or to accompany an immediate family member or relative to hospital for a serious operation or treatment.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases the absence is for a short period of from one to five days and it is the responsibility of the school authorities to arrange classes so that the pupils of the absent teacher receive instruction.</P>
      <P>My Department recognises that this arrangement would be unworkable in a one-teacher national school; accordingly, paid substitution is provided in such cases. The provision of paid substitution in the case of all absences on compassionate grounds would have serious financial implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessary correlation in the performance of candidates across a range of subjects. There are some related curricular areas in which a reasonable correlation can be expected that is in the mathematics and the exact sciences on the one hand or in languages on the other. However, in an examination like the leaving certificate which involves a cohort of more than 60,000 candidates the likelihood of correlations is remote because of different participation rates and the ability and attainment levels of candidates attempting various subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might appear, at first sight, that some subjects are marked more leniently or more harshly than others. There are indeed some subjects, like Italian, where the number of A grades is high when expressed as a percentage of the candidates taking Italian. However, the fact that Italian is taken by only a small number of candidates means that their examination performance is not at all likely to correspond to a representative norm. Some subjects with low participation rates, for example applied mathematics, have traditionally attracted the very brightest of candidates <Col N="1019" /> and, consequently, have yielded a disproportionate number of high grades. It would be wrong to conclude that the large proportion of A and B grades in a subject such as applied mathematics is proof that it is a soft option subject. It would be quite inappropriate and unjust to make the spread of grades in applied mathematics conform to that of a high participation subject like French.</P>
    <P>The standards applied in the leaving certificate have evolved over the years. It must be stated that the leaving certificate, using the standards thus evolved, enjoys high credibility and acceptability particularly in our schools.</P>
    <P>Supervision and moderation of each paper continues for the duration of the marking process under the guidance of <Col N="1020" /> the chief examiner who has an overview of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that greatest care is taken to ensure that the results of the leaving certificate are a fair reflection of the quality of performance across the various subjects.</P>
