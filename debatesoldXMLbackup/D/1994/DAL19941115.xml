      <P>Before calling on the Taoiseach to move a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders under Standing Order 143(2), there are two matters to which the House wishes to address itself.  First, I call on the Taoiseach to move a vote of condolence in respect of a former colleague, the late Willie O'Brien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret that, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I express sympathy to the family of the late Willie O'Brien, former Fine Gael Deputy.  I now hand over to Deputy John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, to lead the messages of condolence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for graciously inviting me to speak on this subject.  It is a matter of deep regret to his friends on all sides of the House that former Deputy Willie O'Brien has passed away.  Those of who knew Willie O'Brien well &mdash; there are many in this House who did &mdash; will remember his infectious sense of humour, his sense of fun, his sense of a good practical joke, his sense of making light of conflict and his ability to defuse a difficult situation &mdash; this obviously applied particularly in the party to which he belonged because of course difficult situations never occur in the Dáil.  He was able to defuse difficult situations within the party &mdash; there are of course many in every party &mdash; with a humorous remark which brought matters back to their true proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Willie O'Brien was a loyal and loving <Col N="3" /> husband and father to his family.  He was a person who put the welfare of his constituents in west Limerick before his own personal convenience and he was willing to be available to help them in any way possible.  He obviously had a particular loyalty to his native village of Patrickswell.  At his beautiful funeral ceremony I was very struck by the way in which the parish priest, on behalf of the people, recalled the work he had done for his specific immediate locality around Patrickswell in west Limerick.</P>
    <P>There was a serious and broader national side to the work of Willie O'Brien.  He was, as many people in the House will recall, chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  He enjoyed a very happy and united family life, but in that capacity he showed great understanding and sympathy for those who did not have the same happy experience he had in marriage.  He worked, in times that were perhaps more difficult than they are now, for the promotion of reforming legislation in the area of marriage breakdown.  He worked for consensus for change in this area.  He understood the need for change.  Parties on all sides made a very constructive contribution &mdash; the then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, notably did also &mdash; to the committee which he chaired.</P>
    <P>Willie O'Brien worked to achieve a consensus for change and that was a fitting reminder of his approach to politics. He used his many skills, personal as well as intellectual &mdash; his humour and sense of fun &mdash; everything he had to contribute to promote consensus for change in this important area.  His passing will be deeply mourned by people on all sides of the House.  On behalf of his close colleagues and friends in Fine Gael, I wish to convey to his wife and three daughters our deepest sympathy on this terrible and irreplaceable loss for their family, Patrickswell, west Limerick and Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about the late Willie O'Brien, <Col N="4" /> former Fine Gael Deputy.  I offer my deepest and most sincere sympathy to his wife, Phil, and his three daughters.  It would be hard to improve on the tribute already written about him by Deputy Michael Noonan.  He described a man who was obviously a very good friend, a good humoured man with a very keen mind although he had little formal education, a man who always had his feet on the ground and served his constituents exceptionally well as a county councillor in the early 1960s, as a Senator in the late 1960s, as a Dáil Deputy in the late 1970s and as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It is very interesting to read the contributions at that committee under his chairmanship and note the pragmatism, commonsense and sincerity of all contributions.  Willie O'Brien was, in short, a real gentleman, the salt of the earth.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I extend our sympathy to his family, his many friends in Limerick and throughout the country and to his colleagues in the Fine Gael party.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar an anam Dilis.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my Labour Party colleagues, I extend our deepest sympathy to the family of the late Willie O'Brien whom I knew very well.  He was a humble and self-effacing man who had a tremendous sense of humour as Deputy Bruton said.  Many of the qualities attributed to him by Deputy Bruton might be useful in this House at this time.  He approached his work with a sense of duty and obligation. He was a firm and solid representative of the people of Limerick West both as a county councillor, Senator and Member of Dáil Éireann.  He was a man from whose experience in public life many of us could have learned much.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I extend our sympathy to his wife and three daughters and his colleagues in Fine Gael, both at local level in Limerick West and at national level.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  I extend our sympathy to the widow and three daughters of the late Willie O'Brien and also to the Fine Gael Party.  I served on the allparty committee on marriage breakdown chaired by him.  I concur with the remarks made that he was a fine chairperson. It was a difficult committee. Many people held strong views on marriage breakdown yet, we had a chairperson who sought to reconcile those differences and accommodate all points of view.  As Deputy Bruton said, he was held in affection by Members on all sides of the House and was well respected and trusted.  He was an honourable politician, a decent man and will be sadly missed by everyone in politics but especially by his wife and family with whom we sympathise today.</P>

      <P>I join with the other party leaders in conveying my sympathy to the wife and family of the late Willie O'Brien and also to his party colleagues.  I only had a brief acquaintance with him but in that brief acquaintance I knew him to be a decent and honourable public representative who served his party and constituents well.  I wish to convey my sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>I did not know the late Willie O'Brien but the family of somebody of his standing deserves our sympathy.  On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I extend our sympathy to them, to his friends and to Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the successor of the late Willie O'Brien in Limerick West.  As everybody knows, Willie gave a lifetime to politics both at council and national level.  The sentiments expressed today encapulsate the man.  He was an example of what a good public representative should be.  It did not matter <Col N="6" /> to what strand of society one belonged all people were welcomed by the late Willie O'Brien.  He was an honest, genuine and caring person and I join with others in extending my sympathy to his wife, Phil, and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and other Members of the House in this expression of sympathy to Mrs. O'Brien and her family on the death of Willie.  I worked with him both at local level and in this House during his political career and I found him to be a person who held strong views and was always in touch with the community he represented so well.  Nobody has mentioned that he was a great GAA man and a great hurling fan, as he should have been coming from Patrickswell.  He genuinely gave a top class service to the people he represented and was always prepared to sit with his constituency colleagues to further a particular cause.  When he retired from public life he was a great loss to County Limerick and his political party.  Mar a dúirt Tomás Ó Criomhthain in &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo;, ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.</P>

    <P>The Clerk of the Dáil made the following announcement:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> I gcomhlíonadh Bhuan-Ordú céad daichead a haon de na Buan-Orduithe i dtaobh Gnó Phoiblí, tá orm a chraoladh go ndearnadh, sna Corrthoghcháin a bhí ann an deichiú lá de Shamhain, míle naoi gcéad nócha a ceathair, de chionn an Teachta Gearóid Ó Súilleabháin d'fháil bháis agus an Teachta Pádraig Mac Coiligh d'éirí as, na comhaltaí seo a leanas a thoghadh don Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In compliance with Standing Order 141 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, I have to announce that at the by-elections held on 10 November 1994, consequent on the death of Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan and the resignation of Deputy Pat Cox, the following Members have been elected to the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dáilcheantar Chorcaí Thuaidh-Lár, Constituency of Cork North-Central &mdash; Kathleen Lynch</P>
    <P>Dáilcheantar Chorcaí Theas-Lár, Constituency of Cork South-Central &mdash;Hugh Coveney.</P>
    <P>Tá Rolla na gComhaltaí sínithe ag an dá Theachta de réir Bhuan-Ordú a hAon.  Both Deputies have signed the Roll of Members in accordance with Standing Order 1. </P>
    <P>Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the new Member for Cork North-Central was introduced to the Ceann Comhairle by Deputy Pat Rabbitte</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Coveney, the new Member for Cork South-Central was introduced to the Ceann Comhairle by Deputy Enda Kenny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I move the suspension of Standing Orders I take this opportunity on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government to welcome and extend a fíor fáilte to Deputy Coveney on his return to the Dáil after a lapse of some years.  I have known Hugh Coveney for a long time and he has always been a very positive thinker <Col N="8" /> who takes a practical approach to problems.</P>
      <P>Kathleen Lynch has been elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time.  She has worked long and hard over many years to earn her place in this House.  This woman, very conscientiously, applied herself to the tasks on the ground.  She has taken up specific issues during the years and followed them through relentlessly. She has gained her reward for her dedication to politics and to serving the interests of the people in Cork South Central &mdash; whom she serves at local level &mdash; and Cork North Central whom she now represents in this House.</P>
      <P>The record of both these Deputies shows all the hard work, which is not always recognised, that goes into politics. For those committed to public service, it is an ever demanding life which demands more and more from us on behalf of constituents.  We recognise that the electorate is becoming more volatile, nevertheless that is the challenge for all of us in politics.  It is our duty to do what these two new TDs have done and take up that challenge. It will be a poor day for this country if we do not get fine candidates, such as the newly elected Members, to put their names forward and take up the challenge of working for people at local and national level.</P>
      <P>I wish Hugh Coveney success on his return to the Dáil and Kathleen Lynch on her election for the first time, I hope they have a long stay.</P>

I also look forward to working constructively with her on behalf of the people of Cork.  She has served on Cork Corporation and there is a very important job to be done on behalf of the people of Cork.

It has to be said that the voters of Cork have chosen very well indeed because they have elected two TDs of the highest calibre.  It is a matter of particular pride that in my constituency of Cork North Central we now have a second woman Deputy which must mark Cork North Central as one of the most progressive constituencies in Cork city and county.</P>

      <P>The election of Deputy Lynch in Cork North Central is a mixed blessing because I was not unhappy that she moved from Cork South Central to contest the by-election in Cork North Central. In the context of the difficult roads and streets we had to travel and the doors we had to knock on during the by-election campaign, I can only echo the sentiments expressed earlier that their stay in Leinster House will indeed be a long one.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the return of Deputy Coveney and the election of Deputy <Col N="11" /> Lynch to this House.  Deputy Lynch misquoted me on a number of occasions during her European Elections campaign, but I am delighted to see her in Dáil Éireann and she will certainly be an addition to her party ranks and to Parliament.</P>
      <P>Those who came into contact with Deputy Coveney on subcommittees of the House and in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party when he previously served in this House will agree when I say that he is one of the most constructive and positive people who has ever been elected and the contribution he makes can only be for the good of the country and Parliament.  He is an excellent representative and I am delighted to have him as a colleague in the party, in the constituency representing Cork city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In paragraph (6) after &ldquo;30 minutes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;that Fine Gael Private Members Time be taken at 7 p.m. to allow a motion &mdash; on the Taoiseach's operation of his Office in regard to the appointment of the President of the High Court and the new Attorney General and the delay in the Attorney General's Office concerning the Brendan Smyth case &mdash; to be debated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that a substantive motion be taken on this matter.  The only way the Dáil can express an opinion about a matter is by means of a substantive motion.  We are not, however, pressing that the vote on that motion be taken tonight.  We will be quite happy to allow any reasonable <Col N="13" /> length of time to elapse, after the explanations that have been offered, for Members to consider the issue before the vote is taken but we believe it is essential, from the point of view of public accountability for the actions of Members of this House &mdash; actions that might lead to bringing down a Government or a Dáil &mdash; that those decisions should also be accountable for publicly. The only way that Members of the Dáil can be publicly accountable for their decisions is by allowing them to vote in the division lobbies.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government, therefore, to agree to allow us initiate this motion in Private Members' Time.  I will be quite happy, however, to enter into discussions with the Government and other Whips to agree to a timing for taking this motion.  We understand that Members will want to consider the Taoiseach's explanations after some time and we would not wish to press for a division on the issue until people have had adequate time to consider it.  We believe strongly, however, that a substantive motion must be taken at some stage on this issue because that is the only way members are accountable for our decisions about the Taoiseach's explanations.  Otherwise, it is a decision being taken in an upper room where there is not any public accountability &mdash; which there should be &mdash; in a matter of this importance.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to agree to my proposal, subject to discussion between the Whips, to determine when a vote might be taken.  I would be quite happy to have that vote tomorrow or after any delay that is reasonable from the point of view of Members on all sides of the House who, when they have heard the explanations, may also want time to think.  We would not object to a delay in taking the division but there must be a motion at an early date on this issue, otherwise the Dáil does not take a decision.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's proposal in relation to this matter.  It is an issue of extraordinary <Col N="14" /> importance to this House and the public, which cannot be allowed to drag on for much longer.  It is also necessary that this House is enabled to express its views in a clear and unequivocal way in relation to the matters we will be discussing for the next number of hours.  I urge the Taoiseach to accept the proposal and for the Whips to then discuss the point at which a vote may be taken on the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We too support the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton. We believe it is important, if we are to have public accountability, that this House, the directly elected assembly, should have an opportunity to vote on the matter if not today, certainly tomorrow. We must bring to a conclusion, within the next 24 to 48 hours, the matters that have stifled the Government and the country over the past few days. It would not be satisfactory to merely have statements and questions today without any opportunity to vote in this House.  We would be running away from our obligation and our duty to the public because the issues about which we are concerned today go to the very heart of parliamentary democracy and we must have an opportunity to vote. Deputy Bruton's suggestion of moving his motion in Private Members' Time and having the vote tomorrow evening is very reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I see the logic in Deputy Bruton's proposal, there may well be necessity for reflection at the end of the procedures outlined by the Taoiseach.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 48 hours, there has been much speculation about the kind of statement the Labour Party might want from me on this occasion to ensure the future of the partnership Government.  This is a good Government and I, and my Fianna Fáil Government colleagues, believe it is our collective responsibility to continue its work.  This is a good Government and a good partnership: even now, halfway through our term, the results prove that.</P>
      <P>However, in preparing this statement to the House, I have wider and deeper responsibilities.  I must, today, explain the failure of a system in this specific case; a failure with ghastly and specific consequences for the children of this country.  I must not excuse the failure: I must ensure that it never happens again. I will give this House a full and detailed report but a full and detailed report of a failure in our method of dealing with such a crime as child sexual abuse will never and can never be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>It cannot be satisfactory &mdash; and it is not satisfactory to me.  As a father and grandfather, I find the idea of paedophilia revolting.  That the paedophile would be a priest, with the special access to children and the extra layer of trust that we extend to the priesthood is much worse, so much worse.  It is a betrayal of innocence, of family, of an honoured position and of a national commitment to the innocence and vulnerability of young people.</P>
      <P>I wish to preface my dealing with the explanation furnished by the Attorney General by stating, upfront, my view of that explanation.  It sets out the details of the handling of the case in the Attorney General's office.  It cannot be satisfactory because it shows a system, developed for past conditions, failing to cope with present realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not defend that system.  On the contrary.  I have asked tough questions about it.  I am dissatisfied when I see the standard rules and precedents being <Col N="18" /> used but not working properly.  I have demanded radical change.  I will, as head of Government, take responsibility along with my colleagues for the fact that the system should have been changed sooner.  That is my view and the view of my Fianna Fáil colleagues on the issue of public accountability.</P>
    <P>We accepted a full explanation of what happened, not as a justification for what happened but as a record of system failure and as something showing the gaps, the flaws and the liabilities that have to be tackled under the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The general public have had the opportunity to read the full text of the explanation in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I intend to place the full text in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the appointment of Mr. Whelehan to the Bench has the effect of preventing me from answering questions in this House in relation to the case.  That is not so.  I have been advised that the fact that Mr. Justice Whelehan is no longer Attorney General does not prevent me from dealing now with any matter that arose during his term of office.  I can deal with it in the same manner as I could were he still the Attorney General even though in formal constitutional terms he is not accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>There was an unacceptable delay in the handling of this case for which we all in Government must take responsibility. On my behalf, and on behalf of the Government, I wish to express my deep regret to the Irish people for the delays that occurred.  I give a solemn assurance in this House today that such a situation will never arise again, on the part of an organ of State whose special duty it is to look after the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of confirming categorically to the House that I have been assured by the then Attorney General that he did not know and was not made aware of the existence of a request for the extradition of Fr. Brendan Smyth until recent weeks.  The <Col N="19" /> existing procedures gave rise to that obviously unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of the issues which have arisen in connection with this matter, I decided that there should be a thorough, immediate review of the operations of the Office of the Attorney General.  I have directed that this review will be completed within the next three weeks after which I expect a radical re-organisation of the Office of the Attorney General to take place. This review is being carried out by a high-level group chaired by the Secretary, Public Service Management and Development in the Department of Finance and comprising the Secretary to the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The group is free to seek such assistance, from within and outside the Civil Service, as it considers necessary, to carry out its task as expeditiously and thoroughly as possible.  The terms of reference of the group are: to review and make recommendations on the relevant organisational structure, systems, procedures and staffing arrangements in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I see this review as being the essential first step in the preparation of a statement of strategy for the Office of Attorney General.  A strategy statement will provide the basis for the reform of the operations of the office in the longer term and underpin the immediate measures that I have just announced.  I have asked the Attorney General to ensure that it is put in place as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Lessons from this case have already been learned by the Office of the Attorney General.  It is recognised that this case was not handled as sensitively and urgently as it should have been. Steps have been taken to remedy this. New administrative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the Attorney General is informed of every extradition request immediately it is received by his office.  In addition, the Attorney General has directed that, henceforth, absolute priority over other <Col N="20" /> work, irrespective of its importance or urgency, will be given to any extradition request that involves the abuse of children. I can assure the House that there will never be another Brendan Smyth case.</P>
    <P>Extraditon requests are among the important matters that are invariably placed before the Attorney General for his personal decision, but before he will be in a position to make his decision on the request, the preparatory work on the case has to be done by his professional staff.  Nevertheless, I believe, and I operate on this basis in my own office, that important and sensitive matters should be brought to the immediate attention of the Taoiseach, Minister or office holder, such as the Attorney General, so that he or she may give directions as to how the matter is to be dealt with in his or her office.</P>
    <P>The importance and urgency of this case was clearly not appreciated and understood in the Attorney General's office.  Legitimate concern has been expressed by many people at the fact that this case, involving as it did accusations of sexual abuse of children, took so long to be dealt with by the Attorney General's office.  I fully share that concern. I appreciate and regret the deep anxiety which is felt by everybody, especially parents, about this case.</P>
    <P>Two particularly serious issues arise in connection with this case.  The first is how the Attorney General's office could take seven months to process the warrants and, secondly, who is accountable for this situation.  In relation to the seven month delay, with great regret I have to tell the House that there is no really satisfactory or adequate explanation which I can give in response to that.</P>
    <P>One reason that has been advanced by the Attorney General's office, has been the issue of Fr. Brendan Smyth's address at the time of the warrants.  The address on the warrants was a previous address in Northern Ireland but on the accompanying documentation supplied only to the Attorney General's office was an address at Kilnacrott Abbey in <Col N="21" /> County Cavan.  It was unfortunately assumed in our Attorney General's office on the basis of this that, if Fr. Brendan Smyth was in the State he was living at that address, living within a religious community.  That comfortable assumption, which we now know was regrettably incorrect, resulted in consideration not being given to the possibility that Fr. Brendan Smyth might be out in the community or in contact with young people.  There was an unquestioning belief that residence within a religious community by a person accused of offences such as those specified in the warrants would render it out of the question that he would engage in, or have the opportunity to engage in, further activities of that type.</P>
    <P>The statement in the documentation as to Brendan Smyth's residence, upon which the assumption was made, should not have been accepted by the Attorney Generals' office at face value.  It is a mistake that cannot be allowed to happen again.  In future cases of this type any such statement will have to be thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there has been justifiable public concern about the manner in which this particular extradition case was handled.  Proper priority should have been accorded to it.  It was dealt with as a normal extradition case but this was clearly not appropriate given the particular seriousness of the offences and the possibility that existed for further offences to be committed.  I regret very much that the lack of urgent action on it has caused so much anxiety to parents and others.  I can assure them that they will have no basis for such anxiety in the future.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the criticism which has been made that the process of examining extradition warrants in the Attorney General's office must be changed and changed radically.  A seven month delay in processing the paperwork is totally unacceptable.  I conveyed my strong views on the way in which this case was handled.  The Attorney General will ensure that all members of the staff of his office are fully aware of <Col N="22" /> these views and of the absolute need to ensure that all matters related to the welfare of children will be accorded the highest priority in future.</P>
    <P>In the wider context of policy, this partnership Government has made child care a priority and has undertaken that all sections of the Child Care Act will be implemented.  Priority will be given to those provisions which confer new and improved powers on health boards, the Garda and courts to intervene more effectively in cases of child abuse.  Our State legal services must also reflect these priorities in their work.</P>
    <P>The general question of responsibility and accountability has been raised in connection with this case.  The Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer and is not part of the Executive of the State.  He is the legal officer of the Government but also has a quasi-judicial role.  In the case of the implementation of the Extradition (Amendment) Act of 1987, the Attorney General is required to direct that a warrant for the extradition of a person from the State shall not be endorsed unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, he is of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute that person, founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  The Attorney General is not answerable to the Government or to the Dáil for that particular statutory function.</P>
    <P>As regards the integrity of the office of Attorney General, I am informed that only one officer in the Attorney General's office was involved in the processing of the Smyth case.  In response to my personal inquiries, I have been assured that there is no question of outside influence being brought to bear in the case.</P>
    <P>When a request for the extradition of a person has been received from another jurisdiction, the decision whether to advise the Garda that they may endorse the warrant, thus initiating the extradition process, or whether to direct them not to do so is one for the Attorney General himself and not for <Col N="23" /> any official, save in the case of absence or illness, which is not relevant in this situation.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is responsible for the decision whether to grant or refuse an extradition request.  In the Smyth case, the Attorney General did not make any decision because the preparatory work which had to be done by officials had not been completed at the time it became known that Fr. Brendan Smyth was voluntarily going to Belfast to face trial there.  As is known, he did return and was in due course sentenced to four years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with a number of specific points.  The first point was &ldquo;why was there such an absolute refusal to issue a public statement or face public questions&rdquo;.  I am doing today what I clearly indicated last week I would be doing.  I am giving a full account.  There has been no refusal to issue a public statement or face public questions.</P>
    <P>The second point was in relation to &ldquo;the Attorney's explanation that he had not seen the request, amplified by the assertion that there would be no point in his seeing it, until all the preparatory work had been completed by an official&rdquo;.  This was contrasted with his predecessor's statement in December 1988 that the Attorney General &ldquo;bears ultimate responsibility for the initation and conduct of extradition proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The third point was that &ldquo;in his explanation, the Attorney also says that what comes to him and what does not, is decided on the professional judgement of the person with responsibility for the relevant file&rdquo;.  This is contrasted with a letter from the Attorney General about aspects of the Ethics Bill, in which he referred in detail to the &ldquo;non-delega-tory&rdquo; nature of the job of Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The answer to those two points is as follows: the initiation and conduct of proceedings in the above context refers to the courts, not to the examination of the file in his office.  Anything that requires the decision of the Attorney <Col N="24" /> General is, of course, submitted to him, and his decision-making functions indeed cannot be delegated.  But that does not mean he has to work singlehanded, or in particular, that work preparatory to a decision cannot be delegated.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address some of the broader issues of the case.  The Attorney-General's position is not the same as that of a Minister, but he clearly has responsibility for the operation of his office, in the same way as a Minister has under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  We must distinguish between responsibility and culpability.  As Ministers pointed out yesterday, if for example there were a teacher accused of molesting a child in a school under the control of the Department of Education, the Minister would be responsible, but he or she would not be culpable, unless, having been informed of that fact, they failed to take corrective action.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for example, if patients are abused or left untreated in a public hospital, the Minister for Health is responsible, but again he or she is not to blame, provided they act when the problem is brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>Another example would be a case of negligence by a local authority official. The Minister for the Environment would be responsible, but he would not be to blame.</P>
    <P>The reality, as we all know, is that hundreds of decisions are made in Government Departments every day of the week.  The ministerial head of the office is responsible and accountable for each of these decisions, and must take corrective action when required.  They are also in general responsible as far as possible for the efficient operation of their offices.  That ideal is not always easy to fulfil, but must be striven for at all times.</P>
    <P>Government in Ireland operates under the doctrine of collective responsibility.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government. The Taoiseach is in practice administratively accountable for the Attorney <Col N="25" /> General's office in this House.  Indeed, accountability is unaffected by the Attorney's appointment to the Presidency of the High Court.  I am here to answer for his office and his conduct of it in this House.</P>
    <P>If there were legislative delays, as there have been in the past, I do not think the House would find it an adequate excuse if I were simply to attribute all responsibility for the delay to the Attorney General's office.  The responsibility would clearly also lie with the Government as a whole.  W.T. Cosgrave, as President of the Executive Council in 1924, stated, given the necessity to have somebody to answer for the Attorney General in the House, where he was not a Member, that `In this arrangement the Executive Council has the general responsibility, and must be prepared to answer for the Attorney General &mdash; Official Report, volume 5, cols. 916-917.  In other words, it was laid down by the first leader of a post-independence Irish Government at the time of the Ministers and Secretaries Act that the Government as a whole was responsible for the Attorney General.  In my opinion, it follows that I personally and the Government as a whole must take some responsibility for the deficiencies in the operation of extradition procedures in the Attorney General's office, as brought to light in the Smyth case.</P>
    <P>I now want to address all the issues surrounding the appointment of the former Attorney General to the Presidency of the High Court.  In recent months, particulary since controversy arose about the appointment, when it was brought into the public domain, I have been faced with two unenviable choices. I was faced on the one hand by the opposition of my colleagues in a partnership Government to this particular judicial appointment, which was made much more difficult to resolve by the fact that it had become public.  On the other hand, if I had acquiesced in the violation of a well-established precedent, it would have implied that the Attorney General did not enjoy the full <Col N="26" /> trust and confidence of his colleagues, and consequently, his position as Attorney General would have become untenable.</P>
    <P>Part of the question that arose between us was over whether there was a precedent for the Attorney General to be entitled to nomination as President of the High Court.  With regard to that point, about which there has been some dispute, I would like to quote one of the most eminent authorities on constitutional government in Ireland, Professor Basil Chubb, in the 1992 third edition of his book, <i>The Government and Politics of Ireland</i> page 295.  There he states: &ldquo;by custom the Attorney General, a political appointee, who is the Government's legal adviser and state prosecutor, is always offered any vacancy to the High Court that occurs during his term of office&rdquo;.  I underline the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;, which clearly includes the presidency.  No provision was made in the Programme for Government for any alteration of this custom and precedent. I now accept that the desirability of such a custom is open to question, and both parties in Government have agreed that it will not obtain in the future.</P>
    <P>Following the initial controversy, we reached an impasse on this issue.  The Cabinet agreed to set up a sub-committee of four to see in what way this impasse could be resolved.  Discussions took place and some progress was reported.  I then had the much publicised discussions with the Tánaiste in Baldonnel on 9 October.  Following that meeting the sub-committee worked out a new system of judicial appointments, which it was agreed would be incorporated in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, on my clear understanding that this would pave the way for the appointment of the Attorney General to the presidency of the High Court.  Indeed, on 11 October, a Government statement said &ldquo;when the legislative changes are approved by Government, an appointment to the Presidency of the High Court will be made&rdquo;.  I agreed to repeated postponements of the decision, <Col N="27" /> at the request of the Tánaiste.  The emergence of the Smyth case did not affect the integrity of the Attorney General, nor his suitability for high judicial office.  It was my understanding that the appointment was to be made last week. It was agreed to take it last Thursday evening, but in the event the Government meeting was devoted to a discussion on Northern Ireland arising from the tragedy in Newry that morning. It was decided to have the usual Government meeting on the following morning, Friday, when the full agenda was dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste came to see me on that Thursday evening and handed me a letter timed 7.30 p.m.  I responded to the letter in writing.  I received a further letter that night from the Tánaiste timed 11.30 p.m. which was not received by me until I returned home from an engagement, at about 1.20 a.m.  I rang the Tánaiste early the following morning.  In these exchanges I was anxious to accommodate the Tánaiste in every possible respect, and had no problem with his other requests seeking proper accountability. The only outstanding issue was whether the decision on the presidency of the High Court required to be deferred in order to allow me to be accountable on the Attorney General's behalf to the Dáil in the Smyth case.  I sought advice on the proper procedures, and was confirmed in my view that this postponement was unnecessary, because accountability arises for all decisions that have been taken, but not for decisions which have yet to be made.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the Executive is to take decisions and to be accountable for them afterwards to the Dáil.  We cannot as a rule hope to satisfy the Dáil, and particularly the Opposition parties, before we take decisions.  When the former Taoiseach came to explain and answer questions in the Dáil on the Fr. Ryan extradition case, it was to defend the decision that had already been taken by the Attorney General independently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> My view of good Government is that it must be decisive.  We had a long Cabinet discussion last Friday on this issue. I was given no advance warning that my Labour colleagues intended to leave the Government meeting, were the issue of the presidency of the High Court to be decided.  Government procedures are such that dissenting voices at a Government meeting are not recorded in the Government minutes, whereas members of the Government absenting themselves from a decision may be recorded, if they so request.  It was for this reason we took the view that, rather than staying at the table, our Labour colleagues were absenting themselves for this decision only, thereby recording their dissent.  We therefore proceeded to take the decision on that basis.  It has transpired that this was a misinterpretation on our part.  I genuinely regret that, and any inadvertent offence caused to the Tánaiste and his Labour Party colleagues.</P>
    <P>Given the consequences that have arisen, which were certainly not our intention, we must avoid any recurrence of this type of situation.  It is clear we need a better method, which is not provided for in the Programme for Government, for dealing with issues of this kind which rarely happen.  I am willing to sit down with the Tánaiste to set up whatever structures would explore conflicting interests, and provide a better mechanism of dealing with them within the partnership, which respects vital political interests, while ensuring that essential decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>These new structures would underpin renewed trust and co-operation which I recognise as essential components in the good partnership Government.  They can serve as the mechanism for dealing with this type of situation in the future, should it ever happen again.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if a Government that is achieving rapid economic progress, that has achieved the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in over 25 years, and that has a fine legislative programme should be placed in <Col N="29" /> jeopardy over misunderstandings surrounding a single judicial appointment. In particular, it is my profound conviction that we have to give the fragile Northern peace process the best possible chance of permanent consolidation. I believe the national interest requires continuity at this time.  We must all work to restore the spirit of partnership which is the cornerstone of this successful Government.  I solemnly commit myself as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil to restoring that spirit of partnership and trust.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has played an indispensable role in both the Northern Ireland talks process and the peace process.  I want again to pay tribute in particular to the dedication and expertise which he brought to these delicate and protracted negotiations, the success of which will underwrite the future of this country.  History will recall Deputy Spring's essential contribution to that success.  We can go forward from here and build on that success.  I know that Deputy Spring and the Labour Party are the right partners to achieve that goal.</P>

      <P>The lengthy account I have given here shows that I am willing to give a full and comprehensive account of the conduct of the Attorney General's office.  Where obvious deficiencies have arisen, I asked questions and sought changes.  The essence of accountability, where there has been a breakdown in public policy, is threefold; to give a full account of what has happened, to accept responsibility, which I have done on behalf of the former Attorney General, myself and the Government, and to make the administrative changes that are so obviously necessary.</P>
      <P>Even the most detailed explanations cannot make a bad situation better &mdash; cannot make a flawed system acceptable. The most detailed explanation cannot make any of us feel that a seven month delay in dealing with a child sexual abuser was acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party would never seek to justify or minimise what went wrong in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case. All of our members have an instinctive, reflex horror and revulsion of this kind of abuse, particularly when done by a priest friend of a family.  It goes against everything we stand for, everything we believe in, everything we work towards.</P>
      <P>I have expressed my deep and genuine regret to the Irish people for this bad episode.  Now, I go further. Nothing like the Fr. Smyth case will ever be allowed to happen again in this country.  I will ensure that the structures are put in place to make that a certainty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are meeting today to consider a very serious issue.  In our approach to this debate it is important <Col N="31" /> that we are just to all concerned and willing to accept so far as possible the word of all concerned.  Before addressing ourselves to that issue we should express our concern for and sympathy to the victims, and their families, of the awful crime of paedophilia, a crime which stays with the victims until the end of their days.</P>
      <P>The issue we are being asked to consider today concerns principally the way in which the Taoiseach does his business as Taoiseach.  It would appear that last Friday the Labour Party Members, who are members of a two-party Government, failed to obtain adequate explanations for the behaviour in office of the then serving Attorney General.  It would appear also that, having failed to obtain those explanations, they withdrew from the Cabinet meeting.  Notwithstanding that, the Taoiseach went ahead and appointed the person, about whose conduct adequate explanations had not been provided, to one of the most senior judicial positions.  That was wrong on two counts.  It was wrong because it is unfair to the judicial system and to all judges that anybody over whom serious questions hang should be appointed to the Judiciary.  It was wrong for a second reason, in that it represented a calculated insult to the other party that were members of the Government jointly with the Taoiseach.  He thought so little of their opinion that he ignored them entirely, went ahead and took a decision in their absence with which he knew they did not agree.</P>
      <P>I simply do not accept the explanation given by the Taoiseach for his having taking that decision.  In the course of his statement the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Government procedures are such that dissenting voices at a Government meeting are not recorded in the Government minutes, whereas members of the Government absenting themselves from a decision may be recorded, if they so request. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is trying to pretend to the House and the Labour Party that <Col N="32" /> this departure from the Cabinet meeting on the part of an entire party which represented 33 Deputies and obtained a huge public vote at the last general election was no more than a simple case of somebody looking out the window when a vote was being taken or going out to the balcony with the intention of returning.</P>
    <P>I believe that to be a completely incredible explanation.  I was not at the meeting so I do not know what went before but my understanding is that it was long and somewhat acrimonious. That the Taoiseach assumed Labour Ministers were simply engaging in a procedural device to wash their hands of a decision rather than making a much more serious protest on behalf of their party at the way in which business was being conducted is completely unbelievable. I will be amazed if the Tánaiste and the Labour Party accept that this is a true statement of the Taoiseach's true beliefs about their decision on that occasion to take that most serious step, as a party, of withdrawing from the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach claims that this was a misinterpretation on his part.  My understanding is that there was not much time taken after the Labour Party Ministers had left in discussing this issue or attempting to weigh up whether or not this was a correct interpretation of the conduct of the Labour Ministers. My understanding is that the decision was taken very quickly immediately the Labour Ministers had left.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that if the Taoiseach was genuinely in doubt as to a true understanding of the reason for the Labour Ministers absenting themselves from the Cabinet he would have taken either of two steps: he would have had a lengthy discussion with his remaining Fianna Fáil colleagues to weigh up the true understanding of what the Labour Ministers were doing or would have requested the Secretary to the Government to contact the absent Labour Ministers to ascertain their view on the matter.  He did neither of those things.  He did not care to find out the true interpretation of the Labour <Col N="33" /> Party action in this matter.  He did not care.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at some of the circumstantial evidence which may substantiate my belief that the Taoiseach did not care whether the Labour Party were simply engaging in a procedural device to evade responsibility for a decision &mdash; which would be uncharacteristic of them &mdash; or were making a serious protest.  The reason I think the Taoiseach did not bother to inquire is that he was taking this decision on the day the first tallies were coming in from the by-elections in Cork.  He knew the Labour Party, as is customary for a party in a coalition, was not doing particularly well and coldly calculated that it would be in no position to object. It was not any misinterpretation; it was a cold, calculated act, one that could be described as the act of a political bully. I do not believe that type of act has any place in any Government whether it be a single or multi-party one.  Politics is about arguing one's case but is also about respecting the case of others.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Taoiseach acted on that occasion, perhaps spontaneously or without a great deal of deliberation, revealed his true attitude to the Labour Party.  Perhaps in times of less stress, when he has more time to deliberate and consult before doing things, he may force himself to treat the Labour Party with more respect, but when he took a decision under pressure, in the heat of the moment, his true feelings emerged. Those true feelings were feelings of contempt. Contempt is the only appropriate noun to describe the activity in which the Taoiseach engaged in ploughing ahead with this decision in the absence of his Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>That is the central question.  I intend to devote some time to the explanations, or rather non-explanations, that have been offered for the decisions of the Attorney General, now President of the High Court.  It is well known by all Members, but not perhaps as well known by members of the public, that it is a well established tradition in this House that one may not criticise <Col N="34" /> members of the Judiciary.  On any occasion a Member has sought to criticise members of the Judiciary the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has intervened to stop us from doing so, in my view quite properly because of the separation of powers. How then can we pass any judgment on the conduct of somebody who is now a judge?  We are not allowed to discuss the conduct of somebody who is now a judge, because we are not allowed to impugn the Judiciary.  It is relevant to point out that the Taoiseach, far from being committed to accountability, adopted a deliberate device to prevent the Attorney General being the subject of any searching criticism in this House by placing him in a judicial position where he is not only above accountability but above criticism since it is not proper or appropriate to criticise a judge in this House.</P>
    <P>One might draw the conclusion that there is another unworthy motive for the haste in making this decision, that for some reason the Taoiseach did not want the Attorney General to have to answer questions about this matter. Otherwise he could have waited a week to make the appointment and thus allowed the question of the answers provided by the Attorney General for his handling of this case to be discussed. Had the Labour Party or anyone else decided that they wanted to have a critical debate or a critical questioning of the Attorney General, they would have been able to do so because the subject of criticism would not have been a judge, someone who is above criticism in this House.  Perhaps his Labour Party colleagues know more about it than I, but the Taoiseach plainly did not want a critical examination of the Attorney General and that explains why he had to give the explanations to the Cabinet and make the appointment at the same time.  Any delay would have meant the possibility of an open debate and criticism of the Attorney General's activity and, for some reason, the Taoiseach did not want that.  That is wrong.  It is not <Col N="35" /> accountability.  It is a denial of the prerogative not just of this House but of the public who are entitled to scrutinise the activities of any important officer of State.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the responsibility of the Executive is to take decisions and to be accountable for them afterwards to the Dáil.  He continued: &ldquo;We cannot as a rule hope to satisfy the Dáil, and particularly the Opposition, before we take decisions.&rdquo; It is a gross misinterpretation to imply, as the Taoiseach did, that the Tánaiste was asking him to defer the appointment of a President of the High Court until Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left were satisfied. He was not making any such request.  Neither was he asking that the Dáil as a whole should be satisfied with this appointment.  He was asking no more and no less than that sufficient time be allowed for questions to be asked publicly.  The Tánaiste was not seeking to give the Dáil a veto over Executive decisions in regard to this matter.  He was not seeking to give the Opposition &mdash; to quote the Taoiseach &mdash; a role in this matter.  He was simply seeking to allow questions to be asked and the only way the Taoiseach had of preventing that was by taking the decision at the same time as explanations were offered to the Cabinet, thereby shutting off any possibility of questioning on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach claims that he agreed to repeated postponements of the decision at the request of the Tánaiste. That may be true, but it does not explain why a decision on the appointment had to be made at the same meeting at which the explanations in regard to the Fr. Smyth case were presented.  A further postponement of one week would have made no difference. However, from the Taoiseach's perspective, such a postponement would not have allowed him to perform the ritual humiliation of the Labour Party in Government that acting as he did allowed him to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The Taoiseach claimed that he was pushed towards haste in this decision by the fact that the controversy within the Government had become public.  He must ask himself, as must all Members of the Government, why that happened. It is a matter that reflects discredit on all 15 members of the Government that any matter of this kind should have become public.  However, when it comes to accountability for the fact that proceedings at Cabinet became public, the person who is primarily accountable for that failure is the Taoiseach himself as Head of the Government.  If a Government leaks it is because it is not managed on a partnership basis, because people feel they are not getting an adequate hearing at the Cabinet table and must, therefore, make their views known through the media.  If a Government leaks it is because it is not working and the person who is accountable for that is the Taoiseach.  Far from representing some form of excuse for the Taoiseach's behaviour, the fact that matters discussed at Cabinet have become public is an indication of serious failure of leadership on his part.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also sought to justify his action in proceeding with this appointment on the grounds that there was a well established precedent that the holder of the office of Attorney General could be offered any position that came up in the courts at any time. I have made inquiries of members of the legal profession, of judges, former judges and others, and I am satisfied that there is no such precedent.  I understand that the Labour Party agrees with my view on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has sought to imply that there is some similarity between the position of the Minister for Education in the detection of child abuse in a voluntary secondary school in, say, County Galway and the position of the Attorney General.  Of course the Minister for Education has a responsibility but it is of an entirely different level and scale from that of the Attorney General in regard to extradition. As the Tánaiste has correctly pointed out, the Attorney General's office is different from the office of a Minister in that, as the Attorney General rather delicately put it, it involves a non-delegatory job.  More than that, in regard to extradition it is clear from the record of this House that that is a matter for which the Attorney General is personally responsible in a way that no Minister for Health is personally responsible for what happens in the health services and no Minister for Education for what happens in a particular school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Official Report on the debate on the Extradition Bill makes it clear that the responsibility of the Attorney General is very different.  During that debate the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerard Collins, who is in the House, said the Government was happy that the Attorney General must see and examine all warrants.  There is not a similar provision that the Minister for Health must examine all reports on health institutions or that the Minister for Education must examine every school <Col N="38" /> report.  However, in the case of extradition there is a specific responsibility on the Attorney General to see and examine all warrants.  During the 1987 debate on the Extradition Bill the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Haughey, said this important new procedural step &mdash; he was referring to extradition &mdash; will mean that the Attorney General will have to form an opinion as to these matters. This is plainly different from the situation with which the Taoiseach thought to compare it.  It is a matter for which the Attorney General has a clear personal responsibility.  Therefore, a delay of seven months in a case like this represents a personal failure on the part of the former Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General said he did not see the file and I accept his word on that.  Unfortunately, as would be the case in a court, we are not in a position to cross examine him about the matter to test his credibility even though one is disposed to accept his word.  We are not allowed to do that because the Taoiseach appointed him to a job where he is above questioning.  Even without that, I am willing to accept he did not see the warrants.  I am prepared to accept also, but with more difficulty, his statement that finally, in view of certain innuendoes made he has been assured by the official dealing with the case that there was no contact of any kind from or with any political or other source concerning the case.  In other words, the former Attorney General claimed that nobody made representations to him.  The only way in which that could be definitely determined would be for all those dealing with the case to be interviewed by somebody accountable to this House, but that has not been done.  If the former Attorney General interviewed those people he is no longer accountable to this House because he has been promoted.  The Taoiseach most certainly did not interview those officials and, to date, he is unwilling to allow anyone else to do so.  While I am willing to accept the statement of the former Attorney General on face value, we have been prevented from examining it <Col N="39" /> by the Taoiseach's action in promoting him to the position of President of the High Court.  The normal procedure of inquisition to test the veracity of any statement &mdash; even though one is not maliciously disposed to disbelieve his statement &mdash; have been denied to us in this case because of the action of the Taoiseach in appointing the former Attorney General to a position where he cannot be asked questions.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach's abject apologies today on behalf of someone who is not here and who no longer has anything to do with the Government do not adequately deal with the matter, and I wonder about the validity of apologies offered on behalf of someone who is no longer part of the Executive.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced a major reorganisation of the office of the Attorney General.  As we all know, in business parlance an announcement of a reorganisation of a company usually means that some people will lose their jobs or will be moved to other positions. This is another example of the Government apparently trying to hide behind officials.  In the Arcon case the Minister was unwilling to take responsibility for decisions of his Department for which he was legally responsible under the ministers and secretaries Act and produced, not to the Dáil but to journalists, an official who took the rap.  This is another case of evasion of responsibility, by shoving the matter into the hands of officials who will now probably be moved and it will be implied that they are truly responsible.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>When one considers this against a background of a Taoiseach who was unwilling to answer questions in this House about his behaviour in matters covered in the report of the beef tribunal, the unexplained issuance of a passport to an investor in a company belonging to him and his difficult to believe statement that he was unaware of a £1 million investment in his company, we see a picture of a Government that does not really believe in being <Col N="40" /> accountable.  I am glad that accountability on this occasion is being sought, but there seems to be an irredeemable aversion to accountability in the Fianna Fáil Party.  That party does not believe in having to account to this House if it can get away without doing so.  To the credit of the Labour Party, it is not getting away with doing that on this occasion, although it got away with it very often on many equally important matters in the past two years.  However, I am glad that, perhaps, that process has now come to an end.</P>
    <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for being generous in regard to time.  I hope I do not transgress on the time of others, but I am sure you will understand that in delivering <i>impromptu</i> remarks it is difficult to coordinate my thoughts in the time allocated.</P>
    <P>It is clear that not only was the extradition warrant sent to the office of the Attorney General in the normal way, but that the Department of Justice was informed about it.  I would like the Minister for Justice to indicate why she did not take action or saw nothing wrong with a seven month delay in processing that warrant.  Apparently, the Minister for Justice was aware of the extradition warrant as soon as the Attorney General became aware of it.  I understand that an official in the office of the British Attorney General telephoned or wrote directly to the office of the Irish Attorney General about the matter. Who from the office of the British Attorney General made that contact? Who in the office of the Irish Attorney General received such communication? What was the rank of the official who contacted the office of the Irish Attorney General and of the official who received the communication?  How long had the warrants been in the office of the Irish Attorney General prior to the receipt of the request from the office of the British Attorney General?</P>
    <P>In the statement issued by the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party two possibly not very important <Col N="41" /> questions were ignored by the Taoiseach in his contribution.  The Tánaiste referred to some of the questions that refer to internal aspects of the explanation and to some missing information, like dates, notes, comments etc., relating to the extradition file which consists of 27 pieces of paper.  I presume those questions are available to the Labour Party and it would be helpful if they were made available to the Opposition members so that we might pursue them later.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Leader referred to other queries that will also arise, and these were pursued by Labour Ministers to no avail.  It appears the Taoiseach has dealt only with Labour Party queries contained in the Tánaiste's published statement.  Obviously, there are a number of other queries, referred to by the Tánaiste, Which the Tánaiste, probably due to lack of time because the statement was so long, did not include in his public statement.  As those matters are obviously of concern to the Labour Party and therefore of some importance, they should be put to the Taoiseach. I invite the Labour Party to make available to us a copy of any other questions it may have &mdash; it is obvious there are other questions &mdash; so that they can also be put to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with this matter in a fair and thorough fashion.  The ultimate issue is the way the Taoiseach conducted the Cabinet meeting and the way he dealt with his parliamentary and Government colleagues, which is entirely unacceptable.  It is not acceptable in any Government, single party or coalition, to make a decision when a significant minority is as unhappy as were the Labour Ministers.  To treat colleagues in Cabinet table, be they of your own party or of another, as Labour Ministers were treated last Friday is unacceptable and incompatible with collective responsibility.  The person responsible for that is the Taoiseach and, therefore, he should not continue to hold the office of Taoiseach since he has behaved in a manner which is unacceptable.</P>

      <P>The issues we are debating this afternoon strike at the very heart of parliamentary democracy. What we are talking about today is the right of Members of the Dáil to vindicate the accountability the electorate places in us.  The quote of the century must go to the Taoiseach who said, &ldquo;I am totally committed to public accountability&rdquo;. I know of no Taoiseach and no office holder in the history of this Parliament who has been less accountable for his actions as an office holder than the Taoiseach.  There is the instance of the Masri passports affair &mdash; who is accountable for that? On the beef tribunal, who is accountable for putting at risk in excess of £100 million of taxpayers' money? Who is accountable for usurping the authority of the IDA? The Taoiseach should be accountable.</P>
      <P>I have to say to the Taoiseach &mdash; this is not easy for me, despite what he might think &mdash; that I had difficulties working with him as a junior member of his Government.  He did not see me fit to represent the Government at Northern Ireland talks.  I found that difficult to accept and never got a reasonable explanation for it.  The Taoiseach finds it impossible to work with those who differ with him.  That has been my view since my experience in Government with him.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that it is only two years this month since the Taoiseach, in giving evidence to the beef tribunal, sought to totally undermine one of his Cabinet colleagues.  Despite getting the opportunity on, I think, 13 occasions, when Deputy O'Malley's counsel cross-exam-ined him, to clarify what he had said, the Taoiseach persisted in putting his Cabinet colleagues in a position where he had no alternative but to withdraw from Government.  Anybody who places the Government at such a risk is not suitable to hold the most senior political office in the country.  The experience of the Labour Party does not surprise me, although sometimes one expects that people will learn lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he had made up <Col N="43" /> his mind he was going to answer questions, but I do not accept that.  Why did I receive a letter from the Ceann Comhairle last Friday, 11 November, telling me that the Taoiseach had transferred my questions on this matter to the Minister for Justice for answer on Tuesday, 6 December while yesterday afternoon I received a telephone call from the General Office to say the Taoiseach would take my questions? What happened between Friday and yesterday? The Government was put at risk and that is the only reason the Taoiseach was prepared to take questions in this House.</P>
    <P>When this issue first arose my colleague, Deputy Keogh, raised it on the Adjournment.  We were concerned because Fr. Smyth had been a chaplain in Tralee Hospital and had 24 hour access to the children's ward there.  We were rightly concerned that the church and hospital authorities did not take precautions to protect the children in their care.  It was not until a couple of days later that we realised that extradition proceedings had been initiated in this case by the RUC.  On Sunday, 25 October, when we became aware of the extradition proceedings, the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donnell, issued a statement. I will put on record some of what was said.  That evening the Attorney General's office said they had not dealt with the matter because it was a very complex case over many years, and the length of time was not unnecessarily long.  The next day the Attorney General's office told us that the Attorney General had not seen the warrant, that it was being dealt with by an assistant. Even on the first day, they could not get it right.</P>
    <P>Everybody is talking about seven months and I accept the time involved was only seven months, but it could have been two years or seven years as far as the Attorney General's office, the former Attorney General and the Taoiseach were concerned.  The only reason it was seven months is that Fr. Smyth <Col N="44" /> voluntarily went back to the North, and we should not forget that.  If he had not voluntarily gone back, he may still be here.  It is interesting that, as in the case of the beef tribunal, it was a television programme of a foreign channel that brought this matter to public attention and caused action here.  That should be noted on this occasion given that a journalist will shortly face proceedings in regard to her fine work.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that anyone would dare to put forward as a defence the fact that as the priest was in a religious community was reason to believe he would not do again what he had been doing for many years.  Anyone who knows anything about child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, knows the pattern: people do not give up, they continue for as long as they have access to children, and we must make sure they do not have access to children.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's defence of what happened is not convincing.  He regrets what happened but he did not say he made a mistake last Friday, and that is very interesting.  I wonder why a Taoiseach who was risking so much &mdash; the downfall of his Government, tainting the Judiciary, his own reputation and that of the former Attorney General &mdash; should have persisted last Friday when less than half his Cabinet were present. I wonder why the former Attorney General accepted the position.  Many reasonable people will ask legitimate questions about those two matters.  I know of no person who would have put themselves in the position in which the former Attorney General put himself.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach should have insisted on appointing to the second most senior judicial position in the country a man who was surrounded by so much controversy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said it was all right because he was going to answer questions this week, but I do not believe he had intended to do so.  On 2 November when Deputy O'Malley and I raised the matter on the Order of Business and asked was the Attorney General accountable for what happened in his <Col N="45" /> office, the Taoiseach refused to answer. The matter went on at length and the Ceann Comhairle sought to rule us out of order, but the Taoiseach did not answer our questions.  He did not believe that the Attorney General was accountable.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach quoted W. T. Cosgrave, but the Government as a whole is not responsible.  The Taoiseach, not the Government, appoints the Attorney General, and it is the Taoiseach and the former Attorney General who have to be held accountable.</P>

      <P>There is a disturbing litany of recent events where members of the Government, when they found themselves in trouble, blamed their civil servants or, if they wanted to take credit, they blamed their civil servants for giving contrary advice.  The Taoiseach did this on 1 September in this House, as stated at column 202, volume 445 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Does anyone think that in helping to reach this point [bringing peace to Ireland] I have not had to take many critical decisions, without being able to take cover behind official advice? Does anyone think we could have reached this point without personal political initiatives and risk-taking on my part?  The country is fortunate that I did not take the official advice in this case.... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was prepared to down his civil servants then and when the Government got stuck in the Arcon affair an unfortunate civil servant was rolled out to take the rap.  The Taoiseach is again prepared today to blame a civil servant.  I heard last night and read this morning &mdash; no reference was made to this in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; that a civil servant is to be moved to the Law Reform Commission.  Somebody has to take the rap, but not the Taoiseach and the former Attorney <Col N="46" /> General, the people responsible for that office.</P>
    <P>The defence offered by the former Attorney General that he did no know about it is not good enough.  The Attorney General is required under section 2 of the 1987 Act to approve personally all requests for extradition to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  What action did the former Attorney General take to put procedures in place in his office to make sure they would be brought to his attention quickly? Obviously, he did nothing. He is responsible for the delay.  It is not good enough that he now holds the second most senior judicial position in the State.  It is ironic that he was sworn in this morning when we have not yet had an opportunity to put questions to the Taoiseach.  This says a lot about what we accept as appropriate standards of behaviour.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people are horrified by this case.  I said last week during the Cork by-election campaigns that many people had raised this issue with me.  Other politicians from other parties dismissed this and said that no one had raised the issue with them.  I was surprised by this because many people, particularly young mothers, raised it with me on the doorsteps.  Perhaps it was not the first issue mentioned by them but when one engaged in conversation with them it was an issue of concern to the voters of Cork, as it is to every right minded person throughout the country.  For too long we covered up child sexual abuse and accepted that our children could be put at risk.  The lives of many individuals have been destroyed beyond repair because of child sexual abuse and a failure on the part of the authorities, be they religious or State, to deal openly and realistically with the matter.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in his contribution to this debate the Taoiseach did not give us the detail given by the Attorney General in his explanation to the Government as reported in the newspapers yesterday. What we have read during the past few days makes a nonsense of Cabinet confidentiality.  When it suits <Col N="47" /> the Taoiseach as it did today we are given the detail of what happened at Cabinet.  The Taoiseach vigorously defended the concept of Cabinet confidentiality and refused to answer questions but today when it suits him we have been given full details of what happened at the Cabinet meeting last Friday. This makes a nonsense of the case taken by the former Attorney General which has been defended so often by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach genuinely believe that Mr. Harry Whelehan, now President of the High Court, was suitable given the controversy surrounding this case? Does he believe that this was the right decision not just last Friday but at any time? Did he make a mistake when he insisted on proceeding with this appointment last Friday?  While many words of concern about child sexual abuse have been expressed the word &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; has not been used.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach and other Ministers, in particular the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, said that the former Attorney General had no right to speak, that he was a defenceless man.  The former Attorney General was not shy when it came to the X case, he spoke out frequently to defend himself.  He also spoke out about the Danagher affair, the Maastricht Treaty Protocol and the Solemn Declaration.  He had no problem in any of those cases in speaking out frequently, issuing press statements and giving press briefings.  Why the silence in this case? Why are Government Ministers insisting that he had no right to speak? He had a right to speak and he was not prevented from doing so by the Constitution.  The fact that he did not choose to do so speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's decision to proceed with the appointment last Friday, the day the by-election results were announced, even if it was the right decision, will make many people very cynical; they wonder why it was not <Col N="48" /> made before the by-elections were held. The Taoiseach knows in his heart that it was the wrong decision and knew that it would not be well received.  He made the anouncement so that it would get lost in the election results.  I presume he did not know that his colleagues in Government were not going to put up with this shabby behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about partnership and trust despite the fact that he sought to destroy this partnership and trust only last August on a sensitive issue for himself, the beef tribunal.  We are supposed to believe that he is going to make up but one cannot put a structure or committee in place to contain someone who does not have the capacity to lead a partnership Government.</P>
    <P>It may seem surprising - the Taoiseach smiles as I say this &mdash; but his predecessor, despite difficulties both for himself and my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, did know how to lead a partnership Government.  He led it in a professional and businessike way. Despite my many criticisms of him over many years I had to admire the way in which he sought to lead that Government. It was a genuine effort to lead a coalition on a partnership basis.  This may not be music to the Taoiseach's ears.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a number of specific questions as I may not get an opportunity to do so later.  Perhaps the Taoiseach's advisers will note these questions and provide answers.  What work was done on this file by the professional staff in the Attorney General's office?  In particular did they prepare any submission, even a partial submission, for the Attorney General?  Was any request made by the Office of the Attorney General to the RUC or the UK authorities for additional information? Was any opinion sought from counsel on this file?  I note that in the Attorney General's explanation to the Government he dealt with other cases and said they had to seek the opinion of counsel because of the complexity of <Col N="49" /> the issues involved.  Does the file contain any written evidence of activity on the case other than the notes from the UK authorities?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach believe, because of the way this case was handled by the former Attorney General, that he was a suitable person for appointment to any judicial office?  The Taoiseach said there is a precedent but I dispute this.  Whatever about appointing the former Attorney General to a High Court position it is highly unusual to appoint him as President of the High Court.  A judge has been carrying out this job for the past three years and why he could not be allowed to continue for the remainder of his term of office is beyond me. It was this Government which created the vacancy by appointing Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton as Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>Why and when did the Taoiseach give a commitment to Mr. Harry Whelehan that he would be given this job?  Did the Taoiseach ask Mr. Whelehan to stand aside and, if so, when?  Does the Taoiseach believe that he should resign, as many people do, because of what happened in this case?  Even if we have a new Government or a general election the irony is that Mr. Harry Whelehan will remain in that important position for 22 years until he reaches the age of 72 unless he is impeached for misbehaviour as a judge or for incapacity.  It is extraordinary that someone who has such enormous power &mdash; more powers will be vested in the President of the High Court under the Courts Bill - will remain in office for that length of time. As long as Mr. Harry Whelehan holds that position there will be no public confidence in the presidency of the High Court.  As I said earlier, this is about public accountability and we do not have accountability in this parliament. The day the Government is elected is the day it becomes no longer accountable to the Dáil.  We have accountability on the day we elect the Taoiseach.  After that, we have nothing.  Day after day questions are not answered in this House and when difficulties arise that are dealt with in the media, we are told <Col N="50" /> that committees, commissions and task forces will deal with them and that procedures and structures and so on will be changed.  We are fed up hearing about new structures and new procedures. Despite all the tribunals, structures and procedures there are still office holders in this country, the Taoiseach and members of his Government, who do not understand the basic concept of accountability and responsibility.</P>
    <P>May I ask the ask the Taoiseach who will take the rap for this mess?  Who took the rap for the Masri passport affair?  Nobody.  Who took the rap for the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry &mdash; perhaps the journalist, Susan O'Keeffe, will take it in a couple of weeks when she comes before the court.  It is not good enough that Ministers in his Government are not prepared to be accountable and responsible to Dáil Éireann.  It is not for me to make a decision for any party, it is difficult enough to run one's own party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The issues that arise in this case are very clear and I do not believe that changing structures or mechanisms or putting in place a body such as the one I referred to in the Dáil as &ldquo;a forum for peace and reconciliation&rdquo; when we thought all the problems were over until 1997 will change the fundamental problems that have arisen in this case.  The Taoiseach does not have the capacity to lead either a single party Government or a partnership Government because bully boy tactics and a take it or leave it attitude is not the way to run a Government and it is certainly not the way to behave in a parliamentary democracy.  It is not the way to good Government or the way to create the team spirit we need if we are to have a successful Government where everybody is working together on a common agenda for a common purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fundamentally believe that the issue that faces the minority party in this <Col N="51" /> Government is so fundamental that it cannot be resolved by changing procedures, committees or putting other mechanisms in place.  That of course is a matter for them and not for me.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice defended the seven month delay and said it was not unusual but she did not tell us that her office had been consulted.  I wonder why the Minister for Justice has been silent in this matter because she has not been shy about expressing her personal opinions.  However, this morning I read in the newspaper that she too did not know about it; that a civil servant had got the warrants and had not told her.  I wonder why there is this secrecy in Government Departments.  I find it hard to accept that there is so much secrecy because from my experience as a junior Minister civil servants tell things that one might never need to know about and one gets files on things that are so irrelevant they do not matter.  I find it hard to believe that on such fundamental issues people are not told, whatever about being given the file.  We were told by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, that the way this case was handled was the way cases have been handled for the past 30 years.  Of course, the legislation under which the Attorney General was operating only took effect in early 1988 so matters could not have been dealt with like that for the past 30 years.  We have not been told the full truth, even on the basic facts.</P>
    <P>The issues at stake are very important and may have important and serious consequences for every party in this House.  We must begin to learn lessons. We have already had expensive tribunals of inquiry.  There is a great deal of disquiet about politicians in general and particularly with the politicians in Leinster House, which was evident from the low vote in both Cork by-elections. We must draw from our conclusions and learn from them.  In particular, we must be man or woman enough to take the rap in cases where we are responsible <Col N="52" /> and we must not continue to blame unfortunate civil servants who cannot speak for themselves and who generally act honourably in the interest of the State.  If mistakes were made in the Attorney General's Office that was the fault of the former Attorney General. Because of the issues surrounding this particular case the former Attorney General should not have been appointed to the Presidency of the High Court.  It was an unwise and inappropriate appointment and will cause major problems for the Taoiseach for a long time to come.  I wonder why he put so much at risk for the sake of this one person. I would like to hear his account of why he did that and whether he believes he made a mistake in persisting with the appointment last Friday?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A former Attorney General, Mr. John Murray, in a statement to the Dáil delivered on his behalf by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, on 13 December 1988, volume 385, column 1202, said:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is designated by the Constitution as the chief law officer of the State and is the guardian of the public interest.  It is he who bears ultimate responsibility for the initiation and conduct of extradition proceedings. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement succinctly summarises the issue at the core of this controversy. The Attorney General bears ultimate responsibility for the conduct of extradition proceedings.  Irrespective of whether he personally saw the file &mdash; and many people find it very difficult to believe that this was not the case, given the requirements of the 1987 Extradition Act &mdash; Mr. Whelehan bears ultimate responsibility for the manner in which his office failed for a period of seven months to process the warrants for the extradition of the child abuser, Fr. Brendan Smyth. Mr. Whelehan bears ultimate responsibility for conduct by his office which has been widely condemned and which even the Fianna Fáil Party has now stopped trying to defend. <Col N="53" /> Given what happened in the Smyth case he should simply never have been appointed to the position of President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Public anger about the handling of the case has been intensified by revulsion at the nature of the evil crimes of which Fr. Smyth was accused and ultimately convicted and sentenced by the courts in Northern Ireland, with no help from the Office of the Attorney General in this jurisdiction.  What caused so much shock in the public mind is the manner in which this case was treated in the Office of the Attorney General, as a relatively minor issue not requiring immediate attention and to be processed, according to the report submitted by the then Attorney General to the Cabinet last week, with the same degree of urgency that might be given to an application for planning permission.</P>
    <P>What message does this convey to the unfortunate victims of Fr. Smyth, many of whom are still attempting to cope with the trauma of their ordeal?  What message does this cavalier attitude convey about the degree of seriousness with which the constitutional office of Attorney General regards the crime of sexual abuse of children?</P>
    <P>The approach is further typified by the claim in the then Attorney General's report to the Government that &ldquo;there was nothing to suggest that the offences were continuing or were likely to continue either here or in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Who in the Attorney General's Office made this value judgment and what qualification did he or she have to make such a sweeping assessment, especially when all the scientific evidence is that paedophilia is a condition that is difficult to treat with success and that the rate of reoffending is high?  On what basis did the then Attorney General accept this judgment and why did the Fianna Fáil members of the Cabinet apparently regard it as satisfactory?  Are we to assume that one of the criteria used by the Office of the Attorney General to determine the urgency with which a request for extradition is handled is its judgment of <Col N="54" /> whether an offender is likely to reoffend rather than the seriousness of the offence or the rights of the victims of the accused.  Those who murder rarely reoffend.  Are we being asked to accept that a warrant for extradition of a person accused of murder would not be treated with any urgency by the Office of the Attorney General because the person sought was unlikely to reoffend or, as we have now been told by the Taoiseach, was resident in a monastery?</P>
    <P>It is not just in the Office of the Attorney General that there appears to have been serious shortcomings.  We now know that copies of the warrants were sent to the Department of Justice at the same time they were received in the Attorney General's Office.  I know the Department of Justice has no direct role in processing extradition warrants but did it not occuar to anybody in that Department to inquire what had happened to the warrants?  Did nobody in the Department of Justice consider it worthwhile to pick up the telephone and simply ask if there was a problem with these warrants, particularly having regard to the nature of the crimes for which Father Smyth was wanted?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has questions to answer but the principal and most crucial questions are for the Attorney General.  With these questions unanswered, the decision to proceed with the appointment of Mr. Whelehan to one of the most important judicial appointments in the country was almost beyond belief.  What debt of gratitude does the Taoiseach owe to Mr. Whelehan that he is prepared to put his entire political future in jeopardy to secure his appointment to the Presidency of the High Court?</P>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile the scathing criticism he made today of the handling of the warrant by the Attorney General's Office with his willingness to accept &mdash; apparently without question &mdash; the report submitted by Mr. Whelehan to last Friday's Cabinet meeting? How can the Taoiseach possibly stand over his nomination of Mr. Whelehan to the position of President of the High <Col N="55" /> Court in the light of what he said in the House today?  Although he specifically said in his statement today that the Smyth case has no bearing on the integrity of Mr. Whelehan or his appointment to the High Court, it is simply beyond belief that the Taoiseach can attempt to put that across this House.</P>
    <P>Attempts by the Taoiseach today to draw a spurious line between the concepts of responsibility and culpability will not wash.  If the procedures in the Office of the Attorney General were inadequate, then Mr. Whelehan must accept responsibility for them.  I accept that the Attorney General may not be in a position to be personally aware of every action which might be taken &mdash; or not taken &mdash; by a member of his staff, but it is reasonable to expect that he should know how long it takes to process extradition warrants in his office.  It is reasonable to expect that he should exercise sufficient control over the office to know what is going on.  It is not as if this was a case of a Minister in change of a Government Department, with thousands of staff, not being aware of the action of an individual civil servant. The Office of the Attorney General is a relatively small one, fewer than 40 staff, and there is simply no sustainable excuse for Mr. Whelehan's failures.</P>
    <P>If one lesson is to be learned from this affair it is that in future the position of Attorney General should be a full-time one with the occupant expected to devote his or her attentions solely to the affairs of that Office.  It seems such an obvious reform that I am surprised the Taoiseach did not refer to it in his statement today.  Like a number of his predecessors, Mr. Whelehan engaged in an extensive private legal practice while occupying the post of Attorney General. It is fair to ask, if Mr. Whelehan had devoted himself full-time to the job of Attorney General, whether this whole disastrous affair could have been avoided?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> The circumstances in which the appointment of Mr. Whelehan as President of the High Court was made adds insult to injury.  The manner of the decision was unprecedented &mdash; made in the absence of half of the Cabinet and the entire Labour Party membership &mdash; and was in breach of the spirit, and possibly the letter, of Article 28.4.2. of the Constitution regarding the collective authority and responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>In pushing ahead with the appointment of Mr. Whelehan to the Presidency of the High Court against the background of the unanswered questions surrounding the Smyth warrants, in the face of unprecedented public concern and with a substantial number of his Ministers opposing the move, the Taoiseach has made one error of judgment too many and may now have written his own political obituary.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is not the only one who stands accused of a serious error of political judgment.  I believe the concerns expressed by the Labour Party regarding the handling of the Smyth affair are deeply and genuinely held but I simply cannot understand why the Tánaiste, and his collegues agreed to the reappointment of Mr. Whelehan as Attorney General in January 1993 in the light of his previous record in regard to the &ldquo;X case&rdquo;, Cabinet confidentiality, the beef tribunal and other matters.</P>
    <P>Many of the decisions taken by Mr. Whelehan while he was Attorney General to the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government were also questionable. One of the last major decisions taken by Mr. Whelehan as Attorney General was to intervene to block the Comptroller and Auditor General from publishing information he had prepared on the operation of the 1993 tax amnesty, which was itself one of the most outrageous decisions taken by the Coalition. The aim of the Comptroller and Auditor General was, in his own words, to see whether the evidence he prepared &ldquo;told us anything about the effectiveness of the normal tax assessment and collection procedures of the Revenue&rdquo;. <Col N="57" /> The Attorney General intervened to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor General from making this information available to the Committee of Public Accounts, to the Dáil and to the people.</P>
    <P>My sympathy for the dilemma in which the Tánaiste now finds himself is also tempered by his refusal to heed warnings from this party and others that the inevitable outcome of coalition with Fianna Fáil would be betrayal.  Perhaps Deputy Spring was taken in by the media-constructed aura of political invincibility which had been built around him at the time of the last election and genuinely believed that he could change the nature of Fianna Fáil. However, like others before it, Labour has now found it is not possible to change the political culture of Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <P>Nothing I heard from the Taoiseach today gives me any grounds for believing that the level of trust and political cohesion, which is required in any Government if the problems of the country are to be successfully tackled, can be restored in this Coalition Government.  These exchanges constitute the death-rattle of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government and it seems to me that, given the failure of the Taoiseach to address the issues in a convincing way, the withdrawal of the Tánaiste and <Col N="58" /> his colleagues is now inevitable unless what I detect to be a deal in the speech delivered by the Taoiseach is in fact a deal.  During that speech the Taoiseach referred to the extension and the implementation of the Child Care Act, ending the custom of the appointment of the Attorney General to judicial positions, he apologised to the Tánaiste and offered to write him into the history books for his role in the peace process. He also apologised to the people, although oddly enough there is no apology in the speech to the victims of Father Smyth.</P>

      <P>I do not detect any great enthusiasm among the public for a general election but that may be the only way in which this political crisis can be resolved.  If the Government falls it will be a matter for the President to decide whether to accede to a request from the Taoiseach for a dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>If the President decides not to dissolve the Dáil, Democratic Left is quite prepared to enter serious discussions with other parties to see if an alternative administration can be formed.  We will be constructive in our approach and conscious of obligations to the public, particularly to those who voted for our party in the general election and, more recently, in the Dublin South Central and Cork North Central by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions that an alternative administration without Fianna Fáil would be unsupportive of the peace process are mischievous and without foundation. All parties in this House support the Downing Street Declaration and are participating in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The greatest threat to the peace process is from the continued existence of the paramilitary groups and from incidents such as the murder in Newry last week of Frank Kerr.  Certainly, a core principle of any Government in which Democratic Left was willing to participate would have to be full support for the Northern Ireland <Col N="59" /> peace process based on the principles of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>An alternative Government is not just a matter of mathematics.  It is not simply a question of getting the numbers together to provide an alternative to Fianna Fáil.  Any new administration must be very different from the outgoing Government.  Government is about serving the people: too often during the past two years, it has appeared to be the other way around.  Despite its lavish promises of openness and accountability, this was a Government which simply lost the run of itself and brought arrogance to new levels.</P>
    <P>Matters such as the 17 per cent increase in ministerial saleries, the appointment of an array of advisers, assistants and programme managers and the abuse of the Government jet at a time when taxpayers, who had to foot the bill, were told they had to accept cutbacks and that money was not available for this or that, did as much to destroy public confidence in this Government as any other issue.  Any new Government must learn the lessons of the past two years and avoid repeating the mistakes.  A simple gesture by a new Administration, such as withdrawing the increase in ministerial salaries, would do much to restore public confidence in the process of government.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left want a Government in which the public can have confidence. We want a clean Government from which sleaze will be eliminated which will not stumble from scandal to scandal or crisis to crisis, a Government which is not prepared to sell Irish passports to wealthy business people and which will not reward the rich by giving them tax amnesties.  We want a Government which will not continue to tax the sick and unemployed or pay lip service to them but rather will put in place programmes to deal with unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> These are issues which a new Government must address if it is to restore confidence in the democratic system.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter not only in its political implications but because it concerns children who are a vulnerable group in society.  It is ironic and tragic that we are constrained in what we can say as a result of the appointment of the Attorney General as President of the High Court and that we now face a pre-Christmas election. Christmas is a time of peace, reconciliation and good will but we are adding to the acrimony and dissention both inside and outside the House.  It is sad that the peace process is being used as a political football to try to prevent an election. That process is supposed to show how peace and reconciliation can be brought about on the island.  It is contradictory to talk about having a peace forum for people of differing views and traditions when we cannot uphold the principles of reconciliation within the partnership Government.  It flies in the face of logic that we would be sincere about one and not about the other.</P>
      <P>There has been a breakdown of understanding in the Government and the procedures and processes for creating peace seem to be clear to the Taoiseach only when he is dealing with Northern Ireland.  I gave him a book called <i>The Politics of Consensus.</i> I know he took an interest in that subject.</P>

      <P>It is clear that he has not applied its message to governing this part of the island.  The first rule of consensual politics is whether a decision <Col N="61" /> needs to be taken.  There is no need to divide if a decision does not need to be taken.  The Taoiseach said this decision was not as urgent as some people, particularly in the media, made it out to be, but the decision has been made hence the division and discord.  It is difficult to understand the motivation behind making it.  It is as if there is a third element in the coalition Government sufficiently powerful to move the State apparatus, in spite of the reservations expressed by the Dáil, to introduce various questionable measures &mdash; the scandalous tax amnesty for cheats and criminals who constitute a malodorous minority in Irish business circles, an arrangement that skirted the limits of company law upon which our credibility as a sovereign trading nation so depended.  It is amazing how powerful this element was in getting the State apparatus to move quickly and precipitiously against a young girl who was pregnant as a result of a rape, in furtherance of dogma above compassion.  It is amazing that the processing of documentation, duly submitted, can be arrested in the case which led to this debate.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a lengthy speech on remorse and resolve but gave little by way of explanation.  The Taoiseach said it would never arise again but how can such an event never occur again?  I wish that was true but the reality is it is impossible to say so.  It is time we and the Labour Party were told what changes are to be made.  Is it a change in rules or is it a matter of removing a civil servant and getting him to take flak?  Those questions were not answered.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised the question of who was accountable as if there was a doubt about it.  How can the Attorney General be anything but accountable given his position?  If a person is drunk while driving a car it does not matter who plied him with drink; he drank the alcohol and he is responsible.  The Taoiseach is fudging the issue of accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said Fianna Fáil would <Col N="62" /> never seek to justify or minimise the seriousness of the Father Smyth case. Unfortunately, by elevating Mr. Whelehan to the position he now holds without the promised public investigation or questioning the Taoiseach has minimised the seriousness of the case.  That is the issue on which we must now ponder.</P>

At that time I was the first to point out &mdash; I was looked at with some amazement &mdash; that looking at the various combinations of figures there was only one combination that could give us a Government which would last and do much of what was needed for the future. While I might disagree with some of the measures taken by the Government, I am satisfied that the view I expressed prior to its formation &mdash; that the only combination was a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government &mdash; has proved to be correct. The continuation of the Government is more important than an election. Both parties will suffer in an election.  Some people might say that this would be no harm, that they brought it on themselves, but if they suffer losses in an election what will be the position in this House afterwards?  Will there be any prospects of a stable Government being formed?  Will there be a coalition Government of two or three of the smaller parties which will try to work together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how difficult it is to work with other parties in Government.  Two of the parties on this side of the House and the two parties on the other side of the House have had experience of working in coalition Governments and they know the difficulties involved.  The Government was aware of the difficulties it faced.  Yet it has managed to achieve many things during the past two years.  This clearly indicates the capacity of the two parties to compromise and find solutions, all in the interests of the country.  If we do not have a stable Government and an election is called, <Col N="63" /> which will result in instability in this House, it is the people, some of whom are saying it will serve both parties right if they get hammered in an election, will suffer.  The Government must realise that it is the future of the public and the well being of the country that is of prime importance and not who was right, who was wrong, who did this or who did not do that.</P>
    <P>I was not in the House when the various criticisms were trotted out but I listened to every word that was said on radio.  The Opposition and those who want to hammer the Government, whether Fianna Fáil or Labour, are having a field day but it is not a great day for the country, it is a bad day for the country.  I ask the leaders of the two parties to realise that important though the issues raised by the appointment of Mr. Whelehan as President of the High Court are they are not nearly as important as the future well being of the country and the economy, not to mention the peace process.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say that the peace process should not be made a political football and I am not going to do anything of that nature.  Nevertheless I appeal to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to think back to the time before they formed the Government, and the hills they knew they had to climb.  Despite what they saw, they addressed the issue and by and large made a good job of it.  They have done a better job than would be done by a less stable Government, whether it is formed by Members of this House or as a result of an election which can only create instability.  In an election some parties will lose seats while others will gain seats and there will be more Independent Deputies which all parties agree is a bad thing.  We would put up with that, the Independents could do with more company.  This might be a stabilising factor in the midst of the chaos which I think will follow if the Government parties do not put their heads together this evening and decide, in the interests of the people and the country, not to call an election.  With all <Col N="64" /> due respect, this is not an election issue. It is so far removed from an election issue that we are wasting the time of the House talking about it.</P>
    <P>I ask the leaders of the two Government parties to get together and resolve their differences.  I ask those who criticise the Taoiseach and-or the Tánaiste to remember that it is the Government parties who decide who are the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach; it is a matter for the parties in Government to make those choices.  I say to those who argue that the Taoiseach or Tánaiste is not suitable for office or that one is more suitable than the other that we do not decide who is Taoiseach or Tánaiste, it is the Government parties who decide, the people having decided on the strength of those parties.  The leaders of those parties should get together and get back to work.</P>

In that context I said it was not a matter which had to be dealt with within days or weeks.  We are now in mid-November.  During our discussions at that time the Tánaiste and I agreed that it was not a general election issue and that the &ldquo;Four Wise Men&rdquo; should get together and put forward a resolution.  They did this and it was sent to Cabinet.  I never stated that the <Col N="65" /> decision could be deferred for up to six months.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that it was possible for the acting President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Declan Costello, to continue in that job at least from last Friday to, say, this Friday so as to allow the explanations which were provided by the Attorney General to be made more publicly available, scrutinised and examined?  What was the rush to get the entire job done on that one day, particularly when part of the Government had absented itself from the meeting?</P>

      <P>I made clear in my statement to the House the reasons the decision was proceeded with on that day.  As a former Minister, Deputy Bruton knows full well that the Executive makes the decisions and it is accountable to the House.  That is the correct procedure under the Constitution, and he knows that.  That is the procedure I followed in this case.</P>
      <P>We had a very long Cabinet meeting. I reject the suggestion by anybody in the House that our meetings have been shouting matches.  I can say without fear of contradiction that Deputy Bruton's description of the nature of our relationship at Cabinet as one of &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; was never the case.  Neither were there any votes by this Government or the previous Government.  I hope Deputy Bruton will understand that the Executive carried out its role first and that it is accountable to the House.  That is why I am here today.  I made it clear at all times &mdash; I made this clear as early as, I think, last Thursday or Friday &mdash; that the Executive is accountable to the House and that I would answer questions.</P>

      <P>If a question is raised which requires supplementary information from the former Attorney General, the President of the High Court, how is it possible for the Taoiseach to obtain that information from him now <Col N="66" /> that he is no longer in any way accountable to the Dáil because of the Government decision?  Does the Taoiseach not realise that it is impossible for the occupant in this instance to be accountable when he is no longer in a position where he is answerable to the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach has appointed him to the High Court?  Does the Taoiseach understand that that change in his status means that accountability and answerability, so far as Mr. Whelehan's behaviour is concerned, is impossible? If any question is raised here which requires further information the Taoiseach is not in a position to check it out with Mr. Whelehan who is now a judge and thereby in a position where there can be no communication between himself and the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton would have people believe that the only reason for making a decision last Friday was to try, in some way, to prevent the House from asking questions about this whole affair.  I made it very clear in my statement that that was not the case, that I was accountable to the Dáil and here to answer questions.  Every Member of this House knows that the only forum in which an Attorney General can be made accountable under the law is at a Cabinet meeting, and we had a long Cabinet meeting in relation to the issue. The Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government of the day, is accountable to this House for the Attorney General and that is the exercise in which we are engaged now.  There was no question of depriving the House of this opportunity to ask questions.  If Deputy Bruton wants any further information on the Attorney General's office I will certainly do everything I can to obtain it for him.</P>

      <P>May I ask one question of a procedural nature?  Why is the Minister for Justice not in the House in view of the fact that her office received a warrant on exactly the same day as the Attorney General's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice was present all evening.  Like others she left but I have no doubt she will be back.  In her absence I will define the role of the Department of Justice &mdash; a question raised by Deputies Bruton and Harney.  The impression created by today's media, reporting on the role of the Department of Justice in the Smyth extradition case, is misleading in that it proceeds on the false assumption that the Department of Justice was in possession of certain essential information. The factual position, for the benefit of the House, is as follows.  As is normal practice in extradition cases, copies of the warrants in the Smyth case were sent by the Garda authorities to the Department of Justice and to the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
      <P>However, the information contained in the warrants stated the name of the person sought but without any reference to his being a priest, gave a previous Northern Ireland address only and signified the offence by a reference to named persons without giving their ages and relevant provisions of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861, of indecent assault against a male and in one case a female.  There was no information whatever available to the Department of Justice until the recent controversy arose to suggest that this was a case of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The requirement, when extradition warrants are first received &mdash; this applies in all cases &mdash; is for a determination by the Attorney General in respect of the functions imposed on him under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, and in relation to advising on whether the request meets the requirement of our law.  No decision or action is required by the Minister for Justice or the Department of Justice in advance of the Attorney General's determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> The procedure in all extradition cases &mdash; which was followed in this case &mdash; is to allow the legal issues, which the Attorney General is required by law to consider, to be dealt with in accordance with established arrangements which include the provision of such additional information as is necessary for that purpose and in the manner judged best by the Attorney General's office.  No pressure would be brought to bear by the Department of Justice, and it would be improper for it to do so, unless it becomes specifically aware of some special circumstances as, for example, a pending release from prison, the imminent departure of the person concerned from the jurisdiction or pressure from the authorities requesting extradition. No such signal was received in this case by the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Given the quote I read into the record earlier from a former Attorney General, John Murray, to the effect that it is the Attorney General who bears ultimate responsibility for the initiation and conduct of extradition proceedings how can the Taoiseach stand over his statement that: &ldquo;The emergence of the Smyth case did not affect the integrity of the Attorney General, nor his suitability for high office&rdquo;. How can he reconcile those two issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have attempted to do in the House today was to separate two questions from each other; first, the Attorney General himself and, second, the procedures of the Attorney General's office in dealing with this extradition case &mdash; the Smyth case as we have come to know it.  I will take the procedures first.  What is the normal procedure in the Attorney General's office for dealing with a warrant? Normally, an outside agency which is seeking to extradite somebody out of this jurisdiction is in touch with the Attorney General's office.  There is much exchange of information in relation to the circumstances in which extradition may eventually be sought. That normally gets rid of much of the preparatory work that is usually done by officials before it is presented to the Attorney General for final determination. It is the Attorney General &mdash; and he or she alone &mdash; who can make that decision about extradition.  There was no advance notice or otherwise in relation to this case.  I understand it took approximately two years to put the warrants together.  Consequently when they arrived in the Attorney General's office the matter started from scratch.  I am not defending the seven month delay, which I have already said was unacceptable.  It is clear the system in that office operated successfully over a long time, but in this case it failed.  The Government must take responsibility for that and ensure the procedures and <Col N="71" /> structures in the Attorney General's office are such that a similar case will not be allowed to happen in the future.</P>
      <P>I have already taken action in that regard.  The former Attorney General, before taking up a higher judicial office, directed every member of his staff to ensure that all extradition warrants of this type are brought to attention immediately.  The new Attorney General, in conjunction with the secretary of personnel and management development in the Department of Finance, the secretary to the Government and the secretary of the Department of Justice, has been given responsibility to examine the structures in place in the Attorney General's office and to report within three weeks on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to making whatever changes are necessary. Radical changes will have to be made because the procedures and structures of that office have not been changed for approximately 40 years and I am sure no Member would claim that changes are not overdue.  That will ensure that this type of situation does not arise again.</P>
      <P>I do not know anybody who does not accept the Attorney General was not aware, or made aware, of the existence of the warrant in question and the events of the past couple of weeks do not change that, nor does it change his suitability for higher office.  There is nothing to say he is not as suitable today for higher office as he was a few weeks ago.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>I tried my best to give an insight into the workings of the system and how it failed in these circumstances, but it worked successfully for a long time.  We accept responsibility for its failure in this case.  The matter has caused a great deal of anxiety to many families and neither I, nor I am sure any other Member, would attempt to say that any one of us is more concerned than another about the sexual abuse of children.  It is an abuse of the family and of freedom &mdash; it is obnoxious.</P>

      <P>Has the Attorney General at any time accepted responsibility for the negligence in dealing with this case and, if so, would that not call into question his suitability for higher office?  Will the Taoiseach accept that if the Attorney General had been a full time Attorney General there might have been less chance of such negligence? Does he intend to ensure that future Attorneys General, at least under his Administration, are appointed to the post in a full time capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Deputy in the latter part of his question and will consider it in terms of future Attorneys General.  I have taken the necessary steps to ensure the system will not fail again.  New administrative arrangements have been put in place already; future Attorneys General will be notified of such cases immediately In addition, the Attorney General has issued a directive to ensure that these types of cases are given priority over everything else.  From time to time the Government sends directives in regard to legislation to the Attorney General's office which require immediate attention and that can affect the work of the office.  To ensure that nothing gets in the way of giving priority to such cases in the future, the Attorney General and the Government must be informed of them immediately so that we do not give directives in regard to legislation at that time.  It is fair to point out that since this Government took up office the Attorney General's office has produced 40 per cent more in legislative terms than previously with the appointment of only two additional trainees.  However, no statement I make here can explain the failure of the system in this case.</P>

      <P>It is very clear from the Taoiseach's reply that there is no contrition whatsoever and that he stands fully over the decision he took on Friday last.  May I ask why he choose to bring about this instability, despite his having quoted Professor Basil Chubb? I had to check twice because I thought he was quoting the theologian, Cardinal Basil Hume, such was the theological content of the point.  The appropriate quotation reads:</P>
      <P>... by custom the Attorney General, a political appointee, who is the Government's legal adviser and State prosecutor, is always offered any vacancy to the High Court that occurs during his term of office. </P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there were two vacancies in the High Court, one for a member of the High Court and the other for its presidency?  Why did the Taoiseach bring about this instability by insisting on appointing the then Attorney General to both vacancies? Would he agree that he insulted the institutions of the State, the Cabinet, the Oireachtas and the courts by his abuse of power on Friday last?  Is it not true the Taoiseach gambled that the Labour Party would not dare walk out following the results of the Cork by-elections and that the instability of which he now asks us to believe he is fearful was caused by his reckless gambling?</P>

      <P>In the course of his statement the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is responsible for the decision whether to grant or refuse an extradition request. </P>
      <P>When the Extradition (Amendment) Bill was introduced in 1987 he was a member of the Cabinet.  Would he agree that the only reason that Bill was introduced at that time was to solve a problem within Fianna Fáil who had political difficulties about the whole principle of extradition?  Does he recall that the Taoiseach of the day came into this Chamber &mdash; I was then Opposition spokesman on Justice &mdash; and gave a guarantee, for the benefit of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, that the Attorney General personally would deal with every extradition request that came into his office?  Does he agree that the only reason for the introduction of that Extradition (Amendment) Bill was the resolution of a political problem? Would he agree that, at that time, the Fine Gael Party proposed an amendment to transfer that responsibility from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the simple reason, as we pointed out at the time, that the Attorney General was semipolitical, being appointed by the Taoiseach of the day? Would he agree that the justification for adhering to the Attorney General was to satisfy the political problems within Fianna Fáil, who defeated that amendment?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach now expects us to believe, given the background to the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987 and the political difficulties within the Fianna Fáil Party over extradition, it would be seven months before the Attorney General would see an extradition request despite the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I recall it, Deputy Barrett was the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice at that time.  If my memory serves me correctly, the objective of that Bill was to ensure that, whenever the extradition of somebody from this jurisdiction to another was sought, the onus was placed on the Attorney General to ensure that that person could expect a fair trial, that there was a reasonable prospect of such a fair trial, that evidence existed and had been checked out to exist, and that there was a case to be answered.  I have been paraphrasing from memory.  Deputy Barrett tabled a worth-while amendment to that Bill to the effect &mdash; again I am relying on my memory &mdash; that, whenever charges related to offences committed a long time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be careful about what he says.  The Attorney General's report to the Cabinet was incorrect.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, said, column 345, Volume 376, No. 1 of the Official Report of 1 December 1987:</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that a person's return may be refused where, by reason of lapse of time it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to return him. </P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett can make his own point about what was or was not political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an insinuation that, in some way or other, all of these extradition cases are political.  I want to put <Col N="79" /> on the record that since I became Taoiseach the Attorney General has never discussed any extradition warrant with me.  I have outlined the constitutional position of the Attorney General.  It should be quite clear to everybody that, in future, he or she alone must make the determination at the end of the day. Deputy Barrett's amendment to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 provided that the Attorney General had to establish, whenever very old charges were brought, whether there was a reasonable chance that justice delayed could be justice denied.  In the case of the Smyth extradition warrant the charges ranged over a period going back some 28, 27, 22 years and, if I recall correctly, the most recent six years ago.  I acknowledge that Deputy Barrett tabled that amendment in order to protect people.  I have already stated clearly that I consider the seven months in this case to be totally unacceptable but nonetheless a reasonable period must elapse in any extradition case because we have witnessed both extremes.  For example, we saw Dominic McGlinchey arrested somewhere on a St. Patrick's Day, the Supreme Court met and he was over the Border that night.  In the end it transpired that the basis, evidence and so on produced at the time, did not exist when he was charged and was acquitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad we have returned to the question of the warrants because we had deviated from it.  The former Attorney General placed much reliance on the preparatory work that is done leading up to his seeing a file and making his determination as required under the Act.  Nothing in what the Taoiseach has said gives me any reason to believe that any work was done on the file.  I would love to see that file. Was anything done?  Was a telephone call made to the Northern Ireland prosecuting authorities?  Was contact made with the RUC to flesh out the details of the warrants?  The Taoiseach said that an assumption &mdash; a comfortable assumption &mdash; was made by the legal assistant dealing with the matter that there was no danger to the public because Fr. Smyth was living at Kilnacrott Abbey.  One simple inquiry to the RUC would have revealed that this man was a persistent paedophile, that they had records of his persistent offending and that the very nature of the offences stretching over many years would have indicated a persistent system of reoffending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as helpful as I can.  Following receipt of the extradition warrants in the Attorney General's office on 30 April 1993 the following took place between the office of the UK Attorney General and the office of the Irish Attorney General.  A letter dated 4 May 1993 received via the diplomatic bag in the Attorney General's Office on 14 May 1993 was sent by the UK Attorney General to the Irish Attorney General enclosing the additional extradition documents consisting of a confirmatory note on statements of facts and of law.  This letter was <Col N="81" /> addressed to the Irish Attorney General. It was contained with the other documents in an envelope addressed to a senior officer who was in charge of this file.  Somebody asked earlier how many people worked on this file.  The answer is just one.  Mr. Whelehan never saw this letter which was retained by the senior officer.</P>
      <P>On 20 September 1993 an officer of the UK Attorney General's office contacted the Attorney General's office regarding the case.</P>
      <P>On 14 October 1993 the officer of the UK Attorney General's office contacted the Attorney General's office regarding the case.  On 18 November 1993 the officer of the UK Attorney General's office contacted the officer in the Attorney General's office about the case.  On 6 December 1993 the UK officer contacted the officer in the Attorney General's office about the case to inform him that Fr. Smyth was returning voluntarily to Northern Ireland.  The official is a senior officer in the Attorney General's office.  It is not known what rank the English officials held.  It is assumed that they are of equivalent rank.  All concerned have professional qualifications.</P>
      <P>In relation to additional information on work done on the file, the following work appears to have been done: (a) the Chief State Solicitor's office checked the warrants and noticed a number of possible defects which would have to be corrected; (b) in the Attorney General's office, the file indicates that work was done in the form of research or consideration of the issues on five occasions or so.  There appears to be five different memoranda or sets of notes with nothings on them which would support this proposition. No submission at any time was prepared or submitted to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if information regarding the matter was sought from anyone such as the RUC, the Garda etc.  No such information was sought.  I was asked if any activity of any kind was indicated in the file.  The only activity consists of the notes and memoranda indicating legal <Col N="82" /> research plus the Chief State Solicitors's office note.  No opinion was obtained from counsel.</P>
    <P>I was asked if there had been contact with Kilnacrott Abbey.  No such contact was made.  The Attorney General's office proceeded on the assumption that Fr. Smyth was resident at the Abbey.  As a result of contact with the UK Attorney General's office it has been ascertained that negotiations between Fr. Smyth's legal advisers and the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions took place on or about 22 November 1993.  The Director of Public Prosecutions did not believe Fr. Smyth was anywhere else but in Kilnacrott Abbey but had no information on his file regarding the seven month period. Again, I believe that this failure to check is part of the system failure.  It is a judgment that is exercised as to the urgency of individual cases and the stage at which information on them and papers connected with them should be furnished to the Attorney General.  The importance and urgency of this case was clearly not appreciated or understood by the Attorney General's office.  As to the assumption made about Fr. Smyth's residence in Kilnacrott Abbey, nobody in this House would agree with that.</P>

      <P>Arising from that, will the Taoiseach confirm that while all this activity was taking place the Attorney General was actively considering amendments to the extradition legislation? Over that seven month period did the Attorney General never ask his officers about extradition warrants?  Did he never make the kind of routine inquiry of his officers that might have elicited information about this case.  When the Taoiseach tells us that the Attorney General did not know or that he was not made aware, is he telling us that the Attorney General did not ask about extradition warrants or that, if he did ask, he was given misleading information?</P>

When that is completed they are passed to the Attorney General for determination and a decision.  That is how the system works and has worked.

      <P>I do not believe that I, Deputy Dukes or other Members would have made the assumptions made. However, those assumptions were made and a judgment taken.  It was wrong to <Col N="87" /> treat the case as an ordinary extradition case.  When dealing with an extradition case one must refer to case law, statutes, etc.  Which may impinge on the rights of the citizen to be extradited.  We are all aware that a large number of extradition warrants are contested in this country. Consequently, a detailed level of investigation and preparatory work must take place.  I have said repeatedly here that this file was never submitted to the former Attorney General nor was he made aware of it.  Nobody doubts it, that is the reality and nothing I say will change that.</P>

Will he agree that they must have been known to the then Attorney General who must have known how every warrant which came into his office was dealt with?  Must it not have been <Col N="88" /> the case that Mr. Whelehan, the then Attorney General, knew he did not see documents for considerable periods of time when they were dealt with by others and that he did not exercise personally any responsibility to determine the priority of urgent cases?  Does it not follow clearly that the political responsibility for the maladministration lay with the person whose duty it was to correct it, the then Attorney General?  In view of that why did the Taoiseach reward such incompetence with promotion to high judicial office?</P>

New administrative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the Attorney General is informed of every extradition request immediately it is received by the office.  In addition, the Attorney General has directed that henceforth absolute priority over the other work, irrespective of its importance or urgency, will be given to any extradition request for a person accused of abusing children.  I assure the House there will not be another Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  The first essential steps are being taken.  Three secretaries are considering the basis of management in the Attorney General's office and that is only right.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter, with the Fr. Smyth case generally and with many of the questions raised this evening, it is necessary to draw a very clear distinction between two explanations for the failure in the Attorney General's office: first, the failure to act because of serious misjudgment by an individual or individuals or because of inefficiencies in the way in which the office is administered; second, the question of deliberate intention not to act for what I describe as sinister motives &mdash; for example, an inclination to delay or somehow cover up serious offending simply because the alleged perpetrator was a priest.</P>

In view of the fact that for some months prior to the appointment of the new President of the High Court he was well aware of the strong opposition of the Labour Party in the partnership Government why did the Taoiseach persist and proceed with the appointment? How did he come to the conclusion that the Labour Party Ministers were merely absenting themselves from the Government meeting to register their non-par-ticipation in the decision to appoint Mr. Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court when they did not return for the remainder of the meeting? The explanation given by the Taoiseach so far to the House is not plausible.</P>

      <P>In my opinion it follows that I personally and the Government as a whole must take some responsibility for the deficiencies in the operation of extradition procedures in the Attorney General's Office as brought to light in the Smyth case. </P>
      <P>Does this mean he is saying that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Labour Party should share in the guilt of the decision he made last Friday?  He said: &ldquo;My view of good Government is that it must be decisive&rdquo;.  Is he contrasting this with the Labour Party's insistence on accountability as indecision and in effect is he not getting in his retaliation first so to speak?  Why was none of the 17 or so existing High Court judges from whom every President of the High Court since 1924 was chosen not suitable for the position on this occasion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For example the latest report on the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the beginning of the year shows that during 1992 four persons were extradited to England for assault and sexual offences against children.  During 1993 one warrant was received in respect of <Col N="106" /> the charge of rape and the person was extradited.</P>
      <P>I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the system will not fail again.  New administrative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the Attorney General is informed of every extradition request immediately it is received in his office.  In addition the Attorney General has directed that henceforth absolute priority over other work irrespective of its importance or urgency will be given to any extradition request for a person accused of abusing children.  I can assure the House that there will not be another case of this type.  I have also decided there should be a thorough review of the operations of the office and this will be completed in the shortest possible time, within three weeks and before that, if possible. Deputy Blaney in this House suggested that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and I should get together and put the country and the economy first.  I concur with those sentiments and I hope that this Government will not fall before it has had an opportunity to see the Programme for Government and all it entails carried through to a successful conclusion.  The Irish people will be the judge of whether the Programme for Government will have their support for the future and they will say what they think of the Government during its period of office.  It has been suggested by Deputy De Rossa that I am unsympathetic to Fr. Smyth's victims &mdash; that is totally untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stressed that I abhor and condemn any such acts against children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the accountability of the Attorney General to this House.  I have dealt with this matter fully in my statement.  The Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer and is not part of the Executive of the State.  As well as being the legal officer of the Government he has a quasi-judical role.  In the case of the 1987 Extradition Act, he has a clear statutory function.  He is not answerable to the Government nor to the Dáil for the exercise of this function.  The importance of the independence of the Attorney General has been emphasised many times in our courts.  As the Supreme Court put it in McLoughlin <i>v</i> the Minister for Social Welfare, 1956, the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government, his is an independent position.  He is a great officer of State with grave responsibilities of a quasi-judicial as well as an Executive nature.  While he is in office he holds, and must hold, if he is to do his duty and discharge his responsibilities, an independent position.  He is specifically excluded from being a member of the Government which again underlines his independent position.</P>
      <P>It would clearly be quite inconsistent with the constitutional independence of the Attorney General if he were to be answerable to Dáil Éireann.  My statement sets out fully the reasons the appointment of the President of the High Court was proceeded with and the circumstances involved.  As I said, I was given no advance warning that my partnership colleagues intended to leave the Government meeting were the issues of this appointment to be decided.  I repeat that I genuinely regret the misinterpretation that arose and any inadvertant offence caused to the Tánaiste or his ministerial colleagues or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to that decision being taken the <Col N="108" /> only outstanding issue was whether the decision required to be deferred in order to allow me to be accountable on the Attorney General's behalf to the Dáil on the extradition case.  As I said, I sought advice on the proper procedures and was confirmed in my view that this postponement was unnecessary because accountability arises for all decisions that have been taken.</P>
    <P>There is no question, as Deputy Bruton suggests, that I hold the Labour Party in contempt &mdash; I hope I have already dealt with that allegation.  I paid tribute in my statement on a number of occasions to the indispensable role in both the Northern Ireland talks process and the peace process which the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has played. The two of us working as a team have reconciled the up to now irreconcilable position that existed for 25 years and for anyone to suggest that that success could be achieved by one of the parties involved having contempt for another is simply not plausible nor acceptable to me.  The Tánaiste's ministerial colleagues and his party know full well that they too, along with the rest of us, have made a great contribution to the many achievements of this Administration and that we work well as a team.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton questions the existence of precedence in relation to the appointment of the President of the High Court.  I have already given him the statement of one of the most eminent authorities on constitutional Government in Ireland, Professor Basil Chubb.  The practice of appointing Attorneys General to the superior courts existed prior to the foundation of the State and has continued since then. Thirteen Attorneys General have been so appointed since 1924&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government is appalled at the genocide and mass murder which have taken place in Rwanda and we are particularly horrified by the numerous atrocities which have been committed against children. Ireland has been active at both UN and EU level in pressing for the early establishment of an international tribunal to bring the perpetrators of this terrible violence to justice and to end the cycle of killing with impunity in Rwanda. Against this background, I welcome the decision last week by the UN Security Council to establish an international tribunal for the prosecution both of persons responsible for genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda and of Rwandan citizens <Col N="115" /> responsible for such violations in neighbouring states, over the period 1 January to 31 December 1994.</P>
      <P>In addition to the establishment of an international tribunal, there is, as I indicated to the House on 18 October, an obvious need to monitor the human rights situation in Rwanda and to prevent further human rights violations from occurring.  On that occasion, I expressed concern that no more than 30 of the 147 human rights monitors recommended by the UN Commission for Human Rights had been put in place.  I am pleased to be able to report that the European Commission, with Ireland's support, is currently engaged in organising a contingent of EU human rights monitors within the framework of the overall UNCHR operation and that we intend to contribute to this contingent.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to address the security situation in the refugee camps and in particular to deal with the violence and intimidation in these camps. The remit of the International Tribunal for Rwanda extends to acts of violence already committed in the refugee camps but in addition, there is clearly a need for urgent action to prevent further outbreaks of violence.  The UN Secretary-General is currently considering the options in this regard and we are following developments closely.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to press for early progress in addressing the human rights situation in Rwanda, with a view both to bringing to justice the perpetrators of violence and to preventing further violence.</P>

While the Civil Service Commission from time to time holds competitions confined solely to people who are registered as having a disability, it is open to anyone with or without a disability to apply for any open recruitment competition for which they are eligible. There are no central records of the number of staff with disabilities recruited by means of standard open competitions or their date of appointment. The information on newly recruited staff supplied by Departments to the central database in my Department does not identify staff with disabilities, nor do I consider it appropriate that it should.</P>
      <P>Each Head of Department is fully aware of the Government policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities.  In addition, the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service, a copy of which is issued to all staff, calls on all Government Departments to continue to play their full part in employing people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayeer was in seasonal employment from 3 June 1994 to 30 July 1994.  Before and after this period he was in receipt of unemployment benefit.  When he ceased employment he submitted an application for repayment of tax to the inspector of taxes on 16 August 1994 on which he stated that he would resume work before 5 April 1995 &ldquo;if work becomes available&rdquo;.  However, where the taxpayer remains unemployed, he can continue to submit claims at four weekly intervals to the inspector (up to 5 April next) for repayment of any tax paid.</P>
      <P>In this case, a repayment of £214.81 which took into account the taxpayer's earnings from his employment, the unemployment benefit received by him and his accumulated tax-free allowances to week 21, as issued to him on 12 September 1994.</P>
      <P>A further application was received by the inspector on 15 September 1994 and again taking into consideration the above factors the inspector reviewed his tax affairs to week 26 and as a result a cheque in settlement for £7.37 was issued to him on 3 November 1994.</P>
      <P>A balancing statement will issue to the taxpayer at the end of the tax year. This will include his marriage allowance from 5 October 1994 onward.</P>

      <Quest>the reason co-habiting couples do not enjoy the same tax allowance as that of married couples; if he will reply to a letter (details supplied) dated 22 September 1994, regarding this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples under social welfare provisions arises out of the 1989 Supreme Court decision in the Hyland case.  This found that the social welfare provisions in question in that case were unconstitutional in that they treated a married couple living <Col N="120" /> together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  The social welfare provisions now in operation explicitly give cohabiting couples the same treatment as married couples in determining the level of entitlement to benefits.  The effect of the provisions, therefore, is to preclude cohabiting couples from receiving better treatment than married couples.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tax position, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, it should be pointed out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance (and double rate bands) is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>vs</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances because of the way they are treated by the two systems, in particular those who are not in a position to enter into legal marriages within the State.  In this regard, I should add that an expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems has been established by my colleague, Deputy Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  This group will, <i>inter alia,</i> be looking at the position in which cohabiting couples find themselves.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government is committed to holding a referendum on divorce.  In these circumstances, it is difficult to foresee changes in tax law in this area, pending the outcome of the referendum.  In relation to the letter mentioned in the question I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a reply issued on 10 November 1994.</P>

      <P>As the policy of the Government is to widen the tax base in order to continue the reforms made in the tax code in recent years the introduction of any new relief, except in exceptional circumstances where it would lead to the creation of sustainable employment, would be inconsistent with that policy.</P>
      <P>I should point out that while there are no special reliefs in the income tax code specifically for the preservation of thatched cottages, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982 does provide for tax relief for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of a significant building, which might include a thatched cottage, approved under that section.</P>
      <P>In addition, a grant scheme is administered by the Department of the Environment in respect of necessary works of renewing or repairing the thatched roofs of houses.

      <P>It would seem that the primary additional expenses arising for disabled persons, particularly those in employment to whom a tax allowance would be of most relevance, would be related to mobility and medical needs.  In this regard, the tax system already provides significant assistance.  Disabled drivers and passengers with severe mobility problems may, subject to certain conditions, avail of a scheme whereby VAT and VRT are not chargeable on the purchase of a vehicle which is specially constructed or adapted to take account of <Col N="122" /> their disability.  The scheme also provides for an exemption from road tax and a relief from excise duty on fuel.</P>
      <P>As regards medical expenses, income tax relief is available in respect of medical insurance premiums and an allowance is available in respect of non-reim-bursable medical expenses in excess of £100 single-£200 married incurred in a tax year.  In addition, there are income tax reliefs in the tax code for incapacitated children and for the employment of a housekeeper to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or spouse.</P>
      <P>These, of course, are only some of the wide range of State supports and services in place for the assistance of disabled persons generally.  However, I do not consider the tax system to be an appropriate vehicle for making additional provisions.  I believe that the legitimate needs of disabled persons can best be dealt with through the direct expenditure system where such needs can be more accurately assessed by trained professionals and addressed wherever appropriate.</P>
      <P>I might add that tax policy in recent years has been to broaden or, at a minimum, maintain the tax base and to apply any available funds for the reduction of tax rates and the extension of the standard rate band.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> I can confirm that I have received representations from the company in question seeking relief from the obligation to pay VAT at the point of entry on certain imports from developing countries.  However, the position is there is no provision under Irish VAT law whereby such concessionary treatment could be granted to particular companies or categories of goods.  The complete abolition of VAT at point of entry would be required in order to provide the type of concession being sought.  Because of the very significant cash-flow loss to the Exchequer which would be involved, this course of action could not be contemplated in present budgetary circumstances.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1990 all funds for lottery-approved programmes were voted in a single subhead in the Vote for my Department.  The Department in turn, released funds to suspense accounts maintained by the Departments directly responsible for the relevant lottery-funded programmes.

      <P>It is important to note that the Programme for Government, which covers a five-year period, makes clear that all its commitments are subject to the overriding budgetary targets contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of an allowance for <Col N="127" /> tenants in private rented accommodation is one of a number of related measures set out in the programme under the title of Charter of Tenants' Rights.  The proposal for tax relief for tenants will, therefore, be considered in the context, not only of the budgetary situation, but also within the overall package of measures being developed by the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal.</P>

      <Quest>the number of payments and amounts paid out by health boards in rent allowances to single people living within 20 miles of their families; the criteria for such payments in view of the fact that different community welfare officers seem to adopt differing standards in deciding whether the applicants were forced to leave home or did so of their own accord.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme allows health boards to assist eligible people with the cost of private rented accommodation or mortgage interest payments.</P>
      <P>There is no information available on the number of rent allowances in payment to single people living within 20 miles of their families.</P>
      <P>At the end of July 1994, there were approximately 30,000 rent supplement cases in payment in all health boards.  It is estimated that 12,900 or 43 per cent of these cases are single people with no child dependants.  It is estimated that 7,200 of the 12,900 cases are under 25 years of age.  This represents 24 per cent of total rent supplement cases in payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's guidelines indicate that young single people seeking a rent supplement from a Health Board must demonstrate a valid reason for leaving home.  Such reasons would include moving to seek employment or the existence of serious social problems within the family home which make it necessary <Col N="128" /> for the young person to leave home. Where there are serious domestic problems the guidelines specify that independent verification should be sought by the Health Board from social workers or others familiar with the family situation.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation are being reviewed.  I will be in a position to publish them in the near future.</P>

      <P>Participants in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; educational schemes for long term unemployed people and lone parents may continue to receive their normal full social welfare payment and retain a range of secondary benefits; however, there is no additional allowance payable towards the cost of child-minding expenses for such participants.</P>
      <P>In exceptional circumstances health boards may assist with the cost of child minding.  It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that such child-care is normally part-time and is provided by voluntary organisations as a support to mothers where there are serious social problems, for example, drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very keen to offer lone parents or people in long term unemployment every chance to improve their skills and to return to the workforce.  Earlier this year I made special arrangements under the lone parents allowance scheme to improve the overall net income position <Col N="129" /> of lone parents who are in paid employment. From July 1994, up to £30 per week of a working lone parent's earnings is disregarded in assessing means for lone parents allowance.  This exemption applies in addition to the long-standing arrangement whereby reasonable certified child-minding/ travel expenses are disregarded when calculating a working parent's entitlement to lone parents allowance.  Only half of the balance of the lone parent's earnings are assessed as means.</P>
    <P>In 1993, grants totalling £117,000 were given by the Department of Social Welfare to 35 voluntary and community organisations around the country for projects aimed at helping lone parents to get back into the workforce or participate in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education. Some of the projects funded that year included the provision of creche facilities for young mothers attending educational courses.  This year a sum of £200,000 has been allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The provision of special assistance towards the cost of child-minding facilities for lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments who are participating in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education schemes, would have financial implications which could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A recipient of unemployment assistance at the long term rate can claim disability benefit in the event of illness.  However, disability benefit is a short term payment and is not, therefore, eligible for payment of the Christmas bonus.  Last July, the weekly <Col N="130" /> rate of disability benefit was brought into line with that applying to long term unemployment assistance, that is, £61 per week personal rate.</P>
      <P>Payment of a Christmas bonus this year of 70 per cent of normal weekly payments has been approved by the Government.  There will be a minimum payment of £20 and, in all, over 1.2 million people will benefit (733,000 recipients and their 488,000 dependants) at an estimated cost of £37.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus was introduced originally in 1980 for elderly and other pensioners.  It was subsequently extended to include long term unemployed people in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance. People in receipt of invalidity pension are also covered for the bonus.  Any further extension of the Christmas bonus to other categories of recipients would have considerable cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special arrangements which I introduced for homemakers are designed to ensure that such homemakers do not suffer a loss of pension entitlement because of time spent full time at home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> From 6 April 1994, time spent working in the home rearing young children up to 6 years of age or caring for incapacitated people will be disregarded in determining entitlement to Old Age (Contributory) Pension.  A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.  I am examining the possibility of further improving these proposals in the context of next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> considered the issue of gaps in insurance and recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime, where for example an average of 45 or over would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of 10 to 14 contributions.  They also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased to 520 contributions (10 years), which would then represent 20 per cent of the potential maximum number of contributions which could be registered.</P>
    <P>The report and the recommendations are at present being studied within my Department and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report.  I am concerned about the situation of these older women, whose families are reared and those who have already retired and are classed as dependants of their husbands &mdash; qualifying for an extra allowance on his pension, which, in today's terms amounts to 70 per cent approximately of a personal entitlement.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greater progress towards providing these women with their own separate entitlement to a pension on retirement.

      <P>The free travel scheme is intended to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems. Expenditure on the free travel scheme will amount to almost £30 million this year and will benefit some 440,000 people.  Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception and are necessary on city routes because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>In the case of city bus services for Dublin, Cork and Limerick provided by Bus Átha Cliath or Bus Éireann, free travel is not available from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. each day from Monday to Friday.  There are no restrictions on passholders travelling on Dublin Bus services before 7 a.m. In the case of Bus Éireann long distance buses, the time restriction is limited to Fridays only from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. when passholders must pay for up to the first 20 miles outside Dublin, Cork or Limerick.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handi-capped people, people attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations are made to me from time to time to reduce or abolish the current time restrictions.  Any change is likely to have significant cost implications for the carriers involved who in <Col N="133" /> turn would be seeking compensation from my Department.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established in 1989 to give unemployed people a &ldquo;second <Col N="134" /> chance&rdquo; to obtain second level education in specially run courses organised by the vocational education committees. It was initially confined to people on the live register which was the main target of the scheme.  In 1993 it was decided to allocate up to 10 per cent of places to other social welfare categories such as unmarried mothers, widows and deserted wives.</P>
      <P>The number of places available in any year is a matter for the Minister for Education and is related to the likely demand, the capability of the vocational education committees to provide them and the financial resources available.  I understand participation at the end of the 1993-94 academic year stood at 4,073 people of which 429 or 10.5 per cent were from social welfare categories other than unemployed people and that some 5,000 places were approved for the academic year 1994-95 with a proportional number reserved for those other than unemployed people.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme, which I introduced in 1990, is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments in meeting the costs of children's school uniforms and footwear. People on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme, which is administered by the health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, operates from the beginning of June to the end of September every year.  The rates of allowance are £50 for a child attending secondary school and £35 for a child attending primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme is administered in the Cork area by the Southern Health <Col N="136" /> Board and applications for the allowance are processed by community welfare officers at the various health centres.</P>
    <P>The board has advised that arrangements for the 1995 scheme will be advertised in the local newspapers early next May.  People who qualified for the allowance this year who reside in the Southern Health Board area will automatically receive an application form for completion in respect of the 1995 scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a health board may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need which could include assistance with the cost of school clothing. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment; however, each case would be decided on its merits by the health board.  Parents who feel that they may be eligible for such a payment should contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>

      <P>Over the past few years, I have introduced a number of &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education schemes on a pilot basis, both at second level and at third level, which give long term unemployed people and lone parents the opportunity to improve their academic qualifications and thereby enhance their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Participants <Col N="137" /> in those schemes who are unemployed, receive a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments as well as any social welfare secondary benefits they were entitled to, including rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I introduced the third level allowance Scheme in July 1990 and participation levels have increased every year.  Over 900 people are expected to participate in the current 1994-95 academic year.</P>
      <P>Currently, the allowance is not available to people pursuing post-graduate studies except the Higher Diploma in Education as this qualification is necessary to enable certain people to obtain employment from existing qualifications e.g. certain part-time teachers can secure full time posts and so end their dependance on my Department during periods they are not employed.</P>
      <P>In the context of the ongoing review of these schemes, the situation of other people who require a post-graduate qualification to obtain employment will be further examined.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Register of Titles that the original Instrument referred to appears to have been misfiled and, consequently, as of this date, it is not possible for the Land Registry to issue the certified copy sought by the solicitor.  Search procedures to locate the instrument are in progress in the Land Registry.  I have requested the Registrar of Titles to keep me informed of the progress of the search to locate the Instrument and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome very shortly.</P>

      <P>The Small Claims Procedure was introduced in four District Court venues on a pilot basis in December, 1991.  The procedure is designed to handle consumer claims speedily, cheaply, and informally without involving a solicitor.  To be eligible to use the procedure, the &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; must have bought the goods or the service for private use and from a person selling them in the course of a business. Initially the procedure covered claims for up to £500 for bad workmanship and faulty goods as far as most everyday transactions for goods and services are concerned but not for debts or personal injury.  A fee of £5 is charged for making a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the successful operation of the pilot scheme over a period of two years I extended it to all District Court venues in December, 1993.  In addition, I extended the scope of the procedure to include the non-return of rent <Col N="148" /> deposits and minor damage to privatelyowned property.</P>
    <P>In terms of use in the six month period from 8 December 1993 to 7 June, 1994, 1,154 applications were received, of which 552 were settled by the Registrar.</P>
    <P>The operation of the procedure is being reviewed on a six monthly basis and if considered necessary I will further extend or modify its scope.  I have already given a commitment to increase the monetary limit on claims under the procedure from £500 to £1,000 by annual instalments of £100 commencing in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only communications received in my Department in relation to the case in question were from the Garda authorities in accordance with the normal <Col N="150" /> procedures which apply to such matters. There were two such communications from the Garda authorities as follows.</P>
    <P>First, when warrants in the case were forwarded to the Attorney General's Office on 30 April 1993, a copy was sent to my Department and to the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Second, on 24 January 1994 the Garda authorities forwarded to my Department a copy of a facsimile message received that day from the RUC which requested the return of the warrants as the person concerned had returned to the jurisdiction in which he was sought.  The Garda authorities indicated that they proposed, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, to hand over the warrants to the RUC on 25 January 1994.</P>
    <P>One further communication &mdash; which was not brought to the attention of my Department &mdash; was received by the Garda authorities.  This was correspondence from the RUC on 2 December 1993 requesting an up-date on the position in relation to Fr. Smyth.  This, however, was forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor for his attention.</P>
    <P>I should, for the purpose of clarifying the role of my Department in the matter, add that the information contained in the warrants forwarded to my Department stated the name of the person sought (but without any reference to his being a priest), gave a previous Northern Ireland address only, and signified the offence by a reference to named persons (without giving their ages) and relevant provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 (incident assault against a male and, in one case, a female).</P>
    <P>The requirement when extradition warrants are first received &mdash; and this applies in all cases &mdash; is for a determination by the Attorney General in respect of the functions imposed on him under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 and in relation to advising on whether the request meets the requirements of our law.  No decision or action is required by the Minister for Justice or the Department of Justice in advance of <Col N="151" /> the Attorney General's determination. Likewise no action is required of the Garda Commissioner in advance of the Attorney General's determination and any subsequent decision by me in accordance with section 44 of the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>The procedure in all extradition cases, which was followed in this case, is to allow the legal issues which the Attorney General is required by law to consider to be dealt with in accordance with established arrangements &mdash; which include provision of such additional information as is necessary &mdash; for that purpose and in the manner judged best by the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>No pressure would be brought to bear by the Department of Justice, and it would be improper for it to do so, unless it became specifically aware of some special circumstances &mdash; as, for example, a pending release from prison or the imminent departure of the persons concerned from the jurisdiction &mdash; or pressure from the authorities requesting extradition.  No such signal was received in this case by my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question as to whether there was any communication made by the Garda Síochána to the authorities of Kilnacrott Abbey, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda have no record of contact having been made with the authorities at the Abbey regarding warrants in their possession in respect of the individual in question.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a warrant for the arrest of the alleged culprit in this case has been issued in relation to a number of alleged offences.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as this matter is <i>subjudice,</i> I am precluded from making any further comment on the incident.</P>
      <P>With regard to the operation of the bail laws, the Law Reform Commission has been requested to examine the options that may be open in order to bring about a change in the law on bail.

    <P>As regard the general crime position, the Deputy will be aware that I am now implementing a comprehensive and detailed law and order package.

I am confident that the series of measures contained in the package which are designed to help the courts, the prisons and the Garda response to crime, will make an enormous contribution towards tackling crime in a comprehensive and deeprooted manner.</P>

      <P>Draft proposals for a Credit Union Bill are currently with the Parliamentary Draftsman. It is not yet possible to formally indicate when a Bill will be ready for introduction in the Oireachtas.  At this year's AGM of the Irish League of Credit Unions and at the recent International Credit Union Forum of the World Council of Credit Unions in Cork, the intention to introduce new legislation in this area was signalled by me and by my collegue, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I have said that I hoped to soon introduce such legislation, following extensive consultations with intersted parties, including the League.  While I have publicly given general indications of the product of these consultations, it would not be in order to formally anticipate in this House the content of whatever proposals might emanate from the normal process of drafting and finalisation of legislative proposals.</P>

      <P>I recently indicated in an address to a plenary session of the National Economic and Social Forum that I considered that there was scope for the social economy to provide productive and fulfilling employment particularly for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I had come to this view because of the success of the community employment programme which is currently providing opportunities for around 36,000 people. About 70 per cent of participants are engaged in projects sponsored by voluntary and community sponsors across a wide range of activities such as Arts/Cultural, Community/Social Services, Healthcare, Sports, Tourism and Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further development of the social <Col N="155" /> economy through the community employment programme or some other mechanism will require the co-operation of the social partners and the community at large.</P>
    <P>I have already broached the possibility of an EU initiative in this area with Commissioner Flynn and will be happy to co-operate with the EU in relation to any proposals it wishes to make.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the target is to provide 40,000 places on community employment by the end of 1994 and I am optimistic that this target will be achieved and maintained throughout 1995.</P>

      <P>My primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that authorised insurers meet their statutory reserve and solvency requirements.  The purpose of these financial requirements is that moneys are available to meet claims when they arise.  In order to meet these requirements and operate on a viable basis insurers must be free to set their insurance rates, including their public liablity insurance rates for community bodies and their motor insurance rates for public service vehicles, in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 I established the Insurance Reform Unit within the Insurance Division of my Department to research the reasons for the high level of insurance premia in Ireland as compared to competing economies and in the light of the <Col N="159" /> findings of this research, to formulate proposals designed to achieve a substantial reduction in insurance costs in this country.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 62 and 69 on Wednesday, 26 October 1994, which reply stated that my Department is at present finalising proposals which seek to address the high cost of insurance. Legislative initiatives to implement these proposals, which cover motor, employers' and public liability insurance, are a matter for Government.</P>

      <P>While sick leave policy in respect of participation on community employment is a matter for each individual sponsor, under the programme, FAS can reimburse sponsors in respect of up to seven days certified sick leave per participant in any 52 week period.  In addition, sponsors are required to take out Employer Liability Insurance in respect of their participants and a claim may be pursued under this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is the case with regular employment, participants who suffer injury <Col N="160" /> while participating on community employment are eligible to claim Occupational injuries benefit from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Many enterprises across the spectrum of Irish business, including firms in the building industry, have decided to obtain insurance cover in respect of their employees.  There is, however, no statutory requirement on any enterprise, whether in the building industry or any other industry, to maintain employers' liability insurance cover.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and work</i> stated that the Government is committed to examining the problems created by the absence of employers' liability insurance cover and consultations with the social partners are ongoing in this regard.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy the social welfare system includes schemes which provide benefits for people injured at work.  Queries regarding such schemes are proper to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

In addition, persons registered with the National Rehabilitation Board are also eligible to participate.</P>
      <P>The rationale is that expenditure on the programme is partially offset by savings in social welfare payments. Accordingly, I have no plans to alter the eligibility criteria to include persons signing on for credits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 162, 163 and 195 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities and other bodies under the aegis of my Department have been encouraged by various means to achieve the quota of 3 per cent in relation to the employment of people <Col N="164" /> with disabilities but, while some progress has been made, the overall results achieved to date have been disappointing.</P>
    <P>Based on information received from local authorities, the position in each area as at 31 December 1993 is set out in the attached table.  The information supplied by local authorities does not indicate whether persons are registered with the National Rehabilitation Board or the National Council for the Blind. The other information requested is not available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The number of people with disabilities employed by local authorities generally is increasing, and two county councils have reached the quota.  With a view to achieving greater progress, my Department has recently established a Working Group with representatives of the County and City Managers Association to develop further initiatives, including the preparation of a code of practice, and additional monitoring arrangements.  Appropriate measures are also being taken in relation to the other bodies under the aegis of my Department, a number of whom have in fact achieved the quota.</P>
    <P>My Department is co-operating with the National Rehabilitation Board in relation to a pro-active exercise which the Board is to conduct shortly in each of its regions for public bodies generally, including local authorities and the semi-state bodies.</P>

      <P>A plain language version of Agenda 21 was circulated by ENFO &mdash; my Department's environmental information service &mdash; to all sections of the community, including local authorities, in October 1993.</P>
      <P>While overall implementation of Agenda 21 is seen by the United Nations as the responsibility of national governments, the actions associated with the preparation of a local Agenda 21 are primarily for individual local authorities.  It is open to such authorities to decide how best to pursue the preparation of a local Agenda 21 and it would be contrary to its participative emphasis to pre-empt their initiatives in this regard.  However, I will be facilitating a consistent approach, subject to local initiatives, through the issuing of appropriate advice and guidelines in the coming months.</P>

    <P>¹ S.I. No. 107 of 1984 was revoked by the European Communities (Waste Oils) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 399 of 1992) which gives effect to Council Directive 87/101/EEC amending Council Directive No. 75/439/EEC on the disposal of waste oil.</P>
    <P>² S.I. No. 248 of 1988 was revoked (with a 6-month transition period) by the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Waste) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 121 of 1994) which gives effect to Council Regulation 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community.</P>
    <P>³ The original Directive 70/220 has been amended by 91/441/EEC, 91/542/EEC and 93/59/EEC.</P>
    <P>4 These implement the amending Directives at ³ respectively.</P>

      <P>The tenant purchase scheme has no provision for crediting rents towards purchase payments and there are no proposals to change the terms of the scheme in this respect.  Generous discounts are, however, available for each year of tenancy of the dwelling and this discount continues to accrue until the completion of the sale, subject to a maximum of 30 per cent of the market value of the dwelling.  Local authorities, who are responsible for the administration of the tenant purchase scheme, have been asked to complete sales as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I intend that grants will be made available to Donegal County Council to meet in full the approved cost to them of reopening the 39 cross-Border roads in the county which were closed for security reasons.  Approved works on similarly affected non-national roads in other Border counties will also be funded in this way.</P>
      <P>I understand that three of the Donegal roads concerned are now open on both sides of the Border, while required works in Northern Ireland to reinstate another road are due to be completed later this week.  A further eight roads within Donegal are expected to be reinstated during November, paralleling work being undertaken in the North.</P>
      <P>My Department is involved in ongoing consultations with the Northern Ireland authorities on the arrangements for reopening cross-Border roads, including the timing and nature of the works required.  I am anxious to see the task completed as soon as possible and will make the necessary funding available to county councils to facilitate this. The rate of progress, may, however, be affected by weather conditions.  In some cases, also, the repair or replacement of bridges (which in Donegal will be a factor in the case of seven roads) will affect the timing.</P>
      <P>One national road, the N3 between Cavan and Enniskillen, was also closed. The works required in this case to secure the reopening of the road as early as possible, including the replacement of Aghalane Bridge, are being assessed by the National Roads Authority in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1993, provide for the operation of taxis in 16 cities and towns which are designated as taximeter areas.  Taxi licences are granted by the Garda Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of those regulations.</P>
      <P>In relation to all taximeter areas other than the Dublin taximeter area, new licences may be granted where the relevant local authority authorises this.

      <P>The drafting of comprehensive new regulations to introduce a number of changes to the system of licensing taxis, including new provisions dealing with the creation of taximeter areas and the grant of taxi licences, are at an advanced stage; it is envisaged that these regulations will assign new functions to local authorities.</P>

      <P>Guidelines governing the provision of pedestrian crossings were prepared by An Foras Forbartha and made available to road authorities who are responsible for the provision of such facilities.  The guidelines outline suggested criteria to justify the installation of facilities and are designed to ensure that diverse situations are assessed objectively and on an equal footing so as to secure an adequate, but not excessive, use of such facilities.</P>
      <P>The Guidelines do not confine the provision of pedestrian crossing facilities to locations with accident records. They allow for the provision of facilities at other locations where pedestrian difficulties may be experienced due to factors such as road width or the speed or volume of traffic.</P>
      <P>I propose to ask the National Roads Authority, as part of its 1995 work programme, to review the guidelines in the light of experience, with a view to determining whether revisions are required.</P>

International experience has confirmed that such limits, applied in isolation, do not have any significant impact on vehicle speeds.  Where road authorities wish to restrict vehicles to a speed lower than 30 mph, they should utilise appropriate traffic calming measures under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The use of lower speed limits will be further considered in the light of experience with the use of such measures.</P>

      <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for such dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  A second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted in 1985 when all soldiers, as well as pensioners, who had opted out of the contributory scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join the scheme.</P>
      <P>The late husband of the person in question was a serving soldier in 1978 and opted in writing not to become a member of the contributory scheme.  In 1985 as a pensioner he did not avail of a second opportunity to become a member of the scheme.  In the circumstances, I regret that the person in question is not eligible for a pension from this Department.</P>

      <P>An application for a licence from the person in question to cultivate oysters at Ballyteigue Bay, County Wexford, was received by the Department in October 1992.  I understand that the area is suitable in many key respects for oyster cultivation and was cleared <Col N="192" /> from a strictly fish health perspective in 1993.  However, processing of the application for the site in question and renewal of fish health clearances have been fundamentally constrained by the fact that the area lies within a statutory nature reserve and was designated by the Wildlife Service as a special protection area under the EU Birds Directive in 1990.</P>
      <P>Developmental activity, including aquaculture, is generally speaking circumscribed within such areas.  The Department has however requested the Wildlife Service to reconsider the extent, if any, to which the application in question can be accommodated within the Bay.  I have instructed the Department to fully brief the Deputy and the applicant on developments to date and to advise directly on the outcome of the current discussions with the Wildlife Service.</P>

      <Quest>arising from his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 123 of 27 October 1994, if a lamb mortality survey was carried out by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Department of Agriculture, Athlone, County Westmeath, in 1992; the percentage of lamb losses due to predation found in this survey; if these figures are at variance with his reply to Parliamentary Question 123; if so, the reason; and the scientific surveys, if any, on which the statements relating to predation in his reply are based.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no survey of lamb mortality carried out in 1992 by my Department.  The results of a study carried out in 1984-85 at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Athlone, which were presented in a thesis to the National University of Ireland in 1991, showed that, of 315 carcases of lambs born live, 0.52 per cent showed evidence of predation damage.  In 1984, <Col N="197" /> my Department published a report entitled <i>Sheep Production, Disease and Marketing</i> which included reference to a survey of perinatal lamb mortality carried out by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Athlone in the period 1980 to 1982.  That survey found from information derived from a questionnaire completed by farmers that 1.39 per cent of live lambs were killed by &ldquo;foxes, dogs, etc.&rdquo; and that, of the carcasses submitted voluntarily to the Athlone Laboratory, 1 per cent of neonatal deaths were classified as due to &ldquo;predation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However, these indications of predation damage are unlikely to be fully representative of the national position since the study and survey were confined to lowland flocks while mortality due to predation is higher in hill and mountain flocks, farmers were less likely to submit carcasses for which there was a known cause of death and many carcasses of lambs killed by predation were likely to have disappeared.</P>
      <P>The estimates given in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 123 of 27 October were based on the current experience of field officers of my Department and of Teagasc.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the issuing of approval to the person concerned for the higher rate of premium payable to farmers under the CAP Forest Premium Scheme.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme the premium for farmers is payable to those who meet a number of conditions, including a 25 per cent on-farm income requirement.  This requirement was introduced by the European Commission last February.  A derogation from this requirement was secured in order to ensure that those who had already received planting approval would not be disadvantaged by the imposition of the threshold.  This derogation applied to all those who had received planting approval from my Department between 1 August 1992 and 15 February 1994, the date of the Commission decision.  This decision was conveyed to the public through a press release which issued from my Department at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's records show that the application for planting approval from the person concerned was received <Col N="204" /> on 14 February, 1994.  Following consideration of the application, including an on-site assessment, approval was conveyed to the applicant on 28 March 1994.  I regret to say therefore that, in accordance with the Commission decision, this application cannot benefit from the derogation.  The applicant is of course eligible for the non-farmer premium as well as the full planting grant subject to the conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>In appointing the Council of COFORD in April 1993, I asked the Council to develop and present a medium and long term research programme for the sustainable development of the Irish Forest Industry. The report <i>Pathway to Progress</i> represents the completion of that aspect of COFORD's terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The report is a comprehensive evaluation of the research needs of the forestry sector in Ireland identifying specific areas of research under five broad headings:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" />&mdash;Reproductive material;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Silviculture and Forest Management;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Harvesting and Transport;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Wood processing; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Socio Economic. </P>
    <P>COFORD has received almost 80 separate research proposals which will be evaluated for scientific merit, industry need and value for money.  I expect that COFORD will have completed this task by year end so that research proposals will be approved early next year.</P>

      <Quest>the square footage of office space occupied by his Department in Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo; the reason no facilities exist for discussions in any degree of privacy with farmer applicants for agriculture grants and subsidies; when the offices occupied by his Department were last painted; the reason the foyer at the entrance to Davitt House was converted for storage use; the reason he has not directed that the offices of his Department be open for longer periods to deal with public claims and queries; when he last visited Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo to see the problems being experienced by staff there at first hand; and if he will make a statement on the matter and have arrangements made to have improvement works carried out forthwith.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of office space (excluding storage) occupied by my Department in Michael Davitt House is 15,800 sq.ft.  Storage space in that office was inadequate and this necessitated the construction of storage rooms in part of the foyer of Michael Davitt House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my most recent visit to that office in June 1994.  I noted the problems experienced by the staff there and following that visit, arrangements were set <Col N="208" /> in train to secure the construction of an extension to Michael Davitt House and to carry out other improvement works. This much needed extension will provide additional space for personnel as well as a larger reception area with private interview rooms.  Limited facilities are available in the Castlebar office to meet farmers.  However as there are 14,168 herdowners in Mayo, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not practical to provide private office facilities for all interviews with individual farmers.</P>
    <P>The decision to restrict public opening hours was taken to enable staff resources to concentrate on expediting payments under the livestock and headage schemes and this decision has contributed to the greatly improved position in regard to 1994 premium and headage payments.  The position will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, are already in place to deal with cruelty to all animals, including horses.  These Acts provide penalties in the form of fines and imprisonment and are enforced by the Garda Síochána.  The Deputy will wish to be aware that an order was made earlier this year which increased the fine for cruelty from £500 to £1,000.</P>

      <Quest>when tree planting approval under the forest premium scheme will be given to a person (details supplied) in County Waterford in view of the fact that his application was submitted by 15 February 1994 in accordance with the regulations supplied to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the issuing of approval to the person concerned for the higher rate of premium payable to farmers under the CAP forest premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme the premium for farmers is payable to those who meet a number of conditions, including a 25 per cent on-farm income requirement.  This requirement was introduced by the European Commission last February.  A derogation from this requirement was secured in order to ensure that those who had already received planting approval would not be disadvantaged by the imposition of the threshold.  The derogation applied to all those who had received planting approval from my Department between 1 August 1992 and 15 February 1994, the date of the Commission decision.  This decision was conveyed to the public through a press release which issued from my Department at that time.</P>
      <P>My Department's records show that the application for planting approval from the person concerned was received on 7 February, 1994.  Following consideration of the application, including an on-site assessment, approval was conveyed to the applicant on 24 March 1994.  I regret, therefore, that, in accordance with the Commission decision, this application cannot benefit from the derogation.  The applicant is of course eligible for the non-farmer premium as well as the full planting grant subject to the conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248, 249 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>The alteration of the CBF document was the subject of a submission by counsel for the State to the Tribunal at the hearing on 24 June 1992.  It was also brought to the attention of the Tribunal on the previous day.  At that stage the alteration was public knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I have no reason to believe that any officers of my Department other than the two referred to in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 and 3 of 3 November 1994 were aware of the matter until it was brought to light at the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to establish at this stage how many officers of my Department were aware of the use of intervention beef to fill the Iraqi contracts in years 1988 to 1990.  The reply to Parliamentary Question No. 141 of 3 November 1994 sets out the position of my Department in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>With reference to Question No. 250 I have had no knowledge of the alteration of any official document either before I became Minister or since.  My Department has been aware of the following alterations of official documents, both of which relate to the GATT beef import scheme: the dates of issue and expiry of a 1989 GATT import licence were altered at some time between the actual date of its issue by my Department and its return to my Department; furthermore the original of this import licence bears endorsements which differ from endorsements on a copy of that licence found on a company's file discovered for the purpose of the case in the High Court of Emerald Meats Ltd. and the Minister for Agriculture, and others.</P>
    <P>These alterations came to light during the High Court case the outcome of which is the subject of an appeal to be heard by the Supreme Court on 30 November 1994.  The referral of these matters to the appropriate authorities will be considered in the light of the outcome of the legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the case of an application for a 1991 GATT import licence, the applicant was allowed by my Department to make an addition to the application after its submission to the effect that the applicant had not submitted an application in any other Member State and that the country of origin was Australia, both points of information having been omitted from the original.</P>

The ultimate end-use of these animals is unknown, although the breeds generally exported to these destinations are those which are not best suited for beef production.</P>

      <P>My Department has been engaged in consultations with the Department of the Environment for some time about the need to improve <Col N="216" /> roads of tourism importance throughout the country.  The new operational programme for transport, 1994-1999 plans a total investment of about £330 million in national secondary and non-national roads (over 50 per cent of which will be contributed by the European Regional Development Fund).  In addition a further £217 million will be invested directly by the Exchequer in these roads.  Roads of tourism importance will benefit from this investment.</P>
      <P>In identifying their non-national road priorities for 1995 for funding under the EU co-financed scheme of grants, I understand that local authorities have been asked by the Department of the Environment to select roads of tourism merit.  Some weeks ago, my Department requested Bord Fáilte and the other tourism agencies to make known to local authorities the tourism roads priorities in their respective regions.</P>
      <P>My Department is separately communicating these priorities to the Department of the Environment and will be urging that Department to select, <i>inter alia</i>, those roads which have been identified by the tourism agencies as important in a tourism context.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is the Department of the Environment, in conjunction as appropriate with the National Roads Authority, which are the responsible authorities for deciding what tourism roads improvements are supported under the new transport programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said recently, on the <Col N="217" /> occasion of a very successful all-Ireland store promotion in London.  I am convinced that the achievement of a lasting peace on this island will bear economic fruit, particularly in the area of trade development.  One of the reasons for this it that a very good foundation has already been laid in recent years by the State agencies on both sides of the Border, focusing on new opportunities within Ireland and joint promotional activities abroad.</P>
      <P>While it is true that opportunities for our exporters do exist in the North and are being acted upon, I prefer to think in terms of a two-way process which will result in the creation of a genuine internal market on the island of Ireland. Overall, the intention is that the share of the all-Ireland market held by Irish firms, North and South, will increase substantially.</P>
      <P>In terms of putting particular economic initiatives in place, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that one of the agencies for which I have responsibility, An Bord Tráchtála, last week published a very comprehensive market profile on Northern Ireland.  This is in a user-friendly format and would be particularly valuable to Southern firms who are unfamiliar with the marketing environment in the North in terms of household expenditure patterns, the structure of the retail trade, etc.</P>

      <P>As of 10 November 1994, 27 of the 124 GATT contracting parties had either signed definitively, or formally deposited instruments ratifying, the Marrakesh Agreement embodying <Col N="218" /> the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.  This leaves 87 who have yet to formally ratify the agreement.  Five of these &mdash; including Ireland &mdash; have notified the GATT Secretariat that they have completed their domestic procedures for ratification. In accordance with established practice within the European Union, Ireland will deposit its instrument of ratification simultaneously with the European Union and other Union member states.  It is expected that the European Union and each of its member states will have completed their ratification procedures by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>1 January 1995 is the target date for entry into force of the agreement, which was signed on 15 April 1994.  The Director-General of GATT, Mr. Peter Sutheland, said in a recent statement that a substantial number of governments had indicated that they would have completed their ratification procedures by the time of the implementation conference, which is due to be held on 8 December.  He therefore expected the conference to confirm 1 January 1995 as the date of entry into force of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The trade liberalisation measures contained in the Marrakesh Agreement represents a significant opportunity for Irish exporters.  I am therefore very pleased at the prospect that it will come into effect on 1 January next, less than nine months after it was signed.</P>
      <P>For further information, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 92 on 11 October and No. 213 on 18 October 1994 on the same general subject.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan includes provision for an EU assisted investment programme of £220 million so as to enable substantial progress to be made on implementation of the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  This funding includes provision for expenditure of up to £200 million in respect of the first phase of the light rail network for Dublin.</P>
      <P>The remaining £20 million has been included in the National Plan for a number of other important public transport projects recommended by the DTI including improved interchange facilities for buses and other public transport and off street bus parking facilities in the city centre; extension of DART to Greystones and possibly to Malahide; provision of secure park-and-ride facilities on the public transport network; an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms the overall cost for these projects would greatly exceed the level of funding available.  Accordingly it is essential that the available expenditure is carefully allocated to the most effective projects in overall public transport terms.  In this context I have asked <Col N="220" /> CIE to undertake a detailed cost-benefit analysis of a number of future public transport options for the north Wicklow area including a DART extension to Greystones.  Pending the outcome of this work and further detailed analysis in relation to the other public transport projects recommended by the DTI it is not possible to be more specific about the prospects for implementation of an extension of the DART to Greystones.</P>

      <P>In the context of the restructuring of the electricity industry, ESB will be reorganised into five business units, with each unit producing separate accounts to ensure full cost transparency.  One of these is the customer service unit, which includes ESB's retailing activities.  It is not envisaged that the legislation, which will give effect to the restructured electricity market, will require separate accounts to be published in respect of ESB's retailing activities.</P>

      <P>I am aware, from a small number of representations, of reception problems in the area concerned from time to time. The licence referred to was transferred to the company concerned in 1990.  At that time the cable system was in need of significant upgrading and a total of £230,000 has been invested in the system since then.</P>
      <P>The company is currently investigating the possibility of acquiring an improved signal and minimising interference caused by high atmospheric pressure.  My Department will be kept informed of progress on these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in relation to securing improved access to public transport for people with mobility handicaps, including those with disabilities, is embodied in the work of the Inter-Departmental Transport Accessibility Committee.  This committee comprises representatives of the Departments of Health and Equality and Law Reform, the National Rehabilitation Board, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann under the chairmanship of my Department.  Its objective is to secure such improvements in accessibility to all modes of public transport as can be implemented within the resources available to public transport providers and other relevant bodies.  The Committee has prepared <Col N="223" /> and continues to update an action programme aimed at securing a wide range of specific improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>The issue of improved accessibility to road and rail vehicles has provided a major focus for the Committee's efforts and a number of notable advances have been recorded.  It is Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new rail vehicles will be accessible to people with disabilities. DART trains are wheelchair-accessible as are the new Arrow railcars, which also have wheelchair-accessible toilets. The new carriages for the DublinBelfast service will also have this facility, while the existing Intercity trains all have at least one dedicated area for wheelchair users in the dining cars.  As regards bus services, both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann endeavour to obtain the most accessible and user-friendly vehicles available on a cost-effective basis.  Both companies in replacing their urban fleets are guided by the recommended specifications of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DIPTAC), a UK statutory body which advises on the needs and requirements of the mobility impaired.  Bus Éireann have also acquired 130 improved coaches for their Expressway network which include a facility whereby the front of the coach may be lowered to facilitate access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheelchair users present the greatest accessibility challenge to bus operators, the main problem being the lack of affordable, operationally-proven and cost-effective wheelchair-accessible buses.  In this connection, the introduction of more than 90 wheelchair-accessible taxis in the Dublin area represents a significant step towards providing a flexible, door-to-door facility corresponding to the particular needs of wheelchair users.  At the same time, Bus Átha Cliath, with EU funding under the Horizon programme, hope to be in a position to begin a pilot wheelchair-accessible service operated by small-capacity low-floor vehicles between Clontarf and Finglas, beginning in January 1995.  The operation of the pilot <Col N="224" /> scheme will be monitored and assessed by the Inter-Departmental Committee as part of its ongoing programme to maximise the accessibility of public transport infrastructure and services.</P>

      <P>The storage and disposal of all radioactive waste in Ireland is subject to control by licence under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1993 (S.I.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Radioactive material, in both sealed and unsealed form, is imported for use in industrial, medical and laboratory applications under licence from the institute.  At present, all imported sealed radioactive sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the Institute prior to the issue of a licence.  In relation to unsealed sources and sealed sources imported before the introduction of regulatory controls in 1997, the licensee is obliged to store waste material safely on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
    <P>Inspections of storage of radioactive substances are carried out by the institute.  The institute and I are satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a correct manner which does not pose a hazard to people or the environment.</P>
    <P>The institute have recommended the establishment of a centralised waste management facility to cater for long term storage of radioactive substances. My Department is keeping this matter under continuous review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 304 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that as many disabled persons as possible are employed in the health services and am particularly cognisant of achieving the 3 per cent employment quota for persons with a disability in line with the terms of the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work</i> which in relation to people with disabilities states <i>inter alia</i> that &ldquo;the 3 per cent quota scheme in the public sector will be continually monitored with a view to ensuring that all sections of the public sector meet the quota target.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My Department is represented on and fully supportive of the Monitoring Committee on Employment of people with disabilities set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress and continued under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which oversees developments in achieving the 3 per cent quota in the public service including the health boards etc.</P>
      <P>With these objectives in mind, I have requested that due regard be given by health service agencies to the commitment to the disabled and in cases where the quota has not been achieved, to make every effort to secure an appropriate increase in the number of disabled employed consistent with operational and employment control requirements.</P>
      <P>While progress has been made in the health service toward achieving the 3 per cent quota e.g. the percentage of disabled persons employed in the health board sector increased from 0.95 per cent at the end of 1992 to 1.09 per cent at the end of 1993, I am conscious of the need to encourage agencies to maintain this momentum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each agency has been circulated with a copy of the Civil Service Code of Practice in relation to the employment of people with disabilities and encouraged to review their policy in relation to the employment of the disabled in light of <Col N="234" /> this document to ensure that the objective of equality of opportunity is maintained and particularly that the minimum employment target is met.</P>
    <P>In this context my Department is having ongoing discussions with representatives of health service personnel officers to see how the development of a policy in relation to the disabled may be progressed. Particular regard is being paid to the question of the employment of disabled persons and to meeting their specific needs in the workplace by ensuring that good communication exists so that any difficulties encountered may be addressed.</P>
    <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy in relation to the proportion of new recruits with a disability to each health board is not readily available in my Department.  I am having the data compiled and will forward it to the Deputy and make it available to each of the health boards as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284, 288 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 provide that a health board shall inform an applicant in writing within eight weeks of the receipt of the application, or, if all the information sought has not been provided with the application, within eight weeks of the receipt of the information requested, of its decision whether or not to pay a subvention to the person to whom the application refers and the amount of any subvention to be paid.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board inform me that in accordance with the regulations each applicant is informed of the outcome of his or her application within eight weeks of making such application if all the appropriate information is provided of the time of application. However, the board's experience has been that applicants do not provide all the necessary information at the time of making an application.</P>
      <P>There are currently 240 applications for nursing home subventions on hand in the Western Health Board area.  The application process was delayed somewhat by the recent dispute involving Acting Directors of Community Care. The board state that these difficulties have now been resolved.</P>
      <P>Accounts in respect of the month of September have been processed and payment to the nursing homes will issue shortly.  Following recent discussions between officials of my Department and the Western Health Board concerning funding for the Nursing Homes Act, it was agreed to allocate an additional £800,000 to assist the implementation of the Act in 1994.  The board is now satisfied that there will be sufficient funds available to fund the scheme to the end of the current financial year.</P>

      <P>The needs of those who have been diagnosed as positive for hepatitis C are being monitored and re-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the necessary support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>At the outset, a comprehensive counselling programme involving medical consultants at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and general practitioners throughout the country was put in place by the Blood Transfusion Service Board for persons who received the Anti D product.  Persons who tested positive for hepatitis C under the National Blood Screening Programme were invited to Blood Transfusion Service Board consultations which took place in Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  To support the Blood Transfusion Service Board counselling services, a counselling programme was also structured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board with the Well Woman Centre in Dublin. Large group information meetings on hepatitis C were also held in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Monaghan, Mullingar and Donegal.  Counselling in small groups (up to 20) is also being undertaken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Individual psychological support is also available where this is considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C is being provided at the following six designated hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital; University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment initially involves an <Col N="237" /> out-patient visit which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow up treatment, if required.  The treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>
    <P>A limited <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme is being operated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board to ensure that all Anti D recipients are in a position to avail of the screening, counselling and treatment services.</P>
    <P>The support services put in place to meet the needs of those persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C under the National Blood Screening Programme will be available for as long as they are required.</P>

      <P>The scheduling of admission to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine their medical priority.  Urgent cases are always given priority.  Should the person in question feel that her condition has deteriorated she would be advised to return to her general practitioner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I have allocated additional funding in the sum of £154,900 in 1994 to the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear to allow it to reduce waiting times for cataracts and other ophthalmology procedures.  This increased activity should go a considerable way to reducing waiting times for all those currently listed for treatment.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends to take to ensure that there is an adequate number of refuge places for women and children who are experiencing violence in Dublin in view of the fact that, of the 260 women who requested refuge, places were only found for 76 in the period from January to September 1994.</Quest>

      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area there are three women's refuges at Rathmines, Ballymun and Bray providing secure refuge facilities for 17 families (approximately 63 women and children).  The level of financial support provided by the board to these centres represents approximately 90 per cent of total expenditure.  In an emergency other facilities, which primarily cater for homeless women, can also accommodate victims of domestic violence.  There are also three units of accommodation for victims of family violence who, while no longer requiring refuge accommodation, are not yet ready for full re-integration into the community.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, I regard the provision of refuges and other services for victims of domestic violence as an important component of the network of child care and family support services being developed under the Child Care Act.  As part of the Eastern Health Board's 1994 Child Care Action Plan I approved additional funding of the order of £55,000 for refuge facilities, which is equivalent to £100,000 in a full year.  I might add that the Eastern Health Board is currently carrying out a review of the services for victims of family violence in its area with a view to ensuring that there are adequate supports and services in place for this particularly vulnerable group.</P>

      <Quest>if the law on foreign adoption will be amended to accord with the recently agreed Hague Convention on the subject, as stated in his Department's strategy document, Shaping a Healthier Future; if this will enable the recognition of the foreign adoption of all children now resident in the State for several years but currently banned under this country's foreign adoption legislation; the reason, current legislation on the recognition takes no account of the standards observed by adoptive couples while adopting abroad, thereby banning adoptions of a high standard and yet granting automatic recognition in cases where standards were known to be far from satisfactory; if his attention has been drawn to any other country which ban the adoption of children solely on the grounds of their country of origin; his views on whether this practice is potentially damaging to the children and families so affected; his views on whether discrimination of this kind under the law is acceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which was completed last year, provides, among other matters, for the recognition by countries which are parties to the Convention of intercountry adoptions which take place under and in accordance with the requirements of the Convention.  More than 60 countries, including Ireland, participated in the preparation of the Convention. As is indicated in the National Health Strategy, I am committed to amending current adoption legislation so as to enable the Convention to be ratified here.  However, the Convention does not provide for the recognition, on a retrospective basis, of foreign adoptions already completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> The existing law on the recognition of foreign adoptions is set out in the Adoption Act, 1991.  Broadly speaking, adoptions which are effected in countries which operate systems of legal adoption similar to our own qualify for recognition under the 1991 Act.  A central requirement for recognition is that the foreign adoption must have essentially the same legal effect as an Irish adoption in relation to the termination and creation of parents rights and duties. Where a foreign adoption is recognised, it is accorded the same legal status as a domestic adoption order, that is to say the child is regarded in law as the child of the adopters as if born to them within marriage.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions is in no way discriminatory against certain foreign countries or foreign children.  The entitlement of an adoption effected abroad to recognition is determined by reference to the criteria set out in the definition of a foreign adoption contained in the Adoption Act, 1991 and the country of origin of the child has no bearing whatsoever on the matter.</P>

    <P>The South Eastern Health Board does not employ chiropodists on a full time basis.  The board provided £36,828 for sessional chiropody in 1993 and has a sum of £59,476 budgeted for the service in the current year.  The service is provided by the board in its long-stay hospitals and day care centres, where virtually all patients are medical card holders.  The South-Eastern Health Board also provides chiropody services on a non-patient basis in the Kilkenny area where 688 patients were treated in 1993 and in excess of 700 patients have been treated in 1994, to date.</P>
    <P>Chiropodists employed on a sessional basis by the South-Eastern Health Board are drawn from the list of chiropodists held by the Chiropodists Assessment and Advisory Committee.  There are over 500 chiropodists practising in Ireland whose membership and qualifications are as follows:</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to recent media reports concerning the original development of the rubella vaccine.</P>
      <P>The rubella vaccine used in this country's vaccination programme is produced by growing the rubella virus on cells known as MRC5 cells.  The MRC5 cell line was developed originally by the Medical Research Council in the UK in 1970 from cells taken from the lung tissue of a therapeutically aborted foetus.  I am assured that since that time, no new foetal tissue has been used in relation to the vaccine used in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health Rubella Immunisation Programme is designed to prevent Congenital Rubella Syndrome in new-born childen.  If rubella is contracted during pregnancy, there is a high risk of the infant being born with a range of congenital abnormalities, such as heart disease, mental handicap, deafness and eye problems (including blindness), and it may even result in death.</P>
      <P>Approximately 750,000 children have been immunised against rubella in Ireland since 1971.  Since 1988 the rubella vaccine has been administered as part of the MMR vaccination.  It is given to children at 15 months of age and, in schools, to children aged 10-14 years.</P>
      <P>The foregoing information was conveyed in the press release which I issued in October.  I would again like to emphasise the need for parents to have their children immunised against rubella.</P>

        <Col N="244" /> The North-Eastern Health Board provides a range of community and residential services for people with Alzheimer disease and their carers.  The community services include, public health nurse visits, occupational therapy, general practitioner care and day care facilities.  Respite and long stay care for Alzheimer patients is provided in a number of board homes such as the John Sullivan Home in Cavan and the Boyne View Home, Drogheda.  The board also liaise closely with the local branches of the Alzheimer Society.</P>
      <P>Major developments in services for the elderly in the North-Eastern Health Board are currently underway and these will lead to an improvement in residential care and respite services for the elderly and mentally infirm.  Additional assistance to carers is already provided for by the home care assistant service and the night sitting service which are offered where appropriate to support the elderly and mentally infirm in the community.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave in response to a similar question from him on 21 June 1994 regarding this preparation.</P>
      <P>As I stated at that time I am aware of reports concerning the drug Co-trimoxazole which is an active ingredient in the preparation Septrin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Septrin has been authorised in <Col N="246" /> Ireland since 1975 with specific indications for use and is available only on prescription.  Possible adverse reactions to the drug are well known and documented and there is nothing in recent reports which was not already known.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the National Drugs Advisory Board that any cases of side effects which have been notified to the board suspected in association with Septrin and other Co-trimoxazole products have been published in the board's annual side effect listings which are circulated to medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientific libraries.  The side effects which have been reported over the years are included in the product's published data sheet which has been revised and updated to reflect the drug's safety profile.</P>
    <P>Although the possibility of adverse reactions in rare cases is known, the National Drugs Advisory Board, following the recent media reports, initiated further investigations into the safety of the drug and, in line with its normal pharmacovigilance procedures, continues to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.  The board, however, is satisfied that there is no cause for concern at this time.</P>
    <P>Prescribers of the drug would be familiar with its indications for use and with any likely adverse reactions or contraindications to its use.  It is not proposed to make any changes in relation to the requirements governing the prescribing of this drug.</P>

      <P>The development of general practitioner services is an important element of the National Health Strategy.  The strategy identifies the fragmentation of general practice as a major weakness which as a result makes it both difficult and costly to improve services and to integrate general practice with other health services mainly hospital and community services.  In order to address such deficiencies the strategy contains a plan for improving the organisation of general practitioner services through the development of group practices, amalgamated practices or through co-operative type arrangements between general practitioners.  As part of the implementation of the strategy, my Department has requested health boards as a matter of priority to improve the organisation of services to meet the twin objectives of improving <Col N="249" /> patient care and enhancing the quality of general practice.</P>
      <P>The implementation of such developments in Cork city is a matter for the Southern Health Board.  The Board in consultation with general practitioners locally intends to bring about improvements in general practitioner services, including organisational improvements which are in line with the strategy commitments. In that regard the Board has invested proposals from general practitioners who are interested in organising and developing their practices in accordance with the objectives outlined above.  The Board has received a proposal from general practitioners in the Mayfield area of Cork city.  I have been given to understand that the Board is supporting these developments on the basis that they are in line with the strategy priorities, that the co-operative arrangements between general practitioners are viable and sustainable and can improve the quality of general practice for the patients of the doctors concerned. Similar proposals from other general practitioners which are in line with these criteria will also be supported by the Board.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the report &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;, the main focus of policy <Col N="250" /> for the elderly has been to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when elderly people can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Unit 6, Cherry Orchard Hospital was re-opened by the Eastern Health Board in December, 1993 to provide for the transfer of 26 elderly patients from the acute general hospitals who had been medically assessed as in need of that level of care.</P>
      <P>Services provided for patients in this unit include physiotherapy, as well as recreational, diversional and reminiscent therapy.  Patients are also encouraged to participate in board games, crosswords, story telling/ conversation, singing and physical exercises. All patients have access to telephone facilities, if required.</P>
      <P>The board state that due to the high dependency levels of patients, the medical management of the hospital do not consider it appropriate to have tea machine facilities in the Unit.  However, nursing or care staff provide beverages for patients on request.</P>

      <P>The National Co-ordinating Committee <Col N="251" /> on Drug Abuse was reconstituted in 1990 with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of a National Plan which will cover both the demand and supply aspects of drug abuse and drug trafficking;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the co-ordination of the Ratification of the UN Convention on the Illicit Trafficking of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances 1988 and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the co-ordination of participation at international meetings relating to drugs. </P>
      <P>The committee met on two occasions in 1992, on two occasions in 1993 and has not met to date in 1994.</P>
      <P>The original committee prepared a report in 1986, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In 1991 the Government approved the reconstituted National Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse which had been prepared by the National Co-ordinating Committee.  In 1992 the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS was produced.  Both reports form the basis for the strategy measures to prevent drug misuse which is so closely identified with HIV/AIDS in this country.  These strategies are being implemented in this country by the relevant authorities and agencies including the Garda, Customs and Excise, health boards etc.  I am satisfied that the two reports have enabled a radical overhaul of the care, treatment and preventative services in this area to be accomplished.</P>
      <P>As regards the future role of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, I understand that my colleague the Minister for Justice is examining future structures for national co-ordination at present to ensure that the real advances which have been achieved in recent times are built upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board (NRB), which is an executive agency of my Department, has responsibility for approving and monitoring vocational training for people with disabilities.  The accepted standard for course design, with appropriate modifications, is the National Standard for Training Specifications QA58/01 (FÁS).  In addition, the requirement for courses to lead to the award of nationally recognised certification ensures that trainees leaving special training centres have the same qualification as those leaving mainstream training centres.  All courses are classified according to the level of training and the level which apply in special training centres are thus linked to national and European training levels via certification.</P>
      <P>There are also linkages between special training and mainstream training centres in respect of:</P>
      <P>Integrated pilot programmes e.g. courses for trainees with a disability held in mainstream centres; courses where the trainee target group include people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>FÁS, CERT, Teagasc and the NBR, as a EUROFORM initiative, have developed certification in Introductory Skills for trainees in their respective centres.  Design and delivery briefings were conducted on an integrated basis (i.e. mainstream and special trainers).  It is anticipated that this certification will be available in early 1995.</P>
      <P>EU Training Exchange programmes funded by HORIZON for specialist trainers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> Negotiations between the NRB and FÁS, CERT and Teagasc have not only gained access for disabled trainees to national certification but have also increased these organisations' awareness of the needs of people with disabilities and stimulated them to look at their policies.</P>
    <P>A foundation trainer qualification programme for trainers working with people with disabilities &mdash; Certification in Special Needs &mdash; was developed by NRB in conjunction with St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1992.  To date 160 trainers have qualified and a further 98 commenced their studies in September, 1994.  This course fully includes the FÁS/Maynooth Foundation Certificate in Training Technology &mdash; the mainstream qualification for trainers. </P>

      <Quest>in respect of each of the Dublin Accident and Emergency Departments, the action, if any that has been taken to implement the proposals made by the Kennedy report some years ago on overcoming problems for patients in such Departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, which was chaired by Professor David Kennedy, made wide-ranging recommendations regarding the more efficient use of all acute hospital services in the Dublin area.  These recommendations covered aspects which were common to all of the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals, such as the inter-action between the accident and emergency department and other departments within the acute hospitals; admission, bed management and discharge policies; and the need for step-down facilities for elderly in-patients no longer requiring acute hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Following the publication in September 1991 of the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, a second group, the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, which was also chaired by Professor David Kennedy, monitored and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of these reports' &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations.  This group found that the implementation of the recommendations was broadly satisfactory, although it was recognised that to put them fully into effect would take some time.</P>
    <P>Certain recommendations required the provision of additional resources, and, as such, have had to be considered in the context of individual hospital's development priorities and the funds available for improvements throughout the health services as a whole.</P>
    <P>In 1992, £500,000 was made available so that facilities could be put in place for the elderly.  Shortly after coming to office, I approved a sum of £500,000 to tackle the shortage of step-down accommodation. In December 1993, I allocated a further £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.  This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition.  This action helped significantly to relieve the seasonal pressures on the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 to 315, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Open heart surgery operation for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts &mdash; CABGs &mdash; are currently performed for public patients at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin and at Cork Regional Hospital.  At present there are approximately 1,600 patients on the waiting list for open heart surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office I have been concerned to ensure the expansion of <Col N="259" /> existing facilities for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector.  In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, I have provided capital funding of £2.8 million which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, I have allocated in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital funds to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development, which was completed recently, includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities at the hospital have support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital which have been opened this month, will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy relating to the number of patients awaiting cardiac surgery operations from the North Western Health Board area and the number of patients on the waiting list over 1 year and 2 years is not routinely collected. However, I will have this information collected and I will communicate it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

These responsibilities are discharged under licences issued to the relevant health agencies by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The Institute ensures, through its licensing conditions and supervisory role, that the arrangements are satisfactory. My Department has no plans to provide for the centralised storage of such waste.</P>

      <P>The South Presentation Secondary School, Cork, is a voluntary secondary school owned and managed by the Presentation Sisters.</P>
      <P>The future of the school has been under consideration by the Trustees, in the light of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the rapidly declining enrolment, down from 408 in 1989-90 to 176 in the current school year,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the decline in the intake of new pupils each year, down from over <Col N="261" /> 40 in September 1989 to 19 in September 1994.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the major level of refurbishment which would be required to bring the school building up to an acceptable standard. </P>
    <P>In the light of the above factors the Trustees decided that there was no option but to close the school on a phased basis.  Accordingly there will be no intake of new pupils from September 1995.</P>
    <P>From inquiries made by my Department I understand that parents have been informed of the Trustees decision, and also that every effort will be made to enable existing junior pupils to complete the junior cycle in the school.</P>
    <P>My Department will assist in whatever way possible in ensuring that the phasing out process will be completed with the minimum disruption to both pupils and staff.</P>
    <P>In this context I am satisfied that there are sufficient postprimary school places in the general area presently served by the South Presentation Secondary School to cater for the future needs of that area.</P>

      <P>My Department recently issued a discussion paper outlining proposals on the future organisation of a national network of education centres. It was clearly stated in the document that the proposals had not been adopted as official policy and that the discussion paper was being presented for consideration and feedback, in order to inform the debate on the development of an overall framework for in-career development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion paper envisaged the <Col N="263" /> provision of a network of 18 full-time centres throughout the country, which would henceforth be known as Main Centres.  It also included proposals for the provision of Associate Centres on a part-time basis, based on an assessment by the Main Centre of the needs in the region.</P>
    <P>In the discussion paper, Monaghan is not proposed as a full-time centre.  This is for geographical reasons, and in no way denies that excellent work is being done in the centre.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently attended the AGM of the Association of Teacher Centres in Ireland to hear the feedback on the discussion paper and will shortly be engaging in discussions with teacher and management interests on the issue.  No decisions will be made until the consultation process has been completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has approved the provision of three prefabricated classrooms at the schools in question to cater for increased enrolments.  Planning permission has been received from the Local Authority, but a Fire Safety Certificate, required in accordance with the fire safety regulations of the Building Control Act, 1990, is still awaited.  Subject to receipt of this certificate, the Department will be in a position to invite tenders for the project.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the extra examination fees for repeat leaving certificate students; the reason for these fees; the cost of setting and examining the average student's papers; in view of the fact that many students repeat due to the lack of jobs, sickness at examination time and other such reasons, if there is a means processing `hardship'.</Quest>

      <P>1.  The current entry fee payable in respect of a student who remains at school to repeat the Leaving Certificate examination is £120.  A <Col N="268" /> Course Fee of £100 is also payable in respect of such students.</P>
      <P>2.  The entry fee payable by first-time candidates for the Leaving Certificate is £44.  A higher fee is charged to repeat candidates because they have already benefited from the normal course of post-primary schooling and it is considered reasonable that those who wish to take an extra year should be asked to make an extra contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources.</P>
      <P>3.  Each student who sits the Leaving Certificate Examination costs my Department, on average, about £120.</P>
      <P>4.  The fees payable by examination candidates may be reduced or waived entirely where payment would cause hardship.  In the case of a repeat student whose parent or guardian is the holder of a current medical card, the Course Fee is waived and the entry fee payable is reduced to a maximum of £44.  At the discretion of the school authority, the entry fee may be reduced still further in the case of necessitous pupils subject to a maximum amount notified to each school or Vocational Education Committee by my Department.  A sum of £394,000 was allocated by my Department for this purpose in 1994.</P>
      <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of alleviation of fees, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of: unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child doing the Certificate Examinations; other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
      <P>5.  A candidate who was unable to complete the examination because of illness would not, at his or her next attempt, be regarded as a repeat candidate for the purpose of additional fees.</P>

      <P>These conditions stipulate that there must be room on an existing local service after all eligible pupils have been accomodated, that no extra cost should be incurred through carrying them and that they should secure the written agreement of the authorities of their nearest school to the provision of such transport.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the possible detrimental effect on children of carrying heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>I set out my views on this matter for the House on 13 October, 1994.</P>
      <P>The only issue raised by the Deputy which I did not specifically address on that occasion concerns the use of lockers.</P>
      <P>My view is that the problem of lockers or alternative facilities for the safe custody of books can be considered only as part of a wider solution at school level.  This should involve prudent time-tabling and advance planning by teachers so that pupils know in advance what books are required on any particular day and also the books they need to take with them for home use.</P>
      <P>Consequently I have no plans to provide lockers in all schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.  On application by the Chairman of a national school's board of management, my Department considers and approves eligible grant-aid for new play-areas and ball-courts and the resurfacing of existing worn-out play-areas and ball-courts where warranted.  The planning data for national schools specifies the extent and area to be provided for the individual school.</P>
      <P>In the case of post primary schools provision is made for appropriate hard play areas where new schools or major extensions are being developed.  In the case of existing schools the maintenance or upgrading of play areas is the responsibility of the board of management.</P>
      <P>The demand for accommodation is such that available funding has to be directed towards the provision of urgently needed teaching spaces.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently completed a survey in regard to the accommodation and other facilities in all national schools in the country.  The data emerging from this survey when analysed will provide up-to-date information on the standard of play areas generally.</P>

      <P>These appointments were made on the basis of priority of need following the collection of data from schools by my Department's Primary Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review and the needs of all schools, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>
