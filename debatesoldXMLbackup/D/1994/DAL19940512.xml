      <P>After many years this House agreed a reasonable interpretation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule. However, it now appears that a <i>sub judice</i> rule is being applied in respect of any matter before a committee of the House so that no Member of this House may raise it in this Chamber.  I seek your guidance, Sir, on how we might approach this matter.  It is the most absurd proposition that Members cannot raise in this Chamber a matter before a committee of the House.</P>

I will communicate <Col N="1377" /> with the Deputies concerned with a view to elaboration in respect of the ruling I made.  My ruling was never intended to place a block on matters from committees being raised in the House.  I will communicate with the Deputies in some detail on this subject.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(ii) by the substitution in subsection (2) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1989), of &lsquo;£10,0000&rsquo; and &lsquo;£5,000&rsquo;, <Col N="1386" /> respectively, for &lsquo;£7,200&rsquo; and &lsquo;£3,600&rsquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1993), and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have two general comments to make. First, last week the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs sat four days to discuss the Committee Stage of this Bill.  While Standing Orders, the workings of that committee and the debate on different Chapters of the Bill facilitated a detailed analysis and some significant changes to the Bill &mdash; I welcome some of the Minister's amendments tabled on Report Stage &mdash; I was appalled that the media, almost <i>en masse</i> ignored the debate on the most significant Bill being processed which involves a huge amount of work.  I saw at least 60 Department of Finance officials in attendance.  I have no officials to help me, neither do my colleagues on the Opposition benches. The amount of work put into this Bill is quite extraordinary.  I am not complaining about lack of publicity or four minute sound bites or statements on this very detailed work.  Next year, perhaps, we might examine the possibility of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill being taken in this Chamber, under the same Standing Order, so that the debate might get some media coverage.  There are 212 amendments to be disposed of today in five hours.  Therefore, I shall be brief in my comments on each.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 deal with the issue of exemption limits with regard to income tax liability, that is in respect of people on low pay, which is a very successful way of targeting tax relief at the low paid.  The Minister effected no changes in exemption limits other than for children and, therefore, failed to meet a very pressing need.  As was said on Committee Stage, the annual practice was for the Minister in his Budget Statement to say that so many people were taken out of the income tax net.  The Minister has departed from that practice and in failing to increase the exemption limits, he has brought people back into the income tax net.  It is clear that poverty and unemployment traps can be rectified, not by the very expensive increase in all <Col N="1387" /> personal allowances but through targeting them at the low paid.</P>
    <P>The case we made on Committee Stage for the elderly has been ignored and my amendment No. 2 deals with this issue. People who have worked all their lives and are in receipt of contributory old age pension from the Department of Social Welfare may also be in receipt of a small superannuation pension, perhaps from a local authority, a company like Irish Life or other former employer.  That is subject to tax.  Those people are entitled to some additional relief.  I regret the Minister turned down the suggestion that a single person in receipt of less then £100 per week should not have to pay income tax and that a married couple in receipt of less than £200 per week should not have to pay income tax.  Last night when examining European income tax comparisons I found that the low paid in Ireland are throttled for tax unlike people residing elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>These amendments afford the Minister a last chance to mend his hand, ensuring that the low paid are not merely the subject of rhetorical propaganda but rather get real improvements in their standard of living.  Will the Minister reconsider this issue and address it as he failed to do in the course of his Budget Statement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only did we course this issue on Committee Stage at some length but I tabled an amendment similar to amendment No. 1 today for the last three Finance Bills because of my conviction that whatever money is there to alleviate the tax burden ought to be targeted at people on low incomes.  We have been over the course to show that poverty in this society is not peculiar to people on social welfare benefits.  People on low incomes, and there are a great many of them, are also caught in the poverty trap. The Government accepts that fact through instruments like the family income supplement because it is acknowledged that people on low incomes with a family find it impossible to make ends meet.  The purpose of this amendment is to clearly state that it is disgraceful that <Col N="1388" /> a single person in receipt of just over £71 per week theoretically should become liable to income tax.  Nobody could reasonably argue that a threshold of £100 per week &mdash; as stipulated in amendment No. 1 &mdash; before incurring liability to income tax is fair or reasonable.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister remind the House of the cost of implementing this proposal? As was noted on Committee Stage, the Minister has abandoned the annual habit of telling us how many people are being taken out of the tax net as a result of changes he effects in the budget each year.  He explained his reasons for so doing and more or less agreed that largely it was a meaningless exercise not relevant for very long because of changing circumstances and so on.</P>
      <P>The fact that there are so many people on low incomes in a society within which the structure of the work-force is changing must be recognised.  For example, the days of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. traditional style job have ended for very many people.  There has been the proliferation of contract or casual work, part-time work, of shared work and so on which means there are a great many people who are on low incomes.  Then there has been the proliferation of work in the services sector, some in the services sector are very well paid, while others, especially in the personal services area, are poorly paid.  Many of the changes and-or improvements effected in the tax code over recent years have disproportionately benefited higher income earners.  The focus needs to be on taking low income earners out of the net entirely and that is the purpose of this amendment. I ask the Minister to reconsider his position and to allow the word to go out from here that anybody earning less than £100 per week is not liable to income tax.  That at least would make a major contribution to lifting many people out of the poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to keep my remarks brief, as requested by Deputy Yates.  The purpose of amendment No. 1, which is a repeat of a Committee Stage <Col N="1389" /> amendment, is to increase the general exemption limits by £1,400 for widows and single persons and by £2,800 for married persons.  The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to increase by £400 and £800 exemption limits related to persons aged 65 years and over.  As I explained last week, section 1 already provides for an increase in the general exemption limits in the case of taxpayers with dependent children.  The special child addition which operates in conjunction with exemption limits is increased by £100 per child from £350 to £450 for the first two dependent children and £550 to £650 for each dependent child thereafter.  The child element of the exemption limits is intended to target relief at the group which is identified as in particular need of support &mdash; low income married couples with families. I have no difficulty with Deputy Rabbitte's statement that these are the families we should target.</P>
      <P>In examining the rate of the exemption limit this year I also provided for a decrease from 48 per cent to 40 per cent of the tax rate applied where a taxpayer's income is above the appropriate exemption limit but is entitled to the marginal relief.  Both these measures cost the Exchequer in excess of £10 million in 1994 and £20 million in a full year.  Some 2,900 persons and about 6,000 persons with children will be exempted because of that measure.  That measure brings 25,500 taxpayers with 36,000 children into marginal relief.  As well as benefiting the 33,800 taxpayers who move into marginal relief, there are also benefits for over 100,000 existing marginal relief cases.  These moves are directed at the group referred to by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that the income tax treatment of the elderly is more favourable than for taxpayers generally. The exemption limits for pensioners are significantly higher than those which apply generally.  Currently they stand at £4,100 for a single person and £8,200 for a married couple aged 65 and over.  For those aged 75 years and over the exemption limit is £4,700 for a single person and £9,400 for a married couple. Pensioners who have incomes slightly <Col N="1390" /> about the exemption limits are also taxed at the marginal relief rate of 40 per cent. It is more beneficial to pensioners to be taxed under the normal tax system.  The age allowance of up to £400 for a married couple is given in addition to the normal tax free allowance, ensuring that pensioners get preferential treatment under the tax system.  While the age allowance has remained unchanged for a period it is important to consider that the overall taxation system, is better for everybody rather than examining one case in isolation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the point made by Deputy Yates, I agree with the objective of trying to lift the burden of taxation.  That is what everybody wants.  We are often lectured about our allegedly miserable performance in the income tax area compared with our neighbours on the other side of the Irish Sea.  It is not generally recognised that low income families get a much better deal than equivalent families in the United Kingdom.  Even before the budget a married couple with four children could earn £9,000 before paying any income tax whatsoever.  The threshold for tax purposes for this family has now risen to £9,400.  The equivalent family in the United Kingdom would have been obliged to pay almost £800 in income tax in the year 1993-94.  I am not sure what Deputy Yates read last night but it is not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Let us put this debate in simple terms.  The Minister is saying it is right that once a single person earns in excess of £72 per week they will have to start paying a marginal rate of tax of PRSI plus 27p in the pound &mdash; say, a total of 35p in the pound.  I do not know whether the Minister visits the Border constituencies but apropos his point in relation to people being better off on this side of the Border than in the UK, many people who work in Derry, Sealink or in the British jurisdiction but reside in Ireland on a fairly full time basis, have to pay more tax when they get their PAYE balancing statement.  The Minister's examples of individual cases who may be marginally better off disregards <Col N="1391" /> the fact that at the end of the day people pay more tax under the Irish system, leaving aside the fact that in Britain they have a three tier tax rate with a particularly low rate for the lower paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to press this amendment <Col N="1392" /> because somebody on £80 per week should not pay income tax and a married couple on a single income of £145 per week should not pay income tax.  That is not fair.  This is affordable in this year's budget.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte.  I observe that amendment No. 10 is an alternative.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 3 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;For the purposes of income tax assessment, married persons shall mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a man and woman who are married to each other, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as man and wife.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 10 are similar. As we debated this matter on Committee Stage I will not delay the House.  The point at issue is that those people who are in <i>de facto</i> marriages or second unions and who cannot, under the law, get married are not recognised as man and wife under the tax code.  The Minister raised our expectations during the debate on the Finance Bill last year when he indicated he would review the matter.  Unfortunately, he indicated last week that tax law must lag behind general law in terms <Col N="1394" /> of a review and, therefore, he has not tabled any amendments.</P>
    <P>The travesty is that those people who are cohabiting and wish to claim a lone parent's allowance are told that under the social welfare code they must claim as man and wife.  If they go out to work they cannot claim an adult dependant allowance or child dependant allowance even though under the social welfare system they are treated as a family unit. This is farcical and illogical.</P>
    <P>The question is how we confine it to couples living as man and wife and who, under the law, cannot remarry.  That is a simple proposition.  The advice of the Attorney's General &mdash; which was not published &mdash; is that we cannot introduce a cohabiting allowance.  I ask the Minister to review the matter before the next Finance Bill &mdash; God only knows where any of us will be at that stage &mdash; and consider introducing a cohabiting allowance for married couples in all but name.  This is the purpose of amendments Nos. 3 and 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This has become a hardy annual in recent years but I am sceptical about its worth.  I can see, at a superfical level, the attractiveness of this proposition but the cruel truth is that single people in particular do extremely badly under the tax code.  No matter how we would seek to define the arrangements in a case such as this people would be able to drive a coach-and-four through it in practice. For that reason, far from eliminating anomalies, it would create even more glaring ones.</P>
      <P>A different logic is applied under the social welfare code.  When one considers extending one line of reasoning from one code to another sometimes it can be seen they are applied for different reasons and that it is logical to treat people separately. I cannot support these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said he had been advised by the Attorney General that this would be inconsistent with the Constitution.  I have tried to highlight this major issue in Irish life at the request of many couples who <Col N="1395" /> are living as man and wife in a common law relationship and believe they are discriminated against under the tax code. The Minister has not denied this.  These people do not have the opportunity to remarry.  It is not a cliché to say that we have divorce Irish style; what we do not have is the right to remarry.  The Government states that 60,000 marriages have broken down.  One cannot automatically say that 60,000 persons find themselves in this situation but I think the Minister and each Deputy in this House knows that there are a great many people in second relationships, many of whom would remarry if they had an opportunity. They are living as man and wife in a common law relationship; yet, they are assessed as single individuals irrespective of their responsibilities.  Whatever about my amendment being unconstitutional this is an injustice.</P>
      <P>When I tabled a similar amendment last year the Minister indicated he hoped that we would deal with the question of divorce before another Finance Bill was presented.  The position would then be that tax law would follow civil law.  One year later we still have not dealt with this major problem in society.  If we can manage to do this under the social welfare code what is the reason we cannot do so under the tax code?  If this resolution is not constitutionally firm I invite the Minister, as I did on Second and Committee Stages, to present his own amendment or suggest how the wording of the amendment can be improved but the fact remains that I have taken this amendment from the Social Welfare Act, 1991. Many people find it hard to understand the reason people who are cohabiting, unemployed and in receipt of various social welfare benefits are regarded by the State as being married for the purposes of assessing the benefits to which they are entitled but as being single under the tax code where the State takes money from the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be reasonable or fair that when the State gives out money under the social welfare code it regards two people as married, but when it is taking in money <Col N="1396" /> it regards those two people as single. There is a major anomaly in this area.  I will not enter into an argument with the Minister if he says this amendment is not the way to go about changing this, but the 60,000 known cases of marital breakdown and those in second relationships, many of whom would remarry if it were possible to do so in this jurisdiction, are being discriminated against under the tax code.  If the Minister continues to hold the view that this amendment is not constitutionally practicable, what hope is he offering those people?  What is he saying to those in second relationships?  If he continues to oppose this change because of the advice available to him, so be it, but it is incumbent on him and his advisers to tell those people that there is hope and that they are considering addressing the injustice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been discussed at some length, but I will restate some of the points.  The right to remarry is prohibited by our Constitution and because of that there is no reason tax or any other law should recognise the status of cohabiting couples on a positive basis.  Social welfare law is designed to prevent cohabiting couples getting better treatment than married couples.  That is an anti-avoidance provision, not an anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples for income tax purposes arose out of the Supreme Court decision in the Murphy <i>v.</i> Attorney General case in 1980 in which it was held that a position in which a married couple might pay more tax than two single persons living together would be repugnant to the Constitution.  Therefore, a married couple is entitled to double tax free allowances and bands, whereas a person cohabiting is entitled to only a single person's allowances and bands.  Deputies Rabbitte and Yates will appreciate that the tax law in principle follows and reflects the general law relating to marriage.  That has been the position for a number of years because of our Constitution.  As the House is aware, the Government is committed to holding a referendum on divorce in the near future <Col N="1397" /> and intends reviewing the taxation of cohabiting couples in the light of the outcome of that referendum.</P>
    <P>The treatment of cohabitating couples under social welfare provisions arises out of the 1989 Supreme Court decision in the Hyland case.  That decision found that the social welfare provisions in question were unconstitutional in that they treated a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabitating couple.  The social welfare provisions now in operation explicitly give cohabitating couples the same treatment as married couples in determining the level of entitlement to benefits.  The effect of the provisions is to preclude cohabitating couples from receiving better treatment than married couples.  It is not possible to extend the treatment of cohabitating couples under the social welfare code to the tax code because cohabitating couples are explicitly given similar treatment to married couples in determining the level of entitlement where either both partners are on unemployment assistance or where one partner is on unemployment assistance and the other is receiving social insurance payments. The effect of this is to restrict cohabitating couples from receiving better treatment than married couples and follows from the Supreme Court decision in the Hyland case in 1989.  The matter must rest there until the referendum is held and the Government reviews the matter in the light of the results of the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is not to make <Col N="1398" /> married couples worse off than cohabitating couples.  What we want is equality. We want the provisions of the social welfare code extended to the tax code.  I question the political will in this regard. We know the Government is long-fingering the divorce referendum and that many Government backbenchers do not want divorce in this jurisdiction.  This is a practical example of how people who have been unfortunate enough to suffer marriage breakdown lose out under the tax code when they enter a second union. Will the Minister review this matter again?  It is not beyond the scope of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister's Department or the Attorney General's office to devise a successful formula and I ask that their attention be focused in that direction in the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still cohabiting, but will not get their due allowances under the regulations.</P>
      <P>According to the Culliton report, for single people, approximately the first £12,000 should be assessed at the standard tax rate and the remainder at the higher rate and for married people the first £24,000 should be assessed at the standard rate and the remainder at the higher rate.  A clear and reasonable conclusion can be drawn from the progress of the past two budgets of this Administration in respect of this standard band. It has decided rhetorically to genuflect in the direction of Culliton, but in practice it has abandoned the Culliton thesis in terms of radical tax reform.  I welcome the move to widen the standard band, but the puny steps taken in no way tackle the radical hurdle set by Culliton.  Following the introduction of two budgets by this Administration, I can only conclude that when it faces the public in a general election we will have only limped towards the Culliton test rather than jumped the hurdle.  That is a serious failure.</P>
      <P>The most fundamental observation in that report related to the need for radical tax reform.  The single most substantial suggestion in respect of income tax was that not more than 20 per cent should pay tax above the standard band.  Considering this Bill and last year's Act, one is entitled to say the Government has abandoned that as an achievable target during its life.  If it cannot be achieved during the life of a Government which has the largest majority in the history of the State, one wonders if there is a genuine appetite for a radical, pro-jobs tax reform of the type advocated by the people asked to advise the State on this matter.  They gave solid, clear and unequivocal advice, which has been set to one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent are primary targets which my party has argued for.  In the 1992 budget the Minister gave a commitment to move to an upper rate of 44 per cent which appears to have been quietly buried.  That is regrettable.  I could continue at some length but I have made the essential point.  I do not suggest it can be achieved in one fell swoop but it is the litmus test <Col N="1401" /> of a commitment to radical, pro-jobs tax reform recommended by Culliton.  It is clear from the two budgets of this Government that it is not prepared to go down that road.  The largest single writeoff under any one heading in terms of giving tax back was the abolition of the iniquitous 1 per cent levy.  That is not tax reform but tax repentance.  This Bill does not represent radical tax reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider there is a great deal wrong with the existing tax rates of 26 and 48 per cent provided the bands are adequate and the exemption threshold is correct.  The real difficulty with our tax structure is that people are drawn into the tax net at very low incomes.  Those people become liable for the marginal rate of tax at a comparatively low income because of the narrow rate bands.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to have a comprehensive discussion on the Finance Bill and to suggest how to fund some of the changes we seek to make when it is not possible to table an amendment which involves a potential charge.  That restriction effectively puts us in a straight jacket.  I sought in the amendment the Chair has ruled out of order an alternative three-tiered tax code whereby the cost of lessening the burden on people on low and middle incomes would be clawed back from people on very high incomes.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that for the first time in some years the Minister has made no concession to raising the exemption level. That is a mistake.  The public will not acknowledge progress has been made in tax reform until the exemption level is right. Higher income earners would also benefit, but low income earners would benefit disproportionately for a change because in some cases it would take them out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second element is the rate bands. The existing bands are not fair because shortly after coming into the tax net on the 27 per cent standard rate one must pay tax at 48 per cent.  By any standards that is punitive.  On Committee Stage we discussed in detail the increasing number of taxpayers who become liable at the <Col N="1402" /> marginal rate.  That is a serious problem with our tax system.  My approach would be somewhat different from that of Deputy Cox in that I seek to ensure that such moneys as are available to relieve the burden of tax would go to people on low and middle incomes, but that will have to be funded.  The real inequity is the narrowness of the bands, the short duration people pay at 27 per cent tax before they become liable for 48 per cent tax.  That inequity must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments Nos. 6 and 7 take a slightly different approach, but their thrust is broadly similar.  The problem is that people who are in receipt of moderate rather than top incomes pay the top rate of tax.  People here reach the top rate of tax at the lowest level of income in Europe.  A single person whose income exceeds £223 per week pays more than half of it in income tax.  It is staggering that people on such modest incomes should be so penalised.  I not only refer to income tax at 48p in the £1, but 7.75 per cent PRSI which makes up a marginal tax rate of 55p to 56p in the £1.  For every £1 a person earns over that level he or she must pay more than half in tax.  That causes the brain drain because people who cannot amass after tax income leave the country.  In Britain the standard rate of tax applies to the first £23,000 income.  Our tax system is detrimental to employment because the non-wage element of labour costs is uncompetitive. It is 15 per cent out of line with that in England and Northern Ireland. As long as labour costs are central to competiveness we must consider reducing those costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week while debating the Finance Bill I was intrigued that an economist at a construction industry conference in Killarney said that, even allowing for a real growth in public expenditure, the fruits of economic growth would facilitate cuts in income tax of a minimum of £200 million annually.  That is a significant amount of money and contrasts with the reduction in income tax this year which, including the 1 per cent levy, amounted to £125 million.  If the Minister is able to <Col N="1403" /> control the excesses of his partners in Government while continuing to cohabit with them, he should focus his mind on meeting the pre-election promises of Fianna Fáil and, in next year's budget, take the modest step of increasing the standard rate for a married couple from £16,400 to £20,000 and for a single person to £10,000.  As far back as 1990, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he promised at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that this would be done.  Four years later we still have the modest levels of £8,200 for a single person and £16,400 for married couples.  Our tax wedge is uncompetitive in terms of non-wage labour costs and single people in particular working in a bank or in any white collar or professional employment, or even in the public service, find that a huge amount of their hard earned income is taken in tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to vary the income tax structure and the bands outlined in section 2 which proposes to increase the standard rate by £525 for single and widowed persons and £1,050 for married couples, while maintaining the 27 per cent and 48 per cent rates.  Deputy Yates's amendments would cost £164 million in a full year and the amendment in the names of Deputies McDowell and Cox would cost £620 million in a full year.  I have sympathy with the general direction of the proposals in so far as they relate to widening the standard band.  The vast proportion of money available this year went towards reducing the burden of tax by increasing personal allowances and widening the standard band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Government gave a commitment to raising the threshold at which people start paying the higher rate of tax. This is part of the Government strategy to try to alleviate the burden of taxation on workers with low incomes.  That was done in a number of ways this year.  It will be my responsibility to continue reducing the burden on workers with low incomes, particularly those with families and <Col N="1404" /> dependent children, but this can be done only as budgetary resources permit.  I accept Deputy Yates's argument that a tight rein on public expenditure assists that process.  We are trying to devise a budgetary strategy to keep Exchequer borrowing and inflation under control.  I accept that is the best vehicle to reduce the burden of taxation on the working population generally and we will continue in that direction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for a widening of the standard band for the current tax year by £525 in the case of single and widowed persons and £1,050 in the case of married couples.  This is a substantial widening of the standard band, the largest in ten years.  The last time it was widened to this degree, the tax rates were 65 per cent, 58 per cent and 35 per cent.  Since 1987-88 the standard band has been widened by £7,400, from £9,000 to £16,400, in the case of married couples and by £3,500, from £4,700 to £8,200, for single and widowed persons, an improvement of 75 per cent.  The Opposition is right in saying we have to do more in this area, we would if we had the necessary resources.  It must be acknowledged that in the last six or seven years we have made substantial strides in this area.</P>
    <P>The cost of the full tax package, including the cost of renewing the PRSI allowance and the revenue foregone by dropping the income levy, is £250 million in this tax year.  This is all that can be offered in present budgetary circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox will understand our reluctance to accept the 44 per cent rate.  Perhaps rates of 25 per cent and 45 per cent would be welcome, but it is more acceptable to put available resources into increasing the standard band.  The argument about adding PRSI to the 48 per cent rate is not straightforward.  I hope that for the next five or six years the standard band will continue to increase instead of adding small amounts to allowances and reliefs.  We have got away from that practice, which Deputy Cox welcomes. If we continually focus on increasing personal allowances and the standard band we will make an improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> The position of rates is secondary.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the 48 per cent rate is not out of line with international rates.  If we widened the band by a further 75 per cent in the next six or seven years we would have reached the £20,000 rate.  This year we made the biggest move in ten years and I hope that trend continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiment expressed by the Minister of focusing attention in financial planning on avoiding the blunderbuss approach whereby money is scattered around so much that we fail to consolidate available resources to areas of tax reform in which they are most urgently needed.  There is consensus about the urgent necessity to reduce the tax rate, particularly the standard band. A penal feature of the tax code is that people on comparatively low levels of income are drawn into it and, at a very early stage, pay high rates of tax in cases where average earnings may be substantially less than the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that during an earlier phase in his ministry he was an adherent of a reduced upper rate of tax, but he has the characteristics of the television advertisement for a credit card; he is a flexible friend and it depends on who is advising him.  He should be advised to reduce rates as well as broaden bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument on that, but there is an argument about the sense of urgency with which one wishes to achieve the desirable end.  The Minister <Col N="1406" /> said that the cost of the proposal put forward by Deputy McDowell and myself would be £620 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>On occasions our debates on taxation are what I would regard as arguments about a certain false economy. I do not argue that our tax system is the sole cause of unemployment, but I have no doubt that its structure is a significant underlying problem.  In that regard the cost of a change must be balanced against the anti-jobs dimension of the existing structure. Currently our dole bill is more than £1 billion a year, and if the number receiving dole could be reduced there would be more capacity for expenditure in other areas.</P>
      <P>The tax area has to be first among equals precisely because it was identified as the single most effective policy instrument in the hands of Government to tackle unemployment.  I acknowledge the attention it is receiving which is consistent with a run of change over time. However, the change in not radical enough.  I suggest that looking at the cost without looking at the dynamics in terms of employment and unemployment and the benefits that would flow from a radical pro-jobs tax reform can exaggerate the cost because, in the end, the real cost of excessive taxation is excessive structural unemployment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;A deduction shall be made <Col N="1407" /> from the total income of a parent for the year of assessment 1994-95 and subsequent years of assessment in respect of relief amounting to £400 per child.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a group of amendments which were not debated on Committee Stage and to which I attach some importance.  This amendment seeks to reintroduce into the tax code a basic tax free allowance for dependent children on the basis that the cost of rearing children should be acknowledged in the tax code as it is in the social welfare code.  Any parent will confirm that rearing children does not come free.  Whether it is for clothing, food, education, health care, right up to the point when the chickens leave the nest, there is a major cost in rearing children resulting in a reduction in the standard of living of their parents. That is an inescapable fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that changes in child benefit have the effect of meeting the needs of parents.  This is an utterly inadequate argument because people find that they are caught in poverty traps by virtue of the fact that, although they get more money from the Department of Social Welfare for each child they have, they get no recognition in the tax code. Under the social welfare code a married person with ten children has a vastly different income from a married couple with no children.  Under the tax code a teacher with ten children is treated as if those children did not exist.  A teacher with ten children and a teacher with no children have the same tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>My proposal, which I estimate will cost about £90 million, is fundamental to equity in the tax code.  Studies of the income tax system from 1981-93 show that the tax burden on married couples and parents has risen acutely.  So much lip service is paid to supporting families and family values.  A practical expression of that would be to change the tax code. It was a mistake to abolish the tax free allowance.  It was another Labour Party inspired measure on the grounds of so-called <Col N="1408" /> equity.  Such change could be implemented by way of tax credit or tax allowance.  I take the point that the benefit would confer greater value on those who are on higher incomes, but I do not go along with standardisation across the whole spectrum because one must take account of the amount of tax people are paying as opposed to a theoretical argument about percentages and rates.</P>
    <P>The question of whether parents should have a greater tax free allowance than those who have no children is an important and fundamental issue which I will seek to make a central issue in the next general election campaign.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  Given that this country's psyche is pro-family and pro-children, it is a fundamental flaw that our tax code does not recognise it.  I accept that if a person has four or more children it is not worth his while to go to work except for an income well in excess of the average industrial wage.  That is wrong.  People with large families have to have a spouse at home minding those children and they are the people who are most likely to be long term unemployed because it simply does not pay them to go out to work.  I know such people in my constituency, people who have been farm workers, with a fixed income agreed with SIPTU and IBEC.  It would not pay them to go to work if they had five or six children, given that their medical card and rent allowance are based on their gross income and taking into account transport costs and fringe benefits such as the Christmas bonus, the free fuel allowance, etc.  A key feature is that their take home pay is not as enhanced as it should be because there is no basic allowance for children.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important amendments tabled.  It is the most important area in which to bring equity between relative groups of taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We find ourselves dealing more with the level of existing allowances and suggesting new allowances because of inequities in the existing tax system.  Some of these allowances might <Col N="1409" /> not be necessary if there was genuine equity in the tax system.  We must, therefore, address the situation as it is.</P>
      <P>I would feel more comfortable with Deputy Yates's amendment if we had a system of tax credits because then the benefit would go to lower income families. I would enthusiastically support the spirit of the amendment where parents on low incomes raising children would get the benefit of the provision.  Rearing children is very expensive and that is not acknowledged in the tax code.  There is a world of difference in the circumstances of a married couple with no children and a married couple with two, three or four children.  People with children at different stages of development appreciate the additional financial burden that imposes. I very much support the spirit of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to restore the income tax child allowance on a universal basis at the rate of £400 per child.  The child allowance was withdrawn, as Deputy Yates mentioned, from the income tax code with effect from 1986, in conjunction with the introduction of the new social welfare child benefit payment, in accordance with the Government's intention to consolidate secondary tax allowances with social welfare payments.  Last year there were significant increases in that scheme which brought the rate up to £20 per week for the first, second and third child and £23 per week for the fourth and subsequent children.  The additional changes announced in this year's budget mean that the £23 rate will increase to £25 from September next and that the higher rate will be extended to cover the third rather than the fourth child. Substantial improvements were made, therefore, last year and this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment must be viewed against the progress in reducing the level of income tax over the years which has had significant benefits for families and taxpayers.  There has been a reduction in the top rate of tax from 58 per cent in 1988-89 to 48 per cent now, which has been of substantial help, and the 35 per <Col N="1410" /> cent rate has dropped to 27 per cent. Everybody benefits from those reductions in addition to the exemption limits to which we referred earlier.  Under the proposals in this section, the child additions to the exemption limits are being increased by £100 to £450 for the first two children and £650 for the third and subsequent children.  Again, this will help low and middle class income families and there is a concentration on the child additions to the exemption limits rather than the child tax allowance.  That is the best way to achieve our aim, as Deputy Rabbitte correctly said.  The amendment would cost £52 million this year and £88.7 million in a full year but we have given substantial reliefs.</P>
    <P>I quoted certain figures last week which I would like to mention again because the argument that the tax system gives no recognition to children is not correct. As I said last week, on an income of £8,500, the saving per year as a result of the child exemption for a family with two children is £360, for four children the saving is £520.  For a family on an income of £9,500 with two children the saving is £360 and with four children the saving is £880.  For a family on an income of £10,500 with two children the saving is £313, with four children it is £833 and for a family with six children the saving would be over £1,200.  There are, therefore, benefits in this.  Deputy Yates outlined how this could be targeted because otherwise a wealthy person with ten children would get the child benefit.  Of course, where children are not recognised in the tax code they are included in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The changes last year and this year &mdash; and we are committed in the Programme for Government to continue to move in this direction &mdash; are of major benefit and a direct acknowledgment of what everybody said here, that the costs to a family of having children as against a family with no children are substantial from the point of view of clothes, food, educational costs, overheads, etc.  That is recognised in Government policy.  The changes last year and this year are substantial and it <Col N="1411" /> is the Government's intention to continue in that vein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We must face reality.  To deal with this matter by way of child benefit alone is to make insignificant changes.  A couple of pounds per month is spread over many people.  The wealthiest people get child benefit but the people on the lowest level of income get the same amount.  The benefit is not focused in any way and there is a fundamental inequity.  If someone goes to work with the primary motivation of trying to give their sons or daughters the opportunity of having a better life, the tax code should take that into account.</P>
      <P>In Germany, where the demographics are such that they do not have a birth rate to sustain their population, there is now a strong argument about who will pay the pensions of childless people in years to come.  If someone gets tax relief on a good apartment or drives a Porsche, surely the tax code should acknowledge the cost of child rearing?  We have not reached that stage yet but the way our birth rate is going, in ten or 20 years the key issue will be who will fund our pensions which are paid out of current requirement.  This amendment will be seen in posterity as being perspicacious, far-sighted and worthy of support.  I regret that the Minister's policy is against granting tax free allowances for children. This is a matter which strikes a chord with the general public and ultimately I will let the case rest with them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Where an individual provides child minding services in their place of residence, a deduction shall be made from the total income of that individual for the year of assessment 1994-95 or any subsequent year of assessment in respect of relief amounting to £1,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> This amendment deals with the situation where both spouses are required to work and the resulting additional child minding costs.  One of the growth areas for employment will be personal care services, home repair services, child minding, etc.  This service operates extensively in the black economy at present and the acceptance of this amendment would be one way of bringing this whole area into the tax code &mdash; which would cost less than £12 million &mdash; in cases where bona fide child minding expenses are established. This problem primarily faces women.  They should not be chained to the kitchen sink, we must try to improve their role in the labour force and one way of facilitating them is to ensure that at the end of the week when they do their sums and take account of childminding costs, they are left with a reasonable take-home pay.  This amendment would help them in a small way.</P>
    <P>I know many couples with young children who both must work to pay the mortgage.  This is a modest amendment that would give a modicum of relief where both spouses are required to go to work in those circumstances.  If this proposal was successful it could be extended to other areas of personal services and home improvement services, gardening, etc.  It is consistent with my earlier amendments because it represents support for the family and parents and acknowledges the stresses and costs associated with child rearing.  We must remember we are moving into an era where it is commonplace for people not to get married and where couples deliberately decide not to have children.  Notwithstanding the fact that marriages break down, there is no better structure than the family in which to bring up children. Child minding expenses are a bona fide cost where both parents are working. In cases where there is a combined income of, say £10,000 the couple could not survive on one income.</P>
    <P>The wording of the amendment could be improved but the principle is a sound one which the Minister should accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the case <Col N="1413" /> made by Deputy Yates.  It would be regarded in certain quarters as a popular measure and his argument is not without force.  The basic system is so penal in respect of ordinary levels of income that the need to seek extra allowances arises. If we had a fair tax system the need for allowances would be diminished and would remove the force from such arguments.</P>
      <P>Proposals such as those made by Deputy Yates should be consolidated and form part of essential tax reform.  If people were left with more of their income they would have freedom to make choices and could pay for child minding facilities or whatever.  The cruel burden of taxation robs them of that freedom. That must remain the focus of those interested in tax reform.</P>
      <P>I respect the logic in the amendment but we must return to the core argument that we have a penal tax system, the rate, bands and structure of which need to be reformed.  That is how to facilitate the case made by Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not have an opportunity on Committee State to debate this amendment and I am anxious to hear the Minister's views.  During the currency crisis the number of visits to the clinics made by young married couples, both working, who did not know how they would pay the next mortgage repayment was remarkable.  One had the impression that the combined income of two young people with a new mortgage was modest and both were compelled to work in order to discharge the mortgage in the early years.  Notwithstanding the <i>caveat</i> I entered earlier, I am disposed to helping such people in any way we can, in the absence of the ideal tax code which we will probably never see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's view on whether this amendment would contribute to persuading those who offer this service to come into the white economy if there was an allowance in the tax code for so doing? Child minding services are offered widely and in most cases the person providing the service does not wish it to come to the attention of the Revenue.  At this <Col N="1414" /> stage of society's development, both parents go out to work and someone else minds their children either in the child's residence or the residence of the minder.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates suggests that the tax relief would apply to the person supplying the service in their residence.  He is right about the potential employment in this area.  The problem is exacerbated by the absence of any pre-school structure. To the best of my knowledge, many Montessori pre-schools are not within the white economy.  If the Minister looks favourably on the amendment, does he consider it would invite such people to provide the service on the basis of remunerated income in the normal way within the tax system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was brought to my attention by a number of groups and I undertook to examine it in detail. On the surface it seems as if it might be feasible but when one examines it one sees the pluses and minuses.  I agree with Deputy Yates that there is no better structure than the family and it should be helped under the tax code, if possible.</P>
      <P>In his amendment Deputy Yates would give an allowance of £1,000 to a family where both parents are working but would not give anything to the member of the family who stayed at home on a full-time basis minding the children. When I floated that idea at meetings there was no doubt which side of the argument the audience favoured &mdash; the allowance should also be given to the person who stayed at home to mind the children.  It is a difficult argument to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cox rightly said that we had four Finance Bills over three years.  I have been lobbied by various groups and been involved in negotiations on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and with the Department of Labour.  It is the same story each year.  Some people are obsessed with getting reliefs, allowances and concessions for everything &mdash; I do not want to refer to any area in particular. This may be due to the tax system.  I am worried that we will reach the stage where people will invest in apartments, <Col N="1415" /> offices, hotels or restaurants only if they get a section 23, section 27 or section 35 relief or qualify under the BES or urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>People are very imaginative when it comes to qualifying for reliefs.  The section 35 relief introduced in the 1969 Act was intended to be of benefit to artistic people who could help develop the arts.  However, I recently heard about a person who put together a tuppenny book outlining how to add one and one and who sought relief on the basis that this was an addition to the arts.  Even before the debate on this Bill is concluded people will be thinking of ways to qualify for relief.  Last night I opened a tax conference and some of the stories I was told later would make the hair stand on your head.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points put forward by Deputy Cox on this matter, and I think Deputy Rabbitte would go part of the way with us if he could see how the overall system worked.  If we keep on granting reliefs we will never get anywhere &mdash; every relief costs money and either reduces the amount of money available to the Minister for Finance or ensures that the rates stay higher and the bands stay lower.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the balance if most of the people providing the service are in the black economy?  Is there a balance there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with that point.  The reality is that many people on the unemployment register are working for a few hours a week.  I do not believe they are all working 50 hours a week, but they do a few hours work a week in one form or another.  It would be very beneficial if these people could be attracted to leave the black economy. The last time a relief of this kind was introduced was during the late 1970s when a relief was given for home improvements.  At that time contractors operated a two-tier price system depending on whether a person was claiming tax relief.  For example, a person claiming <Col N="1416" /> tax relief was quoted a price of £1,000 while a person who was not claiming tax relief was quoted a price of £800.  This relief was done away with because everyone claimed it and there was no corresponding saving.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes the introduction of a tax free allowance of £1,000 per annum in respect of expenses incurred by a parent in taking care of his or her child or children in the home.  I had hoped to introduce a similar relief in the budget because it sounded like a very good idea.  I have not totally written off the possibility of introducing such a relief in future years.  This amendment would introduce a new discretionary relief into the tax system with an inevitable narrowing of the tax base and lead to renewed demands from other groups which are seeking discretionary tax reliefs.  It would also involve a large cost for the Exchequer &mdash; the estimate is £30 million &mdash; and, more importantly, it would signal a change in the Government's position on tax reform.  The Government's objective is to remove as many low income families as possible from the tax net.  If we continue to grant reliefs it will not prove possible to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Several points have been put forward in favour of an allowance for child-minding costs.  I agree with Deputy Yates that this allowance would make it easier for both spouses in a marriage to go out to work.  Families living in new houses, particularly in the Dublin area, require two incomes to pay the mortgage even with low interest rates.  It has also been argued that the allowance would help to create jobs, combat the black economy where child-minders pay no tax and draw social welfare at the same time and help offset the child-minding costs incurred by working single parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While an allowance for child-minding would undoubtedly be of assistance to a married couple where both spouses worked outside the home or wished to do so, it would clearly discriminate against a married couple with children where one spouse stayed at home to care for the children.  A married couple with both <Col N="1417" /> spouses working would get an allowance for employing a child-minder whereas a married couple with one parent working and the other remaining at home to care for the children would not.  This issue would first have to be dealt with if we were to move in this direction.  The amendment would benefit, among others, the better off double income taxpayers who could afford to employ a child-minder while not recognising the valuable contribution of those working in the home.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee that granting a tax reduction of £1,000 to a person employing a child-minder will create any additional jobs or automatically bring the child-minder out of the black economy. The value of tax reliefs in achieving greater compliance is highly questionable since such reliefs involve high costs for relatively little return.  The net result of a relief along the lines proposed by Deputy Yates could leave employers faced with a substantial increase in fees.  A tax deduction of £1,000 would not seem very attractive in those circumstances.  The experience of the tax relief for personal services is not very encouraging in this regard.  That relief was abolished in 1983 because it failed to create any worthwhile additional employment.</P>
    <P>As regards single parent families, the Government is not insensitive to the plight of such families, which have a particular difficulty.  The tax code already provides an additional personal allowance for single parents to give them allowances equivalent in aggregate to that of a married couple.  This allowance was intended to cover to some extent the childminding costs of a working single parent.</P>
    <P>I will continue to consider the possibility of introducing such an allowance, but it will have to be broader than the one proposed by Deputy Yates if it is not to create difficulties.  Such an allowance would also have to be granted across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to press my amendment.  Deputy Cox and the Minister take the straightforward simplistic <Col N="1418" /> view that all reliefs should be given at the basic rates.  Politicians have an obligation to put forward the experiences they come across and to espouse the introduction of certain values in the system.  Politicians do not have to calculate the rates &mdash; the guys in Merrion Street can do that, it is a simple case of arithmetic.  If the Minister says it cost £30 million, if one takes as many people claiming at the top rate as the lower rate, something in the region of 75,000 people will be eligible for this relief, which would be of real help.  In fact, it might facilitate people in their family planning.</P>
      <P>The point the Minister made about single parents was valid &mdash; I could not have put the argument better &mdash; they have a problem regardless of whether they go to work.  This type of relief would directly benefit such people.</P>
      <P>This package of amendments has an underlying philosophy which is that parents do not weigh up the cost of child rearing.  Indeed, this philosophy was aptly demonstrated in a song which depicted a very demanding child who, for doing various household chores, washing dishes or removing the dustbin charged $5 or whatever.  Then the mother wrote down all the chores she undertook such as making the bed, cleaning, cooking, a myriad of tasks and, at the bottom she had put &ldquo;no charge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The tax system discriminates against families.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw this amendment.  I do not accept that politicians should not interfere in the tax code to support views and values, which is what these amendments attempt to do.  Bureaucratic constraints impede what the Minister could do at the basic rate but it would send out a message attributing greater relevance to the many political statements all parties make about support for the family.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Where a spouse works full-time in the family home, caring for an adult or child dependant, a deduction shall be made from the total income of that person for the year of assessment 1994-95 and subsequent years of assessment in respect of relief amounting to £1,000.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a simple, practical fact that if a couple have a certain number of children one spouse must remain at home.</P>
      <P>I first entered this House in 1981 on the crest of a wave attributed to the charisma of our former party Leader, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  One of the infamous issues in that June 1981 election, when we won 20 seats, was the £9.60 to be paid to the wife who remained at home.  It was a matter of subsequent derision that this was never implemented.  I understand the reason it was not was that, when it came to administering and implementing it, the mandarins of Merrion Street baulked and said it could not be done.  I am now endeavouring to bring about the same effect, which is to recognise the role of the full-time parent working in the home. There is no doubt that the value of a mother in the home is totally underrated. I am sure it is politically incorrect to say this but the love and attention a woman in the home can give on a full-time basis must have a very beneficial impact on bringing up children.  That is not to decry people who have to go to work; I have already spoken in support of them. Where possible, such full-time spouses working in the home should be assisted. Indeed if the purpose of this amendment is to get more women to remain at home, it may well free up great job opportunities for sons, daughters and school-leavers seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment which can be implemented and would give effect to that infamous proposal of paying £9.60 per week to stay-at-home wives, which was profoundly popular.  It needs <Col N="1420" /> to be re-examined because it is something from which many women would benefit. If the Minister has the relevant statistics he might let us know how many spouses of taxpayers fall into that category.  The spouses at work reaping the benefit of an additional tax allowance of £1,000 would be of practical benefit.  If we had a system of tax credits it would also facilitate greater equity in that it would be of greatest benefit to the lower and middle income groups.  As we do not have a system of tax credits this relief is proposed in the form of an allowance.  While I can see the political arguments against it I can also see the political benefits of implementing it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to detain the House unduly on this amendment but I feel obliged to respond to Deputy Yates. One of the difficulties with our tax system is that it has grown in a very <i>ad hoc</i> way and has become progressively more incoherent, with bits having been added or subtracted here and there.  We had begun to get into a type of culture &mdash; the Minister mentioned this when responding to an earlier question &mdash; in which, if there was not some kind of a tax break, people felt they should not engage in something.  In the earlier days of this State, and I revert to times when Governments were not involved to the extent they are now in the economy, when some people thought it was in their interests to build the railway system.  They did not do it with grants from Structural Funds, Exchequer grants or the like &mdash; even before that some people thought it was in their interests to build the canals system.  I merely revert to observe that more and more over time one has the impression here that if one wants to do something somehow or other it has to be helped by the State with incentives and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the charge of having a simplistic approach to the tax system.  My party and I have endeavoured to have a coherent approach.  The difficulty about wanting a little bit of everything &mdash; and I accept the politics that a little bit of everything can appeal to many target groups is interesting <Col N="1421" /> politics &mdash; is that, in the end, I do not even know whether that is the most coherent approach.  That is a matter of one's own political judgments, and Deputy Yates has made his choice.</P>
    <P>I do not have an argument with Deputy Yates when he extols the virtue of family life.  Neither do I have an argument with him when he talks about the contribution of full-time mothers working in the home because, among others, he is talking about my wife.  I do not have an argument about the kind of contribution she and people like her, make to one's family, one's home and all that goes with them.</P>
    <P>When dealing with taxation issues the essential question is that households &mdash; and when talking about families we can talk about them broadly in that sense &mdash; need a system which encourages and rewards effort.  The system should also give an incentive to work harder and substantially keep the benefit of that harder work in one's pocket rather than have half or more of it, between a variety of taxes and PRSI payments, appropriated by the State.  That is a pro-family view because, the more one encourages a household to look after itself, the better the overall result for that family and household.  I do not argue with the desirability, if we had the resources, to spread things around.  If we continue to spread the resources in an inefficient way we will get reform which is loosely targeted at various groups and which is a mile wide, an inch deep and makes no real difference.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of giving some income to the stay-at-home housewife. On the tax welfare trap many people say there is no point in taking a low paid job because they would lose out by a withdrawal of benefits and, possibly, family income supplement and so on.  A strong case can be made for substantially increasing child benefit as one way of mediating between the income tax and welfare elements.  It is not a direct form of income for the stay-at-home housewife but it is a way of addressing some of the fundamental results in our tax welfare system.  The more we integrate tax and welfare the more one is entitled to follow <Col N="1422" /> the logic of Deputy Yates' suggestion about targeting the household and the stay-at-home wife.  It has got to be done in a way which is coherent and which, together with tax and welfare, is sufficiently so to get over the worst features of our penal tax system and of the poverty traps between the operation of tax and welfare.  Far from having a view which is simplistic mine is a coherent one.  I share the values which Deputy Yates espouses but one is entitled to differ on the means to achieve them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct. I could not help thinking that it is 13 years this month &mdash; as mentioned by Deputy Yates &mdash; since we all had to do battle against the £9.60 for the stay-at-home wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody had thought it our properly so it could not be implemented.  The £9.60 for the stay-at-home wife was not in the context of a tax credit.  Half of the tax credit was to be paid direct to the spouse in the home who had a correspondingly reduced tax credit.  There are approximately 250,000 people in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes the introduction of a new tax allowance of £1,000 for a spouse working on a full time basis in the home, the cost of which would be about £30 million this year and £50 million in a full year.  To the extent that the amendment is designed to give recognition to the spouse in the home &mdash; who would generally have no income in her own right &mdash; the income tax system provides for this.  Notwithstanding that the decision of the Supreme Court in the <Col N="1423" /> Murphy case related only to the position of a married couple <i>vis-à-vis</i> two single persons when both spouses were in employment, the Government at that stage decided to treat married couples the same for tax purposes irrespective of whether they had one or two incomes. This was to avoid any possibility of discrimination against one income families, particularly where a spouse elected to care for the family on a full time basis at home rather than take up work outside the home.</P>
    <P>The proposal would be discriminatory as between married couples, a situation which, as I said, the present law seeks to avoid and could be open to the same constitutional challenge that arose in the Murphy case.  In many instances, the spouse in the home would not have any income or sufficient income to absorb the allowance.  In such circumstances where the couple were jointly assessed for tax purposes, it would be available to the other spouse earning an income outside the home.  This could lead to an anomalous situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> a couple where both worked outside the home in that, in many cases a one income family, by virtue of the extra allowance, could be better off than a two income family with the same combined income.  The amendment would not achieve the desired effect but would probably create more problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox asked how we could integrate the system.  The Government is committed to it and we have the preliminary report of the tax and social welfare group and the computer hardware is in place.  The experience of the working group is that it is not an easy task and is not quite so simple as people stated.  Last weekend I had the opportunity of speaking with some of those involved and I understand they are arriving at some interesting conclusions.  It is ultimately the way to resolve many of the difficulties. When the working group has completed its task perhaps the issues about the children's allowance, child benefit or whether there should be tax allowances will be clearer.  Some years ago <Col N="1424" /> when the present Taoiseach considered a change in how family benefit would be paid the reaction was unified in that there was a consensus to stay well away from it.  The idea that the richer people should in some way lose out to the benefit of the poorer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For the information of the House we will have a report from the working group on integration of tax and social welfare &mdash; perhaps not the final report &mdash; in late summer.  I hope to have the benefit of that report for next year.  On the simplication of the system, I have no doubt that, as Deputy Yates said, it is a more popular way to operate. It is easy to stand up and give out ten goodies, rather than a few taking tax back, and say that everyone is a little better off.  It so happens that it makes a better headline if we can say we are targeting relief to particular groups.  Until the final report on the social welfare and tax strategy is available I cannot see us making much more progress.  We hope to have that report this year subject to the group not getting into deep water.</P>

I appreciate that one can take a cynical view of the family but in my lifetime's experience, which I am sure is replicated by everyone in this House &mdash; it is significant that four men are debating this issue as I think women would have a completely different view &mdash; I was never short of money in my pocket, I used to smoke, drink and gamble when I was single but not after I married and had children.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to repeal section 14 of the Finance Act, 1992, which abolished the relief in respect of interest on loans to acquire an interest by way of share or loan capital in a quoted company.  In the case of existing loans, relief is phased out over a three year period, generally beginning with the second next tax year after the company becomes a quoted company.  For example, in the case of a taxpayer who took out a loan to acquire shares in a company which first became a quoted company in the tax year 1992-93, the relief available in this tax year will be on 40 per cent of the loan interest.  In these circumstances for a higher rate taxpayer it would confer relief at an effective rate of 22 per cent, which is not very far removed from the standard rate of tax of 27 per cent.</P>
      <P>Section 14 was enacted because it was felt that the rationale for relief to acquire an interest in a company was dubious for quoted companies which had access to capital through the stock market.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;With effect from the year 1994-1995, the provisions of section 138B of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as amended) and section 6 of the Finance Act, 1982 (as amended) shall apply to all taxpayers, whether employed or self-employed or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to extend full PRSI and PAYE allowances to all taxpayers, irrespective of their employment status, whether self-employed or employed. Some of these allowances were introduced because of the payment cycle.  The PAYE sector were given allowances to try to compensate for the time lag in the payment of tax by the self-employed. There have been radical reforms in the assessment and processing of self-employed tax liability.  Now that the process for dealing with taxation of the self-employed has changed there is a question of the equity of the system.  In essence the core of amendment No. 13 seeks to extend to all taxpayers equivalent allowances in respect of equivalent incomes because all taxpayers pay their tax in the same year.  There is a strong case to review the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 16, 20 and 21 in my name are being discussed with amendment No. 13.  This deals with the very core of what Deputy Rabbitte calls tax equity in terms of the burden borne by the PAYE sector compared with Schedule D taxpayers.  I have read reports and studied the statistics in support of the argument that the self-employed, especially farmers, have not paid their fair share and if one divides the amount of tax paid by the number of <Col N="1428" /> taxpayers there is a huge discrepancy. There are all sorts of reasons that is not the full story but I accept that the self-employed have an opportunity to work the system that those whose tax is deducted at source do not.  The case for a PAYE and PRSI allowance is valid. The system needs to be finely tuned.  I accept that the system of accounts for the self-employed is the fairest system and after the rigours of audit gives a fair indication of one's net disposable income.  I am in both categories, the self-employed and the employed, and I can see that under the legal code the self-employed have certain advantages.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cox makes the point that because of current year assessment everybody should get a personal allowance. I would not agree with abolishing the selectivity of the PAYE allowance. In amendment No. 16 I propose that those who get the benefits of the PRSI allowance should get the benefits of the PAYE allowance and those in the public sector who do not pay PRSI at the full rate would get the benefits of the PRSI allowance.  We would combine the £286 PRSI allowance and the £800 PAYE allowance into a new allowance of £1,086 for those people who receive the PAYE or the PRSI allowance.  That would meet the point of trying to give greater equity to those who are employed.  There are people at the edges who lose out, such as public sector employees, by not getting the PRSI allowance.  That allowance was introduced following a by-election campaign which coincided with the debate on a Finance Bill and has been retained since.</P>
      <P>I was asked by the ICMSA to table amendments Nos. 20 and 21 which were not discussed on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that sons and daughters employed on family farms will be given the PAYE allowance and, where the farmer or business person has no son or daughter and is transferring the farm or business by way of an inheritance or gift to a favoured niece or nephew, they will also get the PAYE allowance; in other words a wider definition would be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> Some of the claims made are exaggerated but it is true that the PAYE sector is being screwed.  It is also true that the self-employed take more risks; it is possible that someone who is self-employed will have no income next year. If they get sick they will have less protection. A range of factors has to be taken into account.  I appreciate that in relation to private and public sector workers there are degrees of security of tenure of employment.  I ask the Minister to consider combining the PAYE and PRSI allowance as it may be a better way of achieving the objective of income tax equity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex issue. Deputy Yates has been fair.  I, too, have read the statistics and literature on this matter but these do not represent my view.  I have a basic instinct; the PAYE worker is being screwed for tax and no one will ever convince me otherwise.  It does not matter what changes have been made; there are opportunities open to the self-employed to arrange their affairs in a certain way.  By definition, these opportunities will never be available to the PAYE worker.  No one can seriously challenge this.</P>
      <P>In relation to the self-employed there are differences especially in an era when PAYE workers are being forced to accept self-employed status.  Given the changing nature of the workforce there is a grey area.  As there is a facility open to the self-employed to work the system and arrange their affairs in a certain way there should be positive discrimination in favour of the PAYE worker.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we had an interesting debate on the question of inequity in terms of who may qualify for a higher education grant.  It is possible in a given year to contrive one's income to artificially diminish one's normal income to ensure one's son or daughter qualifies for a higher education grant to enter third level education.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the changes the Minister has introduced this year in respect of this allowance as it applies to <Col N="1430" /> the sons and daughters of proprietary directors, the self-employed and farmers. There are some conditions governing qualification but I do not see any reason the sons and daughters of farmers, proprietary directors and the self-employed should not benefit.  That is a different issue.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is not being taken with this amendment, but which is related, is based on my conviction that there should be positive discrimination in favour of the PAYE worker who cannot claim when he or she has to go to the garage to have the puncture to which Deputy Yates referred fixed.  Anecdotal evidence is best; we all have friends who are self-employed.  I have friends and colleagues who were forced to become self-employed against their will and who now say, &ldquo;you do not know what you are missing; we have never had it so good&rdquo;. I accept that the issue is more complex and that their are different categories among the self-employed but I am in favour of positive discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of positive discrimination in favour of PAYE taxpayers I support the Minister.  I am pleased Deputy Rabbitte has some good Fianna Fáil colleagues who are self-employed and enjoying the experience.</P>
      <P>I wish to take up the point that the self-employed can arrange their books and affairs in a certain way.  While I accept that this is the case we should recognise that the self-employed encounter bureauracy and red tape, that there are checks and balances and that they now have fewer opportunities to arrange their affairs in a certain way to obtain additional benefits.  We should also recognise that most of the self-employed take huge risks.  They would argue that, in turn, they are not getting the rewards in a difficult economic climate.  On the PRSI allowance, I support the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the PAYE allowance of £800 and the PRSI allowance of £286 to all taxpayers irrespective of their <Col N="1431" /> status.  It is worth recalling the reasons these allowances were introduced.</P>
      <P>The PAYE allowance was introduced to differentiate between, on the one hand, ordinary PAYE taxpayers and, on the other, the self-employed, proprietary directors of companies and their spouses and children.  One of the principal differences between ordinary PAYE taxpayers and the self-employed is that the self-employed enjoy a more favourable basis of taxation.  Deputy Yates has been honest in this regard.  Despite the introduction of self-assessment and the current year basis of taxation this difference still obtains.  Some groups tried to tell me that this was no longer the case but I did not listen to this for longer than 30 seconds.</P>
      <P>The self-employed enjoy more liberal tax relief for expenses than an employee and are still not taxed on a full current year basis.  They are taxed on their profits in the year of account ending in the current tax year.  The self-employed have to pay a minimum of 90 per cent of their liability in the tax year, compared with 100 per cent in the case of PAYE taxpayers. The balance is not due for payment until 31 January in the following tax year.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of those two examples means that the self-employed, having the use for a long period of money owed in tax, enjoy a more favourable tax collection system than those within the ambit of PAYE who do not have such use as the tax is deducted before they receive the balance of their income.</P>
      <P>In addition, the self-employed have opportunities for tax planning which are not available to employees.  For example, they control their own remuneration so that it is paid in the most tax efficient manner possible.  Last week Deputy McDowell was kind enough to tell us he had received 18 pamphlets on the BES.</P>

      <P>Other Members from the various professions could also come clean on the number of brochures they <Col N="1432" /> receive.  Farmers have advantages, such as stock relief and income averaging, which are not available to taxpayers in general.</P>
      <P>Spouses of the self-employed and proprietary directors are excluded from the PAYE allowance to avoid a repetition of old abuses.  The scheme was not successful because people found ways of abusing it, a matter which was referred to last year.</P>
      <P>The PRSI allowance was introduced in 1982 to compensate for substantial increases that year in PRSI rates.  The allowance was confined to those who paid PRSI at the higher rates and was not made available to public servants and others who contributed at the lower rate of PRSI.  In 1982 PRSI did not cover the self-employed or proprietary directors and, therefore, they were not entitled to the allowance.  However, the children of higher rate contributors were entitled to the allowance.  When social insurance for the self-employed was introduced in 1988 this allowance was not extended to them. The reason for this is that the employee element in the rate of PRSI which the self-employed pay is 1.8 per cent out of their present 5 per cent rate, compared with the employee rate of 5.5 per cent to which the PRSI allowance relates. Accordingly, extension of the PRSI allowance to the self-employed could not be justified.  It is estimated that the cost of extending the PAYE and PRSI allowances on the basis proposed in the amendment would be £84.3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This year we have acknowledged many of the problems of the self-employed and small business people, particularly with the introduction of reliefs for sons and daughters of higher rate contributors. That provision is very welcome and will have knock-on benefits.  It is worth noting that I have introduced 21 reliefs in one form or another this year which I hope will result in additional employment, otherwise they would be merely costly reliefs.  I am sure their benefit or otherwise will be scrutinised in a future Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that there <Col N="1433" /> is a type of black economy in the area of child minding.  Some people provide such a service because they badly need the money, but others provide it because it is a sophisticated business in the black economy.</P>
    <P>Small business people have brought to my notice the fact that some sons and daughters working for parents are paid out of the till.  The reliefs I have introduced in respect of sons and daughters should eliminate such abuse.  I hope the other incentives will encourage employers to employ more people and that there will be meaningful and tangible benefits for the economy.  It is all very fine to suggest that every small business person should be encouraged to take on an additional employee, but last year out of 60,000 businesses here we received tax from only 21,000 and out of 87,000 farmers we received tax from fewer than 40,000.  There are more than 1 million PAYE workers and approximately 800,000 of them pay tax.  I hope the benefits we introduced this year will result in more employment.</P>

    <P>When was the £800 employee allowance fixed?  It has not been increased for a long time.  From the argument we have just had, it follows that there should be an element of recognition of the different set of circumstances that apply to PAYE workers.  The Minister detailed those in a more logical fashion than we did.  It is only fair and reasonable that the employee allowance should be updated and I have suggested £1,050 as a reasonable level.  PAYE workers do not have refuge from the taxman, he or she cannot conceal any of their income and the vigilance has become more rigorous in recent years.  There is an element of discrimination that carries on into other areas, such as education.  If we accept that the PAYE worker is being screwed it is only proper that the CPI should be applied to the £800 which should be updated.  A level of £1,050 is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 22, in my name, is similar.  I was more modest in that I suggested the allowance should be increased to £1,000.  In my constituency I frequently meet self-employed painters, plasterers or other handymen.  They may not have work in winter.  Because they are not in the PAYE net they are not automatically entitled to unemployment benefit and must undergo a means test to qualify for unemployment assistance. They may be told they are liable to £3,000 tax for the previous 12 months and be assessed with a £60 means test levy.  The impression should not be given that all self-employed people are on the pig's back and are milking the system by avoiding their liabilities.  One cannot generalise in this regard.  In the tax system there are opportunities legally to minimise tax payments or avoid them.  I favour an increase in the PAYE allowance. Will the Minister indicate the cost of the proposal in my amendment No. 22.  I am sure that someone as parsimonious as the Minister in giving tax <Col N="1435" /> reliefs would be anxious to accept my amendment rather than that of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the PAYE allowance to the tax system is £238 million. While that allowance has not been changed for a number of years it is an important one for PAYE earners.  The cost of the increase in the PAYE allowance proposed by Deputy Rabbitte is £46.9 million for this year and £74.4 in a full year.  The estimated cost of the proposal in Deputy Yates's amendment is £37.7 million and £59.8 million in a full year.  This year I have concentrated on personal allowances and the standard rate and that has worked well.  It is better to concentrate on those rather than PAYE and PRSI allowances.  The allowance was £250 in 1980; it increased to £500 and now is £800.  The system is more closed than it was in 1980.  The regime of the self-employed versus the PAYE is different now.  Compliance is greater and the system is simpler.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the view that our tax regime for keeping the books is too complicated.  That opportunity does not exist for the PAYE person who can only calculate his or her tax payments. Nowhere in the world is the calculation of tax and the submission of returns by the self-employed considered over complicated. We have tried to simplify the procedure this year.  I have sympathy for people who must obtain tax clearance certificates and the person to whom Deputy Yates referred to cases of tax refunds being withheld, but that period of retention has been reduced to a few weeks. One tax clearance certificate will now be issued instead of the 14 issued previously. The system has been simplified, streamlined and will become more efficient as the Revenue becomes more computerised. If problems exist in that area we will address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer cost in this area is a substantial one.  Other groups would argue that they should have this allowance, but I do not agree.  The existing PAYE allowance should remain because <Col N="1436" /> the differences between the two systems can be narrowed only to an extent because of the expenses issue.  I cannot increase the allowance because of the cost factor, but I see the benefit of maintaining, streamling and simplifying the system to enable people submit returns in the proper manner, not necessitating the services of an accountant.  I have been involved for more than 20 years in the area of personal tax returns and the argument that one needs an accountant to keep one's books does not stand up to scrutiny.  The majority of people can keep their records if they buy a good analysis book and problems will only arise for other reasons.</P>

      <P>I accept broad generalisations cannot be made about an area as complex as the self-employed sector in 1994.  I will not repeat the arguments, but I believe the Minister accepts there is a sound basis in equity for an element of compensation for the PAYE workers.  The Minister said that the existing relief costs £238 million in a full year. That figure represents a smaller proportion of the income tax yield from the PAYE sector than when the allowance was first established at £800.  What year was it fixed at £800?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> In page 14, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (dependent relatives), as amended by the Finance Act, 1982, is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;£1,000&rsquo; for &lsquo;£110&rsquo; in each place where it occurs.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to increase the carer's allowance.  A carer receives an additional tax free allowance of £110 for minding a dependent relative.  The dependant may be disabled or seriously ill and may need to be turned in bed regularly because of bed sores, may be incontinent or require full-time nursing. The tax free allowance of £2 a week is appalling and I propose it should be raised to £1,000.  The State is getting great value from carers because one would be lucky to cover the cost of a nursing home subvention or a long stay geriatric bed at £110 per week, not to mention the annual cost.</P>
    <P>We must support the 70,000 carers who, through thick and thin, have had the quality of their life greatly altered.  It is not easy for them to take a weekend break or go out at night because they must consider their elderly relative.  The carers provide a very cheap service and the cost of increasing the allowance to £1,000 is a paltry £10 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods talks <i>ad nauseam</i> about the Government's concern for the elderly, what he is trying to do for pensioners and so on.  On the other hand, people at work who are paying income tax and trying not to be a burden on their local health board, not to look for subvention or for a full-time bed, receive an extra £2 a week, which for a person on the standard rate of tax is worth 54p a week, a derisory sum.</P>
    <P>This measure was introduced many years ago.  When I first came to this House the then Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, standing where I am now, made an eloquent case about Fianna Fáil's concern for the elderly who are cared for in the home environment and asked that the figure be increased to £500. Yet no subsequent Minister for Finance <Col N="1438" /> has seen fit to consider this matter.  This is an existing facility in our tax code that will not be abused.  The principle is already in place through a number of supports for people who care for relatives in the home.  I have been contacted by numerous people whose free electricity allowance and telephone rental were withdrawn when a relative come to live with them as they were no longer able to live alone due to illness.  We do not encourage people to be cared for in a family environment.  I would ask the Minister to show compassion in this area and accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Yates is worthy of support.  If the cost of the proposal is as he described, it would be the equivalent of two grants to Croke Park.  It would not be an excessive burden on the Exchequer.  We should encourage people to care for the elderly in their homes.  This would be a good investment by the State when compared with the amount that would have to be provided in various budgets if up to 70,000 people had to be cared for in public institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reservation about supporting this amendment.  I predict that in the not too distant future the Minister for Finance will put forward a more generous proposal than that advanced by Deputy Yates, for economic reasons.  There ought to be a dimension of comparison and even emotion in this area.  For economic reasons the Minister for Finance will come in here in the not too distant future to offer this as one part of a response to the issue of caring for elderly or otherwise dependent relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to demographic trends in the population &mdash; there was some discussion about children and young people.  The structure of our population is such that for the rest of the decade and into the next century there will be a disproportionately large number of older people, but our infrastructure is totally incapable of meeting that demand.  The Minister for Finance must <Col N="1439" /> take a wider view than merely dealing with the tax code.  The mind boggles to think of the vast sums that would be required, through the Department of Health, to fund the necessary infrastructure in the form of nursing homes to cope with this problem in the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>There are relatively few old people in my constituency but I was shocked recently to meet so many older people in other constituencies.  In my constituency virtually everybody is at family formation stage.  The cost of access to a nursing home in the Eastern Health Board region is prohibitive.  Responsibility for providing this service rests almost entirely with the private sector.  It is a very expensive service which is heavily subsidised by the Eastern Health Board.  The economics of the matter are such that the Minister for Finance ought to be down on his knees praying to whomsoever he believes in and thanking people for caring for relatives, as Deputy Yates put it, &ldquo;looking after granny&rdquo; at home.  If people do not continue the Irish tradition of caring, where possible, for relatives at home, the cost to the State will quadruple. This is a most reasonable and meritorious amendment.  Some recognition should be given in the tax code to taxpayers who willingly provide this service in their domestic residence.  Because of our demographic structure this will become a much greater issue in Irish politics in the years ahead and a much more costly one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board for many years I was involved in a report on care of the aged and future health policy and I have no doubt that Deputy Rabbitte is correct about the demographic trend.  The number of old people will increase in coming years.  I referred many years ago to the great bulge in the labour market in 1977.  At that time 58 per cent of the population was under 27 years of age so it is inevitable that 30 years later great difficulties will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dependent relative's allowance is worth £38.50 in terms of tax saved to a <Col N="1440" /> person liable at the standard rate.  It has little effect in deciding on care for an aged or dependent relative.  It is not intended to address the bigger issue.  The first report of the Commission on Taxation recommended that this allowance be abolished and that direct payments be made to needy elderly persons &mdash; the carer's allowance partly deals with that issue.  Deputy Yates will quickly tell me it does not help a family member who is looking after a relative, which is the problem with that scheme.</P>
    <P>The dependent relative's allowance has not changed for more than ten years. The reason successive Governments of all persuasions have steered clear of it is that it was, in the 1970s, the most abused allowance under the tax code.  There is a litany of abuses available if the Deputy wants to hear it.  It was not the people who needed the allowance who abused it &mdash; they were too busy caring for their relatives; it was others, who claimed the allowance for a relative who was not really dependent.  The commission recommended abolishing it.  However, the Government did not abolish it but allowed it to die out.</P>
    <P>The other point is more interesting. Deputy Rabbitte is correct in saying that there would have to be a substantial allowance.  Unlike Deputy Rabbitte's, two thirds of my constituents would be aged.  My constituency contains many areas which were built before the turn of the century and has some of the oldest parishes in the city and county of Dublin, always turn the most heartrending case cost and, to assist them, the allowance would have to be substantial.  One does not have to be an expert on changes in Irish culture and values to see that it is not so easy now to continue the practice of caring for a dependent relative at home.  In the past many people gave up their jobs to care for dependent relatives. That does not happen to the same extent today but, thankfully, it still happens and there is no argument but that it keeps down the costs to the State.  Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte is right that a special scheme should be designed.  However, one would not start with the present <Col N="1441" /> scheme.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would cost £7.5 million.  That would be a start but it is certainly not enough to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance and grant-aid to the health boards are of tremendous benefit.  The vast majority of people in my area would not be able to pay the full rate; they get a subsidy which is of major benefit to them.  The Commission on Taxation stated that the Government should give the grant aid directly to the individuals. That practice has been followed for some years and the amount of money for that is increasing all the time.  The problem now is to provide locations.  The Minister for Health discussed that not too long ago when dealing with the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill.  I do not argue against the principle of change. However, this relief would do very little in the context of the argument being made.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's briefings can always turn the most heart-rending case into a matter that is either unconstitutional or unworthy and, certainly, open to abuse if it were considered.  This is a case where politicians must insist that there is an important issue at stake.  If the Minister wished to attach a medical test to the dependent relative's allowance, that would be fine.  That applies to other codes.  However, I do not agree that the solution to every problem is to give grants, because there are many people who are just over the limit for everything, those earning, perhaps, £200 a week or a little more.  In terms of take-home pay, they are not well off.  They are not eligible for a medical card or for the carer's allowance. If Mrs. Murphy is minding her mother on a full time basis, Mr. Murphy's income is regarded as her income and if half of that income happens to be over the limit, she does not get the allowance. That is why out of the 70,000 carers several thousand only get the allowance.  The Minister must adopt a dual approach.  He must look at it in the context of the tax code and in the context of direct financial assistance.  The Minister may wish to perfect <Col N="1442" /> my proposal by making it more rigorous and not open to abuse, but let him not throw the baby out with the bath water by saying that there is nothing he can do because a scheme already in existence does not operate as effectively as it should.  That could be improved upon and made to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not forget what we spoke about last week and the reason I agreed to an amendment on that occasion.  Families who have dependent relatives are assisted in the tax code because they avail of the medical expenses relief.  In regard to covenants, Deputy McDowell reminded us not to get caught up with education covenants. He was quite right.  I looked at the figures afterwards and a great amount of covenanting is for elderly relatives.  These people are assisted in the tax code as well as under the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We can return to the higher education issue.  I might add that the covenanting system is also very expensive. The Minister said that the cost of accepting this amendment is £7.5 million and surely that is affordable.  We know that the Commission on Taxation has a heart of stone on these issues and also that the Minister is capable of being selective in regard to the recommendations of the commission, particularly today when he is not giving anything to carers.</P>

However, there seems to be a deeper problem and, in the interests of the 70,000 carers who feel bitterly aggrieved that there is so little recognition in the tax code of the invaluable work done, I have no choice but to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 is in the name of Deputy Yates.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 40 are related.  It is suggested that we discuss these three amendments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1922 (treatment for tax purposes of certain benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts) is hereby amended by the deletion in subsection (1) of paragraph (b).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated on Committee Stage for an hour and a half, so I will not labour the point again.  This amendment has to do with the taxation of unemployment benefit.  Before I became too acquainted with this issue I supported the theory set out by the Commission on Taxation and others that this was simply a question of taxing all income equally before the law.  If someone who got an invalidity or old age pension was taxed, why should someone on unemployment benefit not be liable to tax?  Again, the theory is impeccable.  It is cold, clean and capable of being applied.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I told various anecdotes about part-time and seasonal workers and those on systematic short-time who experienced a drop in their income of £30 per week.  There were also cases where one spouse was working and the other receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue is now beginning to surface. My understanding is that when the Revenue <Col N="1444" /> Commissioners sent out the revised tax free allowances, they did not know in all cases that one of the spouses was receiving unemployment benefit.  A very nasty shock, in the form of a PAYE balancing statement, will be due at the end of the tax year for people on unemployment benefit, whose full allowance has been given to the spouse at work because the Revenue Commissioners were not aware that the other spouse was receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In terms of the change the Minister made on Committee Stage, I am requesting that it be extended for short-time workers.  There are people who work systematically, half a week on, half a week off or a full week on and a full week off and who receive flat rate unemployment benefit for the remaining part of the week or the full week they are unemployed. They will suffer a major drop in their income because the tax treatment of their earnings will be greatly revised, resulting in a decrease in their take-home pay.</P>
    <P>I offered the Minister a way out of this difficulty &mdash; and he should not be surprised if this issue comes back to haunt him later in the year &mdash; in the form of an exemption limit below an income of, say, £10,000 per year which would provide tax relief for the low paid.  It is impossible to convince someone who earns £90 a week and whose spouse earns £63 a week that they are well off and should pay more tax.  If the wealthy are unemployed they do not claim benefit, only those who need it, who have paid into the system claim it and that is a telling point.</P>
    <P>I have received many letters on this issue, one from an irate person in Kilkee, County Clare, who referred to my complaints about the residential property tax and wanted to know what I had done in relation to the tax treatment of the unemployed.  The person went on to state that the cut in pay related benefit meant that from 1 April this year they would lose £18.80 per week and, with the taxation of unemployment benefit, an additional £18 per week.  Those people consider themselves to be at the lowest levels of income.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the property tax and <Col N="1445" /> the last amendment, if the Minister continues to take the advice of the academics, the economists and the experts who have landed him in such hot water on this issue, he will find that his backbenchers will complain that he is out of touch and does not understand the problems of ordinary people.  The Minister would save himself a lot of bother if he again examined this issue in the Seanad and came up, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare, with some form of alleviation that will ensure that the poorest in society will not have to bear the burden of increased taxes to pay for the Government's extravagance which this year amounts to £30 million in additional taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates is correct when he predicts trouble down the road for the Minister on this issue.  I do not agree with Deputy Yates that the Minister relies on academics and his advisers, if he does it has only started recently.  I suspect the Minister knows the difficulties this measure is causing and I have also had a flood of letters and telephone calls about it.  No matter how often one points to items in the small print of the budget, people do not follow it closely until it directly impacts on them and some very low income families are affected by this decision.  The wider decision introduced in the 1992 Finance Act to tax social welfare benefits is perhaps an issue for another day; this is just an aspect of that.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 1992 gave the Minister the power to tax all social welfare benefits.  Disability benefit was taxed initially and this year it has been extended to include unemployment benefit.  In an ideal tax code, there would be equity and justice and the exemption thresholds would be at a reasonable level but in the context of the tax code, as it applies now to people on very low incomes, this decision affects them badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific matter, the subject of this amendment, I have had a number of telephone calls from people who say it has provoked serious marital disharmony. Women have been appalled at <Col N="1446" /> the prospect of explaining to their husbands that as a result of their getting social welfare benefit, their husband's tax free allowance will be savagely reduced. They are extremely upset about the implications.  They have tried to conceal it from their husbands or tried to ensure that blame is not apportioned to them. There is considerable public anger about this issue.</P>
    <P>How much does the Minister propose to levy as a result of narrowing the issue to the particular ambit of this amendment? What is it worth to the Minister this year or in a full year?  Because of the aggravation and hurt it is causing some people, the Minister should reconsider this measure.  It is difficult to explain to ordinary people how we can relax the tax code for the high fliers in the tax exile category.  We have made special arrangements to facilitate the super-rich while, at the same time, the short-time workers and the unemployed are savagely hit.  I am sure the Minister has already heard these complaints in his clinics and I ask him at this late stage to backtrack on this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Yates said, we spent a long time on this issue last week and examined some of the issues involved.  Last year a monitoring group examined disability benefits and changes were made.  As I said on Committee Stage, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and I will continue to monitor this issue during the year to address some of the real problems.  In regard to the balancing statements, I have already said that if there is an amount underpaid at the end of the year, the Revenue Commissioners will take into account difficulties experienced by people, or cases of hardship, and will arrange for a distribution of any balancing amount.  That is the case in regard to ordinary funds and the Minister for Social Welfare already stated that they would have to be dealt with in an even more sympathetic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years in this House people have asked why we cannot consider certain categories.  I have no difficulty in <Col N="1447" /> examining hardship cases.  If, for some reason, a person is experiencing particular hardship in their taxation we try to deal with that.  In the last ten weeks of each tax year many people feign illness to claim tax refunds.  Years ago in Dublin Corporation we tried to analyse why 80 per cent of sickness occurred in the last ten weeks of the tax year and it was incredible how so many people were ill on 1 January and recovered on 1 April. There were anomalies and the system was abused.  People who agreed to systematic short time working to ensure their positions made a case to me and I examined the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made that case to me when other people were talking about residential property tax and other issues.  I met them and agreed with their case.  If there are other affected groups I will try to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The combined income of a married couple, both of whom are working, is taxable.  However, in cases where one partner was working and the other was receiving benefit they were taxed differently. Regardless of whether income is generated from employment or benefit or a combination of both it is taxed in the same way.  It is not a tax on social welfare benefit.  If the only income a person receives is social welfare benefit that is not taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises serious questions about the separateness of PRSI as a social insurance fund if people who paid into it all their lives now find that it is combined with their spouse's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Total income received on a weekly basis is taxable regardless of how it is generated.  I know anomalies exist but they involved small amounts of money.  If Deputy Yates gives me an example of cases where a fall in income of £30 arises I will examine them.  For a long time a person receiving social welfare benefit was just as well off, if not better off, than somebody who was <Col N="1448" /> employed.  That led to the employed person taking illness in the last quarter of the tax year and seeking a tax rebate. However, both the Minister for Social Welfare and I will look at hardship cases that arise.</P>
      <P>In the case of employees systematically working a three day week or week on/week off or fortnight on/fortnight off the deferral will be for the tax year 1994/1995 or to the end of their current unemployment benefit claim or current period on short term working, whichever is the shorter.  The reason for the deferral is the people concerned, having been in full-time employment, entered into systematic short-time working arrangements in agreement with their employers on the basis that their unemployment benefit would not be taxable.  In addition, people on systematic short week working, which comprises almost 90 per cent of systematic short-time working, are paid at a low level of benefit.</P>
      <P>My amendment will deal with those who have a justifiable case.  I have spoken to a number of groups about the matter and, while there have been individual cases, no other category has been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If a working spouse whose marginal rate of tax is 50p in the pound has two children, she is entitled to unemployment benefit of £63 per week and 50 per cent is roughly £30 per week.  All the cases put forward by the Minister related to disability benefit.  It is true there was high absenteeism in the last quarter of the tax year.  My amendment and that of Deputy Rabbitte referred to unemployment benefit.  There is a fundamental difference between unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  Disability benefit does not involve the collusion of the employer whereas unemployment benefit requires a complaint employer to lay off the person.</P>
      <P>Last week I spoke about a security worker, a port worker and so on.  We had a very successful church gate collection last week in Enniscorthy despite the Government's policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A person told me he had lost his job after 30 years and had claimed unemployment benefit.  He said there was only himself and his wife but he had not received any word on his pay related benefit.  I told him he was not entitled to any and he said he had been in Joe Doyle's pub and was told that since he had been unemployed for eight weeks he was due the second round of his tax refund.  He was told by the lads he could claim his tax back every four weeks.  I told him the further bad news that he was not entitled to any tax refund as unemployment benefit is now taxable.  Unknown to me he went to a local councillor, a tax expert, who had given him this information.  He then produced a letter stating that he was not entitled to it.  The Minister referred to abuse, avoidance and people who are <Col N="1450" /> playing the system.  These people have lost their jobs and are traumatised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte conveyed an understanding of the real world.  The Minister should ignore academics and esoteric points on the theory of fairness.  These people who may never work again are suffering psychological and emotional trauma.  They are being given a kick in the backside and told they are not entitled to a tax refund.  The whole nature of unemployment benefit is finite; it only lasts for a year.  Any scheme will be for a very limited period because under the revised cutbacks on PRSI workers unemployments benefit will be exhausted after a year.  I would be happy to refer some of these hard luck cases to the Minister. If he proposes to raise £30 million by way of tax receipts from the unemployed there will be hardship cases.</P>

      <Quest>if he will establish an independent health and safety advisory committee to examine the safety or otherwise of MMDS masts in respect of their output of radiation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries under the health and safety legislation are a matter for the health and safety authority.  In considering the introduction of the MMDS system, detailed research was carried out and the findings of expert studies from around the world have clearly shown that it is a safe system. Those operating MMDS systems in Ireland are obliged to comply with strict guidelines based on this research.  Actual measurements have confirmed that MMDS in this country is operating well within the internationally accepted limits.  In view of the wealth of evidence already available in this area, I do not propose to initiate further investigation of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is widespread community concern about MMDS masts and other structures?  Will he agree that this concern is valid and that studies undertaken by his Department were never brought to the attention of people with these concerns?  Will he undertake to make those studies and research papers available to people so that they may peruse them and arrive at the conclusion &mdash; which the Minister has just articulated &mdash; that these structures and this MMDS system are not a danger to health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some concern is being expressed in certain parts of the country resulting from confusion that has arisen. There are a number of different groups with vested interests who are maintaining an illegal broadcasting service outside the regulatory regime, resulting in the nonpayment of any royalties, VAT or anything else.  They have an interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, and the spread of confusion on a whole range of issues, including this one, assists them in prolonging the existence of these stations.  I can assure the Deputy and the people in these areas that there are no grounds whatsoever for concern in relation to health.  I ask that that assurance be accepted by all concerned and that nobody on either side of this House should give succour to any suggestion that there are dangers to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The studies to which Deputy Hogan refers were undertaken by our own technical adviser, Dr. McManus, whose report is and has been made available to anyone on request, so there is no problem about that.  In relation to the international <Col N="1453" /> position, within the last five years the health advisory organisations in a number of countries have re-examined their guidelines.  Last year the World Health Organisation updated and published its guidelines.  With one or two exceptions the recommended limits for public exposure is ten watts per square metre, those one or two exceptions allowing for an even higher wattage per square metre.</P>
    <P>This level is endorsed by the World Health Organisation, Austria, Canada, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the International Radiation Protection Association.  Within the last five years the health advisory organisations conducted these studies.  Actual measured level of emissions in the vicinity of operating MMDS stations in Cork and Galway show that within 200 feet of the masts, field strengths are of the order of 0.0003 watts per square metre.  Further away strengths fall to 0.0001 watts per square metre.  When these stations are fully operational and broadcasting on all channels, peak field strengths could be expected to reach 0.004 watts per square metre and typical levels would be less than 0.001 watts per square metre.  These are extremely low exposures.  To give an example, human bodies emit electro magnetic radiation of a magnitude higher than some of the readings here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in putting in writing exactly what I say here or in supporting the expert studies carried out by our technical advisers.  These are the people on whom we rely and who have a capacity in this area.  Perhaps I could make comparisons with other sources of radiation so that people understand what we are talking about.  On a summer day sunlight exposes us to 590 watts per square metre of infra-red radiation where frequencies range from 300 billion cycles per second to 385 trillion cycles per second.  The universal all prevailing microwave field, to which everyone is exposed, is the electro magnetic radiation produced by the earth and everything on it by virtue of its temperature. The human body emits radiation and frequencies up to 300 billion cycles per second and the strength of this <Col N="1455" /> field is 0.003 watts per square metre. The bottom line is that standing next to someone can expose you to as much, and probably more, microwave radiation than one would ever experience from an MMDS transmitter.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will publish regular reports from the Telephone Users' Council which will indicate the impact of the Telecom Éireann rebalancing package on telephone consumers.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Telecom Éireann Users' Council was a statutory body established under sections 48 and 49 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  As I said before in this House, as recently as 2 November 1993, this body was abolished some years ago and its functions were effectively taken over by the Ombudsman and sections 48 and 49 of the 1983 Act were repealed by section 3 and the Second Schedule of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
      <P>In September 1993 I established a less formal, though nonetheless independent, body which is called the Telephone Users' Advisory Group.  The main function of this group is to carry out independent monitoring of the operation and impact on consumers of the rebalancing package introduced by Telecom Éireann on 1 September 1993.  In establishing this group, I specifically allowed it to determine its own procedures and the frequency of publication of reports is a matter for the group itself.</P>
      <P>I have received two reports to date from the group, one in January 1994 and one yesterday, both of which were made public when they were being sent to me and both of which are, I understand, available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that I table a Dáil Question on this matter <Col N="1456" /> considering that a report on the subject was published yesterday.  Notwithstanding that, there is, like the previous question some confusion regarding this matter.  Will the Minister establish on a statutory basis the Telephone Users' Advisory Council, so that it is seen to be independent by the general public?  A spin doctor approach is being applied by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and by Telecom Éireann in respect of the dissemination of selective information from the various reports.  Domestic users of the telephone service are operating on an emergency service, call patterns have changed substantially and there is a basic weekend service for residential telephone subscribers. Small businesses are suffering in respect of increased costs because of the rebalancing package.  Will the Minister review the package in the light of this information and take on board the widespread public confusion and concern in respect of the huge increase in charges imposed on residential users and small businesses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Deputy calls into question the independence of the group set up to advise and monitor on the rebalancing package. He also calls into question the independence of people such as Mr. Tom <Col N="1457" /> McCabe, IBEC, who represents small business people; Mr. Conan McKenna, Secretary of my Department; Mr. Tony McQuinn of the National Social Service Board, Ms. Joan Morrison of the Consumers' Association, Mr. Brian O'Sullivan of Cornel Electronics Limited, Ms Monica Prendirville, of the ICA, Professor Noel Whelan, Chairman of the group, Vice President of the University of Limerick and former Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach and the former Department of Economic Planning and Development and Mr. Pat Walsh of Forbairt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Deputy did not have the opportunity to read the report before asking the question. The volume of traffic has increased as a result of the rebalancing in relation to local and international calls.  The most recent report taken in two weeks in December 1993 &mdash; a busy time on the telephone &mdash; shows that people have reverted to their original calling patterns and there are net reductions for business and residential users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rebalancing package; there are winners and losers.  In the overall context we have a more cost competitive tariff system in Telecom.  People who express their concern for the strategic future of Telecom fail to face up to the fact that in the absence of a rebalancing package &mdash; such as we have &mdash; which is in line with the predictions I made at the time despite the grave reservations of many people both in the House and outside, the question of its future competitiveness would be put at serious risk. The facts are in line with our predictions. This group in the overall context is confirming what we outlined at the time.  the surveys brought forward by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, who had 400 supporters on whom they rely to produce a Bill, indicated increases of the <Col N="1458" /> order of 38 per cent.  Clearly we have a more scientific basis in the order of 900,000 bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that he never indicated that over 50 per cent of domestic users would have substantially increased bills?  Furthermore, will he indicate if he has any proposal to increase charges for international business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certainly no proposals to increase charges for international business.  Looking at the trends in the communications industry, reductions are the order of the day if one is to remain competitive.  If our native telecommunications industry is to stay competitive it will have to follow that trend rather than the one suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>For the vast majority of consumers the increase is less than 10 per cent and applies in the main to residential customers with low bills.  In the overall context consumers, both residential and business customers, have got a net gain from the tariff balancing package.</P>

      <P>On 12 January last the executive chairman announced a new daily year round non-stop Shannon-New York service. That service is due to commence on 1 June 1994.  I have no indication from the executive chairman of any change in the proposals he announced on 12 January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister's Department has an ongoing interest in whether the daily service from Shannon to New York is provided and he cannot tell the House that this is an operational matter for Aer Lingus only. Does he agree that the situation is being complicated by the emergence of Tower Air which proposes also to provide Shannon-US flights?  How many planes will be stationed at Shannon to provide this daily service?  Is he satisfied that steps have been taken to commence service on 1 June 1994?  Will he indicate also whether he has had any communication with the executive chairman of Aer lingus on these matters and whether, notwithstanding the executive chairman's recent remarks, he has been reassured that the service is about to commence on schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, I do not make a hobby of remembering the operational routes of various aircraft and I cannot list them off the top of my head. I have outlined on numerous occasions the scheduling for the new Shannon-New York direct service.  It will remain.  I will reiterate the point I made in my reply: decisions on this matter are made on a <Col N="1460" /> commercial basis.  Aer Lingus is being run as a commercial company.  The decision to provide direct flights to and from Shannon and New York is a commercial decision and is not based on other criteria.  That is the only way to run a business.  I can assure the people in Shannon that the service will run on a daily basis.  Under the old regime there was not a daily year round Shannon-New York flight.</P>
      <P>The dynamics of the situation have changed.  Deputy McDowell mentioned that Tower Air will fly into Shannon and this is to be welcomed.  The more flights we have coming into Shannon, Dublin and Cork and anywhere else the better as that means more tourism and more revenue for the country.  As one who espouses competition I am sure the Deputy welcomes that.</P>
      <P>The service will remain on a commercial basis.  It is there to stay.  The cargo capacity of the A330 is far superior to the old Boeing 737 and allows for less than 50 per cent passenger capacity in off peak periods.  With a lower cost base, with lower operational costs &mdash; the airbus uses one-third of the fuel used by the older Boeing 747s &mdash; it is a far better product.  I had the pleasure of being on the inaugural flight and it is an excellent aeroplane.  Aer Lingus will acquire three such planes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked where they will be located and my earnest wish is that they will be in the air as much as possible.  We do not want aircraft at airports.  We have seen enough of that in the past.  They will be managed and controlled from Shannon. They will be flying with full capacity making profits and securing the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's remarks about commerciality and I certainly agree with his remarks on having aircraft flying as often as possible. When they are not flying, for example, during maintenance and the employment activity connected with that, the question of where they are based is of significance to the employees at Shannon airport.  In that context will he indicate whether he <Col N="1461" /> has had an intimation from Aer Lingus where they will be actually based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an operational decision for the management of Aer Lingus.  In the same way as the Deputy acknowledges the principle of commerciality in obtaining the aeroplanes in the first place, I presume he will be consistent and agree that the question of maintenance should be a commercial decision.  That is an operational day-to-day matter in which I have no function. That is the situation.  I hope that the former Leader of the Progressive Democrats will be happy with that response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

I accept that it is a matter of operational activity from Aer Lingus's point of view, but has his Department sought any assurances on such employment?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that in my conversations with the executive chairman of Aer Lingus I at all times seek to ensure that the potential of Shannon is exploited to the maximum extent possible.  I do not get involved in the day-to-day operational decisions and that is the proper position for any responsible Minister to take.  The problems in the airline have to be confronted and dealt with.  The management is there to do the job and they are doing it quite well.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (General Control of Radioactive Substances, Nuclear Devices and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1993 (S.I. No. 151 of 1993) provides for the control by licence of the custody, transportation, handling, storage, use, manufacture, production, processing, importation, distribution, exportation, or other disposal of radioactive substances, nuclear devices or irradiating apparatus.  Protocol and procedures governing the control of such materials by all persons and organisations, including educational institutions, are provided for in a licensing system administered by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  A particular requirement of the licensing system is that each institution appoints a suitably qualified radiological protection officer, who will have local day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of the procedures followed within the institution. Statutory Instrument No. 151 of 1993 also completed the implementation of Council Directive 80/836/EURATOM of 3 September 1984 laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity in educational institutions do not pose a hazard to people or property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister be satisfied when his Department is awaiting a report from the Radiological Protection Institute on an incident in a third level institute in Dublin where procedures were not followed?  When does the Minister expect to receive this report and will he allow me to see it at the earliest possible opportunity?  Will he ensure as a matter of urgency that any safeguards required will be provided for in the licensing <Col N="1463" /> procedures to allow students complete courses which are being delayed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is a matter for the RPII, I am aware of the incident mentioned by the Deputy.  The institute has informed me that over a certain period staff and research personnel in the Dublin Institute of Technology purchased and used unsealed radioactive substances without the knowledge of the radiological protection officer or the college authorities.  These substances were used in an area of the college not approved by the college authorities for the use of radioactive substances and without the use of warning signs indicating the presence of radioactive substances.</P>
      <P>The situation first came to light through a routine inspection at the college by the Health and Safety Authority. Following this a survey of the laboratory in question on 25 February revealed a small area of contamination on the floor and some contamination on the door of a refrigerator and a pipette.  Following inspection by the RPII on 3 March the contamination was cleaned up by the college on 4 March.  On 4 March the RPII withdrew the college's licence for the use of unsealed radioactive substances and required these to be kept in secure storage pending full investigation of the incident.  This licence has not so far been restored.  The RPII is satisfied that the spillage which occurred was small and did not constitute a significant hazard to personnel.</P>
      <P>The college acknowledges that it was guilty of certain breaches of the conditions of its licence and has set out the measures it proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of this type of incident.  The question of restoration of the college's licence is being considered in the light of these proposals and other requirements that it may be appropriate to impose.  The possible need for any further action by the RPII is also receiving consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently taking place with the European Commission in order to agree both the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds, and the operational programmes, which will detail the objectives and measures for each sector and provide a legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.</P>
      <P>Since final agreement has yet to be reached on the CSF and the operational programmes, it is not possible at this stage to give details of revised proposals from my Department's perspective, other than to say that the CSF will reflect the broad shape of the National Development Plan and that all the key elements will be included.</P>
      <P>As to completion of such negotiations, I refer to the statement by the Minister for Finance to this House on 21 April last, when he stated that discussions with the Commission were proceeding satisfactorily and, that agreement had been reached on the substantive issues.  He added that the detailed drafting of the CSF and the process of approving it at EU level could take up to two months. Once this is achieved, approval of the operational programmes can follow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 16, 26, 32, 54, 55, 56 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of an ongoing monitor of unlicensed broadcasting in the Dublin area, and from representations received, my Department has established that approximately ten unlicensed stations are operating at present.  Deputies will appreciate that I cannot be more exact because these stations are transient by <Col N="1470" /> nature and tend to move about on the frequency bands.  This, of course, adds to the difficulty of monitoring and prosecuting them.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that no action has been taken.  Since 1988 when the Broadcasting Act came into force, there have been search and seizure operations and prosecutions which put many of the pirates out of business.  It would seem that there is now a resurgence of illegal activity, and I am well aware of the concerns of the licensed stations in this regard.</P>
    <P>As a result of our ongoing work in this area, I can inform the House that officers of my Department, assisted by the Garda Síochána, recently seized equipment operated by one Dublin pirate station.  It illustrates the kind of lawlessness we are dealing with here that the station concerned stated that it would return to the airwaves, within the week &mdash; as indeed it has.  Further action against this and other stations will now be taken as necessary, including where appropriate, the prosecution under the Wireless Telegraphy and Broadcasting Acts, of the persons involved.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that these enactments are the source of my statutory powers in this area and that I have no function in regard to the evasion of taxes or levies by these people.</P>
    <P>I can, however, assure the House that the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy and Broadcasting Acts, including those provisions dealing with people and businesses advertising or providing services to illegal stations, will be fully invoked where the circumstances allow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was last weekend's raid for transmission equipment only the first serious raid in two years?  Is the Minister aware that some of the pirate radio stations are so well established that the location of their studios is well known and one station is operating a 1550 number provided by Telecom Éireann? Has the Minister used his powers under the 1988 Act to require Telecom Éireann to discontinue the supply of telecommunications services and the ESB to <Col N="1471" /> discontinue the supply of electricity to those stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly an option, once we are sure we can do so without affecting the services of innocent parties.  The preferred option is to seize equipment where the necessary monitoring and gathering of evidence places us in a position to do so.  However, I will consider the application of those measures where it would be helpful.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that it is relatively cheap and easy for determined people to acquire the equipment necessary for illegal broadcasting.  What we are doing will involve the systematic denial of transmission sites and services necessary for any type of permanent operation. This may take some time and the use of scarce resources by the Department, but I am determined to end the current upsurge in such illegal activity nationwide, as I have previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that there is a difference between enthusiastic amateurs acquiring transmission equipment and operating it and the operation of an illegal station.  In Dublin illegal stations are operating on a commercial basis and in some cases have acquired a slice of adult listenership in excess of 10 per cent.  When can we expect these stations to be put off the air or, alternatively, when will they be required to obtain licences?  When will the Minister regulate the position so that legitimate radio stations are not put at a disadvantage, as they are at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Wireless Telegraphy and Broadcasting Acts afford us wide scope for action which I fully intend to take.  There may be scope for tightening up the law &mdash; which I am keeping under review &mdash; but we must have sufficient evidence before effective action can be taken.  That is why this matter is so time consuming.  The penalties under the Wireless Telegraphy and Broadcasting Acts allow for fines of up to £1,000 and imprisonment on summary conviction <Col N="1472" /> and on indictment for fines of up to £20,000 and imprisonment.  I will keep those levels and their application to the cases to be taken under review also.</P>
      <P>The ongoing monitoring by my Department will encompass the activities of all illegal broadcasting in due course. If the Deputy or any other Member has information that he or she believes would help, my Department will be happy to receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has only to turn on his radio and turn the dial.  He should not make the matter sound so complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  Action against illegal broadcasters will be taken on the basis of the priority attached to them by reference to, among other things, their nuisance value as well as the resources available to me.  Deputies should be aware that there is a considerable call on resources for the monitoring and prosecution of illegal operators and that is under review.  The Deputy need be under no illusions but that I intend to ensure that effective action is taken on this matter in accordance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a lawyer of some experience, will the Minister not agree that pursuing people, seizing their equipment and threatening them with summary convictions &mdash; when the District Court can eventually get around to dealing with the case &mdash; is not an appropriate way of dealing with this matter? Would he not agree that it would be worthwhile for officials of his Department to consult the Attorney General with a view to getting High Court injunctions which, if breached, would command a jail sentence.  That is the only language those people understand.  There is plenty of jurisdiction for the Attorney General to take an injunction in the High Court to prevent illegal broadcasting because it is a criminal act.  The Minister does not have to rely on criminal sanctions and search and seizure procedures.  If the Minister adopts a hands-on approach <Col N="1473" /> using civil remedies and the threat of contempt proceedings to put those people in jail he will solve the problem within a few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that whatever action can be taken should be taken and I will discuss with the officials in my Department the possible injunction procedures which can be taken.  We all seek a similar end to this matter.  I agree that search and seizure operations are difficult from a practical point of view and, therefore, whatever measures are open to us will be examined as a matter of priority. I will communicate with the Deputy on the matter in the next few days.</P>

      <P>The Paris Commission, which deals with the prevention of marine pollution from all land-based sources, is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  However, as on previous occasions, my Department will be represented at the meeting next month for agenda items concerning the discharges of radioactive substances into the marine environment.</P>
      <P>For the forthcoming Paris Commission meeting in June, I have tabled three recommendations in view of my concerns about marine radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants particularly those from Sellafield, including the new THORP plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the absence of the Minister's file I understand his difficulty, but does he recall specific recommendations adopted at the 1993 Paris Commission meeting to the effect that there should be no further discharges of <Col N="1475" /> nuclear substances into the sea, the UK authorities should be required to conduct an environmental impact study and to consult with this State on the commissioning of THORP?  What steps does he intend to take at the Paris Commission in June to deal with the breaches by the UK authorities of the recommendations of the 1993 meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured the issue will be raised at the Paris Commission meeting.  It is raised on every occasion to seek to invoke jurisdiction, which is not mandatory, and to bring pressure to bear on the British authorities by seeking the support of allies. We will continue to seek support in this regard at the Paris Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that he encounters a lack of mandatory jurisdiction by dealing with this matter solely through the Paris Commission? Will he agree also that renegotiation in the context of the intergovernmental conference in 1996 of the EURATOM Treaty to provide mandatory inspection and controls at European Union level is needed in respect of such facilities?  What preparations are being made in the context of that renegotiation to ensure there is mandatory jurisdiction to deal with such matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the basic treaties must be examined to see how we can invoke mandatory jurisdiction.  Apart from our view that the complex should not proceed, we continuously raise the matter of an inspectorate as the minimum proposal.  I found it incongruous that when the Council of Energy Ministers considered how to make nuclear stations in Central and Eastern Europe safer, they did not have the ability to provide an inspectorate service to give confidence about the state of play of nuclear stations in the European Union.  Successive Ministers have consistently made that case at Energy Council meetings and we will continue to do so.  Any support we receive from Members in that regard will <Col N="1476" /> be welcomed.  Given the restraints imposed, the House is united in its effort to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Appreciating the Minister's difficulty because of the absence of his file, are the proposed recommendations to the Paris Commission based on the submission by Greenpeace which calls for the exercising of the non-reprocessing option of spent nuclear fuel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the file I cannot confirm that position precisely. The Department has worked closely with Irish representatives of Greenpeace and we will continue to do so.  The assistance we receive from that quarter is welcome. There is agreement on this matter across the political spectrum.  The difficulties under which my Department has to operate in relation to those matters is not fully appreciated by those who share a genuine concern, as do the Members, about how we can resolve the matter to the public's satisfaction.  I undertake to correspond with the Deputy and others who are interested in the items we propose to raise at that meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Although MMDS systems are now in operation in nine of the ten franchise areas throughout the country, progress with the provision of MMDS service in some areas has been delayed by the difficulties encountered by the companies concerned, mainly in dealing with entrenched illegal defector systems. The companies feel that they will be able to provide a service to all areas by some time next year.  The annual charge to the subscriber currently varies from £91 to £145.96.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that a time <Col N="1477" /> limit did not apply to the licences granted.  Will the Minister agree if it had applied companies given the franchise would have installed the system within a reasonable period or have lost it and it would be put up for tender again?  The position is causing politicians tremendous difficulties.  They have been abused and accused where there are illegal deflector systems.  Those who are trying to hold the line of legality surely deserve better support from those companies.  The Minister should crack the whip in respect of companies which have not installed the system.  Will he give a commitment that he will ask those people to fulfil the terms of the licences they obtained or to surrender them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Deasy's genuine concern about the continuing illegality and commend him for his principled stand on the issue.  The problem is not that they are not prepared to provide these services; in some cases they are denied the possibility of providing services despite having gone through the planning system.  Many of these companies have undertaken a significant investment in this area.  Proceedings are taking place in one area and I do not wish to say anything that would indicate prejudice on my part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Deasy's concern about the ability of the MMDS operators to <Col N="1478" /> market their product.  There are illegal deflector systems in some parts of the country.  There can be no question of condoning systems that operate outside the law.  Continuity of service from illegal systems cannot be guaranteed; illegality cannot be perpetuated.  The fault does not lie in the fact that licensees do not provide the equipment.  The equipment is provided, but illegal deflector systems operate in competition with the MMDS system and there have been lobbies against it.  MMDS operators who follow the due process and obtain planning permission are denied access, that it is to be condemned.  I share the Deputy's concern, there must be greater urgency in ensuring the problem is rectified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one problem is that the expectations of illegal operators and those who support them were raised prior to the last general election by one of the parties now in Government who told them if it was returned to power these systems would be legalised?  Is that not a significant contribution factor to the problems that have arisen?  Will the Minister make available the names of companies, groups or individuals who tendered for the MMDS system franchise and the tender price for each area?  Misinformation is being bandied about that one individual has virtually a monopoly over these franchises &mdash; this person is a newspaper magnate as well as being a business man.  That malicious and misleading rumour should be shown up for what it is.  The people who tendered were legitimate business people and groups, and the public should be informed who they are and the price paid for the franchise in each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not technically feasible to allow illegal deflector systems to continue in operation given the very small frequency on the UH band.  In addition, we do not have the spectrum necessary for this purpose.  The available spectrum is used for the development of our national service.  The purpose of the MMDS system is to meet consumer demand, to provide a countrywide &mdash; not in pockets, as is the case with the illegal system &mdash; multi-channel choice.  We need the frequency band for Teilifís na Gaeilge and future developments that may take place.</P>
      <P>We do not have the ability to willy-nilly hand over the spectrum, which is a national asset negotiated by the Government in 1960 under the Stockholm Treaty when setting up a national broadcasting service.  We will not allow that frequency to be used to bring in services from outside the country.  There is a demand for these services and we are meeting that demand by a regulated system.  From all the technical advice available, this is the only practicable system that provides the prospect of a countrywide multi-channel choice.</P>
      <P>There is no basis for the health scare and hype.  No Government would consider introducing a system with such inherent dangers.  I try, in all my public pronouncements, to assure people that that is the case.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that there are two sets of experts, the Minister's and those who help other people at meetings, both of whom claim to be correct, will the Minister bring them together so that they can argue this matter with a view to reaching a final conclusion on it?  My Question No. 31 which relates to this matter also asks the number of countries in Europe using <Col N="1480" /> this system.  Perhaps the Minister could give me that information off the top of his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give it off the top of my head but I will give the reply to that question in a few moments.  Different systems suit different countries depending on topography, population density and so on.  There is a whole range of criteria by which to decide the system used.  With our geographical location and the limited frequency in the UH band, this is the most practical system.</P>
      <P>On the question of experts, it is possible for any vested interest group to employ people who will agree with them. The experts in my Department are the people from whom we take advice.  The Attorney General advises the Government on legal matters, we cannot go to the Law Library to pick and choose our legal advice.  The Government has its own legal adviser and abides by the advice received from him or her.  The same applies to Departments.  We have our expert advisers, we depend on them and we abide by their advice.  If there was incontrovertible evidence which would put into question the evidence available to us, it would be considered, but no evidence exists to indicate there is a health scare.</P>
      <P>A study of masts was carried out under my predecessor, Deputy Molloy, and the result, which is available to the public, clearly shows that the levels of electromagnetic radiation are infinitesimal and within the guidelines.  If we start querying the validity of the rulings of the World Health Organisation we will be in trouble.  The World Health Organisation say that a safe limit is 10 watts per cubic meter; what we get is one ten-thousandth of that.  They say that, taking into account all the information from all the international entities concerned, that is a safe level.  There is no evidence that suggests that will change.  If we could look at this matter unemotionally, things might be clearer.</P>

    <P>A great amount of money is being collected under the illegal system which is not subject to VAT or to tax.  No royalties <Col N="1481" /> are being paid to anybody for transmission. When money is involved there is confusion and sometimes the level of confusion is related to the amount of money involved.  We have a system which was examined by Ministers who are now in Opposition and reviewed by present Ministers.  It is the most practicable system available and we need to implement it if we are to have a countrywide choice.  The questions about health and so on have been answered conclusively in my view and in that of my predecessors from all parties.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that I am not representing anybody who is acting illegally and I resent him giving that impression.  The Minister has failed to allay the fears of local people who have no vested interest in deflector systems. They are ordinary people living in the shadow of a transmitter.  They want assurances from the Minister about the safety of these structures.  Notwithstanding everything that has been said today, and notwithstanding some of the information he gave to this House which may be refuted, will he assist the process between now and 19 May by bringing together his officials and local people with a view to establishing a small committee to resolve the issue and allay the fears of people who have nothing whatever to do with those who have a vested interest in illegal deflectors but are concerned about health and safety issues?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no application from the company concerned in the terms outlined by the Deputy.  The company did apply for, and was granted, a licence to provide what are called &ldquo;value added services&rdquo;.  It is one of 14 companies which hold a value added services licence under section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  Under this licence the company is offering international services under certain restrictions imposed by me under the Act and the EU directives which related to voice telephony.</P>
      <P>My attitude to applications to provide telephony services, either for domestic or international traffic, is that they are approved only on the basis that they do not entitle the holder to engage in the simple resale of Telecom Éireann's voice service, i.e., what is known as &ldquo;voice telephony service&rdquo;.  They do, however, allow voice services that do not make use of the public switched network termination points at both ends.  &ldquo;Voice telephony service&rdquo; as defined in Irish and EU law, is a reserved function of Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am aware, from media reports of the recent Communications Workers Union conference, of references to the company in question being somehow favourably treated.  I can assure the House that there is no question of favourable treatment being given to this or any other telecommunications company.  The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector, which I would expect is now accepted as inevitable, will proceed in an orderly and impartial fashion in accordance with prevailing law and our EU obligations and take account of public services obligations met by Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> I can appreciate that at a time of change, as is the case in the telecommunications area, concern for the future will be uppermost in the minds of those affected by the changes.  However, we have to remember that change also brings with it new opportunities.  As I said in my address to the union members at their conference &ldquo;In facing competition and the challenges it brings, you are providing yourselves with an opportunity to take a very large slice of a much larger cake&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to see Telecom Éireann positioned in such a way that it will develop further as an efficient and thriving company even in the face of challenges from competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that the company concerned was permitted to provide international telephone services using lines leased from Telecom Éireann.  Does the Minister's reply mean that this or any other company will not be permitted to lease lines from Telecom Éireann in order to provide long distance telephone service in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to allowing the company compete in Telecom Éireann's core business.  I did not direct Telecom Éireann to do anything. The purpose of what I said was to clarify the position regarding the interpretation of voice telephony as defined in Irish and EU law.  The services proposed by ESAT were not comprehended by that definition. There is no question, therefore, of opening up the Irish network to a private company.  ESAT's service will be provided to its own customers and there will be no break-out facility at the Irish end of the link.  The question of switching out and switching in is important in terms of the definition that applies and the licences that can be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister intend to make a decision on the application from Telecom Éireann for a rebalancing of the charges for leased lines?  Is he concerned about the current position whereby Telecom Éireann is providing <Col N="1485" /> lines at approximately half the cost of that of British Telecom and is effectively subsidising private companies who are effectively now competing with Telecom Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>That issue is being dealt with by my Department.

We hope to conclude that process as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government and of the Irish people I <Col N="1511" /> would like to convey deep regret and sympathy on the sudden death of the British Labour Party Leader, Mr. John Smith, to his family, party colleagues and friends.  It is a sad day for everyone in these islands.</P>
      <P>He was a political leader of outstanding ability and stature.  He came to politics from a Scottish professional background in Edinburgh.  He was impressive in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate, and had a great sense of humour.  He won the trust and confidence of the financial and business community, as well as his own more natural supporters, because of his clear commitment to prudent and sensible economic policies as a framework for his party's social concern.  He also took on courageously the task of party reform as vital to its future progress.</P>
      <P>The British Labour Party has for many years been sympathetic and helpful to Ireland.  I had the privilege of meeting John Smith on a couple of occasions in the last year.  I always found him accommodating and helpful.  He was committed to the achievement of peace in Ireland. He gave his enthusiastic support last December to the efforts of the two Governments in the Joint Declaration to achieve peace, without calculation of party political advantage.  We will always be grateful to him and his colleagues for adopting a responsible and statesmanlike attitude during potentially difficult moments in the emergence of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was very clear on matters of principle. When he was here last June, he told me that the bombing campaign in Britain was totally counterproductive, in terms of the aims of its perpetrators.  He said at a press briefing, on 11 June 1993, that a peaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland problem would be high on his agenda when he came to office.  He disagreed with the view that a time limit should be set for the completion of talks between the political parties.  Governments had to be patient and maintain their persuasive approach, because the problems of Northern Ireland would not <Col N="1512" /> be solved quickly.  On a visit to Belfast in December 1992, he stated that a renunciation of violence was essential for participation in negotiations, and that political change could never be achieved through violent means.</P>
    <P>The Labour Leader, helped perhaps by his Scottish background, was unequivocally committed to Europe, and took a positive and forward view of European integration, including economic and monetary union and the Social Charter.  This represented a significant new departure from previous British Labour Party policies.  Undoubtedly, a harmony of outlook on European policy between Britain and Ireland, such as existed when both were members of the ERM between 1990 and 1992, is very beneficial to Ireland, just as a divergence of outlook can create difficulties for us. Obviously, though, both countries have to decide their own policy, on the basis of what they judge to be in their own best overall interests.</P>
    <P>By his early death, John Smith and his party have been deprived of the opportunity of a democratic contest for Government under his leadership.  I am certain that in whatever capacity, he would have continued to be a good friend of Ireland.  Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I have written to Margaret Beckett, the Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party, to express the sympathy of our party to the British Labour Party on this grievous loss.  I take this opportunity to express my deep sympathy to his wife Elizabeth, whom I had the pleasure of meeting not long ago, on this awful loss. As has been said, his family began a normal day this morning only to find that it has been cruelly changed in every way by this sudden death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Smith was a politician of deep conviction.  He voted in favour of British membership of the European Community against his party's Whip; he was willing to take a risk for his convictions. He was committed to decentralising power within Britain and handled the <Col N="1513" /> difficult issue of Scottish devolution on behalf of his party, both in Opposition and in Government.  He also worked as leader of his party with dedication and skill for the modernisation of the British Labour Party and, through that, for British democracy, building on the work of his predecessor, Neil Kinnock.  It is only a week since he led his party to an unprecedented success in the council elections in Britain.</P>
    <P>Last year I had the privilege of meeting John Smith and his wife, Elizabeth. Having spoken to him for quite some time I was impressed with his detailed knowledge of virtually every subject, including those I raised about which he had no notice.  He showed an all-encompassing detailed knowledge and understanding of them.  He had a complete grasp of Anglo-Irish relations and, in particular, of Northern Ireland.  He showed courage in standing against those in his party who might have wished the British Labour Party in Opposition to take a superficial, simplistic or crowd pleasing approach to the problem of Northern Ireland.  It was that courage, conviction and knowledge that led him to give his support to the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>John Smith did not believe in short cuts in international relations any more than he believed in short cuts in politics.  He was a politician for the long haul and it is a cruel blow to his party that the long haul upon which he was leading it back to office was cut so prematurely short.  He was a committed European who pointed out to me two European models that could be used to help solve some of the problems of this island.  In particular he referred to the Shengen Agreement as a means of dealing with security problems on this island.  He was, as he said publicly and privately on many occasions and as anybody who has had his experience will testify, impatient with the role of Leader of the Opposition and wanted an opportunity to test his ideas in the exercise of power and responsibility in Government. He would have been a truly excellent <Col N="1514" /> Prime Minister and his loss will be deeply felt on both sides of the Irish sea.</P>
    <P>I again wish to express the deep sympathy of all in the Fine Gael Party to the family of John Smith, to his wife and daughters, to the Labour Party in Britain and the labour and socialist movement throughout Europe who have lost a great champion of social justice and the European ideal.</P>

      <P>I find it hard to express the sense of shock I felt this morning when I was told of the death of John Smith.  I was proud to regard him as a friend and I believe that the United Kingdom has lost a potentially great leader.</P>
      <P>John Smith was a genuine friend of Ireland.  He and his wife, Elizabeth, spent part of their honeymoon here and I know from experience that he looked forward to, and thoroughly enjoyed, his visits to our country.  More than that, he was a deep and committed student of the problems of Northern Ireland, he spent a considerable amount of time discussing those problems and developing his own approach to addressing them.</P>
      <P>At our many meetings, here and in London, and indeed at European meetings, Northern Ireland was always on John Smith's agenda.  He was always anxious to be told the latest developments and to offer any constructive help he could.  Indeed, it may not be generally known that in the period leading up to the Joint Declaration, he offered his help on several occasions, with a view to ensuring that progress in Northern Ireland would never be made a partisan political issue under his leadership of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Again, speaking from experience, I know that John's views carried considerable weight whenever and wherever the leaders of European socialist parties met.  He was, rightly, seen by them as a man of immense experience and wisdom and as someone who had employed his own qualities of integrity and inner strength to unify and consolidate the support base of the Labour Party in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> He was always good company.  His quiet and sometimes demure exterior masked a wicked sense of humour, which could enliven any occasion.  His considerable compassion was always visible, particularly in relation to any personal dealings.  He had a particular kind of charm and his warmth and wit will always be recalled by those privileged to have known him.</P>
    <P>However, that quiet exterior also encompassed both a vision and a strong sense of conviction about the future of Britain.  His vision extended from the need to strengthen and develop the technological base of British industry to the overwhelming demand for better and more responsive public services.  The unemployed, the elderly, the handicapped and the homeless were at the top of his concerns and I have no doubt that, had he lived, he would have come to be remembered as one who had transformed their lives for the better.</P>
    <P>John Smith will be genuinely mourned across Europe.  His loss will, of course, be most keenly felt in the United Kingdom and among the members of the great party that he led for a tragically short time.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Irish Labour Party, I extend my deep sympathies to his wife, Elizabeth, to his three children, to his many friends and to the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I was deeply shocked to learn of the death of John Smith, the Leader of the British Labour Party.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I express our most sincere sympathy to his wife, family, relatives, party colleagues and to the British public at large on the loss of someone who was already a leader and a potentially greater leader.  It is a cause of great sadness to see men or women cut down in their prime.  John Smith brought great standing and ability to his position as Labour Party leader in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within his party he achieved the commanding height of leader but it would appear from public opinion and recent election results that he stood on the threshold <Col N="1516" /> of even greater personal and political achievement.  It is deeply regretted that the potential represented by John Smith in democratic and political terms should, through today's tragic event, fall short of its ultimate achievement and reward.</P>
    <P>There is one dimension of Mr. Smith's career &mdash; others have commented on it &mdash; to which I would draw attention from an Irish point of view.  Greatly to his credit he developed and consolidated within the British Labour Party and wider Labour movement in Britain a coherent pro-European long term strategic view.  I witnessed at first hand his influence on colleagues in the European Parliament. Some of the younger members of the socialist group came into a group with many Euro sceptics.  They had great enthusiasm and energy and were motivated by the leadership and commitment of John Smith.  Many of them who were close to John Smith brought this view forward in a vigorous way and gave public testimony to his pivotal achievement, in some respects, in reorientating the Labour movement in Britain towards the focus of a positive view on Europe.  Not only are we all interdependent in terms of the European Union, it is important that our nearest neighour would have a coherent and broadly similar philosophy to ours.  There are many areas, as we witnessed with the currency crisis, where things become unstuck and John Smith deservedly earns our respect for this contribution alone.</P>
    <P>I met him when he visited Dublin and in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He had a deep understanding of Irish affairs and deserves our deepest respect for the fact that he had no truck with any kind of ambiguity about the role of violence in politics.  There were forces in part of the wider Labour movement in Britain that might have been inclined to look in that direction from time to time but he would have none of it.</P>
    <P>His death is a tragic loss to his family, party, country and the people of Europe. Go ndéanfaidh Dhia trócaire air agus ar dheis Dé go raibh a ainm.</P>

      <P>Like everyone else I was deeply shocked to learn of the death of the British Labour Party leader, John Smith.  The British labour movement and people have lost an outstanding leader and the Irish people have lost a valuable friend.  It is a tragedy that Mr. Smith died so young when he had served only two years as Labour leader and when, clearly, he has so much to offer.</P>
      <P>The sense of shock provoked by John Smith's death has been reflected in the warmth and generosity of the tributes paid to him on both sides of the Irish Sea. His ability and skill as a parliamentarian was admired by politicians all over the world.  His powers of oratory, his sharp intellect and wit were all used to great effect to further the interests of the British Labour Party and its supporters.  His loss to politics is a heavy one for he was clearly a man of great integrity and intellectual power and with a great sense of joy in life.  It was that which made him so determined to seek progressive change so that all could share in that joy, free from the shackles of poverty and unemployment.</P>
      <P>He was a formidible political opponent yet he never showed any personal rancour to those with whom he disagreed. He was a much admired father figure in the House of Commons and he was never aloof.  He came to the Labour leadership when the party lost its third general election in a row.  He responded to the task, restoring a sense of vigour and confidence and leading that party to an impressive performance in the recent local elections. He was very much a Prime Minister in waiting.</P>
      <P>When I met Mr. Smith during his last visit to Dublin I was greatly impressed by his interest in Ireland and his desire to see a lasting solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.  He was a good friend of the Irish people and a staunch supporter of the Downing Street Joint Declaration. Perhaps the best tribute we could pay to John Smith is to continue to seek the social reform for which he had worked and peace and friendship between the Irish and British people.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 21, to delete &ldquo;£286&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment related to the earlier debate and the PRSI allowance which, if I remember correctly, was introduced at the time of the great tax marches and protests against the disproportionate share of tax being borne by the PAYE sector.  I think the allowance was originally £312 and was subsequently reduced to £286.  I will not repeat all the arguments I made this morning, which were buttressed by the Minister, except to say that this allowance is now virtually negligible in terms of its value.  The very modest increase from £286 to £500 proposed in my amendment is reasonable in all the circumstances, and I hope the Minister accedes to my proposal.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to increase from £286 to £500 the special allowance <Col N="1519" /> granted for 1993-94 for those individuals who contribute at the higher rates of pay-related social insurance.  The estimated cost of retaining the allowance at last year's level of £286 is £37 million this year and £57 million in a full year.  The increase to £500 as proposed by Deputy Rabbitte would cost an additional £25.6 million this year and an additional £40.7 million in a full year.  While this would be of benefit to a great number of people it would be very difficult to agree to this increase.  The full cost of paying the PRSI allowance at the increased level of £500 would be in the order of £98 million a year, a very substantial sum.  The arguments I made about the retention of the allowance at its present level under the last amendment apply equally in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to his attitude to similar amendments, the Minister's response is probably predictable. However, it is nonetheless regrettable.  While an allowance of £286 was worth something to workers during the early 1980s it is not worth very much now.  If the Minister is going to leave a relief like this in the system it ought not be of a negligible value.  I very much regret that the Minister has not seen his way to increase the allowance in the modest way proposed in the amendment. I will not press my amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts, as amended, with effect from the year of assessment 1994-95 the percentage of mortgage interest paid which qualifies for relief (subject to interest ceilings) shall be 100 per cent of such mortgage paid.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main concerns about the Bill is the way in which it will leave homeowners worse off than they were prior to this <Col N="1520" /> year's budget.  We will not have an opportunity to debate the amendments to sections 105-115 as the question has to be put at 4.45 p.m.  I will, therefore, make a passing reference to the way in which homeowners will be butchered under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the 80 per cent ceiling on mortgage interest relief; in other words, a person who has £1,000 of mortgage expenses will only receive relief on £800.  This has the effect of hitting those on lower mortgages with more modest homes.  This is just one of a number of measures introduced by the Minister, for example, the reduction in mortgage interest relief to the standard rate of 27 per cent, which will reduce the amount of mortgage interest relief by £55 million in the next few years; the widening of the residential property tax net and the implementation of the Labour Party agenda to get more taxes from family homes.  People with a combined income of £25,000 who own homes of £75,000 will now have to pay residential property tax.  There is also the bombshell announcement by the Taoiseach about a poll tax.</P>
    <P>Homeowners are now begining to mobilise.  ACRA has reported that residents' associations which had been dormant for years are being re-established and new associations are being formed to rail against the anti-construction and anti-homeownership policies of the Government.  It is a matter of some concern that people who make lifetime commitments in the form of a mortgage &mdash; their biggest investment &mdash; should be penalised in this way.</P>
    <P>We had a general election foisted upon us in November 1992 when the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government fell apart.  At that time we were in the middle of a currency crisis and interest rates were increasing overnight. On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Minister, Deputy Ahern, assured homeowners that if he was re-elected he would protect them and introduce special measures to relieve the high costs of mortgages.  With the time lapse, the public forgot the preelection promises and they got a triple <Col N="1521" /> whamming, and were hit on the residential property tax.</P>

      <P>The ink on the Programme for Government was barely dry before the parties got down to the real agenda. Indeed, we will see revealing episodes of this in the future.  We do not know what will come next year; we are told we will have the star chamber sitting, somewhere in the deep vaults of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I was reading what the Taoiseach said in Killarney.  He let slip that under his new rates plan in Dublin alone full service charges combined with residential property tax would yield £50 million, and what a pittance the residential property tax yield was at £13 million.  I await the proceedings of this star chamber.  I assure the Minister I will be standing four square with this country's homeowners who thought the policies of successive Governments over decades to give a little assistance to those with a high mortgage would be retained.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 is but the tip of the iceberg.  I am still receiving letters from people who are startled when they study their revised tax-free allowances. The Minister may explain it all away, saying that there has been a cut in interest rates; that people did not want to be underpaying their taxes then receiving demands for more tax and so on.</P>

      <P>What people understand is the difference between their gross and net pay.  They were assured by this Government they would be £3.47 per week better off.  When one takes the 1 per cent levy out one discovers that those with a substantial mortgage claiming the <Col N="1522" /> full relief are worse off.  Next year and the following year, when the relief on VHI premia and the mortgage relief have been chipped away, as outlined in the table in section 6, they will lose £70 million in relief.</P>
      <P>We will be keeping a vigilant eye on the Minister's plans.  The Minister should not have cast aside the solemn promises he gave on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  The evening papers were quick to quote him on their front pages, saying he would protect homeowners from the ravages of high interest rates.  The Minister has now thrown them to the wolves.  The Minister and, indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, are saying that the policy of this Government is that those who want a house should go to their local authority and apply for it.  That is totally against the spirit of self-reliance or trying to help people who are helping themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the temporary loan of some of the Deputy's voters in which I am interested.  It was timely of you, Sir, to remind us of that typographical error. It is quite clear that, despite the element of Dáil reform engaged in and the committee system, we will not reach that, or indeed a good many other amendments that are more important.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates's amendment on mortgage interest relief is important.  It is a most important decision we are about to enact in terms of all homeowners.  For some reason &mdash; perhaps the blame rests as much with us as with the media &mdash; we have been unable to communicate to people clearly what is involved here.  The major part of the Minister's change relates to his commitment to lowering mortgage interest relief to the standard rate.  That means that between now and 1997-98 the rate of relief will be cut annually by approximately 5.25 per cent and people do not readily appreciate its extent.  However, if one looks at the Principal Features of the Budget of 1994 one will see that the savings to the Minister will be of the order of £81 million, admittedly, that includes relief in respect of VHI premia and health expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Yates said, almost £60 million will be saved from homeowners.  An additional £3 million is being levied by the residential property tax.  One can see the douche of cold water this is for homeowners, already hard pressed to meet their mortgage repayments.  They were assured by the Minister that he <Col N="1525" /> would not only maintain the level of interest relief as it was but increase it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Yates said, one must put it in context.  For the first time the Minister for the Environment has imposed water charges on Dublin county, then there is the imposition of residential property tax, the cut in mortgage interest relief, the cut in VHI premia relief and a raising of the threshold for medical expenses. There is no point in our trying to discuss these in isolation because all of them combine to have a very serious, adverse effect on homeowners.  Mortgage interest relief is by far the most serious and people do not readily appreciate that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has developed amnesia since his Killarney speech.  He is now only one step short of denying that he ever made it.  I predict that the Taoiseach will recover his memory very quickly after 9 June and will clarify the position. The star chamber to which Deputy Yates referred &mdash; I suppose if it is chaired by the Minister for the Environment, appropriately enough, it should meet in the vaults because he will bring that gravitas of monsigneur-like austerity to bear on it &mdash; will bring forward something after 9 June but, in the interim, we are enacting a Bill every backbencher who is listening to this debate should be aware that if householders do not now appreciate that their interest relief will be cut by 5.25 per cent for each succeeding year from now until 1997-98, when it will be reduced to the standard rate, they will then appreciate that that constitutes a severe additional burden on them.  On top of all that the sword of Damocles is hanging over home owners.  The Taoiseach made it clear that he intends to replace the residential property tax with a house or home tax for the entire country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with my colleagues in Opposition who said that the Taoiseach was walked into this and did not fully appreciate the extent of what he was doing.  I think the Taoiseach did it in full knowledge of what he was doing, to try to defuse the row which Deputy Callely and other Fianna Fáil Members, as well as colleagues on the other benches, had created in Dublin about the residential <Col N="1526" /> property tax.  He wanted Mr. Niall Andrews &mdash; I promised to give him a plug &mdash; to be in a position to say to people in Dublin &ldquo;the Taoiseach said in Killarney he would replace this tax.  There is no need to worry about it.  We have introduced amendments and so on to get over the problem with the Labour Party but the Taoiseach said we will replace it, so relax, it is not serious&rdquo;.  I have adopted a different approach from Deputy Yates in my amendments where I seek merely to restore the <i>status quo.</i> I agree that is the minimum the Minister should do in present circumstances.  There is no point in presenting a budget that suggests large scale reform if all you do is transfer it from the taxpayer <i>qua</i> taxpayer and take the money back on the other hand from the taxpayer <i>qua</i> householder.  It is jigging around the pieces in the jigsaw so that there is some modest improvement in your direct income tax for which you will pay in VHI, in the threshold of medical expenses, mortgage interest relief, water charges and so on.  That is the position in Dublin county where they have just got their bills for £70 water charges.  Their mortgage interest relief has been reduced and some are liable for residential property tax.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Callely's intervention.  In the earlier part of the day I was reminded of a phrase by my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, one afternoon when he said we should all join hands to see whether we could get in touch with the living.  It is useful to know there is some spark of life in the proceedings as the day draws to a close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is useful in the way it has been employed by Deputy Yates to bring us into the domain of property tax in general.  It is impossible to avoid the opinion that the Government is not being honest about what it wants to do with the system.  Trying to keep up with this debate in Opposition is almost useless because the goalposts keep moving.  Following an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels some months ago, the Minister became almost apoplectic in defending the residential property after the budget because his Fianna Fáil backbenchers did not want it and some of the Labour Deputies felt that this ideological claptrap would not get them re-elected.  The Minister produced a 50:50 scheme, which is more of the stop-go thinking that has characterised tax policy the past two years.  The Taoiseach said we should not get too hung up on the residential property tax. I suppose, although he did not use the phrase, what he had in mind was &ldquo;a temporary little arrangement&rdquo; and that he would replace it with substantial rates by the back door or a poll tax, as suggested by Deputy Rabbitte, but the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, advised the Taoiseach to desist.  This does not necessarily reflect disarray in the Government but a sophisticated approach.  If the Minister for Finance advocates two steps forward and one step backwards, that is policy.  If the Taoiseach advises us to forget about it because it is inconvenient and that a new package will be well worked out next year that must be policy. If the Department of the Environment is charged with producing a significant part <Col N="1528" /> of the input and the Minister says that is not policy, that too is policy and the public is left guessing.  As neither we nor the Government know what the policy is a strong case can be made for tax reform. The Minister set out some principles about that case in his budget speech earlier this year but because of the confusion surrounding this extremely sensitive issue, the Government is in danger of sinking tax reform and the wider target which so many share could be lost.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the amendment.  I agree that the residential property tax is a sham.  It should be removed and I am sorry we cannot remove it today.  I say to Deputy Callely who is now sitting very quietly on the backbenches and all those other Deputies who will come in meekly in five or ten minutes' time to vote that the overwhelming majority will vote into law, walking through these lobbies, this iniquitous extension of the residential property tax.  There is no point in putting out sandwich boards, statements or other emissions from the north or south side of County Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that this year for the first time we were able to give mortgage interest relief at the rate of 100 per cent for the first five years to first time buyers, even if they had bought a house in the past five years.  This will prove very beneficial and will give a great opportunity to people starting off.  I am aware that Deputy Yates is telling people who write to him about the impact of lower interest rates.  A person with a £40,000 mortgage last year was allowed interest relief on £4,800 but with the lower interest rate at 8 per cent the interest has been reduced to £3,200, a saving of £1,600.  This is proving to be extremely beneficial.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of the changes in the budget less the decrease in mortgage relief, a family with an income of £20,000 will have a net gain of £175 and a family on £30,000 will have a net increase of £225.</P>
      <P>It is clearly stated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that it is the Government's intention that the progressive increase in the yield from the standardisation of discretionary reliefs should be used as a priority to expand the standard rate band.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I know that the House will welcome the provision for first time buyers of 100 per cent relief for five years.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sligo Forest Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  The forestry inspector in Sligo, who is employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, retired recently.  A replacement has not been appointed and as a result forestry payments for grants are not being processed or paid.  The forestry office workload is extremely demanding and time consuming and for the past 18 months the inspector worked single handed every weekend.  He covered all of Sligo, most of Leitrim and part of Cavan and dealt with matters, such as private planting, advising on species of trees to be planted, pre-planting and post-planting, general inspecting advice and so on.  He was the only person employed in that office; he did not have a secretary to answer telephone calls.  The office is now unmanned and an adequate service is not being provided for those involved in forestry in Sligo, Leitrim or Cavan.</P>
      <P>If this position remains unfilled, planting will come to a standstill and those employed in forestry contract work in the area will cease work.  I am concerned that the private contractors who work for the forest service will not be paid if the work is not carried out.</P>
      <P>The automation of sections of the forestry operation in recent years has led to a decrease in the number of people employed in forestry.  This is another matter of concern because in recent years the forestry sector has not been adequately catered for.  Additional people should be employed in that sector.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and ask him to urgently appoint a replacement forestry inspector.  The officer who retired worked seven days a week and the only time farmers could contact him was when he returned home at night.  The service in Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan has been down-graded.  If possible, will the Minister make that appointment within the next few weeks to ensure payments are made on time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Foresty (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Foresty (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Foresty (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this important issue.  The professional unit of the forest service consists of 22 professional foresters of which 16 are assigned to regional offices throughout the country.  The regional locations were based primarily on an analysis of areas of greatest intensity for private forestry plantations, determined in 1991 at the time the inspectorate was established.</P>
      <P>In the period 1989 to 1991, the private forestry inspection function was carried out on an agency basis by Coillte Teoranta. This situation proved inadequate for a variety of reasons particularly on conflict of interest grounds in that Coillte Teoranta was itself in competition with private owners for forestry land, with private contractors for establishment work and with private nursery owners for the sale of plants; and second, the delegation of this function to Coillte Teoranta was incompatible with the policy functions of my Department.  For these reasons, a Civil Service Commission competition was held and inspectors were recruited from Coillte Teoranta from which they severed all previous links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period since record levels of planting have occurred in Ireland involving in all cases a significant input of inspectors' time, effort and expertise. The inspector is responsible for pre-planting advice to farmers and landowners on site suitability, species selection, environmental compatibility, economic value and establishment techniques; post-planting evaluation of establishment for grant payment purposes; inspection of maintenance standards in <Col N="1535" /> the early years for second instalment grant payment purposes; and general functions in relations to the provision of the 1946 Forestry Act relating to felling licences and the promotion of forestry.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the CAP reform process, my Department submitted a new programme to the EU which will very substantially expand the forestry planting programme to 30,000 hectares per annum.  The programme will place a new emphasis on species diversity and will, in particular, involve an increase in the share of broadleaf planting to 20 per cent.  I am happy that the EU Commission has accepted my proposals and the programme has now been formally approved.  In anticipation of this, my Department has undertaken a complete review of the inspection process with a view to maintaining the objective of best forestry practice in the enlarged programme. That review is almost complete and will devolve greater responsibilities on private contracting companies while retaining the primacy of my Department's regulatory functions.  I see this new inspection process as delivering a better balance between the ongoing process of certification of best forestry practice with the desire to expand the forest estate through the promotion of forestry as an alternative land use by farmers.</P>
    <P>The inspector referred to by the Deputy retired less than three weeks ago and the question of replacement is currently under consideration by my Department. However, as with all vacancies it is subject to constraints on Civil Service numbers and administrative budget considerations. In the meantime, alternative arrangements will be made to ensure that cases on hand are dealt with as expeditiously as possible so that grants are processed and paid on time.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cork School of Music.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the need for an extension to the Cork School of Music at Union Quay, Cork.  Cork has been treated badly in the third level capital <Col N="1536" /> allocations this year.  In a city with a university, a regional and other colleges the capital allocation is derisory compared with other centres.</P>
      <P>Sanction for the extension in this case was announced in 1978 by the then Minister for Education, Deputy John Wilson. The Cork School of Music is a constituent college of the Cork Regional Technical College which owns the site.  Complete architectural plans for the extension exist and planning permission was obtained in 1985 from Cork Corporation.  The site is located in an area designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 for which Cork Corporation has prepared a Waterfront Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The undeveloped site at Union Quay is an eyesore and a scar on the waterfront. Its immediate development is important as it is a major part of the Cork City Development Plan 1992.  Cork Corporation fully supports the sanction of the application from Cork Regional Technical College to build an extension to Cork School of Music.</P>
      <P>The extension is required for a number of reasons.  The site is a derelict site and Cork Regional Technical College pays an annual fine of £3,750 to Cork Corporation under the Derelict Sites Act because of that.  The extension will replace the school's annex which was closed down having been declared unsuitable and unsafe as an educational premises by Cork Corporation's chief fire officer.  It will provide the school with sufficient accommodation to develop a programme of third level courses for which it already has the necessary staff resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will enable the school to make a major contribution to job creation, enhance Cork city and county as a tourist attraction, provide vocationally orientated third level training in Munster for students of music, speech and drama and provide adult and continuing education in Cork city and county.  It will be possible to generate revenue by renting rooms in the extension during vacation times, in particular the auditorium and the rehearsal rooms to the large cross section of city based performing groups which <Col N="1537" /> depend on the staff and students of the Cork School of Music for their membership and organisation.  At present the activities of the school are scattered throughout the city in different halls and buildings and as a result the proper linking and development of departments is not taking place.</P>
    <P>The total estimated cost of the project in 1993 terms would be £3.8 million.  It is extremely important that the Minister give the go ahead for this extension.</P>
    <P>Many teachers are forced to teach at advance levels in rooms that are far too small for instruments such as wind instruments and for singing.  There is a lack of adequate classroom space for aural training, theory classes and for activities such as chamber music, band, choir and orchestral rehearsals.</P>
    <P>The school library is housed in a room measuring 8 feet by 20 feet without natural light or ventilation.  There is also an acute shortage of storage space in the school.  Staff room facilities and office accommodation are grossly inadequate. At present five heads of department share one room.</P>
    <P>Increased third level activity will require the provision of these and additional student facilities such as canteens. The Cork School of Music has the staff, but not the premises to develop its present third level courses into a highly flexible structure which would offer vocational training in speech and drama as well as music to students aspiring to become performers, teachers, community art officers, sound engineers, organists and choir masters and mistresses.</P>
    <P>The expanded structure based on the present third level course would provide for the award of a certificate diploma and a degree.  Because of the present situation the bulk of the Cork School of Music's library stock is in storage due to lack of space.  The school has the staff but not the premises to develop a variety of post graduate courses.</P>
    <P>If this extension is granted the Cork School of Music will be uniquely poised to realise the potential of collaborations which are possible with the scientific and <Col N="1538" /> technical staff of regional technical college, the staff of the Crawford College of Art and Design, RTE and the music department of University College Cork. The extension would also enable the college to give support to creative artists because it would have the accommodation necessary to originate, support and sustain a composer in residence scheme.  It would also be in a position to facilitate a variety of temporary music ensembles.</P>
    <P>The extension will also enable the Cork School of Music to contribute significantly to job creation through the provision of summer schools, summer camps, and pre-school programmes.</P>
    <P>It will be in a position to accommodate professional services for FÁS supported schemes and will also enhance the employment potential of musicians aspiring to make a career in spheres of popular music including rock, folk and jazz.</P>
    <P>It will create a demand for catering services by virtue of the large numbers using the facilities.  It will also develop a self-financing examination centre based on its widely respected syllabus and examination system.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will reply he has received revised submissions from the regional technical college, but this project has been under consideration since 1978.  I ask the Minister to realise that Cork can wait no longer for this badly needed extension to the school if it is to retain its high standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the need for additional accommodation at the Cork School of Music and I appreciate the opportunity to report to the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline some details with regard to the school.  The Cork School of Music was built at Union Quay in 1956.  It caters for a total of 3,651 students on a part-time basis and runs a full-time national diploma course.  It also provides courses in a number of out centres.  It operated under the aegis of the Cork City Vocational Education Committee up to <Col N="1539" /> 31 December 1992, after which, responsibility for the operation of the school transferred to the Regional Technical College, Cork, under the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>An extension to the school, which would have provided an additional area of 2,800 square metres, was at an advanced stage of planning in 1985 when, having regard to the financial circumstances at that time and the need to utilise funds for capital projects in areas of greatest priority, the planning of the project had to be deferred.  The Deputy will recall his party was in Government at that time.</P>
    <P>A submission by the Regional Technical College, Cork to the Department of Education for capital funding under the 1994-1999 European Regional Development Fund Programme in respect of a broad range of projects for the college, included a proposal for the extension to the school of music.</P>
    <P>As already indicated in the Minister for Education's press statement of 13 January 1994, provision has been made in the Department's 1994-1999 European Regional Development Fund submission to the European Union for capital developments at the regional technical <Col N="1540" /> college.  Regrettably, it was not possible in the specific allocation to the Cork Regional Technical College, to include the school of music project.</P>
    <P>The present position on the proposed extention for the school of music is that following consultation with the director of the Regional Technical College the Department has very recently received a revised submission, prepared by the director of the school of music.  It is under examination in my Department.  The revised submission was necessary due to the many new developments which have arisen since the plans for the extension were originally prepared.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, however, the Department gave approval last autumn for the renting of additional space for the school.  On completion of the examination of the revised submission and when the proposed project has been fully evaluated it will be considered for funding.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the Department of Education continues to be faced with the difficult task of allocating available funding against a very wide range of pressing demands for capital resources.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 May 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> I am in favour of competition in the provision of services in so far as that is practicable.  I believe that MMDS, as a regulated franchise system, is the most practicable way to provide the multi-channel service to non-cabled areas. MMDS, of course, competes with direct-to-home satellite television.</P>
    <P>If by &ldquo;community television&rdquo; the Deputies are referring to illegal deflector operations which provide a &ldquo;re-beaming&rdquo; service in some areas of the country then my position is that such systems cannot be licensed.  There is simply not enough frequency space available to Ireland to enable a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements, such as those of RTE, a possible independent third channel and Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The allocation of these frequencies is strictly governed by our obligations under the Stockholm Treaty of 1961.  Those calling for the licensing of illegal deflector systems in effect are asking me to close off options for the future development of domestic television services in this country.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that boglands in the Midlands from which all peat has been commercially extracted be developed for conversion to grassland, agricultural use, forestry or for amenity or other purposes.  Bord na Mona dispose of such lands where they no longer have use for them and, in operating this policy, Bord na Mona have been specifically asked to ensure that small farmers are facilitated.  Accordingly, such lands are, where possible, being disposed of in small lots.  Furthermore, Coillte no longer have first option on cutaway suitable for afforestation. <Col N="1490" /> Such lands are now offered for sale on the open market.  This enables private forestry concerns to compete with Coillte Teo. on an equal basis.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the National Development Plan.  I am seeking EU funding towards the costs of carrying out of a detailed study into the amenity, tourism and wildlife potential of cutaway bogs which are unsuitable for agriculture, grassland and forestry and which may be put to better use as wetlands.  Discussions are still ongoing with the EU Commission in relation to their funding the study.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in co-operation with my colleague, Deputy Liam Hyland, Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, a midlands cutaway bogs development group is being set up to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Radioactive discharges from the Sellafield complex, including the THORP plant, are monitored at the point of discharge under the supervision of the UK's regulatory authority and the results of this monitoring are regularly published.  The EU <Col N="1492" /> Commission, under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty, carry out inspections of facilities established in member states to monitor nuclear installations which discharge radioactive substances into the environment.  Inspection of monitoring facilities at Sellafield was carried out by the Commission towards the end of last year.  I am satisfied that the present arrangements for monitoring of discharges at Sellafield together with inspection of monitoring facilities by the commission and the monitoring in the Irish Sea carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are satisfactory and I do not see any need to have our own monitoring facilities put in place at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) monitors the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters to study the distribution of contaminating radionuclides, identify trends and assess the risks to public health.  In relation to the Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of seawater, seaweed, sediments, fish and shelfish.  Samples of seawater and sediments are also collected out into the Irish Sea from an area south of Dublin extending northwards to Dundalk Bay.</P>
      <P>The RPII publishes the results of its monitoring programme and results for the period 1988-90 are available.  If the Deputy so requires, I can forward him a copy of this report.  The report for the period 1991-92 is in the course of publication. In general, results of this programme show that concentrations of radionuclides in the Irish Sea have shown a decrease in recent years.  This has been due to a decrease in the Sellafield discharges. In addition, the RPII's monitoring programme shows that there is no significant risk to health from the consumption of marine produce from the Irish Sea.  There should be no concern about frequenting beaches or enjoying the facilities of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed on occasions about the presence of plutonium in the Irish marine environment. The RPII has measured its concentrations and found them to be very <Col N="1493" /> low.  It is, of course, keeping the plutonium concentrations under continuing review.</P>
    <P>Whilst the RPII's monitoring programme provides a reassurance that there is no significant risk to the health of the Irish public as a consequence of the Sellafield discharges, the discharges cause contamination of the Irish Sea. This contamination is not welcomed and I would like to see all discharges progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated.</P>
    <P>With reference to discharges from the Sellafield-THORP plant, which is only now going into operation, I would like to reiterate the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities. I have asked the RPII to extend its monitoring programme to take account of the THORP plant.  New sampling equipment has been installed to measure emissions particular to that plant.  The results of such monitoring will be scrutinised by the RPII on an ongoing basis and I can reassure the Deputy that the results will be communicated to the Irish public in realistic terms.</P>

On foot of this decision, our Department, in consultation with the ESB, developed a competitive scheme comprising a combination of price support and grant assistance to ensure that such supplies are available within the specified period.  Details of the scheme were announced on 12 April last.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present to make grant assistance for domestic insulation available from the 1994 allocation to energy conservation.  The increased allocation of £2.05 million to energy conservation in the 1994 estimates is in respect of a specific series of measures to further the national energy conservation programme including the establishment of an Irish energy centre and the provision of investment, technical advice and back up measures in respect of an expanded Forbairt programme in the area.  Accordingly, there is no scope to make any part of the allocation available for grant assistance in respect of domestic insulation.</P>
      <P>However, I must point out to the Deputy that for the past number of years my Department has provided funding to Energy Action Limited, a voluntary organisation who combat cold in the homes of the elderly and needy by means of insulating and draught proofing such homes.

      <Quest>if, in relation to the recognition of EU teaching qualifications, arrangements are in place for allowances and salaries to be paid in respect of those qualifications; if they will be back-dated on the transposition into law of the relevant EU directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under Directive 89/48/EEC, <Col N="1509" /> which was transposed into national law on 2 January, 1991 under Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 1991, teaching in certain State institutions is a regulated profession.  Nationals of the EU who are recognised as teachers in another member state may, subject generally to the terms of the directive, apply for recognition as a teacher in those institutions.</P>
      <P>The legislation deals only with qualifications and not employment issues such as allowances and salaries.  However, the practice has been that allowances and salaries as appropriate are paid to persons from other countries who obtain recognition as teachers here.</P>

      <P>I have received the correspondence to which the Deputy refers and I am aware of the strong desire on the part of the school in question to secure the services of a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that due to my heavy schedule of commitments, I would not be in a position to meet a delegation from the school.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that I have arranged for the needs of this school to be taken fully into account when decisions are shortly being taken on the allocation of additional remedial and resource teacher posts.</P>
