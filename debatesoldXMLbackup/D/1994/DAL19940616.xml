      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies Harney and John Bruton.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call Deputy Harney to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I give notice that I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the agreement yesterday by the European Commission on the amount of Structural Funding for Ireland in the years 1994 to 1999 and the implications this will have for our National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I request a debate under Standing Order 30 on a motion seeking a comprehensive statement for the Government explaining its decision to pre-empt £1 billion in resources for income tax reductions or for basic non-EU aided Government services by going ahead with all the projects in the National Development Plan even though the EU <Col N="1978" /> funding for these is £1 billion short of budget and explaining why it has done this without publishing a comparative analysis of the cost benefits and rate of economic return of this use of £1 billion of Irish taxpayers' money as against other options for its use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask you, Sir, or through you the Government, when the Government will provide time for a debate on this matter?  The Government has taken serious decisions without the approval of, or consultation with, the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I advised the House only yesterday morning how to proceed on this matter.  I also remind the House that the matter was the subject of an Adjournment debate last evening by Deputy Yates and I understand arrangements for the House to consider the matter will be discussed by the Whips this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect your decision, Sir, but my party asked yesterday for this matter to be discussed today and that was the general view held by Opposition parties.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that as soon as the Commission confirmed its decision he would be willing to have a debate.  Today is the day to have that debate.  The Regional Affairs Commissioner, Bruce Millan, stated on television last night that the Government submitted the final figures to the Commission only on Tuesday of this week, even though the Taoiseach told this House the Commission had all the information and that he was awaiting its decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, it is important to put the record straight.  I hate this innuendo and twisting of statements made in this House.  I said the Government has no problem whatsoever with a debate on the National Development Plan.  If there had been a Whips meeting last night, which we expected would take place, perhaps the matter could have been discussed.  There will be a Whips meeting at 11 o'clock this morning and the matter can be discussed then.  If it is arranged to have a debate today the Government will have no problem with that, but I totally and absolutely reject the insinuations by Deputy Harney in relation to this matter.  The Commission and the Department of Finance have been exchanging information over the last number of weeks and as late as early this week drafts were being sent back and forth from the Commission for approval and tables had to be finalised. Any insinuation that we made incorrect statements in this House is without foundation and I want to put that on the record.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to a former Member of the House.  Déanaim fíor comhbhrón le clann agus gaolta iar-Theachta Dála Sheán Uí Cheallaigh a fuair bás sa bhaile inné i gContae an Chláir.  Fear ab ea é a bhí i gconaí dícheallach agus a thug, riamh, gach a bhí aige. Trí Ghaeilge i gconaí a thug sé faoina chursaí sa Teach seo.  Ní bheidh a leithéid inár measc arís.</P>
      <P>We surely will not have another man like former Deputy Seán Ó Ceallaigh in our midst, a man who died at his home yesterday in County Clare.  Earlier this week we were in contact with him to congratulate him on the appointment of his son, Fr. Fiachra Ó Ceallaigh, as auxiliary bishop of Dublin.  His son Fiachra is the first Franciscan to become a bishop for nearly 170 years and I know Seán was very proud of him.  Seán was a part of history.  He was a Clare man born in the last century and a close friend of Eamon de Valera.  He was a founder member of Fianna Fáil in County Clare and was runaí of the party there for more than 20 years.  He succeeded Eamon de Valera in County Clare in 1959 and he continued to serve the people of his community and his constituency of Clare for a further ten years.  He finally retired in 1969 and I know he has been a valued member of the community and a valuable source of history since then.  Once again, I sympathise with his family, his relatives and friends and, in particular, his son Fiachra.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the former Deputy Ó Ceallaigh.  He was a Member of the House for a number of years and <Col N="1982" /> served his constituents of Clare with dedication. He had a particular love of the Irish language and saw in it an expression of Irish nationality, in which he had a deep belief.  I wish to express the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party to Fianna Fáil on its loss, particularly to the Fianna Fáil Party in County Clare who I know will feel the loss deeply.  It was a considerable honour for Deputy Ó Ceallaigh to be chosen by his party to fill the shoes of the late President Eamon de Valera as Deputy for that constituency.  He was a man of no mean achievement and no mean principle chosen to fill those very large shoes.</P>
      <P>I know he had a profession outside politics.  He was a teacher and had a deep interest in education.  I agree with what the Taoiseach said about the way he continued to serve his country, his neighbours and friends to the end of his life.  I express also the pleasure of our party that he lived to see the great honour bestowed on his son in recent times.  I express on behalf of his political rivals in Clare the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party with the Ó Ceallaigh family on their serious loss.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to convey our sympathy to the Ó Ceallaigh family and the Fianna Fáil Party on the loss of a father and a colleague.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton have said, I am sure this man had happiness late in life with the appointment of his son as an auxiliary Bishop of Dublin. He served County Clare, his party, his country and continued after his retirement from this House to serve the people of County Clare in many ways.  I express to his family and to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party particularly in County Clare, our sympathy on their loss of a man who served his party, county and country in an outstanding fashion.</P>

I did not know him personally but last night I spoke to my colleague, Deputy Molloy who, like others, served in this House with Deputy Ó Ceallagh in his latter years.  He was a committed Gaeilgeoir and a close friend and associate of the late Eamon de Valera.  I would like to extend my sympathy and that of my party to his family and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

While he was always steadfast in supporting his point of view, he always had time for mine.  My late father had a great fondness for the Irish language also.  I join in the tributes to Fr. Fiachra Ó Ceallaigh who is the first Franciscan to become a bishop in more than 100 years.  Following my recent road accident he was the first person to visit me in hospital.  He is a gentle soul.</P>

      <P>This arises under item 12 on the Order Paper which deals with Estimates for the Public Service including Vote 18 for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I have no problem with the proposal to take the Education Estimates without debate but we should have a debate on what the Government is doing to find a realistic solution to the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus.  We need to know what is happening as this affects families over a large area of North County Dublin, County Meath and Dublin city.  The people affected want to see clear Government leadership on this matter which is not the case, and I would like the Government to allow a short debate today on the crisis in TEAM so that we can do everything we can to bring about a solution.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises in the first instance from the requirement to comply with the Third Directive on Non Life Insurance which comes into effect on 1 July 1994 throughout the European Union.  This directive is part of the process, known generally as the Single Market, of opening up the markets of the member states of the EU to competition.</P>
      <P>Up to now, regulation of the health insurance market here has been governed by the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957.  A company wishing to operate here had to apply for a licence from the Minister for Health.  The 1957 Act did not, however, require policies to be sold on a community rated basis nor did it demand of insurers that open entry to insurance and life time cover should also apply.  In practice, these principles were applied by VHI.  The only regulatory mechanism was the decision of the Minister for Health on whether he or she would agree to provide a licence to a company other than the VHI to operate here.  Very few licences were granted over the years and the VHI maintained a near monopoly of health insurance in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement on licensing can no longer apply from 1 July next so that, <Col N="1998" /> unless it were otherwise explicit in legislation, a health insurance company coming into this country could sell policies on a risk related basis with no regard to concepts such as social solidarity.  Such a development would alter radically what has been the situation in Ireland for almost 40 years.</P>
    <P>The Single Market has its own imperative which this Government and previous Governments have accepted.  Within the competitive environment which the market promotes, we have to ensure that what is done is for the general good.  In the area of health services, conventional market concepts do not work very well, given the disparity of information between the provider and the client. Even in a suitably modified market, there is an overriding requirement to protect the general good, to maintain social solidarity and, where health insurance is concerned, to strive to ensure that it will remain available and affordable to those who most need it &mdash; the elderly, the chronic sick and those struck down by serious illness.</P>
    <P>This is the first of two insurance Bills which I hope to bring before the House this year.  In the next term, I intend to introduce legislation which will amend the 1957 Act and provide the framework for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to compete effectively.  I have just received the report of the review group on the VHI, chaired by Professor David Kennedy.  It will be of considerable assistance in finalising the content of the second Bill which will have as its main aim the strengthening and modernisation of the VHI's role and functioning, so that it can continue to be a major player in the new environment.</P>
    <P>There is another imperative besides the Single Market.  We must maintain the best practices of a health insurance system that has served this country well for almost 40 years.  A simple application of free market principles may not always produce the most consumer friendly or efficient result.  Experience from other countries would suggest that an unregulated market in health insurance can often create systems which do not contribute <Col N="1999" /> to the delivery of an effective and efficient health service.</P>
    <P>In this country, health insurance has played a major role since 1957 in the development of the health services.  Its success can be seen in the numbers covered, which now approximate to 1.3 million persons or over 35 per cent of the total population.  Such a high level of coverage demonstrates that health insurance is accepted as offering value for money to consumers and its continuing strength, despite periods of adverse conditions for the economy generally, is a testament of the value that the insured population place on their membership of the various schemes.  Despite consistent and sustained improvements in public health services and the broadening of eligibility criteria, health insurance continues to be an attractive product.</P>
    <P>When the Third Directive was being drafted by the European Commission, it was agreed, on this country's initiative, in the interests of social and inter generational solidarity, that the Directive should allow member states, if they so wished, to require health insurance companies to sell policies which were community rated and to require them to practise both open entry and life time cover.  The Bill which is now before the House has those three principles at its core.  Those elements will, for the first time, have a statutory basis and any health insurance policy sold in the future in this State must comply with these requirements.</P>
    <P>The basic objectives of the legislation, aside from meeting the Single Market requirements, are to copperfasten the good practice in health insurance of almost four decades and to put in place mechanisms for ensuring that community rating, open entry and life time cover will not be undermined by a deliberate commercial policy of selecting only low risk customers.  Another important aim of the Bill is to protect consumers by ensuring that they have a minimum level of cover for certain costly procedures. Those incurring the expense of purchasing insurance must be guaranteed <Col N="2000" /> that their level of cover will give a reasonable level of indemnity against those costs which are likely to be most expensive &mdash; inpatient treatment, consultants fees and certain aspects of outpatient treatment.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the fundamental thinking which informs the provisions incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Any regulatory system for health insurance in this country must be placed in the wider context of the general community. The long title of this Bill speaks of the legislation being necessary &ldquo;in the interests of the common good&rdquo; and it is this aspect of the new system which lies at the heart of the proposals I am putting. There are those who would argue for unfettered competition, placing expedient and short term gain above principle. Those who would take such a stance could scarcely have paused to contemplate the implications for the elderly and other vulnerable groups.  Companies would market products which would not be affordable by the majority of the old and chronically ill.  The inevitable result would be that many people would drop out of health insurance and thereby forego the choice of service which they had regarded as sufficiently valuable and important to them to incur optional expenditure on health insurance, often over many years.</P>
    <P>A second principle which underlies this Bill is the general acceptance that health insurance has an important role to play in the maintenance of a high quality health service in this country.  The regulatory system proposed by the legislation must not adversely affect services for public patients.  The provision of care for private patients in public hospitals helps to maintain high standards of care and treatment throughout the hospitals.  Those standards will apply to all patients in public hospitals and will ensure that everybody gains from having health insurers supporting service providers, both consultants and hospitals.  In the current year, public hospitals will earn over £60 million in providing treatment and care for private patients.  This income is an important factor in maintaining the overall <Col N="2001" /> quantity and quality of public hospital services.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a mix of public and private practice be maintained in public hospitals.  The alternative is the emergence of a divided and divisive hospital system where there is a hospital sector dealing exclusively with private patients and another sector dealing only with public patients.  Such a development exists elsewhere and would not help either sector or be welcomed here.</P>
    <P>Another objective of this legislation is to create and foster the conditions for increased consumer choice through the development of a wider menu of products than is now available.  The Bill will encourage product innovation and responsiveness by insurers to the consumers' requirements.  In particular, I expect that there will be a significant development of ancillary products and that very flexible packages will be made available, particularly as a means of attracting new, young members.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Deputies an information document on the main features of the Bill.  I thought it important to do so as the Bill is complex and technical. The proposals outlined in that document in regard to the details of the future regulation of health insurance will be the subject of consultations with interested parties later in the year.  I will now address in somewhat more detail its three principal features &mdash; community rating, open enrolment and life time cover.</P>
    <P>Community rating is the system of pricing whereby members of an insurance plan are charged the same premium by a company for a particular range of benefits. No discrimination is made by the insurer in regard to the age, health status or sex of the individual member.  The rationale which underlies this concept is that high risk groups, mainly the elderly, should not have to pay more in premia at a stage in their life when they are most in need of the benefits of their insurance policy.  Furthermore, low risk groups, such as the young and healthy insured population, will benefit from community rating when they age and come to need services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> I have described what is meant by community rating.  Perhaps I should also explain what it is not.  It is most assuredly not a system which is anti-competitive.  It does not prevent companies from competing. There is ample scope for commercial rivalry to gain greater market share by concentrating on price, product and quality of service.  It is a matter for each insurance undertaking to determine how it competes on price with its market rivals, provided it does not discriminate within its own plans against vulnerable groups.  Similarly, companies can strive for more customers by promoting insurance policies which meet real needs and fill gaps which clearly exist in the market.  There is nothing in community rating or, indeed, in any of the proposed regulatory arrangements which will prevent the development of innovative products for the consumer.  I am anxious to see new thinking on product lines in health insurance and I anticipate that, should competition occur, there will be a notable increase in marketing and related activities.  The basic concept behind community rating is one of fundamental social solidarity.</P>
    <P>Open enrolment is another key principle which the Voluntary Health Insurance Board has implemented for many years.  Like community rating, it is a concept of particular value to vulnerable people who can be assured that they will have access to insurance when they choose to purchase it.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is very important that people take out health insurance at an early age if inter-generational solidarity is to continue and community rating prosper. This can be achieved by insurers promoting products which suit the needs and reflect the values of young people. A decline in the number of young people with insurance would have serious consequences for the system generally as there would be insufficient low risk members to balance out the high risk groups.</P>
    <P>However, open entry cannot be absolute as no insurance company could be expected to give full cover immediately to any individual who wished to join. <Col N="2003" /> Such an arrangement could have significant adverse effects on the insurer in a very short period.  Some waiting period for cover must be applied if the insurance system is not to be undermined.  I will describe in more detail later the broad parameters that I am considering for statutory waiting periods for cover.</P>
    <P>Life time cover is linked to open enrolment and community rating in protecting the highly vulnerable.  It would be traumatic for a chronically ill person, who may incur a high level of cost for an acute condition, to be denied continuing cover. I am, therefore, providing for the concept of life time cover to be an integral part of the new regulatory arrangements but with some qualifications.</P>
    <P>Despite the reactions of some of those with particular interests in health insurance, what I am proposing will protect the general good, facilitate competition among efficient undertakings, encourage product development, and help to ensure that affordable health insurance will continue to be available to all those who wish to have a choice between public and private treatment.</P>
    <P>A number of important points arise from the interpretations set out in the Bill at section 2 to which I draw the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo; is defined in the Bill.  The definition of those services is necessary to distinguish them from the requirement for minimum benefits which I will describe later and to ensure that the principles of community rating, open enrolment and life time cover are applied to the specific services identified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo;, which is a fundamental part of the Bill, defines health insurance as applying to payments made for the specific reimbursement of fees or charges. In other words, there must be an element of indemnity before a policy can be described as &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo;.  Policies which are cash payments only and can be paid irrespective of the actual costs incurred in treatment are not, under this definition, health insurance.  I did not <Col N="2004" /> seek powers to bring such schemes, some of which are described generally as critical illness policies, within the ambit of this Bill &mdash; they do not constitute an indemnity policy and present no real threat to health insurance at present. However, my Department will keep the matter under review to ensure that where critical illness policies overlap with health insurance or are seen to create a serious threat to it, the question of their coming within the definition of health insurance will be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Section 7 prohibits insurers from offering non-community rated policies.  It also defines community rating.  However, there are a number of aspects of community rating on which I would like to make some further comments.  It will be noted that section 7 (2) (a) uses the phrase &ldquo;suffering or prospective suffering of a person from a chronic disease etc.&rdquo;. My intention in using the word &ldquo;prospective&rdquo; is to prevent the application of current and anticipated diagnostic techniques, such as genetic testing, as a means of providing information on which a decision could be made to increase an individual's premium or deny an insurance contract.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that, with the considerable scientific development worldwide, particularly in our understanding of genetics, there may be a desire by some companies to use the knowledge being created to load the premia of persons seeking insurance.  This would be wholly undesirable in an area such as health insurance and contrary to the principle of community rating.  I understand that a number of other European countries are also considering this matter.  I am pleased that this country will be taking explicit powers, if this House and the Seanad so decide, to ban such a potentially serious development in the area of health insurance.</P>
    <P>The House will also note from section 7 (3) that I am not requiring health insurance policies covering long term care to be marketed on a community rated basis.  The advice I received suggests that the marketing of a long term care policy which is community rated <Col N="2005" /> would be very difficult, as young persons would not be attracted by such a product. However, I hope that insurers will develop products which can cover long term costs.  The demographics of this country and of other developed nations suggest that such products can be directed at a sizeable market which would justify their development.</P>
    <P>I am making a number of exceptions in section 7 (4) (a) and (b) to the principle of community rating.  These exceptions reflect current practice by insurers here, whether by VHI or friendly societies and do not, therefore, dilute to any significant extent the community rating principle. The concessions on group discounts are important and necessary if insurers are to continue to attract the type of risk that can be offset against their high risks.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out, with certain qualifications, the requirement on insurers not to refuse a contract to a person under 65 years.  An insurer is not obliged to accept for membership a person who is 65 years or more except where that person's insurance company has ceased to trade; in this situation the insured person will be allowed to enrol with another undertaking and may not be prevented from doing so.  Section 8 (4) (a) provides for all those, irrespective of age, who have had a health insurance contract with an undertaking to transfer to another company. This provision is reasonable given that a person over 65 years would probably have been paying into a scheme for many years and is, therefore, entitled to continue to receive and expect benefit.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has operated waiting periods for entry into its schemes for many years. The approach taken by the board is reasonable and it is likely, therefore, that I will be prescribing in regulations waiting periods which are generally similar to those operated by the board.  However, a number of areas require further examination, which I have referred to in the information document I circulated.  My aim is to ensure that the regulations will provide a balance between necessary control by insurers on entry while at the same time adhering to the principle of <Col N="2006" /> open entry.  I should add that restricted membership undertakings will be allowed to limit their membership to the relevant occupational group but may not refuse to accept a qualified person under 65 years.</P>
    <P>Section 9 explicitly prohibits a company from refusing to renew cover or terminating it without the insured person's consent, except in circumstances to be prescribed in regulations.  It is likely that these circumstances will allow for cover not to be renewed or to be terminated if it can be established that there was fraud on the part of the insured person or non-disclosure by him or her of significant relevant information to the company.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that an insurance contract which covers hospital services must provide for a minimum level of benefit to be offered to a potential subscriber. An insurance company which is offering benefits which do not include any element of hospital costs but relate only to ancillary services, such as a dental care plan, will not be subject to this requirement.</P>
    <P>A minimum benefit requirement is vital to the general regulatory framework proposed by the Bill.  It is important for the following reasons: it ensures that there is a continuing availability of the type of cover currently enjoyed by the insured population; it ensures that individuals do not under-insure, due to lack of proper understanding of the restrictions which might apply to some types of policy; and it supports community rating by requiring younger subscribers to purchase a sufficiently high level of insurance to help balance the costs of older, more high risk members.</P>
    <P>The level of statutory minimum benefits will be clearly defined in regulations which will be published in the autumn after detailed consultations with interested parties.  However, these benefits will only be paid in respect of what are regarded as medically necessary procedures. The main elements which would be included in minimum benefit are: hospital in-patient treatment, including day care; hospital out-patient treatment; <Col N="2007" /> consultants fees; maternity benefits on a &ldquo;grant in aid&rdquo; basis; convalescence; psychiatric treatment; and substance abuse.  The minimum level of accommodation which will require to be covered is semi-private in a public hospital.</P>
    <P>The precise level of cover for each of the above headings will be described more fully in regulations.  The regulations should not demand that insurers should provide for a higher level of minimum cover than they now provide, as such an approach would be highly inflationary and ultimately lead to higher premia.  My general approach is to make sure that the regulatory framework gives a guarantee of minimum benefit to consumers. If individuals want to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; and purchase more cover, they will be able to do so.  Ultimately, the market should provide the type of product that people want and at a price they are prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>It is very important that all those purchasing health insurance should be given full information, in a clear and comprehensive manner.  It is also necessary to ensure that any advertising or promotion of health insurance is accurate and truthful and does not mislead the public.  I propose to introduce on Committee Stage an amendment which empowers the Minister for Health to make regulations relating to the control of advertising and promotion, if such an intervention is deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>One further issue of continuing concern is the problem of balance billing by consultants where patients may be billed at a level which is not reimbursed by the insurer.  This is a particularly difficult issue which will require very careful consideration. An excessive amount of balance billing must be avoided if health insurance is to maintain its standing as good value for money.  However, any insurance company could be put under great strain if it was to meet the demands for increases in private fees introduced from time to time by medical consultants independent of any statutory control or review process.  My Department will be reviewing this matter further while the <Col N="2008" /> regulations on minimum benefit are being drafted.</P>
    <P>Community rating can be undermined by some insurers deliberately selecting low risk groups or individuals; a number of marketing techniques can be employed by companies to make certain that their risk profiles are lower than the average. Those techniques, which we have seen in operation elsewhere, could include having a direct mailing system to particular groups, or targeting occupational schemes with a relatively low average age, or designing policies in such a way that they appeal only to those who present the least risk.  The inevitable result of selection of low risk members is a considerable instability in the market as other insurance companies, with a higher than average risk profile, would find their financial position rapidly deteriorating.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation is a system which seeks to deal with the problem of market distortion and manipulation.  Risk equalisation should encourage insurers to control their costs by eliminating inefficiencies, whether they occur internally or in the services which they purchase on behalf of their members.  It compensates those insurers who have a risk profile which is worse than the average for all subscribers in the insured population.</P>
    <P>There are different methods of risk equalisation.  The method I am considering is based primarily on profiling each company's membership by sex and age bands.  I am opposed to any system that would pool all risks or costs in the insured population, as this would be a disincentive to competition and would simply reimburse the inefficient insurance companies and service providers. The type of scheme I am considering for risk equalisation would cover costs up to semi-private accommodation in most private hospitals.</P>
    <P>This and other aspects of risk equalisation will be examined in more detail by my Department over the coming months while the regulations are being drafted; there will be consultation with all relevant interest groups before the regulations are finally made.  The EC Third <Col N="2009" /> Directive provides that member states may introduce risk equalisation schemes if considered appropriate.  The proposals in the Bill are in accordance with the intent of the directive and are seen by the Commission as a necessary part of the regulatory framework to maintain community rating, open enrolment and lifetime membership.</P>
    <P>A Health Insurance Authority has been provided for in Part IV of the Bill. The Authority will not be established immediately as the regulatory functions in regard to health insurance will, from July 1994 lie with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, where prudential issues such as minimum solvency margins are concerned, and with myself as Minister for Health in relation to other matters. My regulatory responsibilities will involve the maintenance of a register of health insurers as provided for in Part III of the Bill and the monitoring of policies to ensure that they comply with community rating, open enrolment, life time cover and minimum benefits.  I will also make arrangements with an independent body under section 12 to advise me on whether risk equalisation should come into being, in line with a formula which will be set out in regulations.</P>
    <P>The body appointed to undertake this task will not provide me with any commercially sensitive information on individual companies.  They will receive information from insurers from the first quarter of 1995 which will provide them with the data to assess whether or not a risk equalisation scheme should be introduced. Such information will be entirely confidential to that body; its task will be to alert my Department to the possibility that the equalisation process, involving actual compensatory transfers between companies, will have to commence.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Authority will be established if the task equalisation process is introduced or if, in the interim period, there are changes in the market which would justify its being established. On its establishment, it will assume all the regulatory powers to be carried out from July 1994 by the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Health.  I do <Col N="2010" /> not believe that the arrangements to be put in place from next month of themselves would justify the creation of another semi-State agency.  I am satisfied that those arrangements will work satisfactorily in the interim.</P>
    <P>These are the main elements of the Bill and the remaining sections deal with standard provisions in regard to the maintenance of a register and the work of the Authority, including matters relating to staffing.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will be an assessor appointed by me under sections 10 and 12 who will advise me from time to time on the appropriate level of minimum benefit and the level of costs that should be subject to risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>The system I am proposing for the future regulation of health insurance presents a number of important and complex new features.  It also seeks to protect, through legislation, the key principles on which our system has been based for almost 40 years.  We have had to prepare legislation to cover situations which may not arise.  We may also find that the new situation produces challenges which have not arisen elsewhere and which we have not envisaged.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, persuaded that the regulatory system should be kept under review and should, in any event, be the subject of a comprehensive report not later than five years from its introduction. Nobody can say with certainty how the market will respond in the new environment. It may be that there are areas which will need to be changed so that the principles enshrined in the Bill will not be undermined.  The advice to be tendered by the Authority, if established, and the evaluations conducted on an ongoing basis by my Department should together form a good foundation on which to conduct a full scale review.</P>
    <P>All of the parties involved in health insurance and private care have a vested interest in appreciating the wider arena in which they are operating.  No one interest can stand aside and demand that its needs be met, even if it means that others are affected adversely.</P>
    <P>Service providers who would insist that <Col N="2011" /> their demands be put at the top of the agenda, no matter what the impact may be on the affordability and attractiveness of health insurance, would be behaving in a very short-sighted way.  If the price of health insurance escalates because of excessive demands by service providers the losers will not be confined to any one insurer or provider.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why the percentage of the general population covered by voluntary health insurance is relatively high in this country.  One of those reasons has been a general acceptance by interest groups, albeit reluctantly in some cases, that a level of moderation in demands is necessary if the health insurance system here is to retain its appeal for such a large number of people.</P>
    <P>In order to create a better understanding between the different interests involved in private health insurance and private care, I proposed in the document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> that a monitoring and consultative mechanism should be established which would be representative of these interests.  The forum to be established would include the Department of Health, the public health services and the institutional providers of private care.</P>
    <P>As the strategy document made clear, I do not as Minister for Health have any function in relation to the regulation, co-ordination or assessment of the services provided by private hospitals; the exceptions are maternity and psychiatic services. The experience to be gained from the proposed consultative mechanism will enable me to better assess what further mechanisms may need to be developed to maintain an appropriate interface between the public and private sectors, in the interests of providing the best possible level of health services for the entire population which is, of course, our common objective.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again that the proposals I have outlined today are designed to protect the best features of the system we have had in operation in this country for many years and to allow for competition in the <Col N="2012" /> marketplace.  The proposals have been structured in the interests of the common good and with no other objective in mind. My hope is that this Bill and the related one to which I have referred will be perceived as being as prudent as the 1957 Act which has been the statutory basis for a remarkable success story in the provision of affordable health insurance and the development of health services in this country for nearly 40 years.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is necessary to comply with continuing European Union developments. It is important to introduce the necessary legislation to ensure that the existing system of health insurance is not put at risk as a result of the changes that have taken place in the market.  I welcome competition.  In the old days it was to be the life of trade.  It is still the life of trade in politics and in business in general and I am sure in relation to health insurance it is no exception.  Competition is necessary and desirable and is in line with ongoing developments.  There would be a number of risks, to which the Minister has already alluded in the course of his speech.  When one mentions competition one always assumes it will be of greater benefit to the consumer, but that does not always happen.  Competition can work in other ways also which can be of benefit to those providing the insurance.  The danger is that those coming into the marketplace would identify the more lucrative elements of health insurance and provide competition in those areas which would be to the detriment of the existing system.  That is a luxury we cannot afford.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to hear about competition in the whole area of insurance.  However, I am concerned about the divided responsibility between two Ministers, albeit for a short time.  I am not critical of the Minister's colleague's Department but I wish to point out that Irish premium holders have not benefited to the same extent as other premium holders throughout the 12 member states.  That is particularly relevant in the case of motor and other types of insurance.  This does not apply in the area of health insurance. I sincerely hope the divided responsibility between the two Ministers does not lead us into a shady area that will result in difficulties later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> In his contribution the Minister referred to the mix of public and private hospitals and services generally.  I have always agreed with such a mix provided it results in healthy competition and that one complements the other.  In the event of services being unavailable in the public hospital sector such services should be made available to the patient through the private hospital sector without incurring extra costs.  When overloading occurs in one area it should be possible to take it up in another area.</P>
    <P>The community rating for equalisation of services is fine but unfortunately there may be dangers at a later stage.  The sands that shift quickly from time to time will inevitably shift in that area.  I see difficulties arising with regard to the extent of the services which may be made available. This is an area which the Minister may have to look at again.  For example, if a particular service is covered under a heading I see difficulties arising.  In order to meet health economics criteria, a matter to which I have often referred and which I am sure is the bane of the Minister's life, the tendency will be to reduce the degree of service which is not immediately visible to the policy holder. This is a matter which will need careful scrutiny as time goes on.  Responsibility for this matter will probably rest with the Health Insurance Authority.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the success of health insurance in Ireland and, perhaps, the lack of it in other countries.  Most European countries have a high level of health insurance.  There is no point in having an excellent health insurance system and everything provided if the patient cannot gain access to the services in the event of hospital beds being available.  In that type of situation we need to compare our services with those which are available overseas and the rapidity with which a patient can gain service as compared with overseas. That will have a bearing on the cost of insurance at a later stage.  Free movement of people, goods and services will inevitably lead to a situation whereby patients in the future may not see fit to remain on waiting lists for two or three years.  The Minister may say the waiting <Col N="2015" /> lists have been reduced and may encourage others to say so and they have to a certain extent &mdash; but not by a long stretch of the imagination to the extent necessary. I make that point simply because in a few years' time patients may say: &ldquo;Why not get our services elsewhere? We have our health insurance which is provided on a reasonably equal basis throughout the European Union&rdquo;.  I need not point out to the Minister the dangers of allowing that situation to develop.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the minister referred to loading.  This is an area which all motorists will readily recognise needs careful attention from the Health Insurance Authority.  I have no doubt various devices will be introduced when the new regime is in operation to introduce an invisable loading.  That has happened, time without number, in many other areas.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the VHI for having done an excellent job but I will come to balanced billing later.  In providing a health insurance system many years ago the VHI showed great foresight.  The loading system, to which companies frequently refer and rely on, will need careful scrutiny because in the event of a health insurance company identifying a particular problem they will look at ways and means of beefing up that premium to ensure they are not at a loss if their administrative costs have increased.  It will be important to keep under review the administrative costs of those competing in the marketplace.  For example, it is fine to have a health insurance company enter the marketplace in Ireland and provide competition; but on investigation it may be that those insurance companies have very high administrative costs, may be inefficient and so on.  If they have high administrative costs, inevitably those costs will be passed on to the consumer. I ask the Minister to refer to that area and to recognise that it is not a matter that can be resolved at the introduction of the legislation.  It will recur time and again.  We have sufficient experience in this House to recognise that insurance costs in one area can be <Col N="2016" /> transmitted very quickly to another area of the Union as well as within the country with consequent costs to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;topping up&rdquo; to which the Minister referred, whereby a person purchases cover for extra services, is an excellent one.  While I am aware that it is already possible to do this through the various schemes offered by the VHI, to what extent will health insurance companies be selective so as to discriminate against those in a particular category?</P>
    <P>The issue of balanced billing has been well aired during the past six to 12 months.  As the Minister said, he has no direct responsibility for private hospitals, but ultimately the activities of public and private hospitals will have a bearing on health insurance costs.  The efficiency, or lack of it, of those hospitals will be a factor in determining the cost of insurance premia.  The Minister should ask the Health Insurance Authority to pay particular attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>In a free market a consumer should have some idea of the services with which they will be provided in return for their fee.  On the other hand it is possible for consultants to say that the costs will not be identical as in the final analysis the services may not be identical.  Within reason a consumer or patient should be aware if they face the prospect of receiving a second bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the cost of insurance is low due to the number of young people involved.  While it is more difficult to encourage young people to join insurance schemes, to ensure the success of the entire scheme a greater effort needs to be made to ensure that young people when they enter employment join an insurance scheme such as the VHI.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that an increasing number of allegations of negligence are being made against both public and private hospitals.  I do not know the cause, but these claims reflect poorly on the adminstration of some hospitals.  I am not pointing the finger at any particular hospital, but there are danger signals. The reason may be that hospitals are understaffed and the services provided <Col N="2017" /> are overstretched, but unless there is a reappraisal such claims will have a dramatic impact on insurance costs regardless of whether the Minister has responsibility.  The companies which provide insurance cover will ensure that they are provided for and there will be a dramatic rise in the cost of health insurance if the matter is not tackled.  This issue, although unrelated, has a bearing on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the implementation of the Third Directive on Non-Life Insurance and in doing so this House has made some correct decisions.  The decision to proceed by way of legislation rather than regulation is welcome as some fundamental policy issues have to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>On the question of community rating, whereas one might expect somebody like myself who espouses competitive views to have some cavil with community rating and want free for all competition, a balance has to be struck between participation in voluntary health insurance and its practicality rather than some ideological theory of free competition.  If non-community rated insurance was on offer the net effect would be that there would be fewer people in the voluntary sector. As a consequence more people would be dependent on the State and there would be higher taxation.  The lesser of two evils on this occasion would be an imposed regime of community rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The risk equalisation scheme is potentially a useful weapon to have, but I hope it is clear that it will not be used in such a way that it will adversely affect the entry of new insurance undertakings into the field.  If one enters a field as a competitior it is much more likely, given simple inertia, that one will go for the younger section of the market, those who are taking out insurance for the first time. It is obvious that new entrants will focus their attention on those who have not been insured before rather than try to poach people who are already in the network and who, by supposition, are older and a worse risk.  The Minister should not allow the VHI to use the risk equalisation <Col N="2018" /> scheme as a trip wire in relation to competition as the other competitors will undoubtedly focus their attention on non-insured people who by definition are statistically likely to be at the younger end of the market.</P>
    <P>In relation to the market in medical services of which this is part, insurance is just as much a part of the provision of medical services as the service provided by a doctor, nurse or hospital &mdash; it is welcome that there will be competition in the provision of health insurance, but the logical extension is that there must be competition among the providers of medical services.  I am not in favour of a mad Thatcherite conversion of the medical system whereby we have competing health providing agencies; but there will have to be effective competition, in terms of price, among hospitals, consultants and general practitioners.  That competition is almost impossible, as the balanced billing issue shows.  The VHI can be attacked by all the consultants together and accused of abusing a dominant position if it says it will not pay them anything unless they agree that the entire Bill will be covered.  That is certain to fall foul of the Competition Act.  I wonder should provision be made in this legislation for qualification of the effect of the Competition Act, not that I am in favour of watering it down, but it seems there must be some effective method of price determination.  Perhaps this may be unnecessary in that if a number of undertakings compete with each other they will fix the price on an arm's length commercial basis with the medical service providers, but that may not always be the case.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should face up to this issue, and I am not speaking from an ideological point of view in this regard.  There should be genuine competition between hospitals to provide the services of two health insurance undertakings at the lowest possible rate.  That would involve the reconstitution of some hospitals to make them more competitive, less dependent on State resources and more responsive to competitive <Col N="2019" /> market-induced activity from the health insurance industry.  That is possible in the context of mixed private and public hospital users.  It would not be necessary to make dramatic or radical changes to achieve progress along those lines.</P>
    <P>Section 11 strikes me as a sensible measure to prevent health insurance people from improving their risk by encouraging poorer risks to drop out. However, before Committee Stage the Minister should revise the phraseology of that section because as it stands it would allow third parties to intervene to offer such inducements and, worse still, it might allow a collusive arrangement between competing insurance undertakings to induce people to change from one insurance company to a competitor and perhaps receive an inferior level of insurance.  We must consider the possibility of such inducements as well as those by registered undertakings.  This probably stems from a slight lack of foresight on the part of the Minister.  When making laws one must look around corners, as it were, to see how people might try to get around the law.</P>
    <P>In regard to the range of services provided for patients by GPs as opposed to hospitals, based on experience in North America and, in particular, Canada &mdash; countries in which the health system varies greatly from that here &mdash; it should be possible to provide an increasing level of general practice services in medical centres which can carry out diagnostic treatment, small operations and so on. Cottage hospitals might be the pattern for many health services in the future. The Department of Health should foster that concept.  I accept that it may be easier for health boards to supervise large units, but in the last analysis general practitioners would be a happier group of men and women and patients would be happier if they could have their blood tested and other elementary surgical procedures carried out in small units throughout the country rather than queuing up in casualty or outpatient departments to receive services which do not <Col N="2020" /> necessarily have to be carried out in a hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the increasing rate of claims for negligence against hospitals and consultants.  There may be a diminution in standards but in my view the real explanation stems from the litigation fever here.  As one who practises litigation for a living I have not seen any abatement in the willingness of people to sue hospitals and doctors. While it is not relevant to this type of insurance, negligence insurance for GPs, consultants and hospitals is becoming a significant drain on the community.  In that regard I reiterate what the late Mr. Justice McCarthy said about the desirability of people suing their doctors for medical mishaps and of having a fault-based system of compensation for victims of medical error rather than the present system, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I am sure many other points, similar to those I raised in regard to section 11, could be raised. I hope today's debate, which has been attenuated, will not be mirrored by an overly shortened Committee Stage debate.  I hope the Bill comes into law shortly, that there will be competition among insurance undertakings and that the risk equalisation procedures are not abused so as to hinder entry into the market.  Once there is competition among health insurance undertakings on a community rated basis, I hope it will translate into genuine competition among the providers of medical services. I hope also that Government will be open to the necessary flexibility, adaptation and change that will be required in the field of providing medical services to ensure that the price competition translates into more efficiency down the line. The waiting lists will be greatly reduced if more people can afford voluntary health insurance and if the voluntary health insurers can command greater efficiency from hospitals and consultants than at present.  Ultimately, harsh though it may seem, the price mechanism is probably the right way to approach that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arrived on our desks only last week and it is regrettable it is being debated under such pressure. We were all aware that the deadline was 1 July, but it is regrettable that the implications of the Bill cannot be debated fully.  I have only a very short period to cover the issues I would like to cover, but I hope we can deal with specific points on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the regulation of the private health insurance market. What has been, in effect, the monopoly position of the VHI is no longer tenable under EU regulations.  It also highlights the failure of the Minister to begin the job he set himself with his national health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i>  The Bill is as much about the timidity of the Minister for Health as it is about regularising the insurance market.  This is an opportunity to change an iniquitous and discriminatory system of health care and to think imaginatively about how to resolve the inherent imbalance of care between public and private patients. Instead of grasping that opportunity the Minister has chosen the safe route, the obvious route, the route which maintains the <i>status quo</i> within the new circumstances the EU has forced on us.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a curious piece of work. To herald in the open market in health insurance the Minister has introduced a Bill which is unique in its restrictions and qualifications.  He has argued the reasons underpinning the Bill, and they are understandable, especially in view of the dangers inherent in an open market scenario in a country where there is so much dependence on private health insurance. However, if a future Minister is lobbied by insurance companies pressing a case for opening up the system, will he or she use the series of let-out clauses provided in this Bill to open up the system so that people may be discriminated against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Insurance Bill is designed to offer the same basic cover regardless of which company is offering it.  Companies will also be required to provide cover to individuals who seek it subject to certain qualifications.  I support those important principles, but I am concerned about the <Col N="2022" /> capability of the Minister to ensure that he can sustain those principles in view of the overriding drive within Europe towards an open market.  I can only assume that he had full legal advice on this matter before publishing the Bill.  I am also concerned about the implementation of the controls spelled out in the Bill.  If a company is non-residential and insures people here, how will it be constrained by this legislation?  If a company attempts to contravene the Act what mechanism exists to immediately prevent it from doing so?</P>
    <P>An Authority would be set up if a risk equalisation scheme were introduced. Clearly, such an Authority would need the necessary resources to put in place the controls to ensure the scheme would be operable.  I am surprised the Minister has not indicated details of the board membership of such an Authority, it is simply in the gift of the Minister to determine who will be members.  He has excluded Members of the Oireachtas from it.  We know who cannot be Members but we do not know who should be.  Regarding other boards, particularly on the VHI board, there has been a demand for a long time for trade union representatives to be granted membership. Probably it would be easier if they were friends of Albert Reynolds, rather than being trade union representatives, to get on to that board.  If the Minister means what he says, he should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I should have referred to the Taoiseach.  If such an Authority were established it would be important for a member of its board to represent those who may be described as patients, clients or consumers.  It is difficult to fully assess the detail of the Bill as I had to read it in a hurry.  Will the Minister explain how he will ensure that a risk equalisation scheme will not <Col N="2023" /> end up subsiding unprofitable companies at the expense of profitable ones? There is no doubt that the amount of interest from foreign companies so far has been underwhelming but the market for private insurance exists and is growing significantly despite the fact that everybody is entitled to free hospital care.  That dichotomy between the need for private health insurance and the theory of equal access &mdash; which it is at present &mdash; is the kernel of the issue.  People do not take out VHI cover because they wish to spend their money unwisely.  They do so because they know it provides access for them and their families when they need it.  We all know that, it is not necessary to spell it out.  However, it is interesting to note that according to a Joint Oireachtas committee which considered this matter, the principal reason people take out VHI cover is to be assured of getting into hospital quickly if a treatment is necessary.  That was the most important reason, stated by 62.4 per cent of subscribers.  We are not talking about a product, but about something that may be a matter of life and death.  That is a shocking indictment of the two-tier system that people live with.  People who have money can buy their way into hospital or the private consulting room, that is what private health insurance is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pinpointed this important element in his health strategy which stated: &ldquo;access to health care should be determined by actual need for services rather than ability to pay or geographic location&rdquo;.  The Minister knows better than anyone that is not the case at present, as access to health care is frequently determined by the ability to pay rather than the need for services.  There is a fast lane for the well off patient and a blocked one for the public patient.  If our health insurance scheme was redesigned as an integrated one we would have the best opportunity yet of developing a one-tier system.  If the State ensured an end to the two-tier system, through adapting the health insurance scheme, the same equity would be available as in <Col N="2024" /> general practice.  One of the finest decisions made by a Minister for Health was by the former Minister, the late Erskine Childers, when he took the two-tier element out of general practice.  I would have thought that the Minister would have had the courage of his convictions to reform the two-tier system in hospital care and today would have been his first opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see children waiting in line because their parents do not have enough money to go privately.  Last week I canvassed a young woman who is widowed because her husband was too poor to get private treatment for his heart condition.  I, and I am sure any reasonable person, does not want to see such disparity between the well off and the poor.  Health care is not a product, it is often a matter of life and death and that is a fundamental issue in this debate.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the super-luxury categories within the VHI are still subsidised by the public purse at a time when hospital charge have been increased, when the ceiling of the GMS has not be raised and when pensioners, no matter how old, cannot get a medical card because it is means tested.  At the same time the Government believes that the country can afford to subvent the super-rich.  It is an outrageous anomaly.</P>
    <P>Recently the VHI was not able to pay out on Plan P because of changes in hospital charges and because the Department failed to negotiate a deal with the VHI.  I do not view the VHI through rose tinted glasses, but, to its credit, it has successfully reduced its running costs.  It has a low level of administrative costs.  It is also to its credit that it wished to publish the names of participating consultants. Will the Minister publish the Kennedy report so that we can read it?  It is interesting to note, from the most recent figures which the Minister provided on 26 May this year, that the vast bulk of payments to health agencies from the VHI were made to private centres such as the Blackrock Clinic which received £11.986 million and Galvia Hospital in Galway which received £4.230 million.  Those were by far the two highest payments made &mdash;<Col N="2025" /> both to private hospitals.  The VHI schemes that provide cover for those hospitals are hugely subsidised by tax breaks.  Is this value for money?  Is this giving a good return for the health services and for the child who is waiting to have his tonsils removed in Crumlin hospital or wherever?  Is this what a State owned insurance company should be about?  I have no objection and I do not see why anyone should object to people paying premia for treatment in private clinics.  However, I have a difficulty with where the public and private systems interconnect to the detriment of the public service which, clearly, is happening at present.  There is always the temptation and tendency to cater for private patients at the expense of public ones.  Hence, the drive towards private health insurance for those who can afford to pay it and the continuity of cycle of inequality.</P>
    <P>With the changes because of European Union policy, the Minister had an opportunity to be imaginative and to take his courage in his hands in the way the late Erskine Childers did.  Unless the Minister redesigns the insurance system, his aspiration to equity is nothing more than a dream, or worse, a delusion.  He had an opportunity in this Bill to begin to bridge the gap between public and private patients.  Instead of doing so he chose to produce restrictive legislation which will reduce the impact of the open market in health insurance, and I give him credit for that.  I am sure much work went into it but it has been done within a context which is essentially iniquitous.  It is a device to maintain the VHI in its current form instead of developing a new type of health insurance based on need rather than on the ability to pay.</P>
    <P>The VHI was set up in the 1950s to provide insurance for people who did not qualify for hospital care and was appropriate for its time.  Now, as everybody is entitled to hospital care, we should move on and not be stuck in a rut.  The Minister could use his initiative now that the system of insurance is up for review.  For example, he could use the VHI as a kind of quality assurance mechanism in the <Col N="2026" /> hospital service to include public patients.  If he implemented the recommendations in the Tierney report, appointed more consultants and introduced a productivity payment for consultants through the VHI, a transformation could take place in the drive towards equality of access.</P>
    <P>That kind of change could include the State channelling at least some of the money which is paid in consultants' salaries for public patients on to a fee per item basis just as the VHI pay for private patients.  This would not mean the end of private insurance.  It would simply mean that insurance would cover special items, for example, privacy or special facilities.</P>
    <P>The integration of the private insurance with the public system would improve care for everyone.  There would be no need for people to pay into a private insurance company simply to jump the queue.  There would certainly be no case for tax relief in the private sector which is at present a huge element of subsidisation.  We are paying for division within the hospital services.  Once there was an argument for private insurance on that basis because not everybody was eligible for hospital care. Now there is an argument for private insurance on a very different basis.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister is not moving with the times but reacting to a drive that is coming from Europe.  He is responding but he is not setting the pace. His response in the context of this legislation is adequate and it is one that I will clearly support.  It is important that we have community rating and that there is risk equalisation when a scheme is put in place, if necessary.  It is particularly important to have an authority that can ensure that the restrictions within this Bill can be put in place.  Otherwise there will be a free for all.</P>
    <P>That is really not the issue.  The Minister has set himself ambitious targets. He outlined them in his national health strategy, and everything he does must fit into the context of that strategy.  There is no indication in that document, in his speech or in this Bill that he is in any way changing or altering the direction of the <Col N="2027" /> health services.  It is dispiriting to hear him say that ultimately the market shall provide the type of product that people want and at a price they are prepared to pay.  That is indicative of the kind of thinking of the Department in relation to this.  Changes are coming about at European level.  It is a pity the changes are not creating a demand for a one tier system.  That is the kind of pressure I want to see from Europe.</P>
    <P>The VHI has a central role to play in the health services.  It has proved it can provide health insurance schemes to meet the demands of the times but those demands need to change.  The State has no business competing with other private insurance companies.  It has a responsibility to provide a full health service.  The VHI has the capability to meet that target and to be a vital vehicle for progress within the health care services.</P>
    <P>It is deeply disappointing that the Minister for Health failed to give the VHI a role that is appropriate to the 1990s, one that would reflect the aspirations expressed in his strategy, aspirations that are clearly further away than ever from being realised.</P>
    <P>This was a minor test of the Minister's commitment to equity in the health services, a test that he has flunked.  Like the £40 million of European money that was promised for the Tallaght Hospital, the promises offered in the health strategy are fading into the never-never land of unfulfilled political fantasy.  That is the most regrettable feature of today's debate.  It is an ideological point.  I have no reason not to be ideological when it comes to health care.  We are talking about a fundamental right.  Many poor people are not treated equally and do not have equal access.  Unless there is political change that denial of their rights will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me some of his time.  I am, perhaps, taking away from a more adequate reply that he would like to give, but it is important to remind the House that for two years the Joint Committee <Col N="2028" /> on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has been debating the performance and the future of the VHI.  It produced its report and recommendations earlier this year.  The report was produced at a time when the VHI prepares to enter into open competition as a result of a European directive.  That was taken into account in the course of our report.</P>
      <P>In welcoming what the Minister put before us I am glad to say he is in agreement in large measure with our recommendations. Our document deals with the VHI and since one-third of the population and, I venture to suggest, probably all Members are insured with the VHI it is personally and nationally a very important subject to debate.  I join with other Members in saying that we will have to spend more time on Committee Stage in order to deal adequately with the points raised.</P>
      <P>The joint committee welcomed the inclusion in the Bill of the concept of community rating.  In our report we said that in the new competitive environment it may be difficult to maintain community rating.  However, the joint committee believes community rating is worth preserving so that vulnerable groups such as the elderly will not be exposed to large increases in insurance subscriptions.  The joint committee recommended the establishment of an equalisation mechanism or a compensation fund as this would give the best of both worlds through the preservation of the benefits of competitive marketing and of community rating.  I am glad the Minister has accepted this.  It is very important for those who are members and for future members of the VHI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of vital importance is balance billing.  The committee believes that once people are insured with the VHI they should be fully covered for consultants' fees.  We endorse the VHI's policy of providing full coverage for its members in this regard.  One way of helping members to be fully covered is to provide their doctors with the names of consultants.  In this way the doctors have the necessary information when choosing a consultant.  The joint committee listed <Col N="2029" /> all the consultants participating in the scheme up to the last date available, 4 December of last year, and that provided an opportunity for discussion and comment. However, the Minister has now agreed that this should be provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point the Minister has accepted, although not in the way suggested by the committee, relatged to the appointment of an assessor.  The Minister said that the assessor will be appointed under sections 10 and 12 and will advise him from time to time on the appropriate level of minimum benefit and the level of cost that should be subject to risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>The committee had a different approach and became aware of a few flash points during its investigations which related to the VHI's relations with consultants and private hospitals.  We considered a number of possible solutions and proposed an independent assessor, a type of medical ombudsman, who would make non-binding recommendations in disputes between the VHI on the one hand and private hospitals and consultants on the other.  We envisaged that fee scales for consultants, private hospital costs and the development of new medical facilities could by this procedure.  The Ombudsperson would work with a team of experts as appropriate to each field.  The process would be carried out in an open and transparent way &mdash; this would represent an improvement on the current position.  The Minister may consider that this would be a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter than the proposal in the Bill and I would be glad if he would take that on board.</P>
    <P>The report was confined to the VHI and recommendations were made which are appropriate to mention at this time. It recommended the setting up of a State company for the VHI rather than leaving it in its present state.  This would give considerable advantages to the VHI.  It would be involved in open competition and would be at arm's length from the Department of Health.  Since the Department of Enterprise and Employment will <Col N="2030" /> be involved it is necessary that the Minster consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Many other matters are covered in the report which would be of help to members of the committee dealing with the Bill.  When a joint committee produces a report such as this that gets a great deal of national publicity, one day should be allocated to deal with it, rather than each Member having ten minutes to speak.  This report sold a record number of copies.  Considering the number of doctors and specialists listed in the appendix, it attracted a great deal of public interest.</P>
    <P>Members of this House and the Seanad should have an opportunity to discuss reports such as this.  It took a few years to bring it to fruition and it cost a great deal of money.  More than 200 people and many public bodies made submissions, yet it ended up on the shelf where few people have the opportunity of seeing it.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the joint committee involved I hope I will have an opportunity to comment on the various Stages of the Bill.  The committee welcomes the Bill which incorporate many of the recommendations we made.  It is necessary that it be brought into operation before 1 July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal briefly with all the points raised.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed and share their disappointment that there is not a longer time to debate this very important Bill on Second Stage. I hope all Deputies will have an opportunity to express their views on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan, in welcoming the Bill, was concerned about the division of responsibilities between the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The two Departments have had lengthy discussions on this matter.  In advance of establishing the health authority the prudential functions in which my Department has no expertise will be the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the health related matters will remain with my Department.  That is a <Col N="2031" /> satisfactory interim arrangement pending the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>I have said on numerous occasions here, and it is very much implicit in the national health strategy, that I want to see a public-private mix in health delivery but as far as practicable the private element of medicine will be carried out in public hospitals and the expertise and resources that will go to the private sector will be on the public campus.  This is an objective we are working towards.</P>
    <P>Great success was achieved last year with waiting lists.  Consultants, particularly surgeons, dealt in a very enthusiastic way with the additional resources made available by the Government.  For the first time in many years a significant impact was made on waiting lists.  I hope within the next week or two to announce the 1994 waiting list initiative which will continue that progress.  Nobody can be happy that there are people awaiting elective surgery, but there is not any country with instant access to every procedure. Once you overcome one bottleneck, others occur.  I agree with the views expressed by Deputies that we should always proceed on the basis of medical need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan spoke about invisible loading and risk equalisation.  Great care has been taken to ensure that proper community rating will be maintained. The mechanism of risk equalisation will be considered with a view to ensuring that no invisible barriers are created to get around the intent of the Bill.  On the question of balance billing, I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy that the consumer should be aware of the cover to be provided in the event of illness.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy McDowell's views on increased litigation and allegations of medical negligence.  The country is becoming more litigious and this affects not only health insurance but also motor insurance and all forms of public activity, including fairs and field days.  Deputy McDowell welcomed the implementation of the Third Directive and he also welcomed the Bill.  I was pleasantly surprised <Col N="2032" /> by his attitude in accepting the notion of community rating and the watering down to some extent of open competition in the common good.</P>

      <P>The notion of risk equalisation expressed in the Bill will not discourage new entries &mdash; that is not the intent.  We have gained from the Australian experience in that regard.  Risk equalisation will not come into effect unless there are clear distortions of the health market.  The Deputy made an interesting comment on the effective mechanism for price determination and I again welcome the ideological change from what I would expect from the Progressive Democrats.  I take on board the Deputy's comment on section 11.  That matter will be considered before Committee Stage.  I welcome his comments in general terms.  His point about the expansion of the service provided by general practitioners is very much in line with the national health strategy.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus referred to the fact that we are rushing through this Bill.  I am sorry we have not more time to deal with it.  My Department has been working flat out to comply with the European directives.  I think we are one of the first countries to put the directive into legal force and that is a great credit to the people working in my Department.  Many of the points made by Deputy McManus will be taken on board.  I note she included her normal preface of abuse before continuing with the meat of her comments.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes the approval in principle by the EU Commission at its meeting yesterday of the Community Support Framework for Ireland for the period 1994-99.  Following submission to the relevant consultative committees we expect formal approval and publication of the CSF in a couple of weeks time.  The operational <Col N="2034" /> programmes are being finalised now.  Within a few short weeks, we expect to begin drawing down on this very substantial transfer of funds to increase the jobs capacity of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that after all the debate and discussion we are now about to see this real and very substantial investment in the Irish economy.  Our task is to ensure that this money is used wisely and we get the maximum long term benefit from every ECU spent.</P>
      <P>I paid close attention to what Commissioner Bruce Millan had to say on television last night.  He said very clearly to the members of the Opposition that they seem to be losing this money over and over again.  We recognise that we lost out on the share-out on 21 October last.  We were very disappointed about that but there has been no change in the position since then.  Deputy Yates has been trying to milk this as if it were a new story whereas it is a very old story.  With the surge of the Greens it is good to see the Deputy recycling his speeches.  That should result in less of the rain forests being cut down to provide paper for new speeches from him.  His is a very old story.  There has been no fundamental change in the position.  The money on the table is exactly the same as the money we had on October 21 last.</P>

      <P>Let me clarify a matter for Deputy John Bruton because from what he said on the Order of Business yesterday he seems to have misunderstood the situation.  As I have said already, we agreed the basic figures with the Commission a number of weeks ago, a matter of which I informed the House at the time and those negotiations were extremely successful.  The small print, as I have told the House already, has had to be sorted out in recent weeks and both sides have sorted out matters.  I understand the Commission was submitting the final version of texts as late as Tuesday and Friday of last week as they had to <Col N="2035" /> deal with the figures in the detailed table and in the small print.  However, lest Members be under any misapprehension, the Government was anxious to bring the story out into the open because it is very good news that we will be drawing down the £4.54 billion, the Community Support Framework element of the total National Development Plan package. We are delighted to be at the stage where we can spend the money on those projects that will improve and increase this country's economic potential.</P>
      <P>The figures Commissioner Millan referred to last night were literally the figures in the detailed table and not the central agreement that was reached a few weeks ago, which went very well for us. Unfortunately the process of finalising the Community Support Framework proved more time consuming than either the Irish authorities or the Commission services had expected.  This was not unique to Ireland but applied to all member states.  The Commission officials have had to deal with Community Support Framework Applications from a number of different countries.  From my point of view it was frustrating that the processing of the small print was so slow.</P>
      <P>In fact, contacts between the Irish officials and the Commission on the details of the Community Support Framework continued right until the Commission's approval yesterday of the Community Support Framework.  Textual adjustments were being suggested by the Commission to the Irish side up to Tuesday last.  These figures did not relate to major issues but to a range of technical matters.  Agreement was reached on the substantive issues, including, in April, programme allocations, as I have informed the House already.</P>
      <P>I would have been extremely happy to have seen the Community Support Framework reach this stage earlier, given that the final result is extremely satisfactory from the point of view of the Government.  However, one has to recognise the desirability of the officials on each side to make sure that all the details are correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> I would like to restate the Government's strategy as set out in the plan.  The central objective of the National Development Plan is to ensure the best long term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs.  It is further designed to reintegrate into the economic mainstream the long term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming so.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the Government's strategy to achieve the national and European Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion. The basic elements of that strategy are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;first, investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, in tourism and services, in agriculture and natural resources;</P>
    <P>&mdash;second, investment in the country's productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash;third, investment in the development of the skills of our people through education and training in order to increase productivity and growth capacity; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;fourth, a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative.</P>
    <P>The Commission was very pleased with the local development element of the plan, which is a major departure from the practice in previous plans.  I am very pleased at how well it has been received in Brussels and that our model of local development will be reflected in a new urban development initiative by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission's approval in principle of Ireland's Community Support Framework represents a rousing endorsement of the Government's planned strategy.  May I quote from the statement made by Commissioner Bruce Millan yesterday?</P>

      <P>Commissioner Bruce Millan said:</P>
      <P>The Commission's appraisal of the objectives and strategy concluded that the central objectives of the Plan and the proposed strategy were appropriate to the needs and opportunities for development which have been identified in the Plan itself and in various preparatory studies.</P>
      <P>His statement then goes on to outline the same objectives for each of the sectors as those set out in our plan: the productive sector, economic infrastructure, human resources and local urban and rural development.</P>
      <P>As Members are all aware the plan placed a major emphasis on local Development, building on the experience already gained from the pilot area programme in Integrated Rural Development 1988-1990, the current Leader programme, the area-based initiatives under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the EC Poverty Programme and the EC global grant for local development.  All of these indicated that there is considerable potential to be tapped at local level to tackle long term unemployment and to generate local development.  Central to the programme is the targeting of areas and communities characterised by long term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Commission has supported the Irish Government's view of the need for an expanded role for local development in this CSF as compared with the 1989-93 CSF.  This time we will ensure that the National Plan will reach into the heart of communities that have been blighted by long term unemployment and will make a real difference. Given some of the comments which suggested less than wholehearted support by the Commission for light rail, I am happy to point out that Commissioner Bruce Millan's statement yesterday refers to Community Support Framework funds for the Dublin transportation initiative.  Any project costing over £20 million has to undergo special cost benefit analysis and that analysis is <Col N="2038" /> being carried out.

      <P>Of course we were disappointed last October when the Commission announced that the Community Support Framework would be £4.54 billion, exactly the same figure which has been announced today.  Contrary to media reports, there has been no change whatsoever in the Community Framework figures as announced last October.  It is still the highest amount <i>per capita</i> in the EU.  The shortfall was recognised by the Government at the outset.  It is our belief that in the period up to 1999 it will be possible to get EU aid over and above the allocations already made.  However, the CSF had to be agreed now on the basis of the EU aid which had been on the table.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, adjustments had to be made to the expenditure allocations to take account of the shortfall in EU aid. This shortfall was taken into account in settling the 1994 Estimates and public capital programme.  The assumption underlying the PCP and the Estimates this year is that Exchequer and EU spending in areas covered by the plan will be £130 million less than the plan projections.  This was stated publicly at the time and has been pointed out repeatedly in the Dáil.  In fact, we were able to put in an additional £40 million to make up some of the shortfall this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in so far as 1994 was concerned was fully dealt with.  At the beginning of March the Government took the necessary decisions to deal with the remaining years.  It remained satisfied that the strategy adopted in the plan was the correct one and that the balance of priorities reflected in it remained valid. Accordingly, it decided that the appropriate way to deal with the shortfall in EU aid was to apply a corresponding <Col N="2039" /> reduction on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis to Departmental allocations.  The reduction was applied to the combined Exchequer and EU elements.</P>
    <P>The Government's contribution to the plan of approximately £4 billion has been fully maintained.  We put to the Commission a <i>pro-rata</i> package which would keep the basic shape of what we put in the plan.  All the flagship projects are in place.  I spelled this out a fortnight ago in the debate in Private Members' Time and again last night, and lest there be any misunderstanding, the Tallaght hospital project is signed and sealed.  The contract is there, the foundation stone has been laid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the swings and balances on the two, the figures we have in terms of the CSF as now agreed reflect the <i>pro-rata</i> approach by the Government and that is very satisfactory.  The combined totals of EU and Exchequer spending on each element of the Community Support Framework reflect almost exactly the proposition which we put to the Commission, so we are delighted with this successful conclusion of our negotiations.</P>
      <P>Let me spell this out clearly.  The total contribution from the European Union is as announced by the Commission on 21 October last.  The total contribution from the Exchequer has been maintained. The combined expenditure on each element, taking EU and Exchequer spending combined, reflects the plan's priorities adjusted on a pro-rata basis to reflect the shortfall.</P>
      <P>The mix of Exchequer and EU funding for individual projects has been changed in the CSF as agreed but without affecting the totals in any significant way.  This mix is literally a technical thing.  It was dealt with as a residual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Where the EU is giving us less money for Tallaght hospital, they are giving us more money for national primary roads. <Col N="2041" /> The areas where we are spending more of our money are exactly counter-balanced by the areas where we are spending less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the EU is picking up more of the tab.  The totals of EU aid remain unchanged from what we knew last October.  The totals of overall Exchequer expenditure remain in line with those adjusted on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis as announced by the Government already.</P>
      <P>The text of the CSF approved by the Commission states:</P>
      <P>The proposals of the Commission in these areas were acceptable to the Irish authorities on the basis that they were consistent with their development strategy and that they were able to make offsetting shifts in the allocations of domestic Exchequer resources so as to essentially maintain the relative shares in overall expenditure in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>There will be only marginal variations from this.  In fact, one of the most notable variations, while relatively small in the context of the total package, relates to the local development programme.  This was an important new priority introduced in the plan by the Government to harness the potential of local initiatives to contribute to economic development through a range of new structural interventions, including an area based approach targeted at disadvantaged areas.  I am pleased to say that following discussion with the Commission this is an area which it has been decided to reinforce further by the provision of some additional resources for village renewal. There is also reinforcing of some measures in the human resources area. These will deal with specific areas such as equality, research and development and management training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will look each year at the budget possibilities.  If circumstances are favourable it may well prove possible for the Exchequer to inject additional <Col N="2042" /> resources in later years while maintaining budgetary discipline.  This was the case in 1994, where the Government put an additional £40 million over what it had originally committed into the plan.  The economic outlook now is much more favourable than it was last October when we drew up the plan.  The medium-term economic outlook is excellent.  The short term forecasts from the ESRI show again today that we are anticipating higher growth this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and will enable us to advance some of our projects faster than the CSF sets out.  If we can move ahead on investments that give a worthwhile return to the economy, we should do so.  If an investment is not worthwhile, there is no scope for it being in the plan.</P>
      <P>To the extent that it is not possible to add in additional Exchequer money arising from buoyancy, and not from additional borrowing or additional taxation, some of the investments originally proposed may take somewhat longer to complete.  As pointed out in the independent evaluation commissioned by the EU, investments which make economic sense for the Commission make equal economic sense as investments by the Irish Government.  The Government recognises, however, that fiscal discipline is essential to creating growth in employment and investment, and in no circumstances will there be any increase in borrowing or taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about projects and, in particular, whether individual projects will or will not go ahead. Neither the development plan, the CSF nor the operational programmes which will follow it deal with individual projects. They are concerned with the broader levels of programme and <Col N="2043" /> measures.  Only a small number of individual projects is mentioned in the National Plan and the same will be the case in the Community Support Framework. Comprehensive lists of projects do not exist at this stage and we have not discussed individual projects with the Commission, apart from some major projects which have to be treated separately from broad programmes.  The selection of individual projects is a further phase following the approval of the operational programmes, which is well advanced. Project selection is a process that will continue right through the implementation period.  We cannot say now, therefore, what projects will be implemented in 1997, 1998 or 1999.  That is how the system worked under the previous Community Support Framework and it is how the system works in other member states.</P>
    <P>What we have is a programme for investment in industry.  We do not know which industries will come in, for example, in terms of the inward investment or the Forbairt money for indigenous industry.  We do not know exactly which tourism projects will come on stream to draw down Exchequer and European money based on the input of private sector interests.  We have a fair idea in terms of the roads programme because the Department of the Environment has laid out a national roads programme to the year 2005 but there are other areas where there is just broad programming.  We have a programme in the education and training area but it is not itemised and year on year, as the implementing agencies see fit, individual projects are identified.  A number of flagship projects have been identified in the main programme and they will all go ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Commission's emphasis on proper investment appraisal and cost benefit analysis.  None of us wants to see funds spent on white elephants or on over designed projects or to see money frittered away with poor expenditure controls.  Last year in the Dáil I was very pleased to steer through the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill which provides <Col N="2044" /> for better scrutiny of public expenditure and for value for money audits.  I am strongly committed to ensuring value for money.  As Deputies know, any project which costs over £20 million requires a full economic appraisal before it can go ahead.  There is nothing new in such a requirement for any of our large road, rail or electricity projects.  Indeed, the Department of Finance at my request are updating their guidelines on project evaluation and project management to ensure we learn from mistakes in the past and put in place sound systems which avoid mistakes in the future.</P>
    <P>Negotiations of the CSF with the Commission have gone very well.  I would like to pay tribute both to the Commission officials and to the officials in my Department for the hard work and constructive spirit in which these negotiations were conducted.  I would have liked them to have concluded sooner because the sooner we get this injection of money into the economy, the better.  I am pleased that the Commission has signed off on the deal.  It remains to go to a number of committees.  We hope that that will be approved as a matter of course and that we can begin to draw down the money.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reading from Commissioner Millan's statement yesterday:</P>
    <P>The present CSF will significantly strengthen growth and employment in Ireland over the medium-term and will also lead to an improvement in the budgetary situation.  I believe that the very wide range of actions to be supported will greatly strengthen the productive capacity of the Irish economy and in particular the creation of employment.  I welcome especially the provision of support to Local Urban and Rural Development, which will reinforce and expand the efforts of communities throughout the country to promote their own socio-economic development and which will also complement those efforts by assisting urban renewal schemes to be carried out by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Ireland will <Col N="2045" /> have considerably diminished the development gap separating it from the EU average by the end of the CSF. Finally, I welcome the decision by the Irish and Northern Ireland authorities to include a chapter on co-operation in their Plans with the aim to working closely together to ensure that the operations assisted by Structural Funds provide the greatest possible benefits to the whole island.</P>
    <P>That is a strong and ringing endorsement of our plan by Commissioner Millan and I am happy to see it implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The most telling point I could make in a debate such as this is, if the Minister of State is right and this is such good news and a major success for the Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, would have his backside in that seat cooing, clucking and claiming credit for it.  He knows it is a major débâcle and has hightailed it to New York to get away from this shambles.  He knows the game is up, it is over, and there is no way the fig leaves the Government used can cover this anymore. He left the Minister of State holding the baby.</P>
      <P>I could not put it any better than stated in the Minister's script &mdash;&ldquo;I would like to recapitulate the Government's strategy as set out in the National Development Plan&rdquo;.  That Freudian slip tells it all.  The Government has wheeled in the Minister of State who seems to be visibly ageing in this whole sorry mess and is not able to cope with the enormity of the public relations mess the Government has brought on itself, not to speak of the worsening relations between Dublin and Brussels, that may have done permanent damage to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government attempted to cloud the issue and create such confusion about it that the people cannot see the wood for the trees.  It is not possible to have a shortfall of £1 billion and say there will not be cuts in the plan, extra taxation <Col N="2046" /> on borrowing.  The public know enough about basic arithmetic to know it cannot happen but the Minister failed to grasp that concept.  The inevitable, logical and rational conclusion is that some of the projects will be shelved or extra taxes raised &mdash; or both &mdash; but the Government cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Finance say in <i>gravitas</i> tones on the 9 o'clock news that some of these projects may have to be drawn out and it might be 2002 before some of them would finish.  Who does he think he is codding?  This is 1994 and the year 2002 is eight years away.  We could have several Ministers for Finance between now and then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think he will have a crack at it himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In simple language, if something is being extended to the year 2002 then it has been dropped.  Let us not pretend that such projects have any prospect of seeing the light of day.</P>
      <P>The most important economic implication of the Government's insistence that the plan must remain intact, despite the shortfall, is that it will pre-empt the resources that would have been available for tax cuts between now and 1999 and prop up the Government's vanity.  That is significant.  We are about to enter a unique period in our economic history. For the first time in 20 years tax cuts need not be financed from tax increases or cuts in public spending.  We have the unique opportunity to cut taxation from buoyancy and revenue growth from GNP. What will happen?  As a result of messing with the plan those resources, which will be published at the end of the month when the half year Exchequer returns are published, cannot be used to cut taxation. With an investment plan they could have reformed the taxation system and converted our good economic statistics into real jobs for school leavers.  The net effect of the bundling, false pride and false claims will be to pre-empt the sources of growth and to fail to radically address the tax system.  That is a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is taking <Col N="2047" /> credit for the fact that he cut it back by £130 million in the PCP.  Now that the Labour party must reassert its identity in Cabinet we will probably have a few more training schemes and high profile projects for Labour backbenchers.  I do not know if the Minister was at the meeting yesterday which lasted for five hours but you do not need five hours to tell you what is wrong with the Labour Party.  What is wrong is that the Labour Party told the public at the last election it would change the Government but instead it propped up Fianna Fáil.  As long as it is in that position, no amount of national plans or banging the table at Cabinet will get the party out of its <i>cul de sac.</i>  That is free political advice and I do not understand how the Labour Party does not see that.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the amount of money needed to make up the shortfall is £1 billion &mdash; the same amount by which economic experts advise we could reduce income taxation per annum.  That is based on the forecast growth and real public expenditure growth of 2 per cent per annum.  Our tax bill is excessive and instead of paying money to Saachi and Saachi and others the Government should go to the ESRI and include it in its party political broadcasts.  They seem to be togging out on a weekly basis for the Government on every issue from property tax to economic forecasts and policy.</P>
    <P>Does the Government think we are fools or that we will buy all this nonsense?</P>
    <P>As regards delaying the publication date of the plan, I read carefully the speeches of the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance on the five debates on the matter.  If one reads those and the Private Notice Questions one will realise that broad agreement was reached on this last April.  No amount of proof reading, textual adjustments, evaluation of statistics or tabular statements can explain how April, May and half of June have been taken up to produce this.  Only for people like Tommie O'Gorman we would be completely in the dark.  Every one of the reports in yesterday's newspapers included a paragraph stating that EC <Col N="2048" /> officials had informally and privately acknowledged that the Government delayed publication of the agreement until after polling day.</P>
    <P>Please do not try to pull the wool over our eyes with the nonsense the Taoiseach tried to persist with on the Order of Business this morning.  We know what the Government was up to and that it was on the ropes in Dublin.  We had the tomcat fight in Dublin and a loss of seats by the Labour Party.  I do not know who lost deposits in the by-election.  The last thing the Government needed was the roof to fall in on the Tallaght hospital project and to hear that there would be a shortfall of £40 million.  It told the officials in the Department to engage in filibustering to whatever extent was necessary so that it would not be further humiliated before polling day.  When the passport crisis was reaching a crux, the last thing it needed was for Mr. Millan or Mr. Delors to regurgitate all the past problems in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made a further false claim when she said that the <i>pro rata</i> 8.5 per cent adjustment was accepted by Brussels and in the next breath, that even though there is less money for the Tallaght hospital there is more money for industry and even though there is less money for county roads there is more money for major roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How else does the Deputy expect an unchanged figure to be made up?  The figure of £4.5 billion is unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When the EU Commission is making selective cuts and giving a little bit more money to one project and a little less to another project I do not understand how the Minister can say in the same breath that it agreed to the <i>pro rata</i> 8.5 per cent adjustment and there would be more money available for certain projects.  Let us have some truthfulness on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to what we do know. Under the National Development Plan £70 million was to be allocated to the Tallaght hospital.  We will now get £30 <Col N="2049" /> million for this project which, when I was going to school, was a shortfall of £40 million.  There is no way the Minister can get around this shortfall &mdash; the contracts have been signed, the bulldozers are on the site and the commitment has been entered into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The EU has said that it will only allocate £30 million for this project. I hope it is not proposed to allocate £40 million for roads to this project.  The Government is short £40 million for this project, this is part of the £1 billion it is short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The total is the same on the lower figure, on the £7 billion instead of the £8 billion.

      <P>I want to deal with this issue in a way which the public will clearly understand.  Programme managers and spin doctors should not try to give a particular message on this issue when the reality is that the Government is £40 million short for the Tallaght hospital.  I want to point out in simple terms what this means.  Increasing the price of the gallon of petrol by 10p would not make up the shortfall.  The Government would have to increase the price of a pint and a packet of cigarettes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is £40 million short on a figure of £4.54 billion one has to be up £40 million on something else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was present during the debate on the changes in excise duty she would know their effects on employment and tourism, the increased costs for industry and motorists and the hardship they cause in every area. There is an outstanding case for tax reductions in a variety of areas.  On the third Wednesday of January next year the ordinary punter will get another sting in the tail; at midnight the excise duties will be increased further to make up the shortfall in the funding for the Tallaght hospital.</P>
      <P>On the question of employment, this work of economic fiction states: &ldquo;This National Development Plan is a plan for employment&rdquo;.  If one take the most optimistic forecast in the plan, butchered as it is, one will see that the Government will be 60,000 jobs short on the number required to stop unemployment increasing. In simple language, it means that the policy of the Government for the remainder of this decade will be to rely, as Fianna Fáil always has, on emigration to solve the jobs crisis.  We have read about how pleased, delighted, impressed and satisfied the Government is, yet it is content to let 60,000 school leavers face the prospect of going on unemployment assistance and enduring means testing rather than having the opportunity to get their first job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the level of scaling down the Government is prepared to undertake <Col N="2051" /> on its very optimistic jobs forecast. In 1999, when the transfers have stopped, I wonder how many of the 900,000 people in training and jobs schemes will join the queue of the long term unemployed? There will be the short term palliative and political expedient of massaging the live register and a monthly statement by Ministers welcoming the reduction in the unemployment figures.  Unless we split the country into different regions or the criteria are changed, how many of those people will be in lasting, productive, sustainable and viable jobs when the money dries up?  The Government has been exposed on this issue from start to finish.</P>
    <P>The problems began in December 1992 when the Taoiseach was on the ropes after an incredibly bad campaign and the ravaging by the Labour Party.  The Saachi and Saachi advertisements against the Labour Party were retaliated against by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who insisted that trust should be put back into politics and justice put back into economics.  At Edinburgh the Spanish Government and Felipe González were the smart guys.  We were hearing reports about how well Ireland did at the negotiations, but Spain wiped our eye by ensuring at Maastricht that the specific amount of money it would receive was written into the agreement.  All we got was a nod and a wink on the 14th floor of the Berlaymont building and Jacques Delors was reduced to using the &ldquo;L&rdquo; word about what was and was not agreed. We then had the devaluation of 8 per cent; we were entitled to more money than the £8 billion.  There was also the subterfuge, deceit and dishonesty.</P>
    <P>Finally, on 21 October an announcement was made about the revised allocation. At that time the Government engaged in rhetoric and propaganda and said that the plan would not be altered, no revised plan would be published and everything was all right.  Yesterday, we finally learned the facts, and the Government can no longer hide on this issue &mdash; it has been found out.  The Government deliberately tried to conceal the specific adjustments as it did not want the people <Col N="2052" /> of Ballymun up in arms about their LRT project, it did not want the people of County Laois up in arms about the future of their peat fired station and it did not want the people on the Limerick-Tralee railway line to have a protest march.  It decided, therefore, to say that all was well and that the plan would be reviewed from year to year.  It has put up a stone wall of generalities to evade telling taxpayers that they will have to make up for the shortfall in funding for the projects which it still insists upon.</P>
    <P>The Government can learn some very simple lessons from this débácle.  People would not have objected if the Government had said &ldquo;The money is short, we have to revise the plan and not all of our ambitious plans can go ahead.&rdquo;  Instead of doing this, it continued to try to mislead people into thinking that we would get more money than ever before.  If one looks through the tables of the public capital programme and the supply service Estimates one will see that the money peaked in 1993 and we are now getting less money on an annual basis.  If one adds up the FEOGA money, the Structural Funds and the funding under the Leader programme, INTERREG, etc. one will see that we are now getting less money than we got previously.  If that is considered to be a wonderful achievement, the Minister is easily satisfied. There is every indication from the recent elections that the public know the score, that this is a Government without substance, a Government that can trot out any old line and hope it will be swallowed. The public now know that the Commission taught this Government a lesson, which is that one has to call a spade a spade, one has to tell it as it is. They cannot continue, as the Taoiseach would like to do, to pretend, with dismissive gestures, that £8 billion is the same as £7 billion.</P>
    <P>We will be monitoring the 12 operational programmes, when published, and the annual Public Capital Programme. We will expose the Government for each and every tax increase brought back to the genesis of this plan, each and every modification of the plan, <Col N="2053" /> because this issue will not go away and will be the underlying factor in the destruction of this Government, simply because they could not face the truth or tell it as it was to the electorate.</P>

      <P>I was one of the Opposition Leaders, together with Deputies John Bruton and De Rossa, who sought a debate on the National Development Plan.  I am extremely disappointed that neither the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Finance nor a single member of the Cabinet is here to participate in this debate.  We have never had an opportunity in this House of voting on this plan; we have had constant statements but never an opportunity to vote.  It is not good enough for this Government, and particularly the Labour Party, to continue to treat this House in the way in which they have treated us in relation to the National Development Plan.  From the very beginning, before the Government had even been formed, the manner in which the public had been deceived, first about the mythical £8 billion and subsequently on all of the detail in relation to the National Development Plan, has been a disgrace.  The plan was published in Dublin Castle even before it had been debated here.  It was launched with a great fanfare, with hundreds of people invited to hear the good news, all the members of the Government, all the junior Ministers sat on the platform smiling about the great £8 billion plan.  There is nothing the Labour Party likes more than spending money, particularly other people's, whether it be taxpayers', Euro money or borrowed money.  They all sat there, smiled, gave interview after interview, telling us about this great plan. Ever since the day that plan has fallen apart.  The £8 billion succeeded in deceiving the Tánaiste, Labour Party and wooing them into Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that very political decision the Labour Party and entire Government have made mistake after mistake in relation to the plan.  The mistake is the following: it was a mirage ever to think we had £8 billion.  From that very fact has flowed all that has followed &mdash; failure <Col N="2054" /> to tell the people the truth; failure to acknowledge the real figure.  Were it not for the Brussels-based correspondents from our national media &mdash; and I want to compliment them again today &mdash; we would not know the truth.  It was those hard-working journalists, indeed the President of the Commission himself, Mr. Jacques Delors, who informed the Irish people of the reality.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the recent elections, when the Labour Party tell us they did very well&mdash;they did not do very well; we did not do well ourselves; I am making no great issue of that &mdash; if there is any lesson to be learned, it is that we must tell the truth, we must level with the public; we must not continued the politics of constant deceit in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald &mdash; for whom I have great admiration; indeed much of the criticism levelled at her might be somewhat chauvinistic &mdash; has handled this whole issue, to put it mildly, has been very disappointing.  I would have expected more of her.  Speaking in the Seanad on 21 October 1993, volume 137, No. 12 of the Official Report, at column 1487, the Minister of State had this to say.  This was when we knew that the figure was not £8 billion.  Mr. Jacques Delors had told us, the Government were beginning to acknowledge it themselves, telling us about the <i>fourchette</i> and so on. This is what the Minister of State had to say on that occasion:</P>
    <P>The plan will not be changed in one degree, not one paragraph or a comma will be deleted and we are determined to implement it in full.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning on radio the Minister of State said there would be the juggling on the money, that they would put in extra Exchequer resources here and there to make up the shortfall in the Euro funding.  &ldquo;Juggling of the money&rdquo; was what the Minister of State spoke about yesterday morning.  Yet today she talks about value for money, about introducing legislation to ensure greater scrutiny of the expenditure of public money. <Col N="2055" /> What we need most of all is greater scrutiny of the behaviour of this Government, particularly that of the Labour Party, in relation to this overall saga.</P>
    <P>Whether the figure was £8 billion or, now, the £6 billion we will receive between 1994 and 1999 by way of Structural Funds aid, it is an enormous amount of money, the highest <i>per capita</i> within the European Union.  I have never made an issue about that because that is not the issue.  The issue is about the truth, about the reality of a plan published by the Government to which they committed themselves.  That has remained the issue ever since last summer.  I repeat, it is an enormous amount of money.  If it were expended to deal with the structural problems in our economy &mdash; the purpose for which that money is being given &mdash; to bring us up to the average income level of the European Union as a whole; for the purpose of dealing with the many problems in this economy by virtue of our population structure, our poor economic resource base, peripherality and all of the other things that go to render us one of the poorer regions of the Eurpean Union, then it could make an enormous contribution to the development of this economy in ensuing years.</P>
    <P>But I have to say that the Government do not treat the money in that fashion. They perceive it in a type of Santa Claus fashion: how can we spread the goodies around as much as possible?  How can every Cabinet Minister and junior Minister get their slice of the lolly and dish it out in their constituencies?  That is very much the attitude of the Government to this plan.  It is not a coherent plan, its proposals are not integrated and it has been criticised by many economic commentators. In fact the Economic and Social Research Institute, in its medium-term strategy report, made the point that in many respects the plan did not deal with the structural problems obtaining in our economy, that it was simply beefing up lame duck projects, which at the end of the day will not survive or really benefit from the plan.</P>
    <P>Take telecommunications.  There are <Col N="2056" /> major problems being encountered in Telecom Éireann, but pumping in £700 million of Euro money into telecommunications will not solve Telecom Éireann's fundamental problems, which are that it is grossly over-staffed, with the highest cost per line of a telecommunications service.  Telecom Éireann has been forced to reduce its international charges because it faced competition.  But rather than dealing with its fundamental problems, which it should have been forced to do by the then Government, it simply delayed action, increased the price of the service to the domestic consumer, merely delaying the evil day.  No matter how much money is pumped into Telecom Éireann, until we deal with the fundamental problem, which is that it is grossly over-staffed and unable to supply a telecommunications service to either the ordinary domestic consumer or to business at a reasonable price, we will not be dealing in any realistic way with many of the other problems facing our economy.  Telecom Éireann has £1 billion worth of debt.  Is the taxpayer going to be asked to pump in money to pay for that debt, or is it now to have what the Labour Party call a &ldquo;strategic partner&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I should love to hear the Minister talk about some of those things, or will Euro money be used merely to delay the evil day?  I have said in this House before that what happened to Aer Lingus will be nothing in comparison with what will happen to Telecom Éireann if the Government does not deal with those problems.  The position of Telecom Éireann and the aspects of the plan in relation to telecommunications are multiplied several times over in this plan. There is a failure to deal with reality, to bite the bullet in relation to many fundamental problems.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister of State talk about light rail, that there will be this line, that line and another line after the year 2000.  What we need in Dublin is an integrated public transport system.  One or two lines are useless unless the system is integrated.  For example, there is no point in travelling from, say, Dundrum, <Col N="2057" /> to a point in the city leading nowhere.  If the system is not integrated it is almost a waste of money having any line.  The system must be fully integrated in one full package.  A little bit here and there is not the manner in which to provide an integrated public transport system for this city.  We would be better to do one job right than pursue several different projects and half do them.  That is what I call the half-baked solution of this Government.  We will have half a motorway, half a light rail system, no doubt half a sewage treatment plant, half of the money injected into education and human resources.  Everything is half-baked; it is a half-baked plan.  The Government should have gone back to the drawing board when it knew the reality and produced a fully-baked, coherent, integrated plan.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 19 and 20 April and on other dates when the Community Support Framework would be agreed and published. I was told it was with the Commission and would be published shortly. Last evening, Commissioner Millan told us the truth.  He said the Government only sent them back some final figures on Tuesday of this week.  How could they finalise the Community Support Framework? The Portuguese Community Support Framework was finalised months ago.  In her contribution today the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>The facts of the matter are that the process of finalising the Community Support Framework proved more time-consuming than either the Irish authorities or the Commission services had expected.  As Commissioner Millan has also pointed out, this was a situation unique to Ireland...</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister meant to say &ldquo;not unique to Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>She is right, it was virtually unique to Ireland because on 1 March 1994 in reply to Private Notice <Col N="2058" /> Questions in relation to the plan the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>There is no delay in the discussions on the Community Support Framework. At this stage only one Community Support Framwork, that for Portugal, has been approved.  In that case the development plan was submitted in July 1993.  The discussions on the Irish Community Support Framework are well advanced by reference to progress on the Community Support Frameworks generally, and I expect them to be concluded over the next month or so.</P>
      <P>A month or so ago would have been March or April.  They were not concluded because there was an election.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there was an election the people were not entitled to be told the truth.  The Government did not send back figures because they did not want the plan to be concluded.  The 45-page Fianna Fáil manifesto devoted half a page to the plan, a plan which was supposed to be a miracle to solve every problem.  The plan was hardly referred to in the course of the election.  Government representative after Government representative kept telling us there was no delay.  We were not told the truth until Commissioner Millan appeared on our television screens last evening.  It is not good enough for a party who tells us it wants to put trust into politics and justice into economics.  It wants to reform the Dáil, involve the Oireachtas and have more openness and transparency, all of which are quotations from the Programme for Partnership Government, and yet the manner in which this House and the public at large have been deceived by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State in relation to the National Development Plan makes it clear to me that they are not interested in telling the truth and in levelling with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the Government faces reality in <Col N="2059" /> relation to the plan, accepts the reality of the figures and accepts that it must tell the truth this plan will be a nightmare for this Government.  It will not go away, much as the Minister of State may wish it.  The Government should have had the decency, the honour and the integrity to withdraw the plan and redraft it to meet the targets indicated by the Commission. A plan to spend £20 billion cannot be built on £1 billion less.  That is £1 billion less from EU funding and if there are to be matching funds from the Exchequer, the plan is effectively reduced by £2 billion. Funds for some of the projects were to be matched almost pound for pound. The only way to make up that money is from the taxpayer.  Deputy Yates referred to this and I agree with him.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 billion is a huge sum of money.  In terms of taxation it could reduce income tax by 25 per cent or reduce employees' and employers' PRSI by 40 per cent.  Either of those decisions would make an enormous impact on the unemployment level.  It would give people an incentive to work and to offer employment.  PRSI is a major disincentive to employment.  We have the most anti-work income tax system of all the OECD countries.  Instead of being used to slash income tax, that £1 billion in increased revenue will be used to cover up the cracks in the National Development Plan to bail the Government out because it will not tell the truth and will not admit to its mistakes.</P>
    <P>Everyone in politics makes mistakes. It takes good politicians to admit to their mistakes.  If politicians do not admit to their mistakes and continue with this mirage, at the next election, whenever it may be, the handling of the National Development Plan and the failure to level with the public will be as big an issue as in the election last week.  The Government's failure to deal with it will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that I have to address these matters to the Minister of State because she is an honourable and decent person.  I have been a Minister of State and I am aware that Minister of <Col N="2060" /> State are rolled out when the news is bad. If the news was good this morning the Taoiseach would tell us about it.  He led the debate last October.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was sent in when there was trouble over the figures following the night of the long <i>fourchette.</i> Now when we are in further trouble the Minister of State has been sent in tell us the news.  When we get the money and are spending it no doubt the Minister for Finance and the other Ministers will make the announcements and attend &ldquo;turning the sod&rdquo; ceremonies in Tallaght to which Deputy Rabbitte and I are continually invited.  I did not attend the last ceremony.  It is pathetic to be invited to another sod turning ceremony when the money is not available.  We still do not know who will pay for the Tallaght hospital.  From where will the money come?  When the hospital is built we will not be able to open it because there will not be sufficient money.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State some specific questions.  What is the position on human resources allocation in the plan? The sum of £3 billion was to be spent on training, education and giving opportunities to unemployed people.  What is the precise position in relation to sewage treatment plants, not only in Dublin, and the environmental programmes, on which I have read various announcements in the past week?  I note in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the allocation for education is to be cut by 6.5 per cent.  What areas of education will be affected?  In relation to Tallaght hospital, where will the balance of funding come from?  Will it come from the Exchequer and, if so, when?  I ask the Minister to respond to my query on light rail.  A light rail system must be integrated.  If you come from Dundrum and disembark at a particular point you should be able to continue on by light rail to Finglas.  If you cannot do that people will not use the system and it will be a waste of public money.  We have got to make a choice which must be light rail and we must endeavour to fully develop light rail rather than have half a light rail system, half a sewage treatment plant, half a <Col N="2061" /> hospital, half an educational programme and so on.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we will not have an opportunity today to vote on this issue.  The statements being made here could be made anywhere.  Statements are useless. The purpose of parliamentary debate is to amend, vote and pass judgment on issues because we represent the public. We cannot pass judgment and we cannot vote.  We may as well speak out on the street or hand out scripts to the newspapers. It is a farce, a disgrace.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Party does not begin to change the manner in which things are done in this House there will be fewer people voting at subsequent elections.  It is a pity that a Government with such a large majority treats parliamentary democracy in the way the Government treats this House and the public at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go back a little further, in terms of the genesis of this sorry mess, and quote from the charter of this partnership Government. The relevant paragraph states that &ldquo;the main priorities of the new Government will be to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels; by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Harney, I cannot look the Minister of State in the eye and say the things that I would like to say because I have some regard for her personally; but it is sad after less than 18 months that the high flown rhetoric and aspirations of openness, transparency, trust, accountability and all of the other items that Ruairí and Mervyn put into the programme in the run up to that happy Christmas for the Labour Party have already faded before our very eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance ought to be left holding the baby.  This is a national development plan to transform Ireland, as the Taoiseach told us when launching it; yet, neither the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, nor one single member of <Col N="2062" /> the Cabinet or either of the Government parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has attended this appallingly inadequate debate because of the manner in which it is structured &mdash; formal statements.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, has been sent to continue the stonewalling and the half truths about a plan which was conceived in secrecy, which has been misrepresented time after time in the House and the subject of downright deception by, I am sorry to say, the Minister of State herself, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern and the Minister for Enterprise and employment, Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand this because £4.54 billion is still a lot of money, although it does not match the figure of 13 per cent which we received in the previous round of Structural Funds. I am at a loss to understand how the Government could have contrived to get itself into such a hole in terms of its ability to construct a plan with what it sees as money from America.  I have never been able to understand how it has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the position of the Labour Party.  I am aware that the Taoiseach did not believe at Edinburgh that he would be around to pick up the pieces.  He resorted to his native instinct for snatching whatever figure came to his mind and said that he had £8 billion in the bag.  Why does the Labour Party feel it is necessary to continue to defend him? Why is it that it is always a Labour Party Minister who is sent to defend something that the Taoiseach himself botched in the closing days of the previous Government and the opening days of this one?</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates raised the issue of the effect of devaluation.  It was conveniently forgotten that we were talking about £8.6 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.  We are now talking about marginally less than £7 billion. The Government is continuing in the belief that we lost the public a long time ago, that this argument is esoteric and the public cannot understand it.  I believe the public well understand the difference between £8.6 billion and £7 billion.  With all due respect to the Minister of State, in offering lectures in mathematics to Members of the Opposition one cannot get away from the fact that in a kindergarten they understand the difference between seven and eight.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not expect to be around; he was limping towards the exit door of Irish politics at the time but this was the dowry that won the Labour maiden.  It always escapes me why the Labour Party has to defend the Taoiseach's downright misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste got himself into such a mess.  We remember the famous interview he gave on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; during which he made certain pledges, but he subsequently had to admit belatedly in the House that he was wrong and had misled us.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, denounced &ldquo;mere civil servants&rdquo; who had caused this entire mess.</P>
      <P>If this is such a major matter why is it that all the Government has offered is the Minister of State &mdash; I say this with no disrespect as I have the highest regard for her honour and personal commitment to politics &mdash; to continue the stonewalling and the attitude that something will turn up.  Somehow, due to the buoyancy which the ESRI continues to tell us about, we will be able to introduce budgets each year in which we will be able to make up the £130 million to £150 million per annum which has been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has not told us that it is the historically low interest rates in a climate of international upturn which have produced this buoyancy; it is not due to any act of domestic economic management by this Government.  The reason it is attractive for industry to invest, that people want to buy houses and domestic spending is up is, as the Minister of State is aware, that we have historically low <Col N="2064" /> interest rates.  It is patent nonsense to continue to suggest that the missing £1 billion can be made up through buoyancy and the Minister of State knows this.  I regret that she is continuing the misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney mentioned that she did not take up the invitation to attend the opening of the Tallaght Hospital for the second time.  It is just as well that she did not because, although I represent the constituency, I was not invited to where the action was taking place; I found myself in a room in the regional technical college where the words of the Minister for Health were relayed by video.  I was amazed to find that my colleague, who happens to be chairperson of the county council, was similarly given a secondary role while battling Bernie and Orla were in the front row on the site wearing rosettes.  The charade continued.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the impact would have been if the people of Tallaght and Dublin South-West knew that they were going to be £40 million short for Tallaght Regional Hospital and what the effect would have been on battling Bernie if the people of Ballymun knew that they were not going to get their rapid rail link.  I can well understand the reasons the Minister of State, like any good Minister, tried to protect her home base of Dundrum, but what about the unfortunate people of Ballymun?  What is going to happen to that project?  What would the impact have been if this was known before election day?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates is correct that it is dishonest to continue to pretend that publication was not delayed until after 9 June.  Last evening on television Bruce Millan made it perfectly clear that he was dissatisfied with the duration of the negotiations and that he only received the figures on Tuesday which allowed him to press the button for publication, although everything apart from the most minor details was agreed last April.  Not for the first time he made a frank and honest intervention in this sorry saga; he told it as it was, but in the past he was denounced out of hand by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The Minister for Enterprise <Col N="2065" /> and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said that his officials did not know what they were talking about, they were mere civil servants, but Bruce Millan has been proven to be correct and the reason the figures were not submitted before polling day is evident for any fool to see.  It is regrettable that the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her party should participate in the cover-up.  I fail to see how that can be reconciled with the charter of the partnership Government that was committed to openness, transparency, accountability, honesty, trust and so on.  The Minister of State has been an apparently enthusiastic participant in the cover-up to conceal the truth from the people, in misrepresenting the amount of money that was available and continuing to tell us that, after all, we really have not lost anything.  We had a plan constructed on the basis of £8 billion, we now must make do with £7 billion and we are told nothing will suffer.  That is a fantastic misrepresentation and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the few variations which the Minister mentioned in her speech, for example, in regard to the local development plan.  I recently raised this question with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who denied there was a hold-up in Brussels in respect of the local development plan.  It is now patently evident that there has been a hold-up.  Will the Minister tell us more in that regard than she chose to tell us in her speech?</P>
    <P>Far from the £8 billion the Taoiseach told us was in the bag, he has the Labour Party in the bag and he has them running around like a group of frightened squirrels trying to convince themselves that because Ms Bernie Malone was elected in Dublin everything is fine.  Everything is not fine.  Within ten weeks of the Taoiseach making that statement on 20 July last, on the date of the publication of the National Plan the Government had already started to slide down the slippery slope of half truths, untruths, rumours and leaks.  We were confronted with the unedifying spectacle of Government Ministers engaging in denial cloaked in <Col N="2066" /> bluster and then casting the blame for their miscalculations on commissioners, their officials and other Cohesion countries, but not necessarily in that order. At no point did a Minister stand up in this House and say they got it wrong.</P>
    <P>The Euro funds which were supposed to herald the fundamental transformation of this country and salvage the Government's reputation in the process have dwindled to the point where we will receive only £4.5 billion between now and 1999.  When Cohesion Fund receipts and the allocation for 1993 is added, it is apparent the Government has managed to mislay £1 billion along the way.</P>
    <P>The loss of £1 billion is small beer compared with the damage done to the reputation of the Government and the country in Europe.  The mendicants of Europe went to the well once too often. In the process we managed to alienate the European Commission and prejudice our chances in future negotiations.</P>
    <P>The 98-page verdict on the National Plan being produced by the Commission is a masterpiece of diplomacy, but it cannot conceal the fact that relations between the Government and the European Commission are at an all-time low. The National Plan presented last year with so much fanfare has been judged by Commission officials and found wanting. Those mere civil servants, whom the Minister, Deputy Quinn, dismissed with a wave of the hand last year have come back to haunt the Government.  They took a look at the massive spending on roads and decided that some of those roads were leading nowhere.  They took a look at the chapter on human resources schemes and asked why Structural Funds should be used to pay our domestic dole bill.  In effect, these schemes are dole by another name.</P>
    <P>When the plan was published the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald &mdash; once known as the Minister for £8 billion &mdash; said on &ldquo;Market Place&rdquo; that she did not want to see Ireland transformed into a low wage economy.  The authors of the National Plan obviously had other ideas which have been firmly vetoed by the European Commission.  Those mere civil <Col N="2067" /> servants looked at the plan's chapter on human resources for measures which would contribute towards sustainable job creation and development.  They, like Democratic Left, looked in vain, with the result that spending on many of the deadend schemes favoured by the Government will have to be drastically curtailed.</P>
    <P>When the first edition of the plan was published last year many observers had a strange sense of <i>déja vu.</i>  A series of unfulfilled promises, familiar from Fianna Fáil and Labour election literature from years gone by, unfolded.  Projects ranging from the Tallaght hospital to the Dublin light rail network, vital to the future of this country and which my party welcomes, were suddenly made possible by the Euro-bonanza.  It is unfortunate, given the Structural Funds criteria, that the Commission balked at this point.  The mere civil servants asked whether such projects would not normally be funded from the national Exchequer.  According to my sources in Brussels, this was one of the first questions asked by the Commission on receipt of the National Plan, despite repeated denials by Ministers questioned on this issue.  The Government's answer &mdash; as so often on these occasions &mdash; was the silence of injured innocence.</P>
    <P>On an interview with RTE yesterday, Regional Affairs Commissioner Bruce Millan, whom the Government cast as villain of the piece in a previous act, gave an explanation of the delay in publishing the revised version of the plan.  To anyone familiar with this Government's habits, it is an entirely plausible explanation. Commissioner Millan said the Commissioner had requested certain figures from the Government.  Those figures were not forthcoming until last Tuesday, and I am reliably informed that some figures may still be outstanding.</P>
    <P>The Structural Funds drama is merely in intermission.  We are unlikely to see the final act for some time.  The caveats entered by the European Commission come as no surprise to my party.  Last year we pointed out that the plan did not conform to the strict Structural Fund <Col N="2068" /> criteria laid down by the European Commission. We pointed out that the plan did relatively little to combat the social exclusion highlighted by the Commission, and we queried the additionality element of some of the projects.</P>

      <P>During the last round of funding Ireland received the highest allocation on a <i>per-capita</i> basis, yet we produced fewer jobs and benefited fewer people than other Objective 1 regions. The Taoiseach's national plan &mdash; even in its post-operative version &mdash; looks like being a repeat performance.  The surgery is by no means complete.  The Commission is looking for comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of many of the projects &mdash; analyses which will have to be included in the operation programmes due to be submitted by the Government. Regrettably, there is every indication that, once again, the operational programmes will be drawn up in masonic conclaves, with an eye more to the potential political spin-offs than to the real needs of local communities, the marginalised and small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national plan can still be salvaged. It is still possible for it to make a real impact not just on our economy, but on the lives of communities and individuals. However, the Government must now face up to the questions which it has evaded since the Taoiseach returned from Edinburgh making dubious claims about a promise.  We now know that there will be a £1 billion shortfall in European Union funding.  That shortfall cannot be conjured up from nowhere and Ministers must now inform this House how the gap will be plugged.  The private investment element on which the plan relied for a section of spending is as yet largely unquantified and unsourced, so it <Col N="2069" /> is possible that the shortfall will greatly exceed £1 billion.  Either the taxpayer will have to pay for the shortfall or projects will have to be dropped.  Last night the Minister for Finance ruled out any increase in taxation to pay for his miscalculations and proceeded to hint that the shortfall would be made up by increased tax proceeds resulting from economic buoyancy in the years ahead. In effect, the Minister is trusting to fate to get himself and his colleagues out of a hole of their own digging.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, I do not share the Minister's touching faith.  It is obvious that some projects will have to be dropped.  I would welcome a commitment that the Government will break with precedent and engage in full public consultation on which projects should be chopped, altered and retained.  Denial is no longer an option.  A process of consultation and full information would go some way towards ensuring that the objectives of European funding are met.</P>
    <P>I regret that the format agreed for the debate of statements has meant this is largely a hollow exercise.  If the pattern set by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance is to be followed by her Cabinet colleagues &mdash; if they even contribute to the debate &mdash; and if they continue the stonewalling that characterised the junior Minister's contribution, we will be no wiser at the end of the debate than at the beginning, except that the Minister's continued pretence in insisting that £8 billion is the same as £7 billion is a misrepresentation that children in kindergarten would not believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this discussion on the National Development Plan.  I am pleased that after due deliberation, discussion and debate we are in a position to draw down operational programmes under it.  In my area of concern, that of natural resources, we identified seven priority areas which should benefit from Structural Funds in the coming years if we are to achieve the <Col N="2070" /> following objectives.  Competitiveness is the number one priority which is critically important in the long term for our economy. We must promote the production of output of quality and diversity more in tune with the market-place and consumer needs.  We have some way to go in that area.  We must address the requirement of a greater marketing effort, including the exploitation of Ireland's clean and green image.  We must secure employment and population maintenance in rural areas.  We must also secure the necessary training, education and research and development to underpin both a competitive agriculture, food and forestry sector and wider rural community needs.</P>
      <P>The priority areas identified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are, namely, the food industry, agricultural structures, the rural environment, farm diversification and alternative farm activities, income support to supplement the chronically low income in rural and coastal areas, the natural resource area of forestry and research, development, training and advisory services. Under the Community Support Framework Deputies will be pleased to know that all those areas have been incorporated under the agreed plan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the sub-programme for the food industry the Expert Group on the Food Industry which submitted its report last year made a number of important recommendations for the development of the industry.  The overall thrust of these recommendations was to promote within the industry a sustained switch to a consumer oriented policy.  In particular the group emphasised the need to focus on building up the prepared consumer foods and food ingredients sectors for a better balance between capital and non-capital investment and for a more integrated approach towards the overall development of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of these recommendations the proposals which I put to the Commission provide for a fully integrated approach for the food industry involving all three Structural Funds.  This will take the form of a special sub-programme <Col N="2071" /> within the Industry Operational Programme through which a full range of capital, resource and development, marketing and human resource supports will be provided over the next six years.  The total cost of the sub-programme is estimated to be in the region of £670 million towards which approximately £300 million will be provided from European Union and national resources.</P>
    <P>Regarding the priority area of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is at present in negotiation with the Commission on an Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry which encompasses all those areas.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been achieved in the agricultural structures area in the present round of Structural Funds.  The Operational Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution has been particularly successful.  Under this measure, investment of over £200 million has been carried out by farmers on the provision of waste storage, winter housing for cattle and sheep and fodder storage.</P>
    <P>An independent evaluation of the programme found it has been successful in achieving its main objective of significantly reducing farmyard pollution on the participating farms.  The evaluation also acknowledged the significant contribution the programme had made to the improvement of the environment and to the preservation of Ireland's image as a quality food producer.  However, it was emphasised at the time, that substantial numbers of farmers still had not carried out necessary pollution control work and it was suggested that the reasons for non-participation were mainly financial.  With that in mind I intend to continue with this programme in the 1994-99 period and to target those farmers who need to carry out investment in this area but who can least afford to bear the high costs involved.  We must focus the greater amount of investment on smaller and less well off farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> Other aspects which have been highlighted in our programme are support measures to enable farmers to comply with the new dairy hygiene and animal welfare regulations introduced at European Union level.  They are necessary to allow farmers with small milk quotas to measure up to the stringent requirements of our co-ops and milk factories.  I aim to target the greatest assistance at the smaller producers.  Officials in my Department are also in negotiation with the Commission on the possibility of helping smaller farmers to obtain extra milk quotas.  Farmers with a small milk quota find it extremely difficult to acquire an additional milk quota and some degree of assistance would be helpful.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, I aim to secure extra funding for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  New entrants to farming deserve every possible assistance.  The objective will be to encourage the early transfer of farms to young members of the family or other young people who will be able to adapt to the challenges facing them, particularly as a result of CAP reform and the early GATT round.  That, with the early retirement scheme under CAP reform accompanying measures, should greatly improve our agricultural age structure.</P>
    <P>Our programme also contains proposals to continue aiding producer groups to enable farmers to adapt their product to market conditions and requirements of the modern consumer. On cattle breeding, we are aiming to improve cattle registration recording testing with a view to achieving improved quality of output.</P>
    <P>On our third priority area, I indicated my intention to help farmers with investment aid for pollution control.  In addition our new rural environment protection scheme under the CAP reform accompanying measures aim to establish farm practices and controlled production methods which reflect the increasing public concern about conservation, landscape protection and wider environmental problems.  Under this scheme <Col N="2073" /> generous grants are available to farmers to emphasise their role in protecting the environment.</P>

      <P>The procedures for dealing with grievances in the Permanent Defence Force are at present under review.  The matter is being considered under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  A sub-committee of the conciliation council is examining the existing grievance procedures with a view to identifying problems and assessing the options for improvements.  In this context a draft scheme for a new complaints procedure has issued to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that an external ombudsman to deal with grievances in the Force would be preferable?  In any organisation it is difficult to be both judge and jury.  Is it not time to put a new procedure in place as the present schemes have been deemed unsatisfactory particularly by PDFORRA which has made a strong case for appointing an Ombudsman?  Is the Minister of the opinion that we should be moving in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not impute any wrongdoing to the operator of the present system which has been in place for a number of years.  This is the system colloquially known as redress of wrongs. My concern about the system is that it is somewhat bureaucratised in that a wrong put into the pipeline takes some considerable time to come out at the other end.  Based on the legal principle that justice delayed is justice denied I would like to think that a solution might be provided along the lines of an ombudsman type system within the Defence Forces.  I presume it is not the present Ombudsman the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask the Minister if he would consider seeking an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman to enable him to deal with military matters.  The difficulties being experienced by ex-servicemen in relation to pensions cannot be dealt with by the Ombudsman.  Changes would be required in legislation if the Ombudsman were to deal with such matters as pensions due to retired members of the Defence Forces.  Would the Minister consider appointing an external ombudsman? Anyone other than an external ombudsman would not be much of an <Col N="2075" /> improvement on the present system.  I cannot argue that anything improper has happened up to now, but people believe there is not a workable system of redressing wrongs in place and that it is necessary to appoint an independent person to deal with queries on disciplinary, promotional and transfer matters.  It has been suggested that an ombudsman would be an appropriate person to deal with such matters, either a military ombudsman or the present Ombudsman with extended powers as is the case in many EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If a wrong cannot be redressed down the line it comes to the Minister.  However, without any sense of arrogance and without in any way trying to make little of the wrongs it sought to redress, some were so minor that ministerial time should never have been wasted in adjudicating on them.  I see merit in the introduction of some independent third party investigation to assist me in the review of grievances brought to my attention, but I do not want to pre-empt the form such an investigation element should take pending the outcome of discussions in a subcommittee set up for the purpose sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am not certain that the committee will come up with the recommendation sought by the Deputy.  What will be achieved will be an independent third party to deal with the wrongs.  The subcommittee, established in 1992, consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, a representative of RACO and PDFORRA and it was asked to produce a report for the national forum which is now the conciliation council.  The terms of reference of the subcommittee are to identify current problems in the operation of the redress of wrongs grievance system in the Permanent Defence Force and to bring forward recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if I was aware of the dissatisfaction with the present grievance procedure.  A subcommittee has been established to consider this and, as well as reviewing the current procedures, it <Col N="2076" /> will consider the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission which were that the current procedures should be examined with a view to introducing new grievance procedures; that the aim at all times should be to resolve the complaint at the earliest possible stage; that grievances should normally be outlined in writing and, where possible, indicate the corrective action sought and should be responded to in writing; that military personnel should be trained to deal with grievances; that the number of ranks through which each grievance must be processed should be reduced; that the procedure should allow for the grievance to be addressed directly through an individual's commanding officer rather than through the various NCO ranks where the individual so wishes; that consideration might be given to establishment of a grievance board consisting of a serving officer, a member of the Department of Defence and a member of the representative bodies; that the board should have authority to acquire information and, if necessary, carry out an oral investigation of the complaint and make recommendations on the complaint to the general officer commanding and that where a grievance is not resolved at or below the level of the Chief of Staff the complainant could require that it be addressed to the Minister for Defence for final decision.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result of this indepth review satisfactory grievance procedures will be in place.  That is the picture at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the new system of fishing permits, to which he refers, was approved by Ministers at the Fisheries Council on 10 June last.  The permits regulation adopted is a framework regulation which provides that, for specified fisheries, where there is a limit on access to the fishery, or a limit on the amount of fish which may be caught, fishing vessels operating in the fishery may be required to hold, in addition to their fishing licence, a special authorisation to fish: this is the fishing permit.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that fishing permits will not be automatic, nor will there be a requirement for every boat in every fishery to hold a fishing permit.  Rather, the Council of Fisheries Ministers will have to approve, on a case by case basis, the introduction of a permit system for specific fisheries.  Moreover, the Council will also have to consider the particular conditions attaching to permits in any given instance.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently indicated its support for the principle of permits, which we see as an essential element in the control of fisheries and the monitoring of fishing effort in the future.</P>
      <P>Our main concerns in the discussions on the proposal have been to ensure a strong role for the coastal or control member state in the monitoring and control of permits; to ensure that permits can be used for the control and monitoring of fishing effort on sensitive stocks and for practical reasons, and to avoid any unnecessary administrative burden, to exempt small boats from the permit obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have achieved considerable success on these aspects: the flag member state will be required to notify the relevant coastal or control member state, in advance, of the permits issued; the coastal <Col N="2078" /> or control member state will have the power to take action against a fishing vessel flying the flag of another member state which fishes in contravention of the conditions of its permit and boats less than ten metres in length, fishing in their own waters, have been exempted from the obligation to hold a permit.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a close linkage between the framework regulation for permits and the review of the Iberian Act of Accession.  It is clear that the permits regulation will be used as part of the basis for the forthcoming Commission proposals in regard to the Iberian review. For this reason, it was very important for Ireland that the framework regulation contain firm provisions in regard to control and monitoring of fishing, and this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>This decision is in line with the objectives I set out at last April's Council of Ministers meeting when the Council decided to give Spanish vessels greater access to Irish waters.  When that decision was taken I told the Council that Ireland would insist on appropriate replacement control measures being applied.  This decision on permits constitutes a significant first step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the basis of the introduction of fishing permits twofold: first, a partial, and certainly inadequate, response to the threat from the marauding Spanish fleet in the coming months and years and, second, a method of controlling the amount of fish caught?  Does the problem remain that there are too many boats fishing EU waters?  Our fishing industry is losing out due to the failure of the Fisheries Council to deal with this basic problem.  What progress is the Minister making at EU level to ensure that some boats will be taken out?  Irish boats are not contributing to the problem and we do not have the political power at EU level to ensure that is done.  In the long term is that the only solution that will secure the future of the EU, particularly the Irish fishing industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a detailed response to the Deputy's question.  The <Col N="2079" /> permits regulation adopted is a framework regulation.  This is the beginning of a process which I undertook to put in place between now and December on the control, regulation and conservation of our fish stocks.  I seek to achieve control by the coastal state of sensitive areas within its jurisdiction, that is an area off the south-west and west of the island, of which we would have control, along the same lines as the Shetlands principle.  The coastal state there has control over exit and entry of vessels that come within that sensitive zone.  The coastal region would have control over permits and the examination of catch and log books.  It would have total control over a given zone as designed to replace the 50 mile zone which will remain until 1 January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that boats will have to be taken out as there are too many boats fishing EU waters?  What progress is he making at EU level to ensure this is done, bearing in mind that Irish boats are not contributing to the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the day 20 per cent of the Spanish fleet will have to be taken out under the Common Fisheries Policy, the Iberian Act of Accession and the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme, but that will not solve the problem. On 1 January 1996 Portugal and Spain will have full access to our waters. What I have been seeking to achieve &mdash; I have partially succeeded in doing so &mdash; is that we would have control over sensitive areas, over the fish stocks that would be in danger from the type of fishing engaged in, particularly by the Spanish.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in response to Deputy Sheehan's parliamentary question on 5 May 1994 at the Council of Fisheries Ministers last April, the Commission presented a proposal in regard to the future of drift netting, which has the following elements: all drift netting, for tuna, salmon, and certain other species, to be phased out over a period of four years; during this four year period, nets of up to 2.5 km may be used, but their use must be reduced each year; boats which previously held the derogation to fish with nets up to 5 km may continue to do so for 1994 only.  In addition, the Commission has indicated that funding may be made available to assist fishermen who fish with drift nets to change over to an alternative method of fishing.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the proposal caused much concern among Ministers at the April Council.  In brief, Ireland's concerns were mainly as follows: first, the implementation of the measures would have the most severe implications for employment and incomes in the tuna fishery in Ireland, with particular adverse impact on the ports where the fishery is concentrated; second, the proposal to include drift netting for salmon was extremely disturbing given that this form of fishing is a long established traditional activity in Ireland and plays a key role in the economic and social life of remote coastal regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was discussed again at last week's Council of Fisheries Ministers <Col N="2081" /> meeting in Luxembourg.  The Council decided that the proposal should be examined further and decisions on the proposal would be discussed after that examination.  I am satisfied on the basis of the discussion to date that there is now no question of the Commission proposals for a total ban being adopted.  This emerging outcome will ensure no change in the regulations governing the drift net fisheries in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to press for an increase in the size of drift net allowed for tuna fisheries but, to be realistic, I would not be optimistic as to the possibilities of negotiating an increase from 2.5 km to 5 km.  The Americans and others are conducting a huge lobby on cetaceans, dolphins and other such fish, which are caught in the tuna fishermen's nets and this applies to the fisheries where the Castletownbere fishermen operate. There is no scientific evidence to date, however, to prove that the type of activity engaged in by the 18 boats from Castletownbere is doing any damage to the tuna fishery and that is why I am continuing on their behalf to resist the proposal.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for securing the 2.5 km limit, will he say what progress he expects to make on increasing this limit? Is he aware that unless the limit is increased somewhat there will be no future for Irish fishermen in the tuna industry?  As he has conceded, there is no evidence to indicate that this type of fishing is causing environmental difficulties. The Minister should be pressing strongly for an increase to 5 km in the length of nets allowed.  It appears that we are not comparing like with like because nets in the Pacific are ten or 20 times <Col N="2082" /> longer than Irish nets and they are definitely causing environmental difficulties. There is no problem with Irish nets and there is scope for increasing their length without causing environmental difficulties.  Does the Minister expect to make progress in achieving an increase in the length of nets at the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>To be frank &mdash; sometimes frankness does not pay in politics &mdash; I do not expect to make progress in having the lengths of nets increased to 5 km.  As the Deputy may be aware at the Council meeting in April I spent two and a half hours arguing with my colleague, the French Minister.  He had succeeded in getting derogation to 5 km which was subsequently suspended and he had to tell the fishing industry they could no longer fish with nets 5 km long. He had a huge problem.  I argued our case strenuously and, as a result, succeeded in containing the length at 2.5 km.  Again at a meeting in Luxembourg on Friday we had to argue our position strenuously and I believe we succeeded in maintaining the length of net at 2.5 km which is not satisfactory from the point of view of Castletownbere fishermen.  That fishery generates an income of £2.45 million and employs 144 people and the situation is very serious for them.  The evil day has been put off and the decision to abolish nets of 2.5 km has been put back indefinitely, I would like to think.</P>
      <P>I understand that BIM made available £250,000 to examine the possibility of alternative methods of fishing tuna &mdash; the Spanish do it by long line and that is why they are so anti-net fishing, as Deputy McGinley appreciates.  They are very pious about it and are strongly opposed to net fishing for tuna.  They are so pious one would think one was listening to a saint whereas their fishing methods around Ireland and elsewhere could be compared to piracy.  Sin cheist eile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on that is well known.  We are a peacekeeping nation, we have a moral role to play with the United Nations as a small island nation on the periphery of Europe.  Our voice is respected because of the fact that we have been involved in peacekeeping since 1958.  We are committed to an international role in regard to peacekeeping and I believe that a nation of our size&mdash; keeping account of our basic philosophies in regard to the areas of defence, security and so on&mdash;should be concerned with matters of a peacekeeping nature rather than peace enforcement.  In other words, we should be non-aggressive.  We do not have a colonial history and we are respected worldwide because of the courageous and urgent manner in which we have conducted ourselves on behalf of the international community, through <Col N="2085" /> the United Nations, in the peacekeeping context.  I am sure the Deputy can never see Ireland going to war.  That should not be our role in the world.  We should try to ensure that peace breaks out and whether we should put guns to our shoulders in pursuit of that objective is a matter of opinion.  I do not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point of view that establishment should be in the region of 18,000 but an efficiency audit group examination of the Defence Forces is ongoing.  An in-depth analysis of the role of the Defence Forces is taking place in the climate of current needs and requirements. I do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of the efficiency audit group.  On the contrary, this group was set up by the Taoiseach and the group will report to him in due course.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach and his officials will closely scrutinise the observations of that group of individuals.</P>
      <P>Years ago the establishment was 18,000.  It is now down to 13,000.  We have to examine the role of the Defence Forces in the context of modern requirements. There is no question that modern requirements are demanding.  Our role in peacekeeping is spread over many locations.  There are 832 members of the permanent Defence Forces serving overseas in various locations including Lebanon, Somalia, Cyprus, the Middle East, former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Iraq, Western Sahara, Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have personnel at the United Nations in New York, the CSCE in Vienna and the CSCE in Georgia.  We also have the problem of the Border and our role as facilitators in aid of the civil power, namely, the Garda Síochána.  Taking account of all of those, the Defence Forces have a lot on their hands, not to mention the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Minister's final comment that the Defence Forces have a lot in their hands. If one were to concede that the present levels are even reasonably adequate, and if we respond favourably&mdash;as we have done previously &mdash; to requests for peace-keeping or peace enforcement troops, could the State be put at some security risk?  If troops are to be sent abroad, they must be taken off duties here.  The Minister has already outlined the many important tasks that are being performed within the State, and if troops are to be sent abroad while the levels are so low, <Col N="2087" /> would that not create internal security problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an induction of 500 personnel into the Defence Forces in the recent past.  I would like to continue recruiting people into the Defence Forces while I hold this portfolio.  It would be my intention to await the findings of the efficiency audit group.  It would know my views in relation to the need to maintain an efficient, strong, well prepared group of people, whether they be in the Army, the Naval Services or the Air Corps.  The Air Corps sea and air rescue service has done heroic work and continues to do so.  The Naval Service carries out tremendous work in fisheries protection and I have already referred to the aid to the civil power, the Garda Síochána.  The war against drugs trafficking continues apace.  These are all areas, where we want an efficient and mobile Army, Naval Service and Air Corps and I believe we have that. However, we must await the findings of the efficiency audit group and take whatever action may be necessary in the context of their deliberations.</P>

Competitions for the award of cadetships <Col N="2088" /> in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps were advertised recently in the national newspapers.  The closing date for the receipt of completed applications was Friday, 27 May 1994.  The number of appointments to be made has not been finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a way into the Defence Forces for graduates but my question related to the possibility of a specific competition being set up for graduates.  The point has been made to me that people are recruited via the cadet system and many of those people will have to spend two, three or four of their most formative years at college.  It would make sense from an Army point of view to have a specific recruitment programme for graduates who would enter the Army at 21 years of age.  Some cadets leave the Army at an early age to take up better employment but graduates who respond positively to such a competition would be more likely to remain and have a full Army career.</P>

      <P>A board which recently examined the question of married quarters in the Defence Forces, including the condition and grading of such quarters, has furnished a report in the matter. Examination of the board's report by the Department is currently in progress and the recommendations therein are being considered with a view to formulating departmental policy concerning married quarters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hundred and eighty-five other ranks married quarters have been sold in recent years to the occupants on very favourable terms and consideration is being given to the sale of a number of remaining quarters located outside of barracks on terms in line with the current local authority tenant purchase scheme. It is recognised that the remaining holding of quarters should be maintained to an adequate standard and in this regard the Army Corps of Engineers inspect married quarters and carry out renovation work as may be required within the resources available to them for that purpose.  Major renovations have been carried out in recent years to married quarters in the Curragh and in Collins <Col N="2090" /> Barracks, Cork and provision has been made in the current year's Estimates for Defence in respect of certain improvements to married quarters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the board which reported on married quarters was also to look at the promotion of home ownership among married personnel and the role of local authorities in the provision of accommodation, bearing in mind that married personnel are entitled to go on housing lists in the same way as other citizens in local authority areas.  Did the board address those aspects and what conclusions did they arrive at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation of the board in this regard is being examined. Approximately 200 other ranks married quarters located outside barracks were offered for sale to the occupants in 1988 at concessionary prices. Some 185 of these houses have been sold to date.  The Department is offering the remaining quarters for sale as they become vacant on a first option basis to members of the permanent Defence Forces at a price advised by the valuation commissioner.  In addition there are proposals to sell five other ranks married quarters to the occupants at the Coastguard Station, Crosshaven, County Cork and 12 other quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, under the terms of the recently introduced local authority tenant purchase scheme.  There is a proposal in the Programme for Government to improve living accommodation for members of the Defence Forces and their families.  As far as married quarters are concerned there are approximately 325 soldiers' married quarters and 59 officers' married quarters still in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Quartermaster General set up a board to examine married quarters in the Defence Forces.  Its terms of reference included the condition and grading of these quarters.  Examination by the Department of the board's report is currently in progress and the recommendations therein are being considered with a view to formulating departmental <Col N="2091" /> policy in the matter.  Their terms of reference were extended to incorporate examination of increased home ownership by members of the Defence Forces and examining how local authorities could meet the housing needs of military personnel in the context of the plan for social housing on the public capital programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if any recommendations had been made regarding how Army personnel might be encouraged to become home owners as distinct from buying existing militaryowned accommodation.  As regards single accommodation, I understand there is considerable concern about the standard of accommodation in barracks, the large number of personnel who have to share a small number of toilets and showers, the condition of floor coverings and so on.  Have these complaints been adequately addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable improvements have been made in the living accommodation, but visiting barracks around the country I saw accommodation which would be a source of embarrassment to any Minister or Government or anyone who had a feeling for the need for people to be properly accommodated. As regards the nucleus of the Deputy's question, which is what measures the board has examined to encourage a higher degree of home ownership by members of the Defence Forces, recommendations in this regard are being examined.  The board has reported to the Department which is considering the report with a view to forming policy in light of the recommendations contained in it.  If I might anticipate the Deputy's next supplementary question, the report will not be published.  I understand it is not the practice to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's capacity to foresee my next supplementary and I also appreciate his reply.  As regards single accommodation and bearing in mind his statement that <Col N="2092" /> he has seen accommodation he would be embarrassed to let others see, will the Minister indicate what steps have been taken to upgrade it and provide adequate and decent accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The upgrading of accommodation is ongoing.  The following improvement works are proposed: the replacement of windows in the married quarters in O'Higgins's Terrace, Curragh Camp, at a cost of £150,000 and the internal painting of the M Block in the married quarters at Columb Barracks, Mullingar, at a cost of £10,000, giving a total of £160,000.  I appreciate this is a small figure but it is an earnest of the intention of the Defence Forces to improve sub-standard accommodation. Approximately £250,000 has been spent on specific improvements to married quarters since 1990.  However, the Quartermaster General must have regard to an overall list of priorities, which includes married quarters, and define his requirements within available resources. If adequate resources were available all the things the Deputy and I want would be done in the morning but, unfortunately, from time to time we are strapped in terms of the things we want to do.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to disclose details regarding the purchase of equipment of this type.  For the information of the House, however, I can state <Col N="2093" /> that a small quantity of anti-personnel mines, most of which were of a non-explosive type, was acquired once in the past five years.  Their availability to the Defence Forces for training and familiarisation is essential in the context of overseas duties with the United Nations where military personnel may be called upon to locate and render harmless anti-personnel or other types of mines.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to bring forward proposals for a more effective system of inspection of sea traffic passing through our offshore waters, especially in view of the high volume of such traffic and the views expressed at the international meeting of maritime authorities in Dublin that random port inspections had failed to reduce the casualty rate at sea due to the use of flags of convenience.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspection of ships to ensure compliance with internationally agreed standards, and which is known as Port State Control, is the first line of defence against casualties and pollution. It will continue to be so until international standards are properly and consistently applied by all flag States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the case that no system of Port State Control can be fully effective without co-operation between states of a particular region.  International safety <Col N="2094" /> conventions provide the basis for such inspections, but the key framework is the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control which has been in operation since 1982.  This is an agreement between Ireland and 14 other European countries as well as Canada.  Its function is to operate as a harmonised and co-ordinated system of inspection by the Port States and to target and identify deficiencies.  It is estimated that about 80 per cent of ships entering Paris MOU ports are inspected at least once a year. The most recent annual report shows that over 45 per cent of the nearly 15,000 inspections carried out in 1992 revealed deficiencies of varying degrees.  Some 5 per cent were so deficient they had to be detained.</P>
    <P>European Port State Control has undoubtedly been an effective weapon in our efforts to tackle the global problem of sub-standard shipping.  It has its limitations, however, and there is general agreement among members that the system needs to be strengthened and extended.  A Ministerial Conference on Port State Control will be held in Copenhagen next September to agree improvements to the system.  Ireland is fully supportive of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>In addition, the EU is also working on proposals to improve enforcement of many of the existing practices of Port State Control.  I agree that better enforcement is vital if Port State Control is to be more effective and Ireland is actively involved in the work now underway to bring the EU proposals to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and wish him well in his efforts to tighten up the inspection system of vessels.  Will he agree that measures to deal with ships which fly a flag of convenience is one of the basic ways of tackling this problem?  Experience has shown that vessels which have gone aground or sunk with very high casualties or created major environmental damage have been operated by crews who were not trained, extremely badly paid and could not understand each other because they came from different countries and <Col N="2095" /> did not speak the same language.  Until we tackle the issue whereby ships sail under a flag of convenience &mdash; this is used by major shipping companies to employ cheap labour&mdash;we have little hope of coming to grips with this awful problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this matter needs to be tackled.  We became a party to the Paris Memorandum on Understanding on Port State Control in 1982 with 14 other European countries as well as Canada.  The Deputy asked if we target ships which fly a flag of convenience. Under the Memorandum all Port States pay special attention to ships of specified flags which have a poor safety record. Last year Ireland inspected 82 such ships, of which more than 70 per cent were found to have deficiencies.  Targeting specified flag states for inspection is a major recent development.  As the Deputy correctly said, it recognises that failings may lie not only with the operators of the sub-standard ship but also with the supervision and control exercised by her flag State.</P>
      <P>Some months ago Ireland was represented at an International Maritime Organisation conference by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  It was revealed at the conference that the standard of personnel on some of the ships which fly a flag of convenience are so badly trained they cannot even be integrated on board the ship&mdash;they come from different countries, are, through no fault of theirs, badly trained and cannot speak the same language.  This shows the seriousness of the matter.  The problems continue to exist but we, with other countries, are attempting to resolve them.  It will be some time before the matter is finally resolved.</P>

      <Quest>the proposed functions of the Loran C mast at Loop Head, County Clare; if he can give an assurance that the mast will not be used for military purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Loran C is a land-based radio navigation system used extensively throughout the world.  The Loran C system in North Western Europe is being expanded, under an International Agreement signed by Ireland and five other North Atlantic Governments in 1992. The purpose is to ensure the availability of an independent cost-effective system as a land-based alternative to the US military satellite global positioning system, GPS. It will significantly improve the safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment in North-West Europe generally and in Irish waters in particular.</P>
      <P>The International Agreement was primarily designed to ensure the availability of an independent European-controlled radio navigation system for civilian and commercial use.  The Irish Loran C facility will be Irish-owned and will be operated and controlled by the Commissioners of Irish Lights on behalf of the Irish authorities.  While planning permission for the mast was not statutorily required, I requested the Commissioners of Irish Lights to apply for planning permission so that all relevant issues could be openly examined and debated through the mechanism of the planning process.</P>
      <P>Planning permission to erect the proposed Loran C mast near Loop Head was refused by the planning authority and the Commissioners of Irish Lights have appealed that decision to An Bord Pleanála.  I understand that an oral hearing will be held in Ennis on 28 June 1994.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Is it the intention to comply with the final decision of the planning authorities, given that it was not necessary to apply for planning permission? Will the Minister comment on the claim that Loran C is capable of and may be used for military purposes, which may infringe on the policy of successive Irish Governments of non-involvement with military alliances of one kind or another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2097" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Department will comply with the law.  Presumably, if the decision goes against Loran C under the provisions of the planning Acts and if there is a further avenue open, again within the law, that would have to be examined.  On the question of military or non-military use, Loran C can be used by anybody who purchases a receiver which I understand can cost from as little as a few hundred pounds.  Naturally all ships, commercial, pleasure or naval, will use Loran C if they buy a receiver.  Incidentally, that is equally true of the existing Decca system operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As far as we are concerned, we will not engage in the use of Loran C, if it ever comes into being, as a navigational system here.  I give the House an undertaking that we certainly will not be involved in its usage within a military context but for civilian purposes only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there has been considerable disruption on Community markets for more than a year now.  During that time, Ireland has consistently pushed for strong measures to tackle the problems arising.</P>
      <P>In particular, I have pushed strongly for the introduction and retention of minimum import prices for as long as their need is demonstrated.  I have also supported strongly the adoption of regulations governing the activities of third country vessels which land and directly market their catches at Community ports.  These regulations, which provide for minimum standards in relation to health, hygiene and price control, were adopted by the Council at its meeting on 12 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> Other measures which I have suggested include the operation of Community preference in respect of imports, the satisfactory operation of reporting rules, financial assistance for the promotion of the species most affected by the crisis in the market and the reintroduction of the export refund mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Commission is in the process of preparing a full analysis and report on the situation, outlining the market problems involved, their causes and possible solutions. Ireland has made a full input into this process and continues to push for action to ensure the maximum possible stability in prices for Irish fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the Community preference, is the Minister confident that that type of proposal will be allowed under the terms of the GATT regime which, obviously, would entail a lengthy debate?  Does the Minister hope to be able to push through some type of Community preference proposals notwithstanding the GATT Agreement? Second, should it not prove possible to make reasonable progress in that regard will we reach a position in which there will be dumping of fish on European Union markets, totally below prevailing market prices from outside the European Union?  Can we do anything to ensure that we could respond to the inordinate pressure that would place on the industry at EU level &mdash; I suppose we must think of our fishermen first &mdash; to that grave threat which could put many people in the fisheries industry out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bradford.  I have been attempting, with the awakening support of other European colleagues, to maintain minimum prices.  As the Deputy will be aware, I achieved some success in this regard with the co-operation of Commissioner Palleo Krassis in the not too distant past.  I intend to pursue that particular path.  The Deputy is correct, there has been a serious erosion of the efforts to maintain price levels within the Community by virtue of the intrusion of third countries <Col N="2099" /> that have been, as the Deputy said, dumping fish into the Community.  We will continue to press for the maintenance of minimum prices on the one hand and Community preferences on the other.  A weak effort has been made in regard to Community preferences and I am not certain they are achievable in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that I take a very grave view of any interference with the lawful activities of Irish fishermen.  Close liaison is maintained between the Department and the Navy in mounting preventative patrols in areas of contention. The Department of the Marine investigates all incidents of alleged harassment reported to it and receives reports from the Naval Service.  Signed statements outlining the nature of the incidents are sought and if the Department believes that there have been malicious or dangerous actions a strong formal complaint is conveyed <i>via</i> the Department of Foreign Affairs to the flag State of the vessels involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, however, the alleged incidents were in the hours of darkness, making identification of the vessel or vessels <Col N="2100" /> involved difficult or impossible.  On other occasions there have been allegations that foreign vessels have trawled through the gear of Irish boats engaged in gill-netting, one such being the incident to which Deputy Ahearn referred. In some instances, however, nets have been damaged while unattended and it has been impossible to know whether the damage was the result of accidental or deliberate action or which vessel might have been responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate the absolute importance of hard evidence in such cases.  Where such evidence exists, the matter will be pursued to the utmost. In a number of cases the Navy boarded foreign vessels and took statements from the skippers but there has been insufficient evidence to warrant their detention.</P>
    <P>I have consistently expressed deep concern to ministerial colleagues at EU Council level and on Friday last took the opportunity of raising the latest episodes with my French opposite number at the Fisheries Council.  He indicated a willingness to take firm action against those who could be proven culpable; that is the problem &mdash; provability, culpability.</P>
    <P>At a practical level, a framework has been put in place whereby the officials in the Department have ongoing contact with the control authorities in each member state, particularly those with fishing rights in Irish waters.  Every alleged incident is reported immediately. As the Deputies will be aware from previous statements to the House, the appropriate legal form of redress in cases of collision outside our territorial waters is by way of a civil action.  Ships moving within our territorial waters are governed by the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that civil action will be a lengthy and expensive process especially when taken outside our jurisdiction?  Why was it not possible for the fishery protection vehicle to arrest the vessel which caused the havoc and take it into the jurisdiction of an Irish court?  The vessel's name and <Col N="2101" /> identity were known and there was clear evidence of damage caused.  It is rather like closing the door when the horse has bolted.  If one is trying to take this case to a court outside our jurisdiction the probability of obtaining justice is not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it is within my competence I will try to facilitate the Deputy.  I have a rather long supplementary reply but I do not want to cause tedium by reading it.  I can give the Deputy additional information afterwards and I undertake to write to him specifically in relation to the incident which, I understand, occurred on 1 June when the skipper of the Irish <i>Boy Evin</i> alleged that a French vessel, the <i>Agora,</i> deliberately towed through his gear causing damage to the nets which will cost £2,000 to repair.  The <i>Agora</i> was boarded by the Naval Service some hours later. The skipper made a statement denying the allegation &mdash; this was another difficulty &mdash; that he had not seen any marker buoys and had not been fishing in the area of the alleged incident.  The boarding officer concluded that there was not enough evidence to pursue the matter further.  The problem is we need corroborative evidence; first class evidence is by way of seeing it at first hand, or by way of video, if that evidence is acceptable to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal position in relation to interference is that collisions at sea are governed by the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972.  The latter are implemented internationally on a uniform basis as enshrined in the Collision Regulations (Ships and Watercraft on the Water) Order, 1984.  The regulations apply only within Irish territorial waters.  Offences committed by foreign vessels outside our jurisdiction are dealt with by informing the relevant flag State and asking that appropriate action be taken &mdash; which I did in this instance &mdash; and that the results of the action be communicated to me in due course.  Where the identity of the offending boat is known, initiation of proceedings under civil law is the appropriate <Col N="2102" /> means of redress.  The Department of Foreign Affairs may be able to assist in tracing the owners of the foreign registered vessel.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the application of the collision regulations, in so far as breaches by foreign vessels within our jurisdiction are concerned, is that initiation of legal proceedings requires that a summons be served on the master or on the owner or his agent within our jurisdiction.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this has proved impossible in most cases.  This is a serious matter.  There is a strong principle on the high seas that you must be allowed to pass and repass in freedom and allowed to get on with the business of pursuing your livelihood without interference.  I take exception to what happened to the <i>Boy Evin.</i>  If other cases are brought to my attention I will make representations at the highest level.  I undertake to do everything I can to ensure that Irish fishermen are allowed to fish in safety and freedom without interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that our case is weakened considerably by the fact that Ireland has not signed the International Law of the Sea Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with that Convention.  Sometimes the law, national or international, can be an ass. It is a matter of evidence in my opinion and in that of people more competent in this area than I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is consensus in the House on the potential seriousness of such incidents at sea.  I know the Minister and the Department are monitoring the situation.  What support is available from the Department of Foreign Affairs when investigating such incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal section of the Department of Foreign Affairs gave advice in 1990 on international law on the relatively limited circumstances in which action can be taken against vessels engaged in harassment or dangerous navigation or manoeuvres.  Most importantly, <Col N="2103" /> under international law, ships on the high sea are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the flag State.  It is ultimately for the flag State to exercise jurisdiction over ships flying its flag.  In the event of collision or any other incident of navigation concerning a ship on the high seas, action should only be taken by the flag State or the State in which the person involved is a national.  No arrest or detention of the ship, even as a measure of investigation, may be ordered by any authorities other than those of the flag State.</P>
      <P>Intervention by Irish Navy vessels might be justified as a last resort if actions, collisions or rammings are deliberately perpetrated and could be shown to have constituted an illegal act.  That comes back to the whole evidential aspect of this problem.  Normally, the first step would be an approach through the usual diplomatic channels seeking assurances from the flag State that incidents, details of which we should furnish, would be immediately investigated and appropriate action taken.</P>
      <P>If our initial approach did not get a satisfactory response we could warn that in future we would take action to protect our nationals from the risk of serious injury or loss of life.  This would, however, present problems in proving that the flag State had clearly failed to take appropriate action against those involved.  Identification of the boats involved is essential to the pursuit of redress either through legal process or through representations to the appropriate authorities of the flag State.</P>
      <P>It is an extremely difficult problem. The advice given by the legal section of the Department of Foreign Affairs clearly outlines the difficulties involved and the difficulties for our fishermen in pursuing their livelihood with any sense of safety.  I undertake to follow up any such incidents at the highest level to ensure the safety of fishermen to pursue their livelihood without interference.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the farm installation scheme is a European Union funded scheme the aim of which is to encourage the earlier transfer of farms to young farmers.  There is at the moment no similar provision within the EU fisheries framework for an early retirement scheme for fishermen.  I am pushing strongly for the introduction of such a provision at Community level and for measures to encourage the entry to young trained fishermen to the industry.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the Council and the Commission have expressed a willingness to examine the possibility of introducing socio-economic measures including a pre-retirement scheme in the context of restructuring the Community fleet and it is expected that proposals in this regard will be brought forward before the end of the year.</P>

Two sectors are involved.  In the processing sector there are favourable financial loans and grants available to the commercial sector, backed by the Government.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal only with the industrial relations aspects of the serious problems facing TEAM Aer Lingus.  My colleague will deal with the commercial aspects.</P>
      <P>All parties are fully aware that the future of the company is in danger unless this dispute is settled.  Strenuous efforts have been made by the Labour Relations Commission to bring about a resolution. Also officials from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation met both sides last week.  Having been briefed by the officials from ICTU and IBEC on Wednesday, 8 June, the Labour Relations Commission was requested to conduct an inquiry into the dispute under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission furnished the Department with the report of its investigation on Tuesday last 14 June, stating that the submissions made by the parties did not provide a basis for a negotiated settlement.  The Government accepted the commission's proposed settlement terms that evening.  The Government has decided not to release the full report as it contains sensitive trading, financial and commercial information which was provided in confidence to the Labour Relations Commission. Copies of the settlement terms have been forwarded to the parties by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, who has also conveyed the Government's request to the parties to accept the settlement terms.</P>
      <P>The industrial relations process has been fully utilised in this dispute and it is now a matter for management and the unions to reach an agreement which will secure the company's future.  In view of the serious situation facing the company and the workers, I would again urge all parties to accept the settlement terms drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission and to give careful consideration to the implications of rejection of these proposals.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State willing to release the details of the Labour Relations Commission's report apart from any sensitive commercial information to diffuse what is becoming an extremely charged dispute?  Does she realise that the trade unions want to see the basis of the confidence expressed by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that this plan will resolve the viability issues at TEAM Aer Lingus and protect employment?  Does she agree that those who are asked to accept that the plan will do this deserve to see the basis of the confidence expressed by the Minister? Was the chairman of the Labour Party speaking on behalf of the Government when he indicated that the solution to the problem lay in the unions, management and the commission putting their approaches on the table to allow proper negotiations to proceed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>paragraph 24 of the plan states that the potential of the plans produced by the craft union group to make significant contributions to the efficiency of the organisation and the development of its business must be acknowledged and that the parties are to establish immediately a joint non-negotiating forum whose major initial task will be to examine in detail the practicalities of adoption of the plan and set a course for putting in place those strategies which can make a contribution to the future of the company.  That is not at variance with the Government decision; they are perfectly compatible.  Any ideas put forward will be carefully considered.  The Government has made a decision and it has been conveyed.  All concerned are aware that the end of the road has been reached in terms of the industrial machinery available. All the procedures have been exhausted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if the Government would consider releasing non-confidential trading and commercial information which was provided in confidence by the parties concerned to the Labour Relations Commission.  The Government <Col N="2109" /> made an explicit decision that because the plan contains valuable and potentially damaging information, it should not be publicly released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that 55 pages of a 63 page document contain confidential and sensitive material?  Surely it is possible to make available those 55 pages to the unions if she wants them to sit down and negotiate on the basis of the Labour Relations Commission's plan.  Is she aware that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said in his statement that he had asked the Labour Relations Commission to find an agreed solution to the dispute at TEAM Aer Lingus?  Is it not contradictory that the terms of the letter to the unions from the Minister, Deputy Cowen, were that the Government requested the parties to accept the settlement terms and that they should take them or leave them?  How can that be referred to as an agreed solution when there was no opportunity for anybody, either management or unions, to discuss the plan with the Labour Relations Commission?  Will the Minister not make available immediately to the unions the remaining 55 pages, or at least the 53 which do not contain sensitive information, so that they can sit down with the Labour Relations Commission and management to correct the problems which exist?  Otherwise the Minister will be presiding over the loss of 1,900 jobs in North County Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken in her remarks about negotiation. When I quoted from paragraph 24 of the plan I said that the parties were to establish immediately a joint non-negotiating forum.

      <P>I am sure they are available to everybody.  The Deputy suggested that we would be responsible for the demise of 1,900 jobs.  I wish to make it clear that we want TEAM Aer Lingus to remain a viable industry, that we want people to remain in employment.  To that end the Government decided it was necessary to proceed in a certain way. The Deputy asked how many pages of the document contained confidential, financial and trading information.  Each page of the plan impinges on different aspects in that regard and it would not be possible to publicly encapsulate one part of it without that having a bearing on another.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is not primarily an industrial dispute, but a dispute between workers and management about the survival of the company and the way it can be saved?  The unions indicated that they were prepared to accept changes in work practices and to accept redundancies but that the plan put forward originally by management and now by the Labour Relations Commission will save neither jobs nor the company.  The Government told the unions that if they do not accept the plan jobs will not be saved.  Their answer is that if they accept the plan the company will not survive. Will the Minister not agree it is time the good offices of the Labour Relations Commission were used to facilitate a meeting between unions, the management and the shareholder, namely, the Government to plan the future of the company in a manner which will save it? I do not know if any other Member was as appalled as I was to hear the Minister of State say that so far as she is concerned the Government made a decision and that is the end of the line.</P>

      <P>It may suit Opposition Deputies to adopt a certain stance but let us be honest and realistic about the facts. Exhaustive attempts have been made through the various machinery of industrial relations activity to reach an agreed solution between all sides in this dispute. In the preamble to its settlement terms for the dispute at TEAM Aer Lingus, the Labour Relations Commission said it was not possible, despite the most recent conciliation talks, to obtain a basis for the commencement of realistic negotiations and that the parties remained entrenched in their positions.  I understand that document was made available to everybody. Far from anybody seeking to wash their hands of the matter, we are making sure that TEAM Aer Lingus remains in place and viable.  If we adopted the point of view put forward by the Deputy we would merely see this as a company which is barely four years in existence, has accumulated major losses and is losing approximately £1 million a month.  We would all prefer not to have to give the harsh facts, perhaps to ignore them but this is the position and the settlement terms, which will be carried through, run in tandem with the Government decision which was conveyed by letter to the management and unions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it was Government inactivity and <Col N="2112" /> inaction over many years that contributed to the financial crisis in Aer Lingus and in TEAM Aer Lingus?  The Minister is well aware that in the run-up to the last general election politicians made promises irresponsibly about the future of various people, particularly the employees of TEAM Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus.  Everything was rosy at that time. Has the Government a view on the management of TEAM Aer Lingus and the mistakes it has made?  Is it taking action to correct personnel for the mistakes they made?  Furthermore, is the Government planning any further initiative to break the deadlock or to take the initiative itself to resolve the matter, if the management of TEAM Aer Lingus is not prepared to do so?</P>

      <P>I accept that the confidential elements of the plan cannot be brought into the public arena.  That would not be in the best interest either of the company or the workers, who I am convinced want to hold on to their jobs. We appear to have reached a deadlock in this dispute.  Will the Minister consider giving the spokespersons for TEAM Aer Lingus a confidential briefing on the totality of the plan and trust their judgment and bona fides in relation to their wish to ensure the survival of the company?  Will she take that initiative to break the deadlock so that the workers will know there is more to a rescue plan than considering the industrial relations element?  Issues that concern management &mdash; or mismanagement &mdash; will have to be taken fully into account if we are to put in place the type of plan that will ensure the company's survival and guarantee the retention of jobs.  Will the Minister give the spokespersons for <Col N="2113" /> TEAM Aer Lingus a confidential briefing on the totality of the plan?  If that broke the deadlock it would be worthwhile and I would not consider it a risk.</P>

      <P>The restructuring of the airline and TEAM are essential components of Aer Lingus's Strategy for the Future on which the survival of the Aer Lingus Group depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions in the airline, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, reached agreement with Aer Lingus management on restructuring proposals.  Despite protracted negotiations, and the availability of the services of the Labour Relations <Col N="2114" /> Commission since September last, the trade unions in TEAM could not reach a similar agreement.</P>
    <P>TEAM has a major financial crisis which, unless it is resolved now, will lead to its closure.  It is currently losing £1 million per month and has debts of £65 million.  It has run out of work and money.  TEAM is only surviving at present because its external debt is guaranteed by its parent, Aer Lingus. This cannot continue any longer.</P>
    <P>The airline, in addition to implementing agreed restructuring measures to make it viable in its own market, must also reduce its excessive burden of debt. It cannot do this if it continues to suffer the haemorrhage caused by financial subport of an unviable enterprise the size of TEAM.  Its bankers would not tolerate such a position and viability of the airline would quickly be called into question.</P>
    <P>The Government, with EU Commission approval, has committed itself to injecting £175 million, in three tranches, of scarce taxpayers' money into the Aer Lingus Group.  This commitment and payment of the second and third tranches is subject to certain conditions, including successful restructuring of the whole group.</P>
    <P>Workers in the airline have already agreed to restructuring measures.  The Government could not permit the equity to be eaten up in continued TEAM losses.  It would not be fair to the workers in the airline or to taxpayers.  The European Commission would object to payment of the second tranche if it is not convinced that the restructuring is being fully implemented.  On financial grounds, therefore, a solution to TEAM's problems must be found now, no more time is available.</P>
    <P>Because of the financial crisis facing TEAM at the threat of imminent closure with the loss of up to 2,000 jobs, my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, ten days ago asked IBEC and ICTU to call in both sides to the dispute as a matter of urgency to explore the possibility of a framework under which negotiations to secure the future of the company could resume.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> On 8 June 1994, following a briefing from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC on the position in TEAM Aer Lingus, the Minister referred the dispute to the Labour Relations Commission under the exceptional measure of section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The Minister requested both parties to defer any action which might aggravate the atmosphere for negotiations.  On 14 June 1994 the Minister received the report of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) on its investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was told by the LRC that the submissions made by the parties did not provide a basis for a negotiated settlement. The LRC, however, set out its findings and conclusions in the form of settlement terms which would address the viability of the company and the continued employment of its workforce.  The Minister brought the report to Government on the evening of 14 June.  The Government accepted the LRC's proposed settlement terms and referred the settlement terms to the parties for urgent acceptance.</P>
    <P>The company indicated that it has accepted the LRC recommendations despite the fact that it did not obtain all it had sought to achieve.</P>
    <P>I urge the unions in TEAM to do likewise. They have frequently and consistently pronounced their commitment to making TEAM a viable company.  This is the last chance to ensure that it is.  I again urge them to take it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received an answer to my straightforward question. Notwithstanding the background information, the Minister will recall that last March the unions were told an agreement had been reached on restructuring which would be painful and one which was considered final.  In the light of that, the previous impasses has more to do with the restructuring of restructuring rather than an industrial relation crisis.  Will the Minister be generous to recognise that the unions were let down last March and are afraid that if they accept <Col N="2116" /> this proposal it will not guarantee the future of the company because that was not guaranteed by the last restructuring plan?  Will the Minister recognise the legitimate and heartfelt concerns of the workers not only about their working conditions but for the company's future, and release the report?  I recognise its public release would not be to the commercial advantage of the company.  The Minister should take into his confidence the people whose jobs are at stake and put aside some time to allow them to voice their fears which are far deeper than industrial relations posturing.  This is too do with their company.  I ask the Minister to give them the time to put their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I released the history of this matter and it is now time to make a decision.  The Labour Relations Commission settlement terms state that all undisputed points of agreement reached between the parties in negotiations since December 1993 and not referred to elsewhere in these proposals should be implemented.  There was no overall agreement but the recommendation is that anything that was agreed during the course of the discussions should be implemented.  The Labour Relations Commission points out that the settlement terms, including undisputed points of agreement reached since December 1993, should be accepted by all parties. It also states that in relation to any other proposals the unions may have, these should be discussed under the auspices of a joint non-negotiating to see in what way they can further assist the viability of the company and secure its future.  I am as aware of the seriousness of the situation as any other Deputy and it does not give me any joy to emphasise that these final settlement terms must be accepted to ensure the viability of the company for the reasons I outlined.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it shows bad faith on the part of the Government, having requested both parties to defer any action that might aggravate the atmosphere for negotiations, to take the findings of an inquiry as an all or nothing solution with no briefing, no discussion, no recognition of the management miscalculation in the past and expect people to accept that? Although I appreciate the urgency, would the Minister agree that his approach may precipitate disaster in the company with a very serious industrial relations breakdown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I am not seeking to precipitate a disaster in the company.  Since I obtained this dossier I have sought, with all the authority at my command, to deal with these problems in a way which will maintain the maximum level of employment in this company in its overall and constituent terms.  The record will show that.  It is wrong to suggest that there has not been discussion, that there have not been meetings.  There have been meetings.  The Labour Relations Commission final settlement terms refer to undisputed points of agreement being incorporated as part of the settlement terms that must be implemented.  It is wrong for Deputy Bruton to suggest that this is in some way sudden.  The exceptional circumstances that have prevailed meant that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment used the referral under section 38 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the urgency of the situation.  The Labour Relations Commission outlined during the investigation that a situation never pertained where the parties gave no indication of an ability to recognise and discuss a common agenda that would lead to an agreed survival plan.  The Commission, mindful of the perilous situation of the company and with a view to maintaining the employment of the TEAM workforce and industrial peace, produced the final settlement terms.  The members of the Industrial <Col N="2118" /> Relations Commission are the experts in this area.  They have a proven track record.  Their independence is acknowledged.</P>

      <P>In all aspects.  I will answer the Deputy in a moment; I am sure he will have a question.  Anyone who questions the independence of the Labour Relations Commission is on very shaky ground.  These are the structures we have put in place.  We must acknowledge that these findings include items on which employers sought much more but did not get.  This is a balanced decision, confronting the reality that faces the company.</P>
      <P>I take no joy in contemplating what could happen if common sense does not prevail.  The Government has shown good faith in this matter by accepting these proposals.  Management is indicating that it will accept these proposals and I refuse to believe that the workers at TEAM Aer Lingus are not interested in maintaining those jobs.  I know they are and everyone must confront reality now.</P>
      <P>As to other ideas unions might have on this matter &mdash; I am sure there are many &mdash; there is within the Labour Relations Commission final settlement terms the possibility of a non-negotiating forum to further enhance viability subsequently. The experts say that these terms must be accepted if the company is to have a viable future.  We can emphasise points as we wish but those are the facts and it gives me joy to have to say that.  We must confront the reality now or we face the other prospect which it is not in anyone's interests to do.  We must accept these proposals and move forward to ensure the future viability of the company.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say who on the Labour Relations Commission is the expert on aviation?  To my knowledge the background of the Chairman is deeply in education and not aviation. Was there a change in the Labour Relations Commission brief?  The Minister <Col N="2119" /> for Enterprise and Employment said that it was under section 38 (2) of the industrial relations legislation that the Labour Relations Commission was asked to carry out this study.  That section is very specific and provides that the Commission should conduct an inquiry into the dispute and furnish a report on its findings.  Between the time those terms of reference were given to the Labour Relations Commission and the time it produced a report what was published became a settlement.  Does the Minister agree that the absolutism of his language will in no way assist in getting people back around the table?  Will he reconsider the absolutism of his letter of 14 June to Mr. Frank O'Reilly which states accept this or nothing.  At least we should give them a chance to sit down with the full facts at their fingertips and, perhaps, within the Labour Relations Commission report and settlement terms there will be a solution.  At the moment nobody is talking to anybody.</P>

      <P>As a former Minister for Labour I believe not in absolutism but in realism.  There is no absolutism on my part.  The only absolutes are that this company is losing £1 million a month, has no work and is running out of cash. The purpose of the industrial relations procedure that my colleague, the Minister of State, has outlined has been to seek common ground for the purposes of a negotiated settlement.  The reason we do not have the report that the Opposition suggest would lead to a negotiated settlement is because of the urgency of the situation.  The Labour Relations Commission listened to detailed suggestions from both sides.  They listen to such complex submissions frequently in their work to ensure we have a good industrial relations climate.  Anyone who would question their independence or their competence is on very shaky ground and, if they have any knowledge of the situation, are behaving irresponsibly.  I assure the Deputy that both sides gave a full briefing and the Labour Relations Commission has come up with settlement <Col N="2120" /> terms for acceptance by all sides on the basis that there is no common agenda and with a view to maintaining the employment of the TEAM workforce. The settlement terms do not suit all sides but, in the interests of maintaining employment, everybody should accept them.  That is the only realistic common-sense solution to this urgent and grave problem.</P>

      <P>If this company is to be saved does the Minister not recognise that all parties concerned, including himself as representative of the shareholder, must sit down with management and unions to thrash out the future of the company?  That cannot be done on the basis of diktat, or telling the workers that they will have sudden death tomorrow or a long lingering death over the next 12 months.  The workers are convinced that this plan will not save the company &mdash; their only objective is to save it.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late date, to set about putting in motion, through the good offices of the Labour Relations Commission if necessary, a round table discussion between the shareholder represented by him, management and <Col N="2121" /> unions to find a solution to this appalling problem which could result in the closure not only of TEAM Aer Lingus but of Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as interested as the Deputy and everybody in TEAM Aer Lingus in maintaining jobs there.  There have been different views for some time as to how that can be done and protracted discussions and undisputed points of disagreement in different areas.  The Labour Relations Commission is saying that final settlement terms must be implemented. It is telling workers and management to sit down in a non negotiating forum and consider further proposals that will be necessary to ensure the viability of the company.  That is the result of all the discussions, conciliation talks and submissions.</P>
      <P>The people with the expertise are requesting that everybody come to a balanced decision on this matter to maintain employment and ensure a viable future for the company.  We must consider the fundamentals of this problem, how to address it and how to implement settlement terms to solve it.  Workers and management should sit down in a non-negotiating forum and consider further issues that will have to be addressed to improve competitiveness in a very competitive environment.</P>
      <P>If there is no work for the company its viability is at stake.  No amount of discussion or points of view will solve that central problem.  The competitiveness of the enterprise must be re-established as a matter of urgency in the interests of maintaining the jobs which the Deputy and I, and every Member of this House want to preserve to the maximum extent possible.  I am trying, with all the clarity at my command, to communicate that net point and I do not do so in a contentious or confrontational way.  Independent assessors and arbitrators have asked me, on behalf of the Government, to make a commitment to provide £25 million equity, and I willingly make that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though management has not got what was sought I will have to accept this <Col N="2122" /> plan as a means of re-establishing the viability of TEAM Aer Lingus.  I understand the difficulties involved, but this is an urgent, grave problem.  The matter was referred to the Labour Relations Commission last week by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, in the public interest and in the interests of eveybody concerned with this enterprise I ask the trade unions and workers to accept the final settlement terms set out by the third parties who adjudicated on the matter and to participate in discussion with management to improve the viability of the company.  Surely at this eleventh hour that is the common-sense approach to adopt?  There are no winners and losers in this matter.  Nobody will get everything they want from the Labour Relations Commission's final settlement terms but common-sense dictates that we solve the problem in this way.</P>

      <P>I listened very carefully to a briefing today by union representatives of TEAM Aer Lingus and the one clear signal I got was that the unions remain to be convinced that the plan is comprehensive and market-based.  They are deeply suspicious that the opposite is the case.  I appeal to the Minister to try to create the conditions whereby the unions will be briefed on the main elements of the plan.  It is their company and they have a greater interest in it than anybody else.  They have given their sweat and blood to the company and it is vital that a proper survival plan is put in place to guarantee its future.  Surely it is not asking too much, and it is not impossible to create the conditions whereby a proper and acceptable briefing on the main elements of the plan could be given to the union representatives?</P>

      <P>To understand the nature of the business and the competitive marketplace in which the company must operate is fundamental to staying in business. Other issues may be discussed subsequently, but unless the fundamentals of the settlement terms are embraced the viability of the company will be in <Col N="2123" /> question.  We all have common objectives. There are no soft landings, as there were no soft landings for workers in other parts of Aer Lingus.  There are no easy options or easy solutions.  Everybody is interested in solving the problem and this plan is the common-sense way to approach the issues.  There can be no further negotiations.  The Labour Relations Commission has provided clarification in so far as it can.  Everyone understands that commercially sensitive information cannot be provided to the public to the benefit of competitors.</P>

I asked a simple question: will he meet directly with the staff representatives?  We have had protracted discussions but they have not been comprehensive.  The Minister was not at the discussions and the report has not been given, even in a confidential way, to the people most affected.  They are the people with the most expertise in the field.

There have been ongoing discussions for a long time between management and unions on day-to-day operations and agreement has been reached on some points.  The matter has been referred to the industrial relations procedure and final settlement terms have been put forward on the basis of a common agenda. We have a grave and urgent situation and this is the way forward.  We must accept these final settlement terms to maintain employment in TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The only purpose that I could serve as shareholder is to provide more money but I do not have that facility.  The Labour Relations Commission has hammered out the final settlement terms and is available to clarify matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns of the staff have been expressed here this afternoon. We are deeply concerned about the number of jobs at risk.  I would like to question the Minister on behalf of the shareholders, that is, the Irish taxpayers. How can the taxpayers be satisfied that the proposed settlement &mdash; and the terms that I have seen outlined relate to days off, meal allowances, shift work &mdash; will bring the company back to profitability? The company has a debt of £65 million and has run out of work.  There is nothing in the proposals that indicate how it will get work or how the taxpayer will recover his £65 million investment.  There is no information on the board and the management structures.  Surely Irish taxpayers are entitled to know whether the <Col N="2125" /> company will be competitive and will return to profitability.  The taxpayer, that is the shareholder, is entitled to know more than what is contained in these settlement terms.  I want to know what proposals the unions have to return the company to profitability which will guarantee the jobs in the long term.  Taxpayers are entitled to know the answers to these questions and the Minister, as our agent, should advise us on how we will recover our money and secure the 1,900 jobs.  We need to know also how the company proposes to get business, the membership of the board and the management of the company.  Instead we have spent all day talking about annual leave, superannuation, sick leave and meal allowances.  Does the Minister know what proposals management and the unions have put forward?  These are the sort of questions that would be raised at an extraordinary annual general meeting of an ordinary company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions relate to the competitiveness of the business and whether TEAM Aer Lingus can quote for work at a competitive price and that comes down to how the company is operated. The Labour Relations Commission has had full submissions from both sides as to how best that can be done.  On the operational side, it sets out the work practices and how we recognise the seasonality of the business and what is required to do the business at a competitive price.  The final settlement terms will allow us to be in that position.  The unions suggestions on the management of the company will be addressed in a non-negotiating forum.  The urgency is that the money is running out and no work is available and that problem must be addressed for the company to have a future.  As I have said already, other issues can be addressed in a non negotiating forum with workers and management participating.  However, this final settlement is a prerequisite for that to happen.  It is decision time and common sense must prevail.  I remain to be convinced that workers are not interested in maintaining their jobs, because I know <Col N="2126" /> they are.  Common sense dictates that all sides accept these final settlement terms in order to grow the business from here on out.</P>

      <P>The situation is grave and urgent.  My two questions may possibly help the situation.  First, will the Minister give a commitment that Mr. Mulvey will be available to discuss the final settlement with the unions and clarify matters for them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Any suggestions the staff of TEAM Aer Lingus have that will improve its competitiveness and ability to attract more work should be examined. In the meantime we have an urgent problem.  The company is running out of cash and out of work and that has to be addressed as a priority.  Of course, staff suggestions can be addressed by the non negotiating forum referred to in the Labour Relations Commission's final settlement terms.  The potential of these plans are acknowledged.  The final settlement terms provide the prospect of viability in the future.  The Labour Relations Commission stated last night that there can be no more negotiation but that they can clarify matters.  I would make the point that we are at the eleventh hour.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the operational programmes which will be put into effect shortly under this national plan, agriculture will continue to play a central role in the rural economy in Ireland for the forseeable future but the full exploitation of rural potential will be dependent on the degree to which we succeed in integrating agriculture into wider rural development.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan will play a vital role in this because there will be major investment available under the plan.  For example, under the current operational programme for rural development we have begun the process of encouraging the development of farm diversification and other off-farm activities for farmers and rural dwellers in general with a view to increasing the income levels of those who live in these areas. The measures to which I refer include livestock enterprises such as sport horses, deer, horticulture enterprises, agri-tourism and farm relief services, as well as a whole plethora of other good ideas and opportunities that come from the farm communities.  All of these measures are contained in our programme which, as I have already indicated, is under negotiation with the Commission at present.</P>
      <P>While on the subject of rural development, I will refer briefly to the Leader programme.  Leader has certainly captured the imagination of people living in rural areas and they feel they now have some say in the development of their local communities and how those development programmes are to be brought about.  Those of us at central level recognise that genuine local and community development will only occur at the instigation of local people, backed up where necessary by the support of official agencies.  The key point is that the ideas come from the local communities and the support comes from central authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the question of income support, it must be acknowledged that there are many small farmers who would never be able to survive on the income generated by their farm activities, especially in the handicapped areas.  It is <Col N="2159" /> for this reason that the European Union has prepared a comprehensive plan to compensate farmers who live in such areas by headage and premia payments. These compensatory payments are vital and enable farmers to remain in these areas which would otherwise become even more depopulated, leading to long term economic, social and environmental problems.  I would refer those who suggest that all farmers are extremely well off and make large incomes to the Teagasc reports on family farm incomes.  The survey of those reports shows that a number of the farmers in the severely handicapped and coastal areas depend on income supplements.  In the new round, therefore, we will continue to substantially fund this area; but in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, we will be examining it to ensure it is effectively meeting its objectives.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another natural resource area which has tremendous potential and in the programme we will continue an accelerated programme of planting.  The targets set for these forestry programmes are being achieved and in many cases exceeded.  In the coming period the main investment in the forestry area will come from the new CAP reform forestry programme but the Structural Funds will provide backup measures, especially in the training and research and development areas.  In addition, funding will be available for the timber processing sector under the operational programme for industrial development.  This is the further processing of this natural resource area in which we have a tremendous record over the past number of years. There will be accelerated development in the added value of this large natural resource.</P>
    <P>In regard to the research, training and advisory services, support measures in these areas are essential if the objectives of an effective and competitive agriculture, food, and forestry sector are to be achieved, and a special section of our proposed operational programme is devoted to this area.  Under the new programme <Col N="2160" /> considerable funds will be available for agriculture, rural development, forestry and, of course, food.</P>
    <P>We forwarded our operational programme's to the Commission in December 1993 and had lengthy discussions since then through the spring.  Our programme is being revised to take on board the various points raised in the discussions and we expect to have a revised version by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In a few weeks, therefore, we can begin implementing the valuable operational programmes to draw down this substantial amount of money and I would prefer to hear spokespersons, either inside or outside this House, making effective and constructive contributions as to how best we could spend this large amount of money under the national plan rather than continually moaning and whingeing in a begrudging manner about the amount of money we have or have not received.  This is a worthwhile plan and the programmes under it will change the face of our economy and make us internationally competitive at the production, processing and marketing level and will enable us enter the new century with a dynamic international economy at all levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue before us today is not whether the European Union has let us down in any way.  This issue is how the Government has sought to cod the people at every hand's turn in relation to his investment programme, to overplay its hand, to conceal what was happening and to create a fog around an issue that is quite simple.  The simple fact is that the Taoiseach announced he had £8 billion in the bag.  It is now clear that that was never the case.  Shortly afterwards the Tánaiste tried to doctor the figures to give the impression that the £8 billion was some way intact and he announced that he had £7.8 billion.  But how did he achieve that?  He achieved it by double counting the 1993 figures; the last year of the previous plan was brought forward to make the figures look dramatically better than they were.  The <Col N="2161" /> reality, of course, was £1 billion short of what he announced.</P>
      <P>In October, with reality beginning to dawn, the Government announced a plan with this new figure of £6.84 billion and built that into the plan for 1994-99.  But of course within ten days it was clear &mdash; and it was quite clear that the Government knew when it published the plan &mdash; that even that £6.84 billion was not intact and it had to prune £840 million off the programme.  We moved from the great announcement of £8 billion to a real figure of £6 billion.  The Government was not man enough to face up to the fact that it sought to mislead the public by puffing up the figures; it was not willing to face the scale of the money available to it.  That is why there is a lack of confidence in a programme which announces £20 billion of expenditure but no structured way in which it can be delivered.</P>
      <P>The Government sought to cod and confuse the people in the make up of the plan.  It was so eager to prove it got the balance right in the first plan that it insisted reductions would be <i>pro rata</i>&mdash; the great mantra that was quoted time and again.  The EU has rejected that approach and insisted on selective cuts. Projects have been judged predominantly in accordance with their productive merits, as rightly they should.  It decided that items such as light rail and peat fired stations would have to be reassessed, county roads would have to take second place, the Tallaght hospital project would be scaled down, FÁS schemes would be pruned back and industry would be given more money.  That is what the EU told us.</P>
      <P>Instead of the Government recognising that there were some good and bad elements and that it must cut its cloth according to the measure available, it says everything will go ahead as planned and disregards what the EU told it.  That means the good projects and bad ones will be forced ahead by the Government. Who will pay for that?  The Irish taxpayer will be expected to stump up the money for bad projects which do not pass the EU test.  That is why people are so frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> The Minister for Finance indulged in kindergarten behaviour yesterday when he announced there will be no more borrowing, no cuts in the plan and no additional taxation but still the £1 billion reduction will be accommodated.  That does not stand up.  We do not need lessons in economics to know about the folly of buoyancy answering our economic problems.  For years various Ministers for Finance thought buoyancy was the answer and I thought at this stage the Government had learned this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is the economy had the capacity to fund a period of tax reform by having £1 billion available for tax reductions.  That was the key to achieving fundamental reforms, the glittering prize.  We could have stayed within the criteria set at Maastricht and had aggressive tax reform.  As a result of the Government's pride in insisting on every line of a plan put together more for political than economic reasons the opportunity for tax reform will be thrown aside.  The Government will not be forgiven for that and despite its ability to spend large sums of money it will not gain political benefit because people will judge the cynical move behind it.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI medium-term review showed that the next five years provide a unique opportunity to undertake fundamental policy reform if we have the courage to do so.  The issue is whether the high rate of economic growth over the next five years will pass the people by, as it did in the past, without employment growth, leaving many people struggling in the backwash in the more deprived parts of our towns, cities and countries or whether we will have a policy change that will enable an enhanced economic performance.  It is clear that the Government is heading down the old road of making political choices to suit short term advantage, trying to avoid short term criticism instead of facing up to long term decisions that are selective and using money effectively.</P>
    <P>The ESRI openly criticises the Government's employment scheme as being flawed.  In its report it said <Col N="2163" /> there were still too many unsuccessful programmes and an important missing element is a focus on targeted action in initial education to prevent early failure and drop out.  That was as ringing an indictment of the programme by the Government as we could have from the ESRI and was re-echoed by the EU when it saw the proposals put forward.  Yet the Minister of State says we will have <i>pro rata</i> cuts in the programme and everything will remain intact.  That is a code for saying the Government will not face up to the reality that it has made mistakes in the way it spent money.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I attended an Estimates meeting of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I am sorry the Minister of State was not at it.  The Estimates showed that the Government is considering knocking 11 per cent off our industrial support measures and, at the same time, increasing the activities of FÁS by 25 per cent.  How could increasing employment schemes and cutting the real areas where jobs could be produced be considered a proper priority?  We spend twice as much on schemes of one kind or another as we do on the industrial base and that is not the way to secure our economic future.</P>
    <P>The Government must reassess the National Development Plan.  It was a product of its predecessor and reflects it in large measure.  That plan saw unemployment rise by 81,000 when measured on a consistent basis; 98,000 young people emigrated and our highly qualified graduates emigrated to find work. That was the reality of the last plan and the policy which underpinned it.  Those policies have not changed in the new plan.  What has changed and is boosting confidence in the economy is low interest rates.  The Government is squandering this period of low interest rates by not addressing seriously policy flaws.</P>
    <P>In the last plan there was a target set that we would double the share of exports from our indigenous sector.  It was to go from 1.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent by the mid-1990s.  However, the experience has been not just stagnation in our share of <Col N="2164" /> exports but decline.  We failed dismally to lift our indigenous industry sector.  The trade and marketing programmes failed. What do we have in the new plan?  The very same programmes and language. Nothing has changed.  If there is any change under this plan it will be because of low interest rates.</P>
    <P>In the last National Development Plan we were told there would be great emphasis on the development of small business but the number of small business industrial start-ups fell by 50 per cent &mdash; from 335 in 1988 to 168 last year, a steady decline.  No question was asked about why the policies failed.  The same policies were trotted out again &mdash; we would do great things for small businesses because that was the area where other European countries achieved growth.  No change occurred and the National Development Plan does not contain any recipe for change, which can only be brought about from fundamental policy reform, much of which must be in the area of taxation. We cannot hope to develop our service sector when an employer in that sector has to pay the Government 60p out of every pound he earns while, after all the other deductions, he is left with 3p to keep his business going.  Those are not my figures; they were compiled by people in the business.  When they have paid their VAT at 21 per cent, PRSI at 21 per cent and corporation tax at 40 per cent they are left with 3p while the Government walks out the door, so to speak, with 60p in its pocket.  That is one of the realities we are facing today.  The sooner the Government realises that tax reform is fundamental to creating jobs in the economy the better.</P>
    <P>The Commission set out for all the Governments in the EU the fundamental issues which had to be tackled if jobs were to be created.  The first step was to cut taxes on employment by 1 to 2 per cent of GDP.  The Taoiseach refused to endorse that proposal.  The second step was to upgrade investment in research and development and science and technology. The Government responded to this proposal by reducing by 33 per cent the level of Exchequer funding in <Col N="2165" /> research and technology.  It availed of the EU's willingness to support science and technology to cutback on Exchequer funding in that area.  That was as cynical a move as one could imagine.  The EU demanded that all member states should aim to allocate 3 per cent of GDP to research and development.  We do not allocate even one third of that amount to research and development, yet we are cutting back.</P>
    <P>The third step was to develop new concepts of work sharing and consider more flexible ways of working.  Once again the Government has done nothing in this area.  On a number of occasions the Minister of State has said there will be research in this area.  I would welcome such research, but it must be recognised that it is long overdue and other countries are way ahead of us in developing policies in this area.  We are still talking about commissioning research.  The Commission gave us a lead in these three areas and even though the Government is delighted to grab its money and boast that the amount is three times what it really is it will not face up to the real challenges it has set out for us.  The public realise that the Government's attitude to Europe is cynical.  This debate and the efforts made to avoid facing up to reality has confirmed for the public this cynical approach by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of work sharing, research has been compiled and the completed report must be submitted to the Department by 30 June.  We are committed to introducing in next year's budget the necessary measures for a national voluntary work sharing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment, particularly the labour section, is the national authority for the European Social Fund in Ireland.  In that capacity it has played a central role in the negotiations on the human resources elements of the Community Support Framework.  The Social Fund co-finances a broad range of training, <Col N="2166" /> education and employment programmes delivered by a range of Government Departments and agencies. The main objectives of these programmes are to cater for the skill needs of the economy and to support vocational training and employment measures which address the needs of the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, the disabled and the most disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the percentage of Structural Funds sourced from the ESF during the period to 1999 will be the same as that envisaged in the National Development Plan, 35 per cent.  This reflects the outcome of negotiations in which the Commission fully appreciated the importance the Government accords to training, education and employment initiatives.</P>
    <P>Through the negotiations, the Commission has recognised our commitment to constantly improving the quality of education and training programmes and, very importantly, it has agreed to continue to fund a full-time evaluation unit dedicated to examining the effectiveness of the human resource development intervention across all agencies and Departments.  The evaluation unit was established in January 1992 and is located in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  When the Minister and I met the Commissioner last Monday I put it to him that we wanted the evaluation unit to remain operational, if necessary to full strength in resource terms.  Both the Government and Commission anticipate that this process will continue and intensify over the period of the new Community Support Framework.  In this way we will reinforce the view in the National Development Plan that &ldquo;evaluation is becoming part of the ongoing process of the delivery of education and training programmes&rdquo;.  The Commission's agreement to fund all our education and training programmes is a reflection not only of the existing quality of provision but also of our commitment to strive after continuous improvements.  The objective of all those improvements is, of course, to ensure that the overall aims of the <Col N="2167" /> Community Support Framework are achieved and that the potential of all the participants will be fully explored and developed.  The Community Support Framework is not just about money; it is also about the proper utilisation of funding to ensure that the potential of all participants is fully developed.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiary of the ESF is FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority.  I share the interest of the European Commission in ensuring that Exchequer and EU funding is properly targeted and makes the maximum impact in facilitating job creation and job retention.  Accordingly, particular attention will be paid over the course of the CSF to assessing the effectiveness of the programmes.  The main focus of activity delivered by FÁS will be on skills training, including the training of apprentices, training for those in employment and training for the long term unemployed and disadvantaged.  A central plank of Government policy is to address the issue of unemployment, particularly long term unemployment.  It is well known that more than 40 per cent of those out of work have been unemployed for more than one year.  The community employment programme is specifically geared to cater for this group of people.  That programme will provide employment outlets for approximately 40,000 people each year.  Critically, it will seek to impart vocational skill to participants and afford them the opportunity to progress to enhanced forms of training so as to materially improve their chances of getting sustainable work.</P>
    <P>When the Minister and I met the Commissioner last Monday we referred to the range of Community initiatives as distinct from the CSF.  Deputy Bruton said he was sorry I was not present at the Estimates meeting yesterday.  I was unable to attend that meeting as I was abroad on Government business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet <Col N="2168" /> developed the ability to be in two places at one time.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Human Resources Community Initiatives scenario for 1991-94. Three such initiatives, NOW, Horizon and Euroform, were funded through the ESF under the last Community Support Framework.  The NOW initiative is focused on equality of opportunity and access for women, Horizon addresses the training and employment needs of the disabled and disadvantaged and Euroform pilots innovatory approaches to training and training methodologies, qualification systems and the identification of new employment opportunities. More than 200 projects were funded during the period 1991-94 and total expenditure was £50 million, £30 million of which came from the Social Fund.</P>
      <P>One might well ask what is the scenario for the initiatives from 1994 to 1999.  The guidelines which will be published officially before the end of June set out the broad framework for those initiatives up to the end of 1999 and can be summarised as follows: employment and development of human resources which has three distinct but interconnected strands, including promoting equal opportunities for women, called &ldquo;Employment-Now&rdquo;.  The lessons learned in the introductory stage will now be translated into the mainstream to promote equal opportunities for women under the &ldquo;Employment-Now&rdquo; scheme, to improve the employment prospects of the disabled and other disadvantaged groups under the scheme known as &ldquo;Employment-Horizon&rdquo; and the promotion of labour market integration of young people, in particular those without basic qualifications or training under the scheme known as &ldquo;Employment-Youthstart&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Employment-Youthstart&rdquo; is a new development but the other two, &ldquo;Employment-Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Employment-Horizon&rdquo; seek to build on the exploratory stage of the 1991 to 1994 process. For example, &ldquo;Employment-Now&rdquo; will help to reduce unemployment among women, improve the position of women <Col N="2169" /> already in the workforce, through the promotion of equal employment opportunities, develop innovative strategies to respond to changes in the organisation of work and changing job requirements, whereas the aims of &ldquo;Employment-Horizon&rdquo; are to improve the quality of training through the development of new employment skills and qualifications, new forms of work organisation, employment aids, support for work in the open labour market, in particular support for sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Employment-Youthstart&rdquo;, with which I am very involved in formulating policy, aims to ensure the development of the innovative and transitional dimension of the national Youthstart programmes, to assert the development of structured networks of projects and programmes to ensure the exchange of good practice and experience.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed under the three strands can be presented within four general headings &mdash; the development of appropriate training, guidance, guidance and employment systems, delivery of training, job creation and support for the start-up of small businesses and co-operatives and information dissemination and awareness actions.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with &ldquo;Adapt Initiative&rdquo; about which Deputy Richard Bruton spoke, in particular the need for training those in employment, with which I agree.  This initiative aims to accelerate the adaptation of the workforce to industrial change, increase the competitiveness of industry, services and commerce, prevent unemployment by developing the workforce through improving qualifications and their internal and external flexibility, ensuring greater occupational mobility, anticipating and accelerating the development of new jobs and activities, particularly labour-intensive ones.  The measures proposed for this initiative have been organised under four headings, supply of training, counselling and guidance; anticipation, promotion of networking and new employment opportunities; adaptation of support structures and systems <Col N="2170" /> and information, dissemination and awareness actions.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment will arrange for the dissemination of information under the new human resources community initiatives when we receive our official guidelines.  It is proposed to hold information seminars nationwide and to provide additional information to all interested parties, elaborating further, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund funding to be provided to Ireland through the Community initiatives listed has not yet been finally determined in Brussels but will be additional &mdash; I emphasise additional &mdash; to the funding contained in the Community Support Framework.  No doubt the allocation will be influenced by the impact resulting from the initiative funding and investment to date.  I am very confident that we shall score highly on those criteria. Indeed the number of community and voluntary organisations already seeking ESF support in the next round is testimony to the very positive contribution such funding makes.  These initiatives have heightened awareness of the role of the European Social Fund nationwide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton went into considerable detail on the extra money FÁS has obtained for its various programmes, particularly, community employment, although he did not mention that term specifically but spoke about schemes for the unemployed.  I reiterate &mdash; I have said this is so often here I imagine I am beginning to sound somewhat rusty, nonetheless, I hope, still interesting &mdash; that the Community Employment Programme is an amalgamation of the social employment scheme, Teamwork and CEDP.  Its precise purpose was to iron out difficulties, referred to in various journals, with the social employment scheme.  The Community Employment Programme aims to give people a longer participation on a programme of work, if that is what is required; it provides much more training in a very focused manner on specific skills needed to enhance a participant's potential and to marry that potential to the aims of the programme <Col N="2171" /> involved.  Fifty per cent of participants will continue to participate for two years and, in some local development areas, will continue for three years.  It also aims at a greater, in-depth training component within the Community Employment Programme. Much more importantly, and a point borne out by the OECD report &mdash; when the Minister for Finance chaired the meeting last week which released that report &mdash; one which immediately struck a chord with me because I have been saying so constantly, I was sometimes accused of intervening too much &mdash; is that we simply cannot have all these local development areas, programmes, community employment and others, for unemployed people if we do not match them with intensive vocational guidance, training, hand-holding and placement. There must be strong emphasis on job placement.  Indeed, the extra resources the Minister for Finance was generous enough to allocate to FÁS were for the purpose of releasing job placement officers from some of their onerous, deskbinding duties, allowing them to fulfil that very necessary job placement task. We cannot remain passive about job placement or allow the market to find its level.  Clearly, it must be a directed, proactive labour-market policy allied to market forces.  I strongly recommend the &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; approach to guidance, counselling, training and eventual job placement, to be achieved through the local area partnerships prevailing within local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will not reflect on anything the Minister of State said or did.  Many of the schemes to which she referred are very helpful for training purposes and so on.  When I last spoke on this subject when this famous <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> was unfolded in the House, I said it appeared we were about to embark on one massive FÁS scheme nationwide.  There is a grave danger in placing too much emphasis on the short term alleviation of unemployment which, serious though it is will be twice as serious if there are not long <Col N="2172" /> term proposals to resolve it.  I worry about what will happen when these now reduced billions run out, as they will. Amazingly and coincidentally they will expire towards the projected end of the term of office of the Government.  This could well mean that some other unfortunate politicians would have to pick up the pieces.  I merely cite those as my reservations about over-reliance on schemes to resolve unemployment but there my compliments end.</P>
      <P>When contributing to the debate on the introduction of this National Plan in the House last year I referred to chipping away at the wall.  While the Taoiseach referred to the plan as a window on the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I felt it was papering over old cracks, that one could clearly see underneath its deficiencies and flaws. Scarcely had the ink dried on that document before it began to fall to pieces. Quite clearly, the people in Brussels were not impressed with the Government's proposals.  What intrigued me was that the Government was very reluctant before holding the European and local elections, to disclose the full extent of the remodelling of this document.  I do not know why that should have been the case. I should have thought that a Government with a very large majority would have been anxious to display its prowess to a wider audience and indicate what this document contained before the elections. However, the Government remained coy, reticent, reluctant, shy and definitely reclusive, when it came to disclosing what the revised document contained.  Amazingly also, before the local and European elections, there was the usual series of announcements, the foundation stones of some hospitals having been laid three or four times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Group water schemes were approved with abandon; motorways and so on were approved at a rate of knots.  I was aghast, as I am sure most politicians were, especially those on this side of the House <Col N="2173" /> because we had expected that this open, honest, transparent Government would be ready and anxious to display all the good before the widest possible audience at the appropriate time i.e. before the election.  That was not the case.  I and many hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country were disappointed. A week after the European elections and before the election posters were taken down the Government has had the courage to come forward and say there has been a problem, they did not achieve the same degree of success they anticipated in Brussels.  The officials in Brussels, unlike everybody else in the country, did not think we were on the right track and we have had to revise our plans and proposals.  What has happened to all the projects in the original plan? We have been informed that the shortfall will be spread over all Departments and that it will be made up.  Will the shortfall be made up by a cut in current expenditure or by switching from capital to current expenditure over a period?  That is fine except that a price has to be paid.</P>
    <P>The peat-fired generating station was boldly announced by the Minister in good time for the European elections.  Following the announcement I was contacted by a member of the press who asked for my comments.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State opposite knows that a question has already been raised as to whether it is intended to proceed with it.  Not alone is this station highly mobile but it is elusive <Col N="2174" /> and invisible.  I am deeply disappointed with the Government of high standards in terms of transparency and willingness to be forthcoming with information.</P>
      <P>What will happen in the area of health? In the original plan a large sum was allocated to Tallaght Hospital.  The Government has indicated it will proceed.  I have no reason to disbelieve the Government. As the Government has previously indicated there would be no change in the plan, whom are we to believe?  Are we to believe what the Government told us prior to the European elections or what it is telling us now?  Are we to assume that the foundation stone which was laid several times will not be relaid in a reformed structure?  If that happens we will have serious and trenchant things to say on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>What other area of health is likely to be affected?  If a portion of the Government's plan is truncated surely there will be a knock-on effect.  In regard to all the good news the Minister for Health has given to the House during the past six months, most of which was based on a four year plan which is conterminous with the projected end of the term of office of the Government, is it intended that some future unfortunate Minister will pick up the pieces and explain to the public why we did not progress further?  For example, an extra £4 million, a small sum, was recently allocated to dental services, an area where it is urgently required.  If the Government has to make up a shortfall in this area where will it find the money to do so?  Will it erode those allocations and awards to areas such as the orthodontic services?  Will it reduce further staffing levels in hospitals, thus creating more problems for the administration of hospitals?  Will it cut back on its proposals for the mentally handicapped or for the disabled?  Will it cut back on its long term proposals for the provision of institutional care for the handicapped who do not have parents or relatives to care for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where the Government's transparency has fallen short of expectations during the past few months.  Why did the Government not come forward before <Col N="2175" /> the European elections and say it was sorry?  Their first test on coming into Government was to go to Edinburgh and subsequently to Brussels following which the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance said everything was in order and that they were getting what they expected.</P>

      <P>There are children throughout the country completing their junior certificate this week.  If those children, mine included, fail the test in the same way as the Government failed its first test it does not auger well for them during the coming years.  I am amazed that the Government expects to get away with this and that nobody should expect any retribution from it.  The blame must go to both parties in Government who are culpable in that they contributed to misleading the public.  It is against the rules to mislead the House but there is nothing wrong with misleading the public.  The Government gave a distinct impression in the House in July and December 1993 and in January 1994 that its information was accurate when it knew full well it was not.  It had information which clearly indicated there was a problem.  It would not have been a good idea to tell the public before an election. Naturally the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties, in traditional fashion, put their wise old heads together and came to the conclusion that this information should be withheld from the public, at least until after the European elections.  Perhaps they got a few extra seats.  I am sure the Fianna Fáil Party is rejoicing following its success in the European elections.  I ask whether they would have been so successful had the public known what the Government intended to do on their behalf well in advance of the European elections.  Did the candidates standing for the Government fully accept responsibility for what has happened?  When the various cuts take place will members of the Government accept full responsibility for having deluded themselves in <Col N="2176" /> the first instance and misled the rest of the country afterwards?  Do they not expect to pay a price?  If someone decides to deliberately withhold information which is crucial to the outcome until after an election is held they must expect to pay the price.</P>
      <P>I give the Government ten out of ten for having a hard neck, for withholding vital information in the run-up to a series of elections and getting away with it.  I also give the Government ten out of ten for blandly informing the people after the election that the position has changed slightly, that we will receive 12 to 13 per cent less than we expected two to three weeks ago and that there is a problem.  I give the Government no marks for failing to deliver on its promise on entering office that there would be transparency and that it would be forthright, honest and upfront.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): The level of aid achieved through the new round of Structural Funds, through the Cohesion Fund and through the Community Initiatives which are yet to come, is easily the largest block of aid ever secured by an Irish Government. Over the seven year period from 1993 to 1999, aid per head of population will amount to £2,100 in this country, compared with £1,700 in Greece, £1,650 in Portugal and £1,400 in Spain.  It is symptomatic of the Opposition that it is better at the politics of begrudgery than anything else, but this will not conceal the internal strife which characterises it and the lack of any sustainable policies of its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, with the assistance of our colleagues in Europe, has already made real and lasting progress towards greater economic and social cohesion.  In reviewing the present Community Support Framework which has been in place since 1989 we can see that substantial achievements have been recorded, with the assistance of the Community Structural Funds, in creating jobs in industry, tourism and other services, in visible improvements to our roads and other <Col N="2177" /> infrastructure, in diversification of the rural economy, in raising the skill levels of our population and in other areas.</P>
    <P>The additional Community resources available to us over the next six years, through the new Cohesion Fund and the expanded Structural Funds, provide us with a unique opportunity to make a dramatic move forward towards the goal of greater cohesion and full participation in the benefits of the single market.  This has been achieved through the unswerving commitment of the Government to maximising the share of Community resources available to us and in adopting challenging negotiating positions; and we make no apologies whatsoever for having done this.</P>
    <P>Community funding has enabled an investment of £590 million in the national primary road network in the period 1989 to 1993.  About £1.1 billion &mdash; almost twice the previous amount &mdash; will be available for this purpose in the period to 1999.  This is compelling evidence, if evidence is needed, of the successful outcome of the Structural Funds process.</P>
    <P>The next roads investment programme will build on the achievements of the current programme, the priority sections of the national primary network will continue to attract special attention. However, as so much work has been carried out on these sections, there will be a more even distribution of investment between the regions than has been the case since 1989.  In addition, special attention will be given to those national secondary routes which are of the greatest importance in providing key linkages across the country between the primary routes.</P>
    <P>The non-national roads also have major significance for economic development. Almost £450 million will be invested in these roads under the Community Support Framework.  Other State investment in non-national roads, allied to expenditure by local authorities from their own resources, will bring total investment in these roads to over £1 billion in the period to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The total investment in roads proposed <Col N="2178" /> in the National Development Plan was about £1.7 billion.  The Community Support Framework provides for expenditure of £1.65 billion over the same time span.  This will fund an entirely credible programme to modernise our road network, something a less than credible Opposition would do well to consider before it comes into this House and subjects us to a further dose of moaning in default of any achievements of its own.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for water, sanitary and other local services which was prepared in 1989 was designed to meet the needs of economic sectors and activities, particularly agriculture and food, rural development, industry, tourism, fisheries and aquaculture.  It was also influenced by service weaknesses and environmental and quality considerations which affect economic development.  Expenditure under the programme was slightly over £220 million.</P>
    <P>We sought £605 million for the new programme in the National Development Plan.  The Community Support Framework provides for investment of £604 million.  These figures speak for themselves and will permit the Government to speed up implementation of the environment action programme, which sets out our ten year investment objectives with assistance from Community funds.</P>
    <P>The principles upon which our environment action programme is founded &mdash; sustainable development, precautionary action and integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas &mdash; anticipated the shift in Community environment policy from a largely regulatory approach to a much broader strategic focus on the interaction between human activity and the environment.  In line with the objectives of the Treaty on European Union, the Structural Funds place a special emphasis on requirements for the protection and conservation of the environment and I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>Water and sanitary services, being less visible than other infrastructural projects, are too often and too easily taken for granted; but it only takes a pollution <Col N="2179" /> supplies, a lack of serviced land for new and badly needed industry, or a flooding incident to underline the crucial importance of these services.</P>
    <P>While compliance with Community requirements does involve extensive investment over the decade, it is important to look beyond the letter of the law to appreciate the significance of this investment for our economic and social wellbeing.  Environmental services build up the infrastructural capacity of the economy for the long term and help to ensure that economic activity is environmentally sound and sustainable.  More fundamentally, a clean, attractive environment is itself a basis &mdash; indeed, a precondition &mdash; for growth in several sectors, notably tourism and natural resource based industry.  Our clean image can create a competitive advantage in the promotion of food or other branded Irish products, as the Culliton report emphasised. However, we cannot take that image for granted.  If it is to have substance and reality, the right balance must be struck between environmental protection and economic development.  I am pleased to inform the House that the substantial investment secured for water and sanitary services &mdash; amounting to over £100 million a year over the period to 1999 &mdash; will allow this balance to be achieved and maintained.</P>
    <P>The built environment will also benefit from the Community Support Framework. Despite the success of the present urban renewal scheme, much work remains in revitalising the physical and economic condition of core areas of our cities and towns.  Within the local development programme, £117 million is being provided for urban renewal and this compares with £116 million sought in the National Development Plan.  Expenditure will focus on three sub-measures.</P>
    <P>First, the cultural and heritage programme for the Temple Bar area of Dublin will continue to be assisted.  This programme has already restored vibrancy to an area which has the potential for development but which needed a shot in the arm to provide the necessary <Col N="2180" /> development impetus.  The overall cost of the programme is £37 million of which the remaining £30 million or so will be provided in the plan period.</P>
    <P>There will also be a local authority urban renewal programme involving environmental upgrading and streetscape works in selected areas.  As we are all aware, the streetscape in many of our smaller towns and larger urban areas needs to be renovated and upgraded.  I welcome the fact that this will form part of the new urban renewal programme. Local authorities will contribute to this programme from their own resources and, in total, I expect that over £65 million will be provided during the remainder of the decade.  In addition, over £20 million will be dedicated to a scheme for meeting certain infrastructural requirements of small towns and villages.  All this demonstrates the constructive nature of the negotiations between our representatives and those of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework is a historic achievement of which this Government can feel justly proud.  The programmes and projects for which my Department is responsible will be only very minimally affected by the aid available in the Community Support Framework as opposed to that on which the National Development Plan was based. This is in part due to the fact that a large proportion of my Department's programmes are financed under the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are sick and tired of the puerile criticisms from the Opposition parties that the Structural Fund negotiations were not handled properly.  The truth is that we achieved more than they ever have, or ever will, and the truth hurts.  I commend the Community Support Framework as another example of the Government's success in securing real economic and social progress for all our people.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's final comment is one way of hiding the Government's inadequacies and failure to accept criticism.  It throws useless <Col N="2181" /> stones that do not hit a target.

      <P>I am bored with the saga of the missing and dwindling billions, billions that do not exist.  It reminds me of the story of the emperor with no clothes. It was only when a little boy said he did not have clothes on that everybody felt they could speak about it.  Essentially, the EU is that little boy and it has said that the Government has not had clothes for a long time, even as far back as the Edinburgh Summit when the Taoiseach returned and said it was all in the bag. It even goes back to the time of the Maastricht Treaty when the Taoiseach promised £6 billion over five years.  We in Opposition begged the Government not to allow the debate on Maastricht to revolve around the goodies we were about to get.  We wanted a debate on how we as a country could participate in the greater union of Europe and add to its culture and development instead of merely taking money from it.  However, the Taoiseach made great play of the £6 billion and many people cast their vote on the basis that we were about to receive a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>The Government should have had the wit &mdash; but neither party has shown much of that in Government &mdash; from the start to keep its mouth shut about the amount of money until it was sure it was nailed down.  What we will get in Structural Funding will amount to a great deal of money and I hope it will be put to good use.</P>

      <P>We have said that many times.  The Government made a laughing stock of us and took the intelligence of the people of this country for granted by adopting the view that because they are only ordinary common folk, it did not have to tell them the truth.  This is the approach of a Government that formed an intimate, warm and cosy partnership on the basis of openness and transparency. The saga of the National Plan and the European billions smacks of subterfuge and fudge.  It is similar to hiding a parcel where nobody can find it, a parcel which continues to change and dwindle. Its contents changed from £6 billion to £8 billion over five years and then to £7.48 billion.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said he was 100 per cent satisfied the figures would not unravel.  Thank God he was not knitting because it would have unravelled and he would have been left with a ball of wool.</P>

      <P>I am not very good at that. Every time we tried to get the truth from the Government we were accused of making political capital and damaging Ireland's reputation.  The Government did not need help in that regard; it could do that all on its own without anybody's help.  It was coping well in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1992 the Taoiseach promised £6 billion over five years; in December 1992, following the Edinburgh Summit, he said he had £8 billion in the bag over seven years.  In May and June, following devaluation, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to use Ireland's veto &mdash; they <Col N="2183" /> were getting very confident &mdash; if they did not receive £8 billion.  On 20 July 1993 the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made an announcement that we would receive £7.84 billion over seven years.  One would have thought the Government would have prepared its National Plan on the basis of that £7.84 billion, but instead it merrily went on its way and prepared it on the basis of the £8 billion the Taoiseach said was in the bag, a bag with many leaks.  On 11 October 1993 the National Plan was published in a bright green cover &mdash; about which I am sure Deputy Sargent is very pleased &mdash; and it assumed we would receive £8 billion.  We were told on 20 July by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs about his great achievement in being promised £7.84 billion, but that was not translated into the plan.  The Government adopted an attitude of &ldquo;It will be all right on the night&rdquo; and published the plan on the basis of £8 billion. It hoped people would not notice.  In October, November and December 1993, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government continued to claim that the draw-down from the Structural Funds would be not only £8 billion, but that we would get more at the mid-term review. It claimed that because we received more in the last mid-term review the same would happen this time.  However, we know that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>On 23 November 1993 the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, denied the need to adjust the National Plan to take account of what was then the real figure of £7.2 billion announced by the Commission. She said there would not be any changes to the plan and that everything in the green book was nailed down. However, we know differently today and we received all sorts of &ldquo;post-hockery&rdquo; explanations in that regard.  I heard a man on a radio programme today explain the meaning of &ldquo;weasel&rdquo; words which a journalist in America used.  He said they are a form of words one uses when one is trying to fudge an issue and does not want people to understand something. We have heard many &ldquo;weasel&rdquo; words in <Col N="2184" /> this House and outside it recently.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, stated on Question Time that we may be getting only £7.2 billion but that, like the miracle of the loaves and fishes, we will make it stretch.  She said we need £8.5 billion from the Exchequer and £3.7 billion from private industry, but that it will be all there on the night.  We know that is not true.</P>
    <P>In February 1994 the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who must have had a bad night or had a tooth, out, blamed the officials in Brussels.  The Government could have conned the people in Ireland for longer if it had not told the truth and made it known that it was examining the plan again to make it match the amount of money available.  He did not want to blame himself so he blamed Commissioner Landeburu, who said the Commission would not give us £8 billion.  In February 1994 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, denied there was any problem with the National Plan.  The Fine Gael Party was receiving information from its contacts in Brussels that the EU Commission was unhappy with some of the programmes in the plan and particularly unhappy because it involved much more money than the Commission has promised.</P>
    <P>School children would know that if they only received £50 having thought they would receive £100, and if the benefactor did not provide the shortfall of £50, the balance would have to come from somewhere else.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, who minds our money and has his hands on the Government's calculator, told us not to worry, there were no problems with the plan, he had talks with his colleagues in Brussels and everything was okay.  We know that did not happen.</P>
    <P>On 22, 23 and 24 February the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that a new plan was not required.  Essentially we have a new plan in many areas.  On 1 March 1994 the Tánaiste admitted on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the plan would have to be adjusted and programmes dropped.  He was <Col N="2185" /> quickly silenced and told that the public should not be told the truth at that stage, to let matters continue for a while longer. He said that programmes might have to be dropped and we know that the word &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; has been excised from the Government's lexicon.  Members of the Government are not allowed use that word, so they use words like rephased, rebalanced, stretched out, lengthened and all sorts of wonderful words to avoid saying they made a mistake and are sorry. They should come clean and say what projects will be implemented.  I have heard the Minister say that projects like the Dublin light rail will not be completed in the length of time proposed.  The completion of the project has been put off <i>sine die.</i>  Deputies opposite will not be in Government long enough to deliver on that project.  It will be left to the next Government to pick up the pieces.  We will be over there on those benches reminding the Deputies opposite of it.  I know the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is enjoying his ministry.  He should enjoy it because eventually the piper will have to be paid for the projects in the wonderful green book.</P>

      <P>Today we heard the EU will give only £40 million towards Tallaght hospital, but in reply to questions we have heard that the EU will give £80 million.  Therefore, £40 million will have to be found.  Where?  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, has used weasel words to say a little money will be collected here and there from another programme and the taxpayer will not have to suffer.  An increased sum from the Exchequer must be put towards the plan.  The plan was based on £8 billion but the Government will not receive that amount.  That begs the question how the extra money will be raised.  Will it be raised by the imposition of new taxes? <Col N="2186" /> The Government should indicate what proposed work will not be completed next year as funds will be needed to bolster the gaps in the programmes of the various flagship projects and the day to day education projects.  Nobody has given a satisfactory explanation as to where that money will come from.  The taxpayers will have to put up the money.</P>
      <P>This saga is one of incompetence, ineptitude, subterfuge, fudging, economy with the truth and the small word beginning with L which I cannot use.  I hope an investigative journalist is writing the story of this saga.  I have written mine. The list of dates I referred to is a chronological breakdown of the saga, but much more could be said about it.</P>
      <P>If the way in which this plan was prepared and the manner in which information was not given to the public or the House is an indication of how the plan will be implemented, God help us.  The Government should wake up and cop on to the fact that it made a mess of the plan to date.  Now that the Government has the money it should use it properly and not waste it the way it has wasted our time during the past year and a half with its subterfuge and incompetence.</P>

      <P>I had not planned to speak in the debate, but I felt compelled to say a few words following some of the comments made by the Deputies opposite about a part of the National Plan that falls within my area of responsibility.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify the position so that those seeds of confusion and begrudgery will not take root.  I wish to put some facts on record.  The Community Support Framework for Ireland 1994-99 was approved in principle by the Commission of the European Union yesterday. It represents the best achievement of any Government on the <Col N="2187" /> drawdown of structural support moneys for this country.  That is a basic and undeniable fact which Deputies opposite may try to hide, but the fundamentals of it can be seen by anyone with half an eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen in her contribution finally acknowledged the Government's magnificent achievement in securing such a level of European support. We are no longer the poorest of the European Union countries and yet <i>per capita</i> we have secured the best deal. We are the envy of every country in the European Union and any of the other three cohesion countries would be delighted to have the same <i>per capita</i> support we achieved on this occasion.  It bears repeating that over the seven year period 1993-99 the aid per head of our population will amount to £2,100 compared with £1,700 per head in Greece, £1,650 per head in Portugal and £1,400 per head in Spain.  They are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government not announce that at the beginning?  Why did it hide it?</P>

      <P>It reminds me of the short-sightedness of the person who has £100 on the table but spends his time looking under the table for the 10p that has rolled off.  Such are the antics of the parties opposite and that has been their hallmark for the past 12 months.  They should have the good grace today to rejoice on behalf of the country in the achievement of large inputs of new moneys into our economy which will create jobs, give hope and provide an infrastructure for development.  We all must share that and abandon the begrudgery that has been a hallmark of contributions by members of Fine Gael and Opposition Deputies on this issue for the past 12 months.  That simple point must be made.  Like many of the public, I am tired of Deputies opposite talking down the country, the achievements of <Col N="2188" /> our Government, the magnificent results of negotiations that have produced the best results &mdash; they are beyond dispute. Deputies opposite have not disputed the fact that of the 12 countries in the European Union the results attained by our Government negotiators are the best, but that is not good enough for them.  They want to use some obfuscation or smokescreen to detract from such a magnificent achievement that will bring hope and progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Plan is the most ambitious, constructive and positive development plan ever put before the House or proposed to be implemented by any Government.  It is an ambitious plan.  It touches on every area of activity in our economy.  It is a plan that is fundamentally built on the need of our economy to grow and create jobs.  Jobs are the principle which has driven the National Plan, which are the objective of the National Plan, and I am delighted that the National Plan stands intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tandem with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Programme for Government itself, which is the working operational document of the Government, it will transform this country. The results of the Government's first 18 months in office and its operation of the Programme for Government are already evident.  The ESRI has today updated its own estimate of the growth of our economy.  We will have the fastest growing economy within the European Union.  We have already achieved one of the lowest inflation rates.  In the 18 months since we took office the interest rates have fallen to a level where the economy can now sustain small businesses particularly and allow them to grow.  Confidence in the economy is evidenced by surveys of small businesses and large businesses which, for the first time in a decade, are projecting real growth in job creation and job potential. These are basic facts which cannot be <Col N="2189" /> talked down despite the best efforts of Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Fine Gael Party on this whole issue can be characterised as begrudgery.  It seems to positively will the Government's ambitious plan to run aground.  As to the targets for development in job creation, transformation of transport, the new light rail systems, new developments in roads, rail, sanitation, water supply and hospitals, the new training for our young people, the new education projects undertaken in the plan, it positively hopes these will not be achieved rather than joining in a great national endeavour and rejoicing in the fact that this plan represents a building block unprecedented in our history.  This, I can only say, is an extraordinary attitude for any party that still retains some ambition to hold office in this country.  I say again, the plan will be implemented and I know that is to the great dismay and annoyance of some Deputies opposite. That is something I find totally inexplicable. I genuinely do not know why Deputies opposite would work up such a fever to talk down the country or to positively hope a plan they universally applaud will not succeed.  Is there any element of the national plan that Deputies would not wish to see implemented?</P>

      <P>I am saying categorically, and every other Minister who has spoken has reiterated it, that Tallaght Hospital will be built as outlined, as specified, as scheduled.  In 1994 prices the minimum cost will be £116.4 million.  That will be provided and I am grateful for the contributions from European Union funds to assist, for the first time, a hospital development in this country.  We have developed hospitals across this country from Exchequer resources in the past and I heartily welcome this additional funding to augment our own revenues on this occasion.

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what has already been said.  The chronology leading up to today's debate has been well rehearsed and delivered by way of fairly extensive research into newspapers and the reports of this House which would form the basis of a very interesting <Col N="2193" /> programme on &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; if it were still on the airwaves.  However, I do not think it is appropriate or constructive to try to provide a substitute for that programme here.  I will deal, therefore, with something that has not been dealt with so far in this debate.</P>
      <P>The reason so much play has been made of the allocation to Ireland goes back to the Maastricht referendum when we heard a well played record to the effect that if people voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; we would be guaranteed a large cash injection to compensate for the negative effects of the Single Market and the fact that Ireland is on the periphery of Europe.  It is no accident that so much public attention has been focused on that amount of money since it was such a hot referendum issue.  I do not think enough has been said about the negative effects of that process, and that needs to be recognised in the context of the National Plan.  There was a certain amount of deception in the way that referendum was fought.  The Government used taxpayers' money to push the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; argument and the amount of money made available to the Irish people is much less than promised.</P>
      <P>There is talk of a mid-term review, which is meant to be some kind of panacea, but the Government should not put too much faith in such a review or try to hype it up as a means of staving off the public's anger.  I recognise that other countries did not receive as much as we did.  Countries that are more central are better placed to take advantage of the Single Market and would not be treated in the same way as a country on the periphery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention being given to the amount of money concerned is in many ways a smokescreen.  The real issue is how the money will be spent.  I would be cautious about getting into too much argument about the amount of money involved, scandalous as that episode was. The European Commission laid down guidelines that 50 per cent of the Cohesion Fund should be spent on infrastructure and 50 per cent on environmental projects.  However, our wisdom <Col N="2194" />&mdash; I say that tongue in cheek &mdash; determines that we spend a greater amount on infrastructure and an infinitesimally small amount on environmental projects.  I look forward to the Minister's justification of that.</P>
    <P>Directives are laid down that, for instance, discharges of raw sewage will cease by the year 2000 for conurbations of 15,000 people or more.  We read about this in the newspapers from time to time. However, there is very little talk about the year 2005 and the limit on discharges from populations of 2,000 or more.  The Government is playing a very short term game.  It is concentrating on immediate needs while not considering the long term effects.  I would ask it to turn its attention to the long term aspects.  There are many people not of voting age who will be able to vote by the time the Government goes out of office and they will give their answer if long term provisions are not made.</P>
    <P>The grand road plans need to be considered carefully.  In general, they fly in the face of our commitments at the Rio de Janeiro meeting of world Governments. While one must be discriminating about where road works are needed, towns which are completely overrun with traffic need ring roads and by-passes.  However, the plan proposes not simply to provide by-passes or ring roads but to redraw the map of Ireland so that there will be one major Euro route, while other roads will receive less attention.  The Minister for the Environment will plead that he is providing for all roads but the evidence suggests otherwise.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while at the same time there is no inner relief road, which is just as important for the economy of the town.</P>
      <P>I am very critical of this plan.  I agree that jobs are needed, but the Government has structured the plan in such a way that it will get the maximum tax from the jobs created.  The plan does not outline in detail how the economy will be structured to cope with future constraints. The agreements made in Rio de Janeiro, particularly the climate convention, stated that by the year 2000 we would cut back on carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels, but that is not being done.  The idea of an energy tax is being baulked at, with the argument put forward that we are a poor country.  We use an infinitesimally small amount of energy in comparison with our European partners. It is unwise not to introduce an energy tax, because when the time comes to cut back on energy consumption we will not be prepared for the type of economy that will be jobs intensive, with a reduced energy requirement.</P>
      <P>We should concentrate on creating jobs in energy conservation.  We are not giving sufficient support to this area, particularly by way of European money. Jobs in the recycling area have been neglected because we have not put in place a recycling strategy.  Jobs in local horticulture are under threat due to lack of Government support for that sector. Even though £1 million was provided for the horticultural sector, it was only a joke in light of the difficulties faced by that sector.  In the area of renewable energy we are helping to create jobs in Denmark because the manufacturing of our renewable energy is being carried out in Denmark and the financing is being done through Danish banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ensure the stability of our local economies.  In France there is a very developed economy, with local economies providing their own bread, cheese and wine.  Their local brands are distinctive. France attracts a great number <Col N="2196" /> of tourists because of its diversity.  We seem to have thrown out the baby with the bathwater &mdash; we allowed local economies to be dismantled in the belief that the single market would meet our needs.  This has resulted in the depopulation of rural areas and the associated problems of overpopulation and crime in our cities.  We need to consider the example we are setting for people outside this House.</P>
    <P>Earlier we had a long question and answer session with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, on TEAM Aer Lingus. Under the final settlement workers will have to accept an overall package that will ensure their lives are far more difficult than previously, whether that means being employed or unemployed. People are being faced with the prospect of working longer hours for lower pay in order to remain competitive.  At the same time it is proposed to spend £10 million on the refurbishment of the Dáil.  Ministers are still been driven around in expensive ministerial cars; although this does not take up a huge percentage of the overall budget, it is an obvious cause of disdain of ordinary people.  They see the taxpayers money being used in lavish ways.  I could refer to ministerial trips to the World Cup, but enough has been said already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could do a very good job.</P>
      <P>The plan gives high hope for jobs but the fulfilment of it is far from realisable. There is no harm in aspiring to create a large number of jobs.  When one considers where the money will be spent, the jobs do not appear to be sustainable, which they could be in a more locally based table economy.  The proposed jobs will be affected badly by constraints on energy consumption, which is beyond all our control.  We have neither large sources of untapped energy nor control over its price.  We are putting ourselves in a very vulnerable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> The unemployed are being asked again to try to be patient or to try to get one of the jobs that will be created.  To those who fail to get a job the message is that they have failed and are no longer useful members of society.  That is one of the saddest messages we can give to people. What is required is shorter hours, work-sharing and a basic guaranteed income scheme which will allow people work mobility and makes part-time and seasonal work viable.  Work gives dignity and people should not have to rely on getting one of the few jobs available. Unfortunately, the Government is still going down that road.  When it is reconsidering the National Plan in all its detail I hope it will consider the type of economy that will be sustainable in the future rather than what existed 50 years ago, which because of the growth of technology no longer serves our needs.</P>

      <P>She has suggested I was afraid to come into the House.  I am never afraid to come into the House at any time.</P>
      <P>It is a complete falsehood to suggest, as has been suggested, that the agreement we have vigorously and successfully negotiated with the European Union Commission involved a substantial shift from the original National Development Plan position.  The Government's concern in negotiations was to ensure that the combined Exchequer and EU resources allocated by sector were adjusted <i>pro rata</i> so that the broad shape of the plan was maintained.  This we have done and the income has resulted in some marginal adjustments.</P>
      <P>Admittedly there has been some shift in the EU aid and Exchequer funding mix in the different sectors to meet Commission priorities on the use of EU aid and for technical reasons such as different aid rates.  The Community Support Framework approved by the Commission yesterday makes clear that the Government was able to make offsetting shifts in the allocation of domestic Exchequer resources so as to maintain the relative shares in overall expenditure of the various areas concerned.  In this debate I will restrict my comments to the areas for which I have responsibility.  The Government has already clearly signalled a key role for transport, energy and communications in supporting our future economic growth and job creations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of transport the major objectives will be achieved through increased investment under the Community Support Framework.  First, investments will be made to ensure that internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities are improved on <Col N="2199" /> an integrated basis, thereby reducing transport costs and offsetting the negative effects of peripherality on the economy.  Second, the investments will be undertaken with the objective of improving the reliability of our transport systems by removing bottlenecks, remedying capacity deficiencies and reducing journey times.</P>
    <P>These objectives are being spelt out in an integrated operational programme for transport which will embrace the transport functions of three Departments:&mdash; strategic investments in national, and primary and secondary roads, under my colleague the Minister for the Environment; selective and targeted investment in sea ports, under my colleague the Minister for the Marine; and significant public transport and airport investments, under my own Ministry.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Opposition has suggested the broad thrust of the individual transport investments listed in the National Development Plan last October will be proceeded with under the transport operational programme.  I can reassure the House that under the programme there will be a substantial renewal and development programme for the mainline railways.  The programme will involve the provision of modern rolling stock, track renewal and new signalling systems on those lines forming part of the Trans-European rail networks and on other rail links.  In short, the national mainline rail network will be developed with particular emphasis on strategic inter-urban links and on improving the accessibility of access transport facilities at our main ports and airports. At the same time the Dublin Transportation Initiative will be substantially advanced over the next five years with a considerable investment programme. The operational programme will clearly demonstrate how progress will be made on the implementation of the public transport elements of the DTI recommended strategy.  It will also show how we will commence our investment programme for light rail.  There will also be clear evidence of investment in quality <Col N="2200" /> bus services and other public transport infrastructure and support measures to help make Dublin transport faster and more effective.</P>
    <P>The other area I should highlight is the investment that will take place in our State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  At these State airports there will be upgrading of existing capacity and the provision of new capacity to cater for traffic growth and to maintain service, quality and safety standards.  Such investment is required to ensure the provision of adequate infrastructure for the national and international aviation links required by our trading economic sectors and to meet projected increases in these requirements.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that a second operational programme &mdash; the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme &mdash; will see considerable investment in the areas of energy and communications.  In the energy sector the investment programme will focus on tackling the factors which induce uncompetitive energy charges in the Irish economy, as well as minimising fuel consumption and energy infrastructure inefficiencies.  The new investments in the energy sector will cater for increased demand from the economy in general, secure improved efficiency in energy supply and consumption and result in a more cost competitive supply infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The impact of energy use on the environment has taken on an increasing importance both at national and international level in recent years.  Much of the investment planned for the sector over the next few years will have the effect of increasing the efficiency of existing supply technology, thereby reducing energy losses.  It is proposed to provide EU aid for key projects in the energy sector.  They include peat-fired generating capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the telecommunications sector.  There will be considerable investment in this sector over the next few years.  Despite very considerable investment in telecommunications over the past decade, the level of penetration of telecommunications in Ireland compared with most member states remains relatively low and the full range of modern services is still not available nationwide. I hardly need to emphasise to this House the importance of telecommunications for the Irish economy.  If telecommunications services available in Ireland fail to keep pace with developments elsewhere, this country would find itself disadvantaged in the context of attracting foreign investment and creating and retaining jobs.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that we have, with the agreement of the European Commission, ensured that European funds will be provided to contribute to further improvements in our telecommunications infrastructure, in particular in facilitating investment in certain exchange developments.  Finally, I should mention that, for the first time, European funds will be provided to augment investment in modern postal infrastructural developments.  This expenditure is being focused in the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme in such a way as to assist postal services which, in turn, can enhance the capacity of Irish businesses to compete in the Single European Market by improving the quality of service and by reducing operating costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that I put on the record of this House the fact that the European Commission has now positively endorsed this Government's development strategy in the new Community Support Framework. The agreement on the Community <Col N="2202" /> Support Framework is very satisfactory from the Government's point of view. What is more important, the allocation of overall resources will be in line with our national plan apart from very marginal adjustments.  The agreement is also satisfactory for the Commission because it is assured that its priorities for the use of EU aid are being met.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat what my colleague, the Minister for Finance, pointed out yesterday and that is that the amount of EU Structural Funds aid to be provided under the Community Support Framework was decided by the European Commission on 21 October 1993.  The allocation approved for Ireland was 5.62 billion ECUs or IR£4.54 billion.  It goes without saying that the negotiations on the Community Support Framework were concerned with the use of the CSF aid, but what the Opposition fails to recognise is the fact that the plan also included investments to be aided by the Cohesion Fund, to be aided under Structural Funds Community initiative programmes and to be aided under the EFTA Cohesion Fund in the next five years.  These are governed by different administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>While the EU aid allocation under the Community Support Framework was less than that underpinning the plan, the shortfall in EU aid has already been taken into account by the Government in the 1994 Estimates and in the <i>pro rata</i> adjustments to the plan and that is totally consistent with the Government's press statement of 1 March.  In that press statement the Government indicated that it would be prepared to consider increased Exchequer expenditure in Structural Fund areas in the context of the annual budget.  This proved possible in the 1994 Estimates when a reduction of £130 million was made to planned expenditure. This was not a full amount of projected aid shortfall.  It was possible for the Exchequer to meet some £40 million of a cost which the plan envisaged would be met by EU funding.  Such consideration would have to take account of Government priorities in areas other than those <Col N="2203" /> affected by the Structural Funds and the need to maintain budgetary discipline.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the importance of now drawing down the EU funds under the CSF and the operation programmes as soon as is feasible. The success of our plan will depend not merely on the EU funds that we have negotiated, so successfully, it also depends fundamentally on the extent to which opportunities are grasped and challenges confronted.  There is no doubt that our plans have ambitious targets &mdash; the creation of a considerable number of new jobs and an economic growth rate which is projected to increase faster than the EU average to the end of the decade. To achieve these targets will require considerable co-operation, commitment and consensus from all sectors of the community. It is in all our interests that our plans are successfully implemented so that we can enter the 21st century with a robust economy enjoying higher living standards and with a much higher level of employment.  We never want to go back to the situation that existed in the mid-eighties.</P>

We have already told the House on several occasions that those cutbacks will be made on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and this is what has now been agreed by the Commission.  However, it remains the Government's aspiration to secure additional funding from the Commission if that is achievable, and we will also be examining, on a year by year basis, in the light of revenue buoyancy, to what extent it will be possible to pick up additional expenditure or to accelerate projects which otherwise might have been completed outside the plan period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me stress the fundamental economic point that if an investment is a sensible one from the Commission's viewpoint it is also a sensible one from our viewpoint.  I would, therefore, make no apology for investing some of the fruits of revenue buoyancy in projects and programmes that make long term economic sense in terms of increasing our country's output and job potential.  If a project yields a greater economic return than the alternative spending options or the alternative of cutting taxation, it should go ahead; otherwise it should not. Any decisions to invest extra Exchequer resources in additional proposals will be <Col N="2205" /> on a year by year basis and on a programme by programme basis.  It is not the Government's intention at this stage to pick up the total shortfall within the planned period; this year, for example, the Government picked up £40 million of a £170 million shortfall.  The pace of progress we can make on implementing elements of the plan which are not at this stage co-funded will also depend on the pace of economic progress and the degree to which that generates revenue buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Deputies queried my statement that the Government's approach to the <i>pro rata</i> reductions was largely accepted by the Commission.  I am circulating a table which shows the Government's proposal on allocations made to the Commission last March and the final outcome.  This table shows the combined Exchequer and EU elements in the CSF.  If was on this basis that all the decisions were made at Government.  The distribution of a fixed total of EU aid across the different elements in these totals is largely a technical exercise, and variations in the composition of funding make no difference to the final totals.</P>

      <P>This table covers the CSF part of the plan.  It does not include the Cohesion Fund or the EFTA Cohesion Fund &mdash; the Cohesion Fund has already been agreed &mdash; the Community initiatives, where we expect Commission proposals in the near future, or non-Exchequer <Col N="2206" /> public sector or private sector expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates referred to the time taken to complete and publish the CSF text.  There was no undue delay on our part.  When he sees the final draft he will appreciate the amount of work it takes to complete it and get the text, tables and figures right in a document of this size. For example, as late as last week the wrong regulations were being quoted and obviously the completed document must be accurate.  When we agreed the broad framework of the allocation with the Commission last April, it had not produced a CSF text and this first draft only became available towards the end of April.</P>
      <P>My officials and those in the other Departments involved made every effort to finalise a text as quickly as possible at our end.  I am told it is not unusual for a process of this kind to take less than two months from presentation of the initial draft to finalising all the details.  We have taken no longer than other member states to finalise our CSF, from presentation of the plan to finality.  As Commissioner Millan said yesterday evening, negotiations on all the CSFs were more time consuming than he would like.</P>
      <P>There was a reference in the debate to Tallaght Hospital which will be completed as per contract and provide much needed health services for the people of Tallaght, south west Dublin and North Kildare as I am sure Deputy Durkan will appreciate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the issue of jobs. The central objective of the plan is to <Col N="2207" /> increase sustainable employment.  I am happy that the improvement in the economy since the plan was published has allowed for the inclusion of a higher net forecast for jobs growth outside agriculture &mdash; 15,000 per annum rather than the 12,000-14,000 envisaged at the time the plan was prepared.  Our growth forecast is also higher at 4 per cent rather than the upwards of 3.5 per cent included in the plan.  The ESRI recommend a higher rate.  Some Deputies claimed the ESRI was not independent.

    <P>Deputy Harney asked about the position in a number of areas of expenditure including human resources, Tallaght <Col N="2209" /> Hospital, environmental services and Dublin light rail.  I explained several times that the Government has taken account of the shortfall of EU aid through the <i>pro rata</i> reduction in departmental spending allocations it approved at the end of February.  This applies to all sectors. In relation to environmental services the greater part of the expenditure is to be aided by the Cohesion Fund and that Cohesion Fund related expenditure was not affected by the <i>pro rata</i> cut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not present.  Perhaps his colleague will convey my message to him.  The elderly living in the Dublin South Central constituency are unhappy with the way they are treated by the Government.  Not only do they have to try to live on miserably low pensions but anyone lucky enough to have a small pension from a job finds it is taxable while the Government give millionaire tax dodgers a tax amnesty.</P>
      <P>The Government ought to be ashamed of the way they treat senior citizens many of whom have medical cards.  They have to wait five months for replacement spectacles. What way is this for the Government to treat senior citizens?  I call on the Government to provide additional funds to reduce the waiting times and ultimately abolish them.  In the overall context of the health service this issue might seem like a relatively small problem but it is not for those affected.  In the case of pensioners, the delay affects their health and safety.</P>
      <P>Because of financial shortages the Eastern Health Board decided it can only authorise a limited number of applications for optical benefit each week. There is a waiting list of 19 weeks for people waiting for benefit.  Those hit by the delays are pensioners who may accidentally break their spectacles and need replacement or repairs.  It is a serious matter to leave pensioners with poor sight without spectacles for so long.  Not only may they be unable to read or watch television, they could have difficulty going out.  They may not see traffic and other obstacles.  I note that the Minister of State wears spectacles.  Anyone wearing spectacles knows that their quality of life is affected when they are deprived of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First time applicants for glasses are <Col N="2211" /> experiencing even longer delays as they have to establish eligibility before they are put on the health board's waiting list.  The claims made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, during the recent election campaign about the success of the Labour Party in reducing waiting lists in the health services, sound very hollow to the elderly, the pensioners and the vulnerable in society who have to wait up to 19 weeks to have their glasses replaced or repaired. The Minister for Health should make a special allocation to the Eastern Health Board so that this waiting list can be eliminated and people can have their glasses repaired or replaced without undue delay.  This is a very minor request. The Minister must get his priorities right.</P>
    <P>In the previous debate reference was made to the hundreds of millions of pounds being spent on hospitals and the health services, yet the Government cannot even guarantee fair play for elderly medical card holders who are forced to face unnecessary danger in their day-to-day lives due to these long waiting lists.  I hope the Minister responds in a positive way to the serious problems being experienced by so many vulnerable and insecure pensioners.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Byrne on his re-election to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of optical services for eligible persons in this area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  The sight testing scheme under which eligible adults, medical card holders and their dependants, have their sight tested by ophthalmologists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians in private practice has been in operation in the health services since 1979.  Eligible patients have their sight tested in private practice premises. Where glasses are prescribed for an eligible person, they are provided by a dispenser of the patient's choice from <Col N="2212" /> among those who have agreed with health boards to provide this service.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that there are problems with the scheme as currently operated.  In recent years there has been a steady increase in the number of applications for optical services.  The following practices have been noted by the board: most opticians operate a recall system with many operating a yearly recall system; some have a higher than average number of claims for two pairs of spectacles, reading and distance, some advise their clients that they need a second pair of spectacles as a &ldquo;spare&rdquo;; and some issue a prescription for new spectacles where there has been no change in the strength of the lens.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the number of applications &mdash; in excess of 30,000 per year &mdash; and the number of providers of the services involved, it is difficult without a very detailed examination to quantify with certainty the extent of the above problems.</P>
    <P>Due to increases in the number of applications the board not only exceeded its 1993 allocation but had to create a waiting list.  The waiting period varies in community care areas, and is up to five months in some areas.  While there is currently a waiting list, the Eastern Health Board has in operation a system which gives priority to applicants with special needs such as the elderly and students sitting exams.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of the Eastern Health Board's concern regarding the operation of the sight testing scheme at present.  The board is carrying out a detailed examination of the aspects of the scheme causing concern.  My Department has been in contact with the Eastern Health Board and will discuss the matter further on foot of the outcome of the board's examination of the scheme with a view to ensuring that all persons who need optical services receive them within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the crisis in Irish Steel.  Sadly, this company seems to be moving closer to a dark abyss as each day passes.  During the week the problems in the company were described by management as &ldquo;frighteningly serious&rdquo;.  We are being blamed by the public for standing by and allowing the company to drift towards oblivion.  There is, therefore, an urgent need for a strong political response to this crisis.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday the craft unions unanimously rejected the proposed survival plan.  While this plan is a serious attempt to deal with the problems of Irish Steel, it must be accepted from a human and social point of view that the financial demands imposed by it on the workers would be extremely severe.  It is, therefore, understandable why they are unwilling to accept the plan.</P>
      <P>The Government is the major shareholder in this company.  While the survival plan is an economic response to the crisis in the company, there is an urgent need for a clear political response by the major shareholder, the Government. From a political, social and economic point of view, everything possible must be done to prevent the closure of this plant.  All our efforts must stem from that premise.  I welcome the proposed intervention by the Labour Relations Commission which can only be helpful.  I am worried why it has taken so long for the commission to intervene, but better late than never.  I hope the commission can help resolve the problem in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for sharing his time with me. Cork, and in particular Cobh, have suffered major job losses in the past from the closure of the Verolme Dockyard. When the yard was sold to Damon Shipping some years ago we were promised 300-400 jobs, yet no jobs have been provided in the yard to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 500 full-time jobs in Irish Steel <Col N="2214" /> and a further 500 spin-off jobs are now threatened by the crisis in the company. In the past the workers in Irish Steel accepted wage freezes and redundancies &mdash; I worked in the company but was made redundant some years ago.  The workers have once again been asked to take a cut in their basic wage to save the plant. Management should look at other areas where reductions can be achieved before asking the workers to take a cut in their basic wage.  In April one tonne of scrap cost £114, it now costs £87 per tonne. Irish Steel uses between 360,000-400,000 tonnes of scrap per year and the lower price should lead to savings of approximately £3 million.  This saving should be used to avoid any cut in basic pay and save the plant.  Workers have told me they will not be able to pay their mortgages if they have to take another cut in wages.  They have accepted wage freezes in the past and now they are expected to take a wage cut.  It is unfair to ask them to do this as their wages are already very low.</P>
    <P>The Minister must do everything to save the jobs in Irish Steel and prevent the closure of the company.  Major savings can be made from the lower cost of scrap, and the Minister should give consideration to this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Bradford and Mulvihill for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Last April the Government considered the survival plan for Irish Steel Limited and approved the opening of negotiations between management and unions to achieve the levels of cost reductions and efficiencies needed to enable the company to continue in business as a viable commercial entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minimum net savings of £8.4 million per annum were identified in the plan. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has emphasised that the negotiations between the unions and the executive chairman may identify some other areas where costs are under the control of the company and where <Col N="2215" /> reductions can be achieved.  Nonetheless the cost reductions that have been identified in the plan are in those areas identified in the Simpson Xavier report, and it is likely that they will have to be included in the adjustments.</P>
    <P>However, it has also been emphasised that the savings, whatever their source, must reach at least £8.4 million net per annum because, unless savings of that order are achieved, there can be no question of asking the Government to continue to invest State resources in Irish Steel.  Unfortunately, without those cost savings and further State investment, there can be no future for the company. Nobody should be in any doubt about that.  It gives me no joy, just as it did not give me or the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, any joy earlier to talk in this way about such matters.  However, the facts must be faced.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is difficult and very sad for people working in companies who arrive at the position in which the workers in Irish Steel or TEAM Aer Lingus find themselves.  We are in a huge process of change in semi-State companies, with very difficult times ahead, even with the achievement of cost savings that must be effected.  I repeat, that there is no joy in having to say that.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the concerns of both Deputies who have spoken and others in this area and there should be no doubt about what that prospect means.  It means the immediate closure of the plant if the £8.4 million savings and the loss of all 560 jobs are not accepted.  In addition, job losses would be inevitable in other local industries which supply goods and services to the company.  Admittedly, there are job losses envisaged under the cost savings plan but there is a very big difference between the redundancies envisaged in the plan and the 560 job losses which closure of the plant would entail.</P>
    <P>As both Deputies will be fully aware, the steel market continues to be extremely difficult and a successful outcome of the European Commission's <Col N="2216" /> restructuring plan for the industry remains far from certain.  There will be a meeting of Industry Council Ministers on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week in Luxembourg who will be discussing the steel plan to ascertain whether further progress can be made.  An improvement in steel prices might be expected to follow from its successful implementation which, of course, would be of benefit to Irish Steel which continues to make losses at the rate of £1 million per month on average.  Sadly, that was the same statistic referred to in the House earlier today in the case of TEAM Aer Lingus.  I need hardly say that, given this scale of losses, an improvement in steel prices in itself would not be sufficient to stop the outflow of funds from the company.  That is why it is imperative that agreement be reached on the cost savings plan by 30 June, which deadline must be rigidly adhered to.  The scale of the company's losses does not allow that deadline to be extended.  Time is fast running out and it appears that very little progress has been made to date.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission should be used to progress discussions in a structured manner, involving all unions.  In recent discussions, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, confirmed to the new chief executive officer, Mr. Dineen, that unless agreement is reached on the full implementation of the plan by the end of this month, there can be no question of the Government considering further investment in Irish Steel Limited.</P>
    <P>Because of the regime on State aid operated by the European Commission for the steel industry it would be necessary to secure the unanimous approval of the other member states to any further State investment in Irish Steel.  An important aspect of obtaining this approval would be to show that Irish Steel can function as a viable commercial entity, that it has a commercial future ahead in the marketplace.  As it now stands, Irish Steel is not viable and cannot hope to be unless the £8.4 million cost savings plan is agreed and implemented in full as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> While not wanting to appear to repeat the point for the sake of repetition, there can be no doubt about the consequences of not reaching agreement within the next two weeks on the company's cost savings plan, which would be the total and immediate closure of Irish Steel.  It is a frightening prospect for all concerned, particularly for the workers and management of the company, but is a very real possibility unless reason prevails and serious negotiations are embarked on immediately by all the unions.  I repeat, the Labour Relations Commission is ready, available and should be resorted to to progress discussions in a structured manner involving all the unions.</P>
    <P>I thank the two Deputies who raised the matter.  This company has been the subject of many parliamentary questions, Adjournment Debates and other debates in this House, which is as it should be.  It is only right that Deputies should express the concerns of their constituents, one of the best ways of ensuring that the workings of this House are seen to be relevant.  Equally it is necessary that there be honesty all round in openly stating the position in the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arises from a contact I had during the week with a young woman employed as an apprentice hairdresser, earning approximately £60 per week in that capacity.  She is living away from home in rented accommodation which she shares with a number of others and is paying £25 rent per week. Understandably, she is finding it very difficult to make ends meet.  She applied to her community welfare officer for a rent allowance and was told it was not possible to pay her a rent allowance because she was working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find astonishing about this case &mdash; and I pursued it myself subsequently through health board officials who confirmed that that was the position as it obtains under the regulations which govern rent allowances &mdash; is that if that <Col N="2218" /> young woman was unemployed, she would be receiving approximately the same amount of money and would qualify for a rent allowance.  It simply does not make sense that somebody who wants to pursue a career &mdash; she does not want to leave the job, she is in her third year &mdash; should find herself in such circumstances. It does not make sense that somebody who works throughout the week for low pay &mdash; that is another matter, but it is an apprenticeship &mdash; will not qualify for an allowance to help her with her rent for which she would qualify if she were unemployed.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this matter this evening is to ask the Minister for Social Welfare, through the Minister of State present, Deputy O'Rourke, to examine the regulations governing rent allowances and endeavour to eliminate this type of anomaly where the very same person who would qualify for such allowance, if unemployed, does not so qualify because she is working, even though the amount she earns is no more than she would receive in social welfare payments if unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>I am most interested in this case both through my constituency work and through the fact that the young woman about whom the Deputy speaks is an apprentice.  While that same principle could be applied to anybody on low pay, the rates for apprentices are established, which means the rate of money this young woman receives is set at a particular level. The Deputy has put forward a fair case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislations governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme people in full-time employment are excluded in all but exceptional circumstances from receipt of an allowance. People in part-time employment may qualify for assistance under the provisions of the scheme, including rent supplements, subject to the normal rules applicable to the scheme.  For the purpose <Col N="2219" /> of supplementary welfare allowance part-time employment means employment of less than 30 hours per week. Clearly the woman to whom the Deputy referred would be in full-time employment, even though she is learning a trade.</P>
    <P>The social welfare allowance provision for rent and mortgage supplementation is designed primarily to cater for people on social welfare payments who are in private accommodation and need assistance with rent or mortgage costs.  Other schemes of direct housing assistance are operated by local authorities.  Here I might add that the amount expended on rent and mortgage supplements under the social welfare allowance scheme amounted to £47 million in 1993.  The extension of entitlement to rent supplements and other assistance under the social welfare allowance scheme to people in full-time employment would have major financial implications for social welfare and for assistance with housing costs.  Therefore, it would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may put forward the case that if that same young lady was unemployed and in receipt of the same amount in unemployment assistance she would be entitled to considerable assistance towards her housing needs.  The Minister said that his Department is in consultation with the health boards revising the guidelines for the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation under the SWA scheme and revised guidelines will be available by the end of the summer. <Col N="2220" /> Arising from the present review, the Minister is examining a number of issues relating to housing costs generally to see whether further developments may be necessary.  From a constituency point of view, we are all conscious of the position of people on low earnings who are in full-time employment.  The policy of the Department of Social Welfare has always been that every possible support should be given to people in this situation, subject to family constraints.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to improve cash support for employees on low earnings with families. There are 10,000 people in receipt of a FIS payment compared with 7,200 a year ago.  The Minister for Social Welfare will be increasing the qualifying income limits for the scheme by an additional £10 from the end of July 1994 which will ensure that the uptake of this employment support is extended to more families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising the matter.  It is not an abstract matter, it is a specific case and he has provided all the details.  The rules and guidelines for the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation are being revised and will be available by the end of the summer.  I hope this debate will have some input into those guidelines.  The qualifying income limits for FIS will be increased by £10 from the end of July.  This will enable a greater take-up of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 June 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 October 1992, the UK Government announced revised RAF search and rescue coverage arrangements for the UK area of responsibility in the Irish Sea which will take effect in July, 1994.  These arrangements will bring higher capacity, faster helicopters into service and involve closure of bases including RAF Brawdy in South Wales, from where 24 hours Sea King helicopter coverage will be transferred to RAF Chivenor in Devon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that there is a long history of close co-operation between all Irish search and rescue services and their UK counterparts.  Close liasion is maintained with the UK search and rescue agencies at operational level, <Col N="2131" /> and formally through being represented respectively on each other's national search and rescue committees.  The degree of co-operation reflects the mutual interest in providing the most effective search and rescue capability in these islands.  It is also in line with international obligations which require neighbouring states to co-operate closely in marine search and rescue.</P>
    <P>The Irish authorities were aware therefore that the provision of RAF search and rescue helicopters was under review. Prior notification of the planned changes was formally conveyed in 1992 through the usual inter-governmental channels. The implications of the proposed redeployment of UK helicopter resources have been assessed by the Irish Marine Emergency Service of the Department.  I am satisfied, on the basis of that advice, that there are on balance no adverse implications for coverage in the Irish search and rescue area.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that the current deployment of Irish search and rescue helicopter services enables us to meet our national and international obligations.  I am keeping the service under very close review however.</P>
    <P>A 24 hour coverage is provided by the Sikorsky helicopter based at Shannon which is operated by the Irish Marine Emegency Service of the Department, together with Air Corps Dauphin helicopter based at Finner, County Donegal. An additional Air Corps Alouette helicopter based at Baldonnel provides day time cover.</P>
    <P>Since coming into service in 1991, the Department's helicopter has completed over 300 missions and saved over 200 lives.  Deputies will be interested to note that last year it was necessary to seek assistance from the RAF helicopter service on one occasion only.  Since 1991 the Department's helicopter has provided assistance to the UK authorities on at least eight occasions.  This mutual co-operation will continue.</P>

      <P>It is priority of the Government to continue to improve the access to external markets with emphasis on reducing the total cost and the total time to the marketplace.  This objective is being achieved through actions on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive ports strategy is in place which involves the ongoing pursuit of the following complementary policies: (a) restructuring of the management framework for port authorities through the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises to manage the 12 bigger ports; (b) a major programme of investment, supported by Community funds, in port infrastructures and facilities with the emphasis being on investment in strategic corridors so as to increase frequency of service and benefit of economies of scale; (c) support for the introduction of the new multi-purpose ferry vessels on the Central Corridor for the 1995 season.</P>
      <P>Improving the access to external markets also requires that ports on both sides of the Irish Sea are efficient, have in place competitively priced maritime services and are managed on an arm's length competitive basis.  The close co-operation with the UK authorities which is in place in this regard will continue and the position will be closely monitored.</P>
      <P>In addition to the EU funds allocated to ports under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, a Community Initiative Programme, coverning maritime border regions is being drawn up to promote co-operation between cross-border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening of the Channel Tunnel offers opportunities for Ireland to improve access for our products to the continental markets.  A study on the commercial <Col N="2133" /> viability of combined transport links between the island of Ireland and continental Europe via Great Britain is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>In addition the Department, together with other relevant Departments, is actively participating in discussions at EU level in connection with the development of a Multimodal TransEuropean Transport Network.  This network will embrace all modes, including road, rail, sea and air transport throughout the European Union.</P>

That agreement acknowledged the legitimate concerns of the trade unions in relation to the future development and ownership of B &amp; I and the strategic national shipping interest.  It duly noted the matters of particular concern to the unions in such matters as future investment programmes, employment and terms and conditions of employment and affirmed ICG's intentions in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement also made reference to the trade unions' strong view that the then Minister had a pivotal role to play in ensuring that these declared intentions were fulfilled.  I can confirm again to the House, as I did yesterday, that in the exercise, now, of my responsibility as <Col N="2134" /> Minister for all shipping policy matters I am willing to examine the 1991 agreement in consultation with all interested parties to determine how expressed concerns can be met.  I would say again that the question of delivering on declared intentions made in 1991 is one that should be addressed seriously by unions with ICG in the first instance, but we are prepared to examine these intentions to see what implications, if any, currently arise in the context of shipping and economic policy generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the second part of the Deputy's question, I consider it important <Col N="2136" /> to emphasise that the scheme was introduced specifically to alleviate the hardship suffered by fishermen who were unable to carry out their normal winter fishing activities because of the exceptionally harsh weather conditions at sea last winter.  For this reason, in assessing hardship, the two previous winters are been taken as bench marks against which fishermen's performances last winter can be judged.  Where it is shown that fishermen's activities were curtailed because of bad weather the applicants concerned will be eligible for aid provided they meet the scheme's other criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Detailed collection of sea trout statistics were discontinued after 1986 due to the perceived unreliability of the data collected for some fishery districts and the resulting problem of making any reasonable assessment of the sea trout resource based on such unreliable information.  This was compounded by the introduction of &ldquo;catch and release&rdquo; regulations in some districts as a result of emerging problems with sea trout stocks in the late 1980's.</P>
      <P>I am, however, conscious of the need, particularly in the light of the sea trout problem, for accurate and detailed statistics on sea trout.  In this regard the Department, through the Fisheries Research Centre, FRC, is putting in place a system of sea trout statistics collection in conjunction with the regional fisheries boards.  This system will permit the estimation of stock levels rather than catch levels.  In addition, the FRC has commenced counter trials for the monitoring of the sea trout stocks on two representative rivers.  If the trials are successful, and the initial indications in this regard are positive, then counters will be installed on other rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to questions on 10 February last, following my meeting with the Spanish Fisheries Minister, Mr. Loira Rua, it was agreed that closer co-operation in the monitoring and control of fishing activities in Irish waters would include enhanced contact between senior personnel on both sides, including inspection staff.</P>
      <P>Since then three technical meetings between the inspectorates have taken place and further such meetings are planned. The meetings to date have concentrated on improving the exchange of information on breaches of fishery legislation and the implementation of the pilot satellite monitoring programme.  Proposals for interchange of staff are also under consideration.</P>
      <P>The increased contact is underpinned by the terms of the new control regulation which requires member states to co-operate in securing conservation objectives.

      <P>It emerged at that meeting that administrative arrangements in the court system of other member states would have to be changed to facilitate the proposal. The states concerned did not indicate any willingness to do so in the foreseaeable future.  In two member states legislative changes would be required.  The conclusion of the group was that there was merit in the proposal but that it was not feasible to proceed with it at that stage because of practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>After such a relatively short time it would be impossible to raise the matter again with any prospect of achieving a different outcome.  Moreover, the European Council laid down last December a priority programme in the field of civil judicial co-operation which will take another year or two to complete.</P>
      <P>After completion of the priority programme consideration will be given to reviving the proposal if a suitable opportunity presents itself and the proposal appears likely to have the support of a majority of EU member states.</P>

      <P>My attention has not been drawn to an absenteeism problem at Killinarden community school.  I would not in the normal course expect to be appraised of school attendance matters in respect of any individual school.  This arises because school attendance committees are responsible for the enforcement of the School Attendance Act in the County Borough of Dublin, the Boroughs of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, Cork and Waterford. In all other areas the Garda Síochána have responsibility.  Consequently, schools are not obliged to make any returns to my Department on absenteeism.</P>
      <P>The appointment of school attendance officers is in the first instance a matter for school attendance committees in areas where such committees exist.  The appointments are subject to the approval of the local authority for the area and my function is to ultimately sanction appointments under the terms of the School Attendance Act.  I have no role in the appointment of personnel in areas for which the Garda Síochána have responsibility.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department had no prior knowledge of the case referred to by the Deputy.  I am having inquiries made and <Col N="2155" /> I will advise him of the outcome in due course.</P>
    <P>The general position is as follows. Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.  My Department has a complaints procedure which is available to parents or guardians of children attending national school who wish to appeal a decision taken by a board of management.  It is appropriate that complaints are referred in the first instance to the board of management, which is the body charged with the direct government of the school.  A complaint which is not resolved at that level can be referred to my Department for investigation in accordance with an agreed complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>My Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for Schools Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to all post-primary schools in October 1991.  It requested each school authority to draw up a code of behaviour for its school, which would have regard to the rights and responsibilities of management, teachers, pupils and parents.  It advised that expulsion should be resorted to only in the most extreme cases of indiscipline and only after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and every other sanction has been exhausted.  However, the document did not lay down specific procedures to govern cases of expulsion. Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a code of discipline appropriate for that school.  Where a case remains unresolved at school level, an appeal may be made, in the first instance, to the appropriate school management authority i.e. a board of management in the case of community or comprehensive schools, vocational education committee in the case of vocational schools and community colleges and the manager or board of management in the case of voluntary secondary schools.  Parents <Col N="2156" /> who feel aggrieved with a decision of school management to expel a student may bring the matter to the attention of my Department, which arranges for appropriate investigation.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy there were 152 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus four assistants for the 1993-94 school year. The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher and a concessionary teacher under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The staffing of the school, which was established following an amalgamation in 1981, has benefited from an amalgamation concession.  Amalgamated schools are allowed to replace teachers who leave within one year of the amalgamation. In the case of a teacher who leaves after one year, a replacement is allowed only if the enrolment figure on the previous 30 September warrants it. A member of the staff of that school is retiring voluntarily on 31 August 1994. However the school's enrolment on 30 September 1993 does not warrant that teacher's replacement.</P>

      <P>The proposed new second level school for girls in Celbridge is to have a community school management structure. A site for the proposed new school is currently being considered by my Department.  A schedule of accommodation has been drawn up and it is hoped to initiate architectural planning in the near future.</P>
      <P>The school is to be built to cater for 700 pupils in the short term and 550 pupils in the long term.  The new school is intended to be available for September 1997 and funding will be provided to meet this timescale.</P>
