      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to explain his breach of ministerial accountability under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, on a matter for which he has full responsibility and his failure to supply that full information to the Dáil on Wednesday, 26 October 1994.</P>

      <P>Please allow the Chair to comment without interruption. Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the Standing Order.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.  This matter cannot be said to have the urgency required by the Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was so <Col N="1130" /> urgent that they wheeled out civil servants at a press conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for the Chair's guidance on the appropriate mechanism through which I could raise this matter in view of the misleading information given in the House yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of ways to raise the matter which are open to the Deputy.  I suggest that if it is the intention to make serious charges against any Member of the House, including the Minister referred to, the appropriate way to do so is by substantive motion.  I should also add, as the House knows full well, quite a lot of the time of the House was devoted to this subject.  At Question Time yesterday 50 minutes were given to it and approximately 30 minutes the day before.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also important to draw the attention of the Chair and the House to continuing insinuations and slurs on the integrity and professionalism of public servants.  The gracious thing would be for Deputy Hogan and <Col N="1131" /> Fine Gael to withdraw those insinuations. The truth is out and they should accept it.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 1 and 2.</P>

    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. 5 and 6 shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 7, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) <Col N="1132" /> Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 1.15 p.m. to make a speech in reply; (3) the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m.; (4) the Dáil on its rising this evening shall adjourn until Wednesday, 2 November 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members should agree that the proposal to take No. 5 without debate is absolutely outrageous. What is being proposed is a major infringement on the very few rights left to Deputies in the House.  As far as I know, this proposal has not been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and as far as I have been able to find out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If this motion is passed there will be precious little opportunity for us to make speeches anywhere else. As far as I know, this proposal has not been discussed by the parliamentary parties of any of the groups represented in this House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann nominates John Purcell for appointment by the President to be the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Patrick L. McDonnell, is retiring with effect from 1 November 1994.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members of the Dáil would wish me to express, on their behalf, our appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. McDonnell after 13 years as Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is a high and important constitutional office, and Mr. McDonnell discharged the duties of that office in exemplary fashion.</P>
      <P>I also express my thanks and good wishes to Mr. McDonnell.  As a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts I found him to be an efficient and courteous official who displayed the highest standards of professional behaviour at all times.  I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of Comptroller and Auditor General was originally provided for under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  Article 33 of the Constitution sets down the basic responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General, in terms of his role as comptroller in controlling, on behalf of the State, all disbursements of moneys administered by or under the authority <Col N="1151" /> of the Oireachtas, and in terms of his role as auditor in auditing Government accounts for regularity and accuracy.  In accordance with the Constitution, the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann and reports to Dáil Éireann at stated periods as determined by law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution also provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad calling for such removal.  This underlines the independent status of this important office.  The statutory retiring age is 65 although he would qualify for a pension if he opts to retire at any time over the age of 60.</P>
    <P>The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as outlined in the Constitution, has to be seen in relation to developments in the general practice of audit which have occurred in the past 20 years or so and, in particular, to developments in relation to national audit.  In line with these developments, the recent Comptroller and Auditor General legislation, the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, consolidated existing legislation and modernised the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the two major new elements introduced by the recent legislation relate to the nature and scope of the audit process.  The nature of the audit process has been enhanced by the Comptroller and Auditor General's new statutory role in relation to economy, efficiency and effectiveness &mdash; three inter-related concepts broadly referred to as &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;.  Economy means providing suitable resources for a task at the lowest cost having regard to quality and with minimum wastage.  Efficiency involves relating the costs of resources to the outputs achieved.  Thus, an efficient operation gets maximum output from a given level of resources or a given level of output from minimum resources.  An activity <Col N="1152" /> could be economical without being efficient if resources were purchased at lowest cost but failed to give the required outputs.</P>
    <P>Effectiveness brings into consideration the extent to which the stated objectives of a programme operated by a Department or body in the public service are achieved.  Thus, an activity could be economical and efficient in its use of resources but if the objectives to which it is directed are not being met, it would be ineffective.  For example, a programme could be operated on efficient and economical lines in terms of the acquisition or use of resources but if the required progress in attaining its objectives is not being achieved it would be necessary to review the effectiveness of the activity.</P>
    <P>This value for money function is probably the most important new discretionary power to be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He may, at his discretion, examine and report on the economy and efficiency of Departments and bodies which are expected to have in place the necessary systems to evaluate the effectiveness of their operations.  It is these systems which are subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, rather than a direct examination of effectiveness, which could create problems because of the close connection with policy.  Section 11 of the 1993 Act prohibits the Comptroller and Auditor General from questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of policies or of policy objectives.  The Act applies the same prohibition to accounting officers in the performance of their statutory duties.  Both of these restrictions are reflected in the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, article 3 of which states:</P>
    <P>the Committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. </P>
    <P>All of this is in accordance with the <Col N="1153" /> longstanding tradition that, in policy matters.  Ministers are answerable to this House, not to the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Committee of Public Accounts.  In this regard there is virtual worldwide agreement that the national auditor should not become involved in policy, which is the prerogative of the Government accountable to parliament.  In examining systems which evaluate effectiveness, the difficulty of the Comptroller and Auditor General becoming involved, directly or indirectly, in areas is avoided, while at the same time, the Dáil and public have an assurance with regard to the evaluation of the effectiveness of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit has been extended to include the Finance Accounts, the Guarantee Section of FEOGA, all non-commercial State bodies, a number of educational bodies, health boards and the vocational education committees.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General is empowered to examine funds under the aegis of bodies he audits, and, with appropriate ministerial approval, the subsidiaries of such bodies.  He also has discretionary inspection powers where a body receives 50 per cent or more of its funds, either directly or indirectly, from public moneys.</P>
    <P>The new Comptroller and Auditor General is taking up his appointment at a time of change.  Some of these changes came about as a result of last year's amending legislation to which I have already referred.  Other changes in the area of Government accounting are being introduced on a phased basis over the next three years on foot of recommendations made to the Minister for Finance and presented to the Committee of Public Accounts by a joint working group representative of the Department of Finance and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In relation to the Appropriation Accounts &mdash; the annual accounts of Government Departments, which up to now essentially have been cash accounts &mdash; these <Col N="1154" /> changes will involve expanding the information provided to take account of the assets, liabilities and commitments of Departments.  A statement of the general accounting principles followed in preparing the account will, in future, be included in the published Appropriation Accounts volume, the objective being to make the accounting process as transparent as possible, not only for the benefit of the Committee of Public Accounts and Members of the Oireachtas, but for the information of the general public.  The statement will also explain in detail how the Dáil votes the necessary financial resources to enable Government Departments to conduct their business, how this is given statutory effect by the annual Appropriation Act and how the accounting officer for each Vote accounts for the expenditure incurred by his Department. This should go a long way towards removing a lot of the mystique that members of the public perceive as being unnecessarily associated with the conduct of the public finances.</P>
    <P>In its report, submitted to the Minister for Finance earlier this year, the working group expressed its concern that the basic legislation covering accountability in Government Departments dates from the last century and does not adequately provide for the complexities of modern administration. While the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, updated the audit function, the group considered that the accounting function needs to be updated also by consolidating existing legislation in modern terms in a State Financial Management Act and providing a statutory definition of the content of an expanded Appropriation Account.  The Appropriation Accounts are at present prepared to meet the requirements of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, section 24 of which simply prescribes that an Appropriation Account must show &ldquo;on the charge side the sum or sums appropriated by Parliament for the services of the financial year to which the account relates and <Col N="1155" /> on the discharge side thereof the sums which may have actually come in course of payment within the same period&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that the statutory description of the account be amended so that it provides for the additional notes and information of a &ldquo;balance sheet&rdquo; nature.  Thus, an Appropriation Account will become a comprehensive end of year financial report instead of the present basic receipts and payments account.</P>
    <P>While, as I have already mentioned, the Appropriation Accounts will be expanded to meet the group's recommendations, the question of covering this by statute and of bringing in consolidating legislation is under examination in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In summary, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 1990s is an expanded and enhanced one with a modern and comprehensive statutory basis which will have a positive impact on public accountability and contribute to the overall performance of the public service.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.  Members of the House, especially those who served on the Committee of Public Accounts are aware of the high responsibilities of the post, which I described.</P>
    <P>Having fully considered the matter, the Government decided to recommend the nomination of Mr. John Purcell, who is Director of Audit in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to succeed Mr. McDonnell.  Mr. Purcell has had 29 years' service in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and has given entire satisfaction in his current senior post in that office.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Mr. Purcell will make an excellent Comptroller and Auditor General.  I recommend his nomination to the Dáil.  On my own behalf and that of all Members of the <Col N="1156" /> House I wish him well in his new position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of Comptroller and Auditor General is one of the most important constitutional offices in the Republic.  Of its nature it is not a high profile office, nonetheless it represents a vital check and balance in any democratic society.</P>
      <P>A very important feature of our public service and public life since independence has been the relatively low level of fraud.  This high level of integrity is frequently undervalued, its importance underrated and not appreciated.  Of course, there is no room for complacency and every need for eternal vigilance. In our system of government the lead in this role is assigned jointly to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The high level of integrity in public life is not an accident.  A number of factors contribute to that reality, including the standard set by the first Government of this State, under W. T. Cosgrave, in establishing the Civil Service Commission, the Local Appointments Commission and in recreating the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That latter office has been filled with great distinction since then but not least in the past 13 years under the stewardship of Mr. Laurence McDonnell who had the full measure of this very important job.  His unfailing tact and due prudence was exercised in a manner that enhanced rather than diminished his independence which he upheld very firmly at all times.  It was this combination of qualities which earned the very significant expansion of his role under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  He has modernised his office and kept it fully abreast of changes in technology and management techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I have been privileged to have worked closely with Mr. McDonnell over the past one and a half years.  I can testify that he leaves his great office in a high state of efficiency <Col N="1157" /> and effectiveness, very appropriate given his new role in ensuring that the same is true of all Departments of State. He has chosen to retire eight years before his time in bountiful good health. The State owes him and his wife, Mona, a greater debt of gratitude for signal service of the first rank.  I wish them both míle buíochas and <i>multus annus.</i></P>
    <P>The nomination of Mr. John Purcell to succeed Mr. McDonnell is very welcome. I wish to express my appreciation to the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Finance for seeking my views, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, on this nomination.  Mr. Purcell has been Director of Audit in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for six and a half years, has been to the fore in advising and assisting in the modernisation of the State audit function and in expanding it into value-for-money efficiency and effectiveness.  Mr. Purcell, at 49, is a relatively young man. Some people may contend he is too young for the job but it is known that he can still play the odd game of five-a-side football.  If great men like the President of the United States, the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Opposition and even the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts can hold such posts in their 40s why not the Comptroller and Auditor General?  More seriously, he is the right age for the job as it ensures him a tenure of office of sufficient length to provide the necessary continuity and stability I consider to be of particular importance of the audit function.  Mr. Purcell is a committed and competent public servant who has served a long and distinguished apprenticeship in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have no doubt he will uphold the high standards of his predecessor in all respects.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been expanded and modernised, as has the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The expanded role of the Committee of Public Accounts requires also that we modernise and update our <Col N="1158" /> processes: that has been and is happening. I want to express my appreciation of the co-operation of the Government, in particular that of the Department of Finance, in this respect. The Committee of Public Accounts would greatly welcome a new State Financial Management Act and would greatly appreciate the efforts and disposition of the Department of Finance in this respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that other promised and important legislation has not yet come before us.  I hope it will not be too long because the delay undermines the effectiveness not only of the Committee of Public Accounts but of other committees of this House.  I am referring to the Bill promised to compel witnesses to appear before Oireachtas committees' and to grant them privilege. The absence of those powers has frustrated the Committee of Public Accounts in several significant respects. The Minister of State said the Government is considering introducing a new form of appropriation accounts and we await that with interest.</P>
    <P>In praising the Government, and the Department of Finance in particular, on the co-operation to ensure that the Committee of Public Accounts and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General are effective, it is only right I should mention the controversy or, should I say, the difference of opinion about the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the 1993 accounts of the Revenue Commissioners. This issue is of great importance and is one which all parties concerned, including the Committee of Public Accounts, are taking seriously.  I hope there will be co-operation from all sides to ensure that the issue is resolved in a way that does not impede either the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Committee of Public Accounts and ensures not only that there is probity in the public finances at all levels but also that we get value for money, effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> I wish Mr. Purcell every success in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly happy to support this motion for the appointment of Mr. John Purcell to the position of Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am sure he will be an excellent occupant of that very important office.</P>
      <P>However, I want to take issue briefly with the manner in which he is being appointed.  He is being appointed as a result of a Government decision on the motion of the Minister for Finance. That is wrong.  Article 33 of the Constitution makes it perfectly clear that his appointment should be by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann and not of the Government.  The motion should be moved by the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts rather than by the Minister for Finance.  It is not in keeping with what the spirit of the Constitution sought to achieve in Article 33.  Effectively, the decision is being made by the Government.</P>
      <P>The fact that somebody is appointed by the Government will not, I hope, affect his view in any way because it is of enormous importance.  It is recognised by the Constitution that the holder of that office should see himself as being entirely independent of and in no way dependent on the Government. Dependency on the Government should not extend even to his appointment.  I am confident, that when he is appointed Mr. Purcell will overcome the genesis of his appointment and prove to be every bit as good as his predecessor, Mr. McDonnell.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with the other speakers in paying tribute to Mr. McDonnell.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts during the past 12 months I found him to be a very effective Comptroller and Auditor General who carried out his functions with great skill and a genuine independence. We have been fortunate over the past 13 years to have had a man like Mr. McDonnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the Comptroller and <Col N="1160" /> Auditor General have been increased and clarified to some extent by the legislation passed last year.  I welcome that legislation which is valuable and useful, but it will not become fully effective until further legislation is passed by the Oireachtas giving each of the committees of the House power to compel the attendance of witnesses.  That, perhaps, matters less in the Committee of Public Accounts than in the other committees because usually accounting officers attend on request.  However, that committee should have the power to summon other people.  This legislation was promised for upwards of 12 months and I am extremely disappointed that it has not appeared notwithstanding continuous promises both by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that it was about to be published.</P>
    <P>I want to deal in particular with a recent problem which was also adverted to by Deputy Mitchell.  It is a great pity that it has arisen just at the end of the period in office of the present Comptroller and Auditor General.  I hope, however, that his successor, Mr. Purcell, will be equally anxious to try to have the matter resolved, and resolved in the public interest.  The revelation within the past week by the Comptroller and Auditor General that he had received advice from the Attorney General effectively restricting him from reporting fully to the Dáil on the operation of the tax amnesty throws into sharp focus the issue of the conflict between, on the one hand, the Attorney General's role as legal adviser to the Government and as head of the Department of State, which drafts legislation, including the amnesty Bill, and, on the other hand, his role in upholding the separate public interest.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the amnesty Act purports to restrict the Comptroller and Auditor General in his constitutional duty of auditing public accounts.  By narrowing down the scope of his inquiries to the single issue as to whether the moneys received under the amnesty have been properly accounted for, that legislation, drafted in the Attorney General's <Col N="1161" /> office, seems to be an impermissible constraint on the constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General which is to report to Dáil Éireann and to its Committee of Public Accounts on the manner in which the revenues of the State are being managed.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller's powers and duties are constitutional and are set out in Article 33 of the Constitution.  They cannot be circumscribed by statute to the detriment of his constitutional role and any statute which purports to circumscribe him is, by definition, unconstitutional. In particular, for the purpose of properly auditing the public revenues, it is appropriate that the Comptroller report to the Dáil on a number of issues which, in this case, include (a) the number of persons availing of the amnesty, and the profile of payments made under it; (b) the cost to the Exchequer of the amnesty, having regard to the recoverability of the taxes due by the persons who availed of the amnesty and (c) the extent to which the amnesty was availed of by people who had also availed of the last amnesty in 1988.</P>
    <P>Even conceding, for the purposes of the argument, that it is open to the Oireachtas to impose an anonymity requirement by law on the Comptroller and Auditor General when dealing with tax matters generally, and with the tax amnesty in particular, it is manifestly clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not intend in any way to compromise the anonymity of taxpayers who availed of the amnesty.  Accordingly, the effect of section 7, as interpreted by the Attorney General, seems to compromise the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General more than is remotely necessary to preserve anonymity.  People are entitled to general information as to the number and character of persons who availed of the amnesty, and the nature of the loss to the Exchequer represented by their payments, bearing in mind they paid only 15 per cent of their due taxes and did not pay interest or penalties.  In practice, their payments may amount to <Col N="1162" /> as little as 7 per cent or 8 per cent of what they lawfully owe.</P>
    <P>Apart from the people's general right to know, Members of Dáil Éireann have a constitutional right and duty to inform themselves on those matters through the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and a majority in Dáil Éireann who voted in favour of the amnesty do not have a right to curtail the flow of information to themselves or to a dissentient minority in breach of the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I note the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to consider the matter further.  I strongly urge him &mdash; and did so at a committee meeting some weeks ago when he indicated he intended to seek the advice of the Attorney General &mdash; to take independent legal advice on this issue as a matter of right and duty.  It is unsatisfactory that the committees of this House do not have standing legal advice available. The instinct of officials serving committees is to seek the advice of the Attorney General, but the Attorney General is the worse source of advice in a matter such as this which involves a conflict of public and Government interest.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that unless in the near future the Comptroller and Auditor General issues his full report on the amnesty, citizens will consider initiating court proceedings for a declaration of their rights as citizens and, possibly as Members of Dáil Éireann, to receive such information, for a declaration as to the rights and duties of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the matter and, if necessary, for declarations in respect of the interpretation and constitutionality of section 7 of the amnesty Act.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day that a Member of Dáil Éireann is obliged to seek to vindicate the principles of accountability by having resort to the courts rather than this House.  Another course does not appear open when one is confronted by an unshakeable majority of Deputies who are content to keep secret the policy implications of this infamous tax cheats' <Col N="1163" /> amnesty, passed in the House more than a year ago.</P>
    <P>The lack of accountability to this House on that matter is paralleled by other current matters.  Some people consider this is some type of academic exercise, but it is far from that.  We had an example of a Minister declining to answer questions asked by Members, who tried to have them dealt with at a press conference held at night by a civil servant and attended by a limited number of journalists.  That is not accountability. That happened on the same day we were told that another Government appointee, the Attorney General, is not accountable for what does or does not happen in his office.  He sought to blame officials in that office for allegedly not showing him papers relating to an extremely sensitive matter which were sent to him by the Garda.  It is indicative of the depths to which Administration has descended that those three matters of which I speak should be more or less contemporaneous.  It should be a matter of concern to anyone who wishes to see public administration and public accountability restored to the level and nature envisaged by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>On his appointment as Comptroller and Auditor General by the President following the passing of this motion, Mr. Purcell faces a fairly daunting task.  He can, like many others in public office, take the easy way out or he can face up to his constitutional responsibilities.  I hope he will face up to them and I am confident he will do so as effectively as his predecessor, Mr. McDonnell, whom I wish well in his retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion before the House to appoint Mr. John Purcell to the important office of Comptroller and Auditor General.  I compliment the Government on its choice, coming as it does from an Administration which has a lamentable record in terms of making appointments, drawing on filial relationships and other factors rather than on the merit of the person nominated for <Col N="1164" /> appointment.  In this case the Government has distinguished itself by putting before the House the name of a distinguished and long serving public servant for appointment to an office of crucial significance to the affairs of the State never more so than at present. That does not take from the point raised by Deputy O'Malley about how properly that office ought to be filled, having regard to the constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Notwithstanding the long and distinguished service of the outgoing officeholder, it is extraordinary that over a period of 13 years we have not formulated a way to give expression to the independence expressed in the Constitution.  However, I am confident that Mr. Purcell will, like his predecessor, carry out his duties without fear or favour and without being beholden to a Government party or a Deputy in the House.</P>
      <P>I want to be associated with the tributes paid to the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Laurence McDonnell.  He has done the State some service.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Jim Mitchell, remarked that this was perhaps not widely known.  Perhaps the nature of the office is such that neither the office nor its occupant comes to public attention frequently, notwithstanding the outgoing officeholder's regular and diligent attendance at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts. Deputy Mitchell is correct in saying that down through the years we have not had a serious problem of fraud in the public service but that is not to say that we do not have and, have not had, an appalling problem of waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's reports, year after year, highlight the extent of shoddy and imprudent decision-making in the conduct of public affairs, leading to the waste of taxpayers money.  I would like to have the time to go back over some of the more celebrated cases where waste in the public service was identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General. From the more recent reports of the <Col N="1165" /> Comptroller and Auditor General one can see enhanced efficiency in terms of value for public money spent.  The impact of these reports down the years has had a significant formative influence on the way business is done in the public service, or how decisions are made by Government and on planning to expend public money.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the office and the independent execution of its duties is not more important now than it has been before.  Like Deputy O'Malley, I believe accountability is at a low level in this House and in politics in Ireland now.  There are several examples of the lack of or disdain for accountability to this House required in the Constitution, from the Government.  It seems to be almost a principle now to tell this House the minimum.  It is a question of whatever we can get away with, and if it is extracted from us we will contrive some way to have it brought into the public arena not necessarily in this House where it should be done.  That is a very regrettable development in public affairs and should concern everybody interested in public service.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate to have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for the last five years or more and I concur with everything that has been said about Mr. McDonnell's period of office.  He is a distinguished public servant who has been very patient, at times in very trying circumstances, with the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He has raised for public debate some of the most fundamental questions about value for money in our government system.  We owe him a great debt and I take the opportunity to wish him a long and happy retirement.</P>
    <P>It is a coincidence that we are engaged in what some people would like to turn into a row about public servants at the time when a distinguished public servant is retiring.  The current controversy is not about public servants, but I would be less than honest, as somebody who has, by way of career, represented public servants for 15 years, if I did not say I am disquieted by the <Col N="1166" /> tendency for Ministers not to take responsibility in this House for the actions of their officials and their civil servants.  A particularly striking case was the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry in which it was eventually uncovered that an official made such a material change to an official document that it concealed the source of beef being insured with public money.  We have never really got to the bottom of that.  Did this official make this decision on his own initiative or was he instructed to do so, and, if so, who instructed him?</P>
    <P>Similarly, arising from the failure of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to answer questions in the House about an alteration to another document with far-reaching implications for the planning process, a press conference was convened late in the evening and a civil servant said publicly that he caused the alteration to be made.  This is a disturbing development in public affairs.  I would be very reluctant to draw the inference that one ought to blame the public servants.  I am not sure that is the case.  Perhaps I am hide-bound by the fact that in the past I had the honour to represent public servants and I am reluctant to criticise them, but one gets the impression that we have entered a new era in the public service.  One also gets the impression that public servants feel obliged to take a certain course of action at the behest of a Minister belonging to a certain political party that they might not take if that Minister belonged to another political party.  That is a matter this House will have to consider in future.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to a matter raised by Deputy O'Malley.  I do not know whether the Comptroller and Auditor General considers it unfortunate he has found himself in the middle of an important controversy as he is about to retire.  He is probably unconcerned by that and is doing his duty as he always did, while we consider the implications of it.  What is at issue in the 1993 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is nothing less than the efficacy of <Col N="1167" /> the tax collection system.  That issue is dealt with in paragraph 20 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of 1993 on what is called the incentive amnesty audit.  What we are discussing is the essence of the tax collection system and whether it has been undermined.  These are the questions this House must ask on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General set himself three objectives I will put on the record.  The 1993 report states:</P>
    <P>I viewed my main responsibilities in this regard as endeavouring to determine, by the use of sampling methods, the extent to which those who availed of the Incentive Amnesty:</P>
    <P>&mdash; had in fact complied with the statutory conditions attaching to the Incentive Amnesty e.g. by making a correct income tax return by the due date &mdash; bearing in mind that the arrangements made in accordance with the legislation did not impose a duty to establish <i>a priori</i> the eligibility of declarants availing of this amnesty;</P>
    <P>&mdash; had pre-April 1991 arrears which might be expected to have been successfully dealt with through enforcement before the critical date i.e. 25 May 1993 &mdash; which might indicate whether there were inadequacies in the Revenue Commissioners' collection and enforcement procedures;</P>
    <P>&mdash; had also availed of the 1988 Amnesty which was designed to encourage those who availed of it to bring and keep their tax affairs up to date &mdash; which might indicate whether there were deficiencies in the Revenue Commissioners' procedures for making maximum use of the information at their disposal as a result of the 1988 Amnesty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> By reason of the confidentiality provisions of the legislation, it would not be open to the Revenue Commissioners to carry out and analyse the results of a sampling exercise such as that undertaken by my staff.</P>
    <P>This raises important questions of public interest.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made the point that it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners to look behind the operation of the tax amnesty; they may not do this under the legislation we put through the House. The Comptroller and Auditor General has, I think, used the word &ldquo;cocooned&rdquo;. A special arrangement has been made, under the direction of the special collector, for those who did not pay their taxes whereby they are assured absolute confidentiality.  It is a separate office and the special collector may not share the information with his fellows in the Revenue Commissioners and they may not inquire.  If a person who has been allowed to benefit under this amnesty is asked in the future to account for his pre-1993 taxes he may hold up a little certificate and say that he availed of the amnesty and the Revenue Commissioners may not look behind it.</P>
    <P>The only way this House can evaluate the impact and implications of the amnesty is through the operations of the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Can he report to this House on his analysis of the operation of the amnesty?  The answer he has received from the Attorney General is that he may not.  If there is anything that underpins this society it is the tax collection system.  The ordinary citizen may draw the conclusion that there is one regime for the tax compliant citizen, the citizen who observes the law and tries to pay his or her due taxes, and a different regime for big time cheats and tax evaders who do not observe the law or pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>We have made a special law in this House by a decision of a majority of Deputies and we may not look behind it.  As Deputy O'Malley said, we may not establish what it cost the State or <Col N="1169" /> how many of the people who availed of the last tax amnesty in 1988 availed of this amnesty.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that it was his express intention to review the efficiency of the procedures applied by the Revenue Commissioners.  Did they use the information from the 1988 amnesty, the purpose of which was to bring these people into the tax net and make sure we keep them in it?  As a result of the decision of the Attorney General we do not know whether that happened and if the Attorney General has his way we never will.</P>
    <P>What do we have?  There is the prospect that an amnesty for tax cheats will be introduced every five years.  One was introduced in 1988 and another in 1993. Why should one not be introduced in 1997 or 1998 immediately after the next general election?  If that is the case, why should anybody bother paying taxes?  If, like the Tallaght bus, there is always one on the way, should we bother?  That is the issue at the heart of the controversy to which Deputy O'Malley referred.</P>
    <P>I take a different view to Deputy O'Malley on the question of the Comptroller and Auditor General asking the Attorney General for his opinion of the relevant section in the legislation.  I cannot see that is harmful to the process; it may be illustrative for this House.  After all, it was the office of the Attorney General which drafted this appalling legislation.  Perhaps it is appropriate, and it ought to bring a speedy reaction, as it has.  I am aware there is an apparent conflict in that at times the Attorney General can act with great speed and at others can take longer, but I do not see any harm in the Comptroller and Auditor General seeking the opinion of the Attorney General. The question is whether the Comptroller and Auditor General considers himself to be bound by the opinion of the Attorney General in this matter.  That is a serious issue which we must resolve either at the Committee of Public Accounts or in this House.</P>
    <P>It has been clearly established that there is a conflict between the role of <Col N="1170" /> the Attorney General as law agent of the Government and as upholder of the public interest.  This was never more starkly highlighted than in the case of the beef tribunal where the Attorney General instructed his counsel to conduct themselves and marshal their case in a partisan fashion.  They were present, nominally, to represent the State and its agencies but it became clear that they were present with a limited and partisan interpretation of what this meant.  This came into sharp relief in the conflict between Mr. Hickey, senior counsel, and the chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Hamilton.  When Mr. Justice Hamilton sought to have Mr. Hickey manifestly discharge the public interest dimension of his role he refused and made it clear that he was doing so on the instructions of the Attorney General. The chairman of the tribunal subsequently decided that he could not impose this duty on counsel for the Attorney General and that the task of representing the public interest should be undertaken by the tribunal or counsel for other parties before the tribunal as and when appropriate.  It was a clear confict in that the Attorney General said to his counsel that they were not representing the State &mdash; former Fine Gael, Labour Party or serving Progressive Democrat Ministers &mdash; but rather Fianna Fáil.  That is the way business was done.</P>
    <P>Since we are talking about the efficacy of the tax system it is a public interest issue.  Who will vindicate the public interest?  The Attorney General will say he drafted the legislation and the Comptroller and Auditor General may not report to this House on his analysis of the operation of the tax amnesty.  This question has to be resolved in the public interest as early as possible because there is too much at stake.  Those of us who are members of the committee are looking forward to hearing the Comptroller and Auditor General's considered view of the advice he received from the Attorney General and whether he considers himself bound by that advice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The Committee of Public Accounts should as early as possible consider examining the relevant accounting officer on the commissioning of the consultancy report known as the Cairns report at the centre of the Arcon controversy.  We do not know how much public money was expended &mdash; the Minister did not answer that question &mdash; to secure an independent outside consultant's assessment of a critical issue relating to the environmental impact study of the major mine to be opened here.  I understand that the ore body is larger than the lead-zinc deposit at Navan.  In that situation it is timely and urgent to examine whether we have got value for money in terms of the findings of that consultancy report.  Again, they are issues of public interest, as admitted by the Minister: they relate to public safety, to the potential hazards for working miners and damage to the quality of drinking water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, it is a matter of some importance that the promised legislation on privilege and compellability be advanced at the earliest possible date.  This legislation has been promised, I think it goes back to a previous Government, but it has not yet seen the light of day.  It is important that the Committee of Public Accounts is enabled to discharge its duties even more effectively than in the past but it is hampered by the fact that the legislation on privilege and compellability of witnesses has not been enacted.  It is strange that although it is the oldest committee of the House it is the only one whose work is not televised.  This is not unconnected with the fact that it cannot summon witnesses whom it can compel to attend in the fashion the situation requires.  I hope the Minister may be able to indicate when the legislation will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat, it is appropriate that the House should record its tribute to the selfless dedication of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General for discharging his duties with such skill and commitment in the public service during the past 13 years and to wish his successor, Mr. John Purcell, every success and congratulations in embarking on this important office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As Labour Party Whip I wish to be associated with the motion for the appointment of Mr. John Purcell as the new Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is one of the few appointments where the Government motion comes before the House for its approval before the President makes the appointment. I take this opportunity to speak about the competencies Mr. Purcell has already exhibited, particularly during <Col N="1173" /> the past six years when he had responsibility for the planning, management and reporting of financial matters, the regularity of audits from all Government Departments and offices and for the subsequent follow up of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Let me take this opportunity also to pay tribute to the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputy Jim Mitchell and to his predecessor, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for their important work on behalf of the Members of this House in having an impartial look at public expenditure and evaluating the value for money the public has got from such expenditure.</P>
      <P>During the past number of months there has been a raging controversy in the media about public expenditure, particularly as it refers to Government, office holders and Members of the Oireachtas.  Members have been subject in the media to critical, unfair and untrue accusations about salaries and expenses, holidays and all other aspects of their lives.  This is all happening in the public arena and there is a responsibility, not only on the Comptroller and Auditor General but on the media to report fairly and accurately what is happening. The public believes what it reads and there is a perception that there is widespread abuse of public moneys.  It is important that the public is made aware that an officer of the State is responsible to this House and to the Committee of Public Accounts whose overall constitutional responsibility is to ensure that, independently of Government, he evaluates public expenditure and value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General not alone represents the Houses of the Oireachtas but by definition, the taxpayer, who picks up the tab for all the decisions we make in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The by-elections have been referred to and this upset Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; but by-elections tend to bring out the worst in politicians who are trying to score political points off one another. What is extraordinary in speaking to the electorate who makes the final decision <Col N="1174" /> in any election, is that it has a completely different view of what has been portrayed by rumour and innuendo.  I do not wish to refer to the accusations during the past number of days because they had an adequate airing.</P>
    <P>Public representatives object, and if they do not object they certainly resent, that somebody is looking over their shoulder at all areas connected with expenditure.  The Member has put himself before the electorate and been elected and can only function within the regulations laid down by the Minister for Finance.  Members' salaries and expenses are covered and whatever else is determined by regulation and must be within the law.  At times we show concern when the Comptroller and Auditor General is over zealous in these areas but it is correct that this should happen and that we are subject to an overview by an official who accepts the constitutional responsibility for the correct and proper spending of any money.  I am glad that during the past six years Mr. Purcell's remit has extended to health boards, vocational education committees and committees of the regional colleges.  As a member of a health board I know that it has taken some boards three or four years to present an audit.  If it took a private sector company three or four years to present an audit to the Revenue Commissioners, it would be bankrupt and seeking the facility of a tax amnesty.  I do not want to dwell on the controversy, to which Deputies O'Malley and Rabbitte referred, because I think the committee is adequately addressing its responsibilities and the constitutional responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General and how he will prepare his report to submit to the House on the adequacy of the tax collection system.</P>
    <P>I deny the suggestion, made repeatedly, that the amnesty is for tax cheats. I was involved in the previous amnesty. It helped people in small businesses who were unable to meet their legal responsibility to pay taxes at a particular time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I, along with the majority of my constituents are PAYE workers who have no relief from the tax man, tax is deducted at source on a weekly or monthly basis.  I accept that small business people, who have had to put up risk capital in order to employ people, have experienced difficulties over a number of years and while they did not refuse to pay their taxes, they were unable to meet tax demands on a specific date.  As a result, penalties accrued and over a number of years the penalties amounted to more than the original tax bill.  The tax amnesty was introduced to provide for a waiver of those tax penalties. These businessmen and women are not tax cheats and resent people in privileged positions such as Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Rabbitte and others, referring to them in that manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, who has had so much experience in Government, amazes me with his suggestions concerning the Office of the Attorney General and what the Comptroller and Auditor General should do.  He has been in Government for most of his political life and should have made the changes he now proposes when he was in Government.  I support many of his arguments but why did he not make any changes while he was a member of Government?</P>
    <P>Some companies who discovered errors in their accounts notified the Revenue Commissioners of them. These errors were not discovered by the Revenue Commissioners but as a result of the companies' accounting procedures. Offers of restitution made to the Revenue Commissioners were refused.  In one case a company with 25 employees offered to pay a lump sum while continuing to clear the debt over a number of years but that was refused. The Revenue Commissioners bankrupted the company, the 25 employees were let go and did not receive one penny as a result of that bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Is it better to give people an opportunity to pay the debts and taxes or to bankrupt them?  If we bankrupt them, <Col N="1176" /> people will be put out of work.  Is that what we want when we aspire to the creation of employment and improving the lot of working people?  We hope people will remain in business, pay their taxes and subscribe, through the Social Chapter, to their responsibilities.  One cannot employ workers cheaply in this economy or in any other.  I hope people realise, when they criticise tax amnesties, that their spin-off is that people can remain in business and make a just return to the State in taxes thereby ensuring that revenue is available to the Exchequer for the health boards which experience financial difficulties due to their inability to pay bills from small suppliers.</P>
    <P>The incoming Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, has a daunting task to ensure that all areas of public expenditure are properly scrutinised on behalf of the Members of this House and the electorate whom we represent who are the paymasters.  His responsibility to us and to the Committee of Public Accounts is a major constitutional one.  I commend him on his expertise in the area of public audit and other areas during his years with the public service which will be required in the execution of his duty.  We will regard him as a watchdog who examines Government, Government Departments and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We must ensure that the public and the media perceive what is happening here as open, above board and subject to critical analysis.</P>
    <P>We should not be subjected to unfair hardlines to the effect that Deputies are having two weeks holidays and can get £690 per day.  My salary is only twice that per month by the time the tax man takes his rightful share.  The people who write such articles should be ashamed of themselves because they know it is untrue.  Today's Order of Business is proof that we will not have two weeks holidays.  There was never such a suggestion from the Government Chief Whip.  It was emphasised that we would be required to sit next week.  It was agreed, in consultation with the other <Col N="1177" /> Whips, that the House would not sit the following week because of the Cork by-elections. People should be allowed to be involved in the democratic process of by-electioneering and ensuring that, as happens in this instance, the constituents of Cork North Central and Cork South Central have their rightful representation here.  The price of democracy here is small compared with the cost of dictatorships.</P>
    <P>The freedom of the media should be balanced by responsible reporting as to how politicians act in the public performance of their duties.  I resent some of the recent media coverage of Members of this House.  I do not have to defend those Members but I will certainly defend myself and point to the number of hours I work in any given week.  Regardless of how it is calculated, my salary is comparable with any ordinary industrial wage.  To pay for my education my father broke stones on the road and I am proud of that.  I am not concerned, therefore, about having the salary per hour of ordinary industrial workers.  I am from a working class background from which I am not far removed so I do not have too far to fall, when I lose my seat.  I resent privileged people in the media giving my constituents and other people incorrect information when they are privy to correct information since they travel with us at our expense and at the expense of the public.</P>
    <P>It is intended to introduce legislation governing compellability of witnesses and others and the Minister suggested that he may involve the Whips in consultation in its preparation.  This is legislation we would welcome.  Deputy Rabbitte did not say so this morning, but he is privy to information at the Whips' meeting and knows the Whips are offered the special privilege of involvement in the initial preparation of legislation to be initiated by Government.</P>
    <P>We should be fair with one another and put an end to the political muckraking which is bringing our profession into disrepute.  We should respect the work being done here.  We are all aware of <Col N="1178" /> the demands of public life.  We do not complain about that but we should not be misrepresented by people in privileged positions.</P>
    <P>I hope witnesses will be compelled to attend and that people will have access to information which those in the media and RTE use against us.  The public would give their right hand to know what these people earn, not that I am particularly interested, but when public money is involved transparency is important.</P>
    <P>I commend Mr. Purcell's appointment and extend my best wishes to his predecessor for the service he has given. I wish him every health and happiness in his retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ferris for his kind words which are much appreciated.  John A. Costello who was a senior counsel, Attorney General and Taoiseach on two occasions was reported as saying the greatest honour conferred on him was to be elected a Member of the national parliament.  I do not know for how long people will continue to elect me or for how long I would wish to be returned but it has been a great honour to be a Member of Parliament.</P>
      <P>Some people who comment on the affairs of Parliament are not qualified to do so.  I do not wish to be uppity but many people commenting on politics do not understand them or what Parliament is about.  If a parliament such as the Dáil functioned in Northern Ireland or Yugoslavia people would not be killed on the streets.  The first duty of a parliament is to be accepted as a fairly and freely elected assembly.  This is the place for letting off steam and controlling it so that people do not operate on the streets.  That is the first function of parliament.  It is up to us then to ensure we have an efficient, effective, honest and open parliament and we should be criticised for shortcomings in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the privileges I have enjoyed, serving as a member and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has <Col N="1179" /> given me most satisfaction.  I was a member of the committee for ten years and chairman for almost six years. Initially I was elected annually and was one of the longest serving chairman of the committee.  I have taken an interest in that area, academically and practically, and it has been a great source of satisfaction to me.</P>
    <P>A number of people were helpful in developing the role of the committee, not least the committee itself.  Although it was an all party committee, traditionally chaired by a member of the Opposition, and there were testing moments, in my experience we never divided on party political lines.  When I set up the advisory group on public financial accountability with the encouragement and assistance of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McDonnell, and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the committee gave its support on an all party basis.  It gave me great pleasure to see politicians working in harmony.  It goes to show what can be achieved when politicians co-operate.  These changes would not have occurred if Mr. McDonnell had not been Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. Cromien had not been Secretary of the Department of Finance. Mr. Cromien has retired but there was a good working relationship between him, Mr. McDonnell and the committee and I wish to acknowledge that on the occassion of Mr. McDonnell's retirement.</P>
    <P>Mr. McDonnell is a man of great prudence and courtesy.  He is a measured man, fair but firm.  He is a gentleman and good humoured.  He would need to be as he had to work with some testy chairmen.  He has been singular and clear in his remit and sense of responsibility to the country and this House.  I pay tribute to Mr. Purcell and wish him every success.  He was present at most committee meetings and was involved at a high level.  He is a worthy successor to Mr. McDonnell.</P>
    <P>I recall my first day at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held <Col N="1180" /> in Room 114 at the top of the stairs.  The press was not present.  We would sit there and the chairman would tell us to open the book at such and such a page which we would do like students at school on their first day.  The secretary of the Department or the chairman of the office under consideration would enter and we would have a chit-chat about what was in the book and then we would move on.  I remember the day I proposed that the press be allowed to attend a meeting and there was horror at the idea.  Now the proceedings of both Houses and committees are televised. There were occasions when simply by highlighting wasteful expenditure procedures were put in place to end it. Sometimes the committee put forward firm proposals on how it should be done.</P>
    <P>One of the most amusing occasions I recall was when a woman was discovered to be claiming children's allowance for over 100 children.  Having looked up the word carefully beforehand, I asked the secretary if he would consider the woman was philoprogenitive. &ldquo;Philoprowhat&rdquo; he queried.  I was asking him if she was prolific in childbearing. It turned out that she was living in a mobile home and had a number of books under different names.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ken Dye is a rather colourful Auditor General in Canada and I thought we might develop the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General along the Canadian lines until I saw there were shortcomings in their system which would not be acceptable here. Over lunch with him we exchanged amusing stories and I told him about the woman claiming children's allowance for over 100 children.  He said that was nothing as in the Department of Defence in Canada there was a horse on the payroll.  The reality is that people do not handle public money as efficiently as they would handle their own and it is up to the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that people realise they are trustees and must account to us.  The Government does not have money.  The Dáil provides <Col N="1181" /> money by taking it from the people and the Government must account to the Dáil for its spending.  That is why the Committee of Public Accounts and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General are important institutions.</P>
    <P>I would like the committee to be allowed to compel witnesses to attend meetings.  Following the arms trial it had such powers and if a witness was in contempt of the committee, he could be sent before the High Court under a document signed by the chairman of the committee and held to be in contempt of the committee as if he were in contempt of the High Court.  One witness was sentenced but he appealed.  The appeal succeeded, not because the committee should not have the right to send someone before the court for sentencing for contempt but because the law did not state the range of penalties. Therefore, in theory, the person was capable of being sentenced for more than two years and was entitled to trial by jury.  That was not provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>We set up an advisory group on public' financial accountability which I chaired.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the Director of the Institute of Public Administration, the past President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Chief Executive of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants were members of it.  We compared the roles of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts with similar systems in other countries.  We appended to the report an opinion by senior counsel on how to overcome the problems associated with the 1970 legislation and the compellability of witnesses.  This was the first time such an opinion was appended to a report.  It is relatively simple to do and it should be repeated.</P>
    <P>As I said on the first day of the Dáil, Government backbenchers do not realise that they will be sucked into the system.  The power is distributed between Ministers and Ministers of State and backbenchers are told they must by loyal.  The reality is that the <Col N="1182" /> Government gives us nothing and we give it everything.  Unless we take these powers for ourselves we will have no option but to continue to set up expensive tribunals and inquiries and employ inspectors.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary committees are set up in most other countries to inquire into matters which are properly the remit of Parliament.  These committees cost much less than tribunals or inquiries. The cost of running the Parliament or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is miniscule in terms of their important role.  I think the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas is £20 to £30 million while the Vote for the Department of Education is £700 million and the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare is £1.6 billion.  The cost of running the Houses of the Oireachtas is miniscule compared to the cost of running those Departments or of setting up tribunals which make millionaires of lawyers overnight.  It is time we gave powers to ourselves in this area.  We do not have to ask anyone to give these powers to us.  If enough Members want these powers they will be given them. We have to get away from the idea that we have to tow the party line all the time.  We should make it very clear on issues of national interest or issues of this kind that the views of Members are paramount.  Very often the opinion of the Government is given by a very busy Minister who reads a statement drafted by a senior civil servant.  I may be simplifying this too much &mdash; obviously Ministers give their personal views. However, the system is totally undemocratic and it is time we had a dose of badly needed democracy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise any ancillary issues but the Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer of the State, appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Government after approval of his nomination by the House.  His appointment is akin to that of a High Court judge and he can only be removed from office by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and then only for stated misbehaviour.  He is <Col N="1183" /> accountable to the Dáil and attends all meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts as a permanent witness.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin are the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Although we followed the British system, the Attorney General is an adviser to the Government, not the Parliament.  Following the British system even further, he hived off all his responsibilities to the Director of Public Prosecutions who is not accountable to this House.  If two people are killed crossing a road the Director of Public Prosecutions does not have to initiate prosecution proceedings or tell anyone the details, even the dead people's families.  There have been cases involving multiple deaths where he was right not to initiate prosecution proceedings &mdash; there is no point in having a show trial, and it may not be the fault of the person who was driving the car &mdash; but the families of these people should at least be given the details.  In some cases the book of evidence has not been ready on time.  Despite several warnings by the judge, some cases involving manslaughter have been dismissed because the book of evidence was not ready.  In a recent case a judge is alleged to have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions before he heard a case.  I do not know what he wrote but there should be some way of finding out if the proper procedure was followed.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that we should interfere with the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions but this is not to say he should not be accountable. Nobody is more independent than the Comptroller and Auditor General and he is accountable to this House. The same applies to the Attorney General on whom the courts have conferred more powers.  He is not accountable to the Government, let alone the Parliament, in the exercise of some of those powers.  Those other offices must be made more accountable.  We need a dose of democracy; in other words these offices should be made accountable to <Col N="1184" /> Deputies who have been given a mandate by the electorate.</P>
    <P>I want to mention an issue in passing which I hope will not give rise to controversy. Last Tuesday I had a very bad experience during Question Time about which I have written to the Ceann Comhairle.  The replies given at Question Time are drafted in such a way as to give as little information as possible and to camouflage the truth by appearing to state one thing while technically meaning another, and this after every device possible is used to disallow or transfer a question.  We allow this to take place. Those Deputies who will lose their seats at the next election &mdash; it happens at every election &mdash; will have the rest of their lives to ponder on what they achieved as a Member of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a kiss of death.  We will have served the country well if we make democracy work and make the system accountable.  The Government has a large majority and previous Governments with large majorities have fallen.  In time to come Government Ministers will find themselves on the backbenches or in Opposition &mdash; it is the natural cycle of things. We should not miss the opportunity to do something about this issue.  We have gone some way along the road but we need to go further.</P>
      <P>We should consider conferring new powers and responsibilities on the Ceann Comhairle who would be able to decide that it is contempt of Parliament to mislead this House or prepare a reply to a question which does not give the true picture in detail or spirit.  If this had been the case previously there would have been no need for court and ministerial appointed inspectors, inquiries and tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General that, taking account of debt servicing, gross receipts by the State amount to approximately £15 billion.  One per cent of that <Col N="1185" /> amount is £150 million, while 4 per cent is £600 million.  Does any Deputy who has spent time on a local authority or health board not believe that at least 1 per cent of this amount is being wasted? I am talking about central Exchequer spending, leaving aside what is being wasted on maintenance programmes etc.  That is the reality.  Because of bad practices huge sums of money are wasted.  The value for money powers of economy, efficiency and effective management of spending which the Comptroller and Auditor General was given in the legislation followed the report we brought to the Committee of Public Accounts, which &mdash; to its eternal credit &mdash; it endorsed and brought to this House.  We must encourage the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in every way possible to use those powers to bring about a sense of efficiency and economy in the public service generally, whether at national or local government level because that is a central and important function of parliament.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I learned much from being a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, in particular from Mr. McDonnell who was Comptroller and Auditor General during my time as chairman and most of my time as a member.  He will be sadly missed.  He is one of those great stalwarts of the public service who has a positive attitude to his duties, he contributed in a very significant way to the high standards of public service which we have come to expect.  I wish his successor well and I have no doubt he will follow the same tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak at this historic juncture, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As the Minister said, this is a vitally important appointment in the administration of the State.  The auditing of State expenditure and State revenue &mdash; which the Constitution provides for in Article 33 involves a high constitutional office. <Col N="1186" /> The Committee of Public Accounts, as my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte said, is a senior committee of this House.  The 12 parliamentary auditors, unfortunately still all male, carry out this function in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The appointment of a Comptroller and Auditor General is one of the most critical the Government can make.</P>
      <P>In echoing Deputy Mitchell's sentiments I am disappointed that the committee was not consulted about this appointment.  We take for granted the administration and bureaucracy which continues from year to year.  As the previous Deputy said, we may be here for only a short time but we are the ultimate representatives of the people.  The group of Deputies on the Committee of Public Accounts has vast experience.  In my case that experience is less than two years but it extends to four or five years in the case of Deputy Rabbitte and up to 13 or 14 years for Deputy Foley who has had a long and distinguished career on the committee.  While I support and commend the present appointment to the House it would have been a development of our democracy if there had been consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts, even if we did not go as far as the American system of hearings, etc.  I welcome the Courts and Court Officers Bill.  The appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a very important appointment of State and Deputies should be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that as we make this appointment the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been called into question.  There is an element of crisis in the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the Appropriation Accounts, 1993, there is an extraordinary account of what is becoming a dangerous impasse in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers.  Section 7 (5) of the tax amnesty legislation of last year was inserted at the request of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that no element or aspect of State expenditure <Col N="1187" /> was exempt from the supervision, examination and investigation of the Comptroller and Auditor General; in other words that his constitutional abilities would not be called into question.</P>
    <P>However, when he attempted to discharge his functions and examine all aspects of the tax amnesty, particularly the incentive amnesty from which most of the £200 million plus derived, and tried to present the sample exercise he had produced of the 1993 amnesty to parliament he was told by the Revenue Commissioners that this course of action is impossible because of the 1993 legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners say the Comptroller and Auditor General can discharge his powers in relation to all aspects of supervision, efficiency and so on but he cannot give us guidance on the relative merits of the operation of the 1993 amnesty because it would call into question the confidentiality aspect.  We are told that these concerns are shared by the chief special collector.  Effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General is allowed to audit the moneys received but not to give the committee guidance on the operation of this policy.  We have reached a dangerous position.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the week before last the Comptroller and Auditor General sought the guidance of the Attorney General in this matter who responded by saying that the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners was correct and that the information gleaned by the Comptroller and Auditor General could not be transmitted to the committee. At the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts this morning I urged the chairperson, if necessary, to pursue independent legal opinion in relation to this matter.  I disagree with the advice given because it calls into question a fundamental aspect of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It seems to suggest that the office of chief special collector &mdash; which we established last year &mdash; has dimensions over which the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="1188" /> General's supervision would be unconstitutional. In fact, the reverse is the case.  The office of chief special collector, if interpreted in that way, must be unconstitutional and the Comptroller and Auditor General must have the facility to deal with us.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago we discussed in this House the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.  In that report there was a clear pattern of organised tax evasion by the Goodman organisation, directed by the management and the managing director.  All aspects of that must come within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts and Parliament.  While we may not be able to take direct action in regard to the moneys lost to the State, we must know, in general terms at least, what money was effectively stolen from them by rogue businesses which are not prepared to follow the rule of law.  I do not agree with my colleague in this regard.  The vast bulk of people pay their taxes because they are PAYE workers.  There is no element of choice.  No area of Irish business should be exempt.  Indeed, all decent companies, small businesses, sole proprietorships and so on, discharge their tax liabilities, increasingly so in recent years. There cannot be any area where we can give credence or special concessions to people who have broken the law.  We have a role to play and such people cannot be allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts must support the new Comptroller and Auditor General in this matter to bring before it all relevant information and documents relating to the tax amnesty to allow us make recommendations to Government on the tax collection system. I hope it will not be necessary to have another tax amnesty and that we have drawn a line in the sand in that regard.  I also hope that from now on people who do not adhere to our taxation laws will be punished in the same way that most PAYE citizens are open to punishment if they evade paying their fair share of taxes.  There is a duty on the Committee of Public Accounts and <Col N="1189" /> the new Comptroller and Auditor General to pursue that matter, and pursue it we will.</P>
    <P>I extend best wishes to Patrick Laurence McDonnell and his family on his retirement.  He lives in my constituency and bearing in mind his great qualities I am sure he will not be inactive for very long.  During my time as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, Mr. McDonnell discharged his high constitutional office with great distinction, competence and diligence to the public interest, intense probity and a discerning ability to focus on any area of maladministration or poor value for public money through faulty policy guidelines handed down from Government. In his distinguished career the Minister of State has also been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and I am sure he will agree that Mr. McDonnell adopted a quiet calm and almost understated approach in his advice to the committee.  He has done the nation a great service and will be missed by the committee and Parliament. I am sure all Members wish him a happy and fruitful retirement.</P>
    <P>I welcome and commend to the House the appointment of John Purcell as the new Comptroller and Auditor General.  I referred to consultation with the committee, and had we been consulted we would have been delighted to support the nomination.  During the past two years I have got to know, to like and appreciate the fine abilities of Mr. Purcell.  In his role as director of audit he assisted Mr. McDonnell with very calm, detached and professional integrity in dealing with the different areas of State administration and expenditure.  I am sure he will continue to do that as Comptroller and Auditor General of the State.  He is still a very young man and it is remarkable that he has spent almost 30 years in the service of the State in the audit office.  He certainly has long experience to bring to bear on his new job.  During the past two years I noted in particular his interest in the State auditing and accounting systems of other European Union countries. <Col N="1190" /> The experience he gained from liaising with auditors in Europe will benefit the administration of State audits here.  I look forward to working closely with Mr. Purcell and I am confident he will have an equally distinguished career to that of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Approximately 15 months ago I welcomed important legislation introduced by the Minister of State, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which extended to the Comproller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts new powers to audit health boards, vocational education committees, harbour authorities and other bodies. The legislation also extended our remit into the area of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, a way forward to examine all aspects of State finances.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot express an opinion on the merits of policy, he will have at his disposal an armoury of new powers relating to State administration and I hope he will extend his remit wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to State-sponsored bodies and the criticism of the well-paid executives.  For example, when referring to the national television authority it was alleged that some broadcasters earn between £250,000 and £500,000 compared to the measly salaries of Deputies and, indeed, Ministers for the work they carry out.  It is important that the Committee of Public Accounts should not be afraid to examine all aspects of State administration and that it does not hive off any of its role to other committees of the House, such as the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  The Committee of Public Accounts must have the final say.</P>
    <P>I echo the comments of my colleagues. The former chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts does not appear to be aware that the proceedings of the committee are not televised.  That cannot take place until the legislation on compellability of witnesses is passed. <Col N="1191" /> Much of the important work carried out by that committee is therefore lost to the public.  For example, my constituents have never seen me questioning or interrogating accounting officers on that committee.  We must ensure the proceedings of that committee are televised. I know the Minister is committed to bringing forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As members of the Committee of Public Accounts, from time to time we would like to be consulted about ongoing auditing work.  I recently accompanied the new Comptroller and Auditor General to Finland where members of the Committee of Public Accounts are called parliamentary state auditors.  While their Comptroller and Auditor General is preparing the yearly accounts, the members work with him, whereas we must wait for the end result and tease out the audit on the advice of our Comptroller and Auditor General. Under the Finnish system members of the committee play an ongoing auditing role.  Perhaps our new Comptroller and Auditor General will examine the possibility of operating such a system here.</P>
    <P>We do not get adequate support for research and information systems.  The former Secretary of the Department of Finance, Mr. Cromien, invited us to his Department and advised us on aspects of the disbursement and taking in of funds.  He gave an interesting talk on the system of auditing which operates in New Zealand where all State assets are audited.  At any time one can get a bottom line balance on the Finances of the State in terms of wealth or poverty.  As the new Comptroller and Auditor General is interested in international practices he may consider the development of annual accounting on the lines of the system in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The former chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputy Gay Mitchell, referred to special reports such as that of the beef tribunal, a matter on which there was extensive criticism at meetings of our committee.  The main committees of the House could <Col N="1192" /> have carried out much of the work involved in the tribunal at a much cheaper cost.  Of course that would mean the committee would have to seek legal opinion, and witnesses would also be legally represented.  While I accept it would involve additional cost to the relevant committee it would be much cheaper than the expensive method used to ascertain the happenings in our beef industry.</P>
    <P>I should like the incoming Comptroller and Auditor General to examine all aspects of European Union funding in relation to our accounts.  We have already met the outgoing Irish Auditor of the European Court of Auditors, Mr. Richie Ryan, who spoke to us some six or eight months ago.  He said there was some disquiet about the manner in which European funding was administered throughout the Irish Government system, stating that in some areas of administration &mdash; whether through FEOGA, the Structural Fund, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, or any other section of State administration &mdash; it is very difficult to identify European funding.  Of course, it works the other way round in that over the next seven or eight years, in addition to receiving £14 billion from Europe, we will contribute £3 billion over the next distribution period of Structural Funds.  Therefore, we should like to know where our contribution of £3 billion goes.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General on his distinguished service and welcome his successor, Mr. John Purcell, who I know will have a very distinguished career and will encourage the Government and Minister for Finance to expand the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, in particular giving its members some assistance in resolving the current impasse, establishing the principle that there is no area of State administration free from investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised with which I intend to deal fairly quickly. However, one in which I do not intend to become involved because I do not consider it proper, is that in relation to the audit of the incentive amnesty which, as many Members said, is still being considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not intend to comment on it except to say that, in the normal course of events, the Committee of Public Accounts will give its views on the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Minister for Finance who, in turn, will respond to the committee in writing.</P>

    <P>A number of Members, including Deputy Broughan, referred to the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts not being televised.  I made the point, to RTE in particular, that there is no earthly reason, as far as I am concerned, as Government Chief Whip, for not televising the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The problem and difficulty lies with RTE, its fear of the libel and contempt laws and the matter of privilege and accountability. I pointed out to RTE that at present something could be said at any committee meeting that might be libellous but that, because of the manner in which it investigates things, edits news items and so on, it does not need that privilege.  I replied to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts who raised this matter with me some time ago to the effect that at present there is nothing to prevent the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts being televised.  Perhaps the committee would wish to take up that matter. However, the understandable fear on the part of RTE is in the overall area of compellability of witnesses and, in this <Col N="1194" /> particular case, of privilege.  I am pleased to inform the House that I have seen the first draft of the relevant Bill in respect of which probably minor changes will have to be agreed and implemented but I am very confident it will be published this session.  I hope it will reach the House in this session.  If members of the Committee of Public Accounts wish to convey their views to me, even before the Bill is published, I will be more than willing to listen and endeavour to take them on board.</P>
    <P>In this debate I listened to several Members opposite make accusations of non-accountability of Government to this House.  I regard them all as a load of nonsense, in particular the most recent false allegations against the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who answered questions in this House for one and a half hours over the past two days.  Most neutral observers, we will take it that most media people, certainly reporters, are neutral observers &mdash; are in agreement that the Minister answered any questions put to him.  Therefore, it is nonsense for Members to allege that the Government does not want to render itself accountable to this House.  The Opposition have several means of raising matters &mdash; Question Time, Private Notice Questions &mdash; which they have used very effectively in the past two days &mdash; and Adjournment debates, and, although it is not in order, they use the Order of Business to raise matters of this nature.  In addition, there is Private Members' time.  If Fine Gael is serious that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications misled this House, I challenge it to use its Private Members' time next week to lay that allegation before the House and substantiate it.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter in general, there has been a great deal of talk on the part of the Opposition about threats to democracy.  The greatest threat to democracy is this latest splurge of accusations, half truths, innuendoes and drummed-up moral outrage on the part of certain sections of the Opposition; <Col N="1195" /> that does democracy more harm than anything the Government is doing.  New lows are plumbed every week by certain sections of the Opposition.  When they talk about threats to democracy, they are in fact undermining and using the privilege of this House to make accusations they know to be totally untrue and unfounded.  That is a scandalous abuse of the privilege of this House, a privilege we should all guard and defend.  If privilege is abused, next we shall have a whole series of calls for it to be curtailed in some way because of its abuse by Members, when we shall have nobody but ourselves to blame.</P>
    <P>I challenge Deputy Hogan to substantiate, by way of specific motion before this House, the accusations he made against the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  If his concern is genuine he will do so and afford the Minister the opportunity to do what he has done already, to refute those allegations.  I also challenge Deputies Hogan and Harney to make the accusations they made in the House, including one they made this morning which involved me, outside this House.  If they do not do that, they should have the courtesy and grace to come back into this House and withdraw their remarks. I refer in particular to Deputy Harney's accusation this morning that a meeting took place between me, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Taoiseach, after which, pressure was exerted on a civil servant to take a particular course of action.  A meeting of that kind did not take place. I have not spoken to the Minister, except in passing this morning, before the Order of Business.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges met last evening.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was in the House when I went to that committee and I did not see him again until this morning.  Therefore, I want that accusation withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell paid very generous and well deserved tributes to the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="1196" /> General and to the former Secretary of the Department of Finance, Mr. Cromien, in addition to a very considered contribution on a subject on which I know Deputy Mitchell could speak for hours, the rights of Members of this House, I agree with many of his points, if we want to effect changes, this is the way to do so, by responsible suggestions and debate across the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan and others referred to the powers of parliamentary committees to investigate.  I am charged with bringing forward a document to Government on alternatives to a tribunal, but I am not sure that broadening the scope of the Committee of Public Accounts, as suggested by Deputy Broughan, to enable it to be an investigating committee is the correct thing to do.  That committee does a good job in the area it covers.  I would hate to see it cluttered up with further responsibility.  However, I appreciate the point he and Deputy Mitchell made about the need to have a strong committee of investigation in this House to obviate the need for tribunals, particularly to investigate matters that can be dealt with by the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter adverted to by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Ferris &mdash; it is good to see Deputy Ferris back in full voice and showing no ill effects following his recent illness.  A headline in one of the national newspapers, followed by the broadcast media and other elements of the print media, alleged that Deputies were, effectively, receiving £690 a day for the work they are doing.  That figure was based on the fact that the House would sit about 93 days per year.  That figure was divided into the salary of £32,000 a year that a Deputy receives to arrive at the sum of £690.  I did not check the figure but I presume, the answer was correct.  As to the accuracy of the rest of the article, I have some doubt.</P>
    <P>That method of calculating ignored the work of committees of this House. It is expected that they will have sat up <Col N="1197" /> to 300 times by the end of this year. Apart from duties in the House and on committees Deputies and Senators &mdash; Deputies in particular because the accusation was levelled at them &mdash; also have duties to attend to in their constituencies. It is all very well for people who are well paid and articulate and who know their way around the bureaucracy to tell Deputies that they should not involve themselves in the affairs of their constituents, that they should not be available to their constituents nor seek to represent them on a personal and general basis.  Such people will probably never need a politician to articulate their fears, to work through the maze of bureaucracy and explain or fill in forms etc.  There are people who, for one reason or another, need somebody to do such things for them or at least point them in the right direction and I make no apology to those who are well paid and well connected for doing that job. It is a duty we as public representatives have to perform and is additional to our duty to legislate.</P>
    <P>It amounts to a sleight of hand for such people to continually knock politicians for being close to the people and familiar with their needs.  I am as well informed about the needs of my constituents and people generally as a result of holding weekly clinics as I would be by listening to the advice of civil servants etc.  It will be a day to regret if Members abandon the principle of being close to the people.  I have no doubt that we would all be condemned outright by the same people who made the allegations at the weekend if we were remote from the people.</P>
    <P>I hope the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General and the new appointee will forgive me, and other Members, for digressing a little from what should be a happy occasion albeit tinged with a certain amount of sadness.  I had the great privilege of serving on the Committee of Public Accounts with the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General at a time of exciting development under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Gay Mitchell.  At that time there were five <Col N="1198" /> years of accounts to be dealt with due to the number of elections that took place.  I have no doubt about the efficiency and effectiveness of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I wish Mr. McDonnell a happy and active retirement.  I also wish the incoming Comptroller and Auditor General, John Purcell, every success. My wish for him is that he will be as good as the retiring Comptroller and Auditor General.  If he is, nobody will have any complaints in 20 years time when he retires.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I welcome this important step forward in regard to the rights of women in employment, particularly those who are pregnant.  The legislation is modest because the directive was modest in its requirements of member states.  It was fiercely fought for at all stages and, as is so often the case in that kind of situation, the mean or less is the best that can be achieved.  What is in the directive, and hence in our legislation, is minimal.  The Minister referred to the possibility of further progress on parental leave, in the Department of Social Welfare in the context of levels of payment and in the Department of Labour in the context of regulations on health and safety.  The Minister is certainly honouring his obligations under the directive and he has gone a little further in some areas.  He did not deal with levels of pay, which is the responsibility of another Minister.  As a proposal this <Col N="1199" /> falls far short of the hopes of many of the groups representing women.  In particular it falls short of the recommendations in the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women whose primary objective was to ensure that legislation brought maternity and paternity leave entitlements close to the European average.  I will refer later to how far out of line we are with some European countries.</P>
      <P>The legislation is welcome, particularly the proposal to provide health and safety leave.  Many issues will be clarified, including the possibility of pregnant women losing their jobs because of a controversy over their rights and ability to perform their duties at work.  The Bill will afford greater security for pregnant workers.  The entitlements of pregnant workers will be clarified for employers and employees.  The legislation, introduced as required by the directive, represents a major improvement in this area.  The Minister indicated that work on the regulations to implement the Bill was afoot in another Department.  The Minister is beset by the problem that this legislation is the responsibility of two or three Departments and it is often difficult to pursue matters adequately.  In assessing its impact it will be important to know the detail of regulations which will implement much of the Bill.  Will the Minister indicate when he expects the required regulations from his Department, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the refinements from the Department of Social Welfare will be available?  When will workers be able to benefit from the provisions of the Bill?  Reference is made to the commencement date being decided by way of regulation.  The Minister should give an indication of a realistic commencement date.  Every month that passes is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of paid leave for antenatal care is welcome, as is recognition of the needs of breast feeding mothers. These issues were last considered during the debate on the unfair dismissals <Col N="1200" /> Bill, when it was claimed that some employers dismissed employees on discovering they were pregnant.  The House was assured that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform would deal with the issue in this Bill.  Many of the real problems experienced by pregnant women in terms of their inability to perform certain duties have been addressed in a supportive manner.  As we are awaiting details of regulations from the Department of Enterprise and Employment we have yet to learn the extent of those provisions.</P>
    <P>The directive addressed the area of risk assessment.  That should be clarified. The Minister was only able to indicate that a provision was being prepared. That issue was addressed in some detail at the ICTU conference in March in the context of the directive on pregnancy. On that occasion a senior official in the health and safety executive spoke about the requirements.  The Bill clarifies that the requirement for risk assessment will be triggered by the giving of notice to a pregnant employee.  Will the general health and safety regulations and the requirement to have risks assessed be adequate to deal with this matter?  An amendment will be needed to deal with the specific areas identified in the annex to the directive.  It is important for employers that those provisions are spelt out.  It would be helpful if the Minister could give an indication of the current state of preparation of the regulations for that area which is central to the Bill.  It is difficult to address that matter when the detailed application of the requirement to engage in risk assessment is the responsibility of another Minister and will be included in another set of regulations.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women considered that area and it will welcome the implementation of the first of its major recommendations, namely, the implementation of the directive on pregnancy although it will be concerned the Bill does not go further.  The Minister indicated, although not in great detail, that he is addressing the issue of parental leave. <Col N="1201" /> The commission, the Congress of Trade Unions and the national and international women's bodies who considered this area realise that the issues of pregnancy, employment and the participation of women in the workforce are directly related.  We have the lowest level of participation of women in the workforce, the lowest level of maternity leave in the European Union and like a handful of countries we do not have paternity leave.  It is not an accident that the net effect of that and other factors specific to our labour force is that women are not actively participating in the workforce because they do not have adequate support to do so.  Until the issue of paternity leave is addressed the burden of combining work and family is borne entirely by the woman.  Nothing in our law or social welfare regulations, other than the amendment in this legislation which only operates if a woman dies, suggests it is normal or appropriate that a father should share parental duties.  A man can undertake many of the tasks associated with children, such as taking them for their post-natal check up.  If we want women to participate in the workforce, as many women wish to do, we should facilitate, encourage and insist on giving men the opportunity to participate in caring for children and show that, as a State, we believe such efforts should be supported.</P>
    <P>Groups such as the Second Commission on the Status of Women wish to see this area developed.  They have been backed enthusiastically by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which adopted and supported a number of their aims and ambitions.  However, among the issues not dealt with is levels of pay and this is being discussed in a vacuum.  The Minister referred to the work that will be done in the Department of Social Welfare on the levels of various benefits and their application. This matter was fought with great intensity in the preparation of the directive and it was the lower median that won out.</P>
    <P>This issue is of great relevance to Ireland.  If we consider the statistics <Col N="1202" /> from the different countries, we are among the lowest in terms of levels of payment, we are the lowest in duration of payment and we do not provide for parental leave.  Bearing that in mind, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, supported the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, and requested that issues such as replacement of staff absent from work due to maternity or parental leave be addressed, but that is not adequately done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A Bill on adoptive leave is going through the Houses of the Oireachtas at present.  It is another important step in achieving an adequate legislative framework for men and women in rearing their children.  There has been a modest request for five days paternity leave by 1995.</P>
    <P>In the debate on paternity leave and family leave at European level the point has been made, based on experience of the types of paternity and parental leave available in other jurisdictions, that there should be designated leave for both parents.  Maternity leave is designated at the minimum level of 14 weeks. An element of leave should be designated as exclusively available to the father.  There is nothing in legislation to support this view.  It would be a great step forward in a society where men and women share responsibilities equally.  It would reduce the pressure on women who combine working with child rearing and would enrich the lives of the father who would have a greater opportunity, with the support of the State, to become involved in the care of his children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to repeal the current legislation and bring in a new Bill.  The general complexities of legislation are added to if there is masses of amending legislation.  It is important that legislation that affects workers rights is easily understood and is as accessible as possible.  The Minister has taken that into account.  However, further amendment of the Unfair Dismissals Act is involved and there is need to consolidate that legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the way in <Col N="1203" /> which at European level the lowest common denominator seems to dominate in these areas.  I was often disappointed that in the past Irish representatives hid behind the skirts of their conservative British colleagues who are normally forced into applying social legislation.  In view of our broad support for the Social Chapter, I hope we will be more adventurous in future.  Reservations among the business sector, were clearly expressed by Declan Madden of IBEC, about the recommendations of the commission and they must be taken into account.  Countries successful in creating employment and ensuring an effective, productive workforce are those with the highest level of protection for their workers.  In the context of the current growth in our economy, we should strive not for minimal standards but for the best possible standards and, if at all possible, the ideal.</P>
    <P>Despite the adoption by the Commission as early as 1983 of a proposal on paternity leave in the context of promoting equal opportunities for women, this proposal has been consistently blocked.  There will be another round of discussion on this matter and the directive is being finalised.  I welcome the accession of the northern European countries whose standards of protection for employees are very high.  We should be to the forefront in encouraging protection of workers.  Ultimately it will lead to better quality employment and greater productivity.</P>
    <P>I hope before long the Minister will be back in the House with further proposals on parental leave.  In his reply to the debate perhaps he will comment on his consultations with the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Social Welfare on the consequences of this legislation. I hope he will give an indication of the proposed deadlines on the making of regulations in his Department.  I welcome the legislation.  It represents a very valuable European input into Irish legislation.  As a female colleague said, if it were not for the European directive this legislation would not have been <Col N="1204" /> introduced for a number of decades. Women, particularly working women, owe a great deal to the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Ireland has a proud record in the quality of its medical, maternity and social care. This is well recognised in Europe and throughout the developed world.  The Bill brings us up-to-date in our obligations under EU law and fulfils commitments given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work 1993-97.</i></P>
      <P>The legislation will have implications for many Government Departments, including the Department of Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise and Employment, Social Welfare and Health.  It provides for improvements and greater flexibility in regard to the employment of pregnant workers or workers in the postpartum period or who are breastfeeding.  It introduces new rights for husbands in cases where the mother dies during pregnancy.  This rarely occurs thanks to the high standard of antenatal, in-hospital and postpartum care provided by consultants and general practitioners.  The Bill also re-enacts the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, with amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New sections dealing with the entitlement to leave on health and safety grounds where suitable alternative work is not available in the workplace may not be to the liking of employers, especially those who employ primarily female workforces.  Employers will point out that these are social and health regulations and the expense should not have to be met by them, especially at a time of stiff international competition.  They have a point but the regulations are not as demanding as those in other jurisdictions.  Given that there are fewer than 60,000 deliveries per annum and most places of employment are of a high standard and will not prevent pregnant workers from continuing their work during pregnancy this <Col N="1205" /> should not act as a deterrent to hiring female staff.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to provide protection under the Redundancy Payments Act where a company ceases to trade or is insolvent.  Given the upturn in the economy I hope this will happen less frequently. The financial aspects and implications are elucidated.  Further legislation or regulations will be required in the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance which I understand the Department of Social Welfare is in the process of implementing.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for greater flexibility to take leave in cases involving prematurity, post-maturity and where the mother is breastfeeding.  Workers will also be allowed to take leave to attend antenatal and postnatal clinics without penalty and to take leave under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act.  It appears there are some omissions. For example, there is no reference to certain problems associated with pregnancy, including hyperemesis or excessive vomiting in the first three months of pregnancy, threatened abortions and miscarriages.  In such circumstances pregnant women need special care and protection.  As these complications cannot be considered to be illnesses <i>per se</i> some reference should have been made to them in the Bill. They should not lead to these patients being classified as sick and unavailable for work as pregnancy is not an illness.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals primarily with the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European Union.  Perhaps we would open a can of worms if we were to take all these matters into consideration.  As we are leaders in the field when it comes to maternity care we should also take the lead in introducing social and protective legislation in relation to pregnant women.  I welcome the Bill as it represents further progress for women's health and welfare during pregnancy.  I ask the Minister to assist employers in any way he can to make the efficient working of the Bill as painless as any labour should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Laoighis-Offaly</i>): <Col N="1206" /> Listening to the debate yesterday and today it is clear that this legislation has received widespread support.  Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Moffatt made worthwhile contributions and the points they raised need to be taken into account in legislation and social policy. The position here is in stark contrast with that across the water where social legislation is frowned upon by the Government which has been in power since 1979.  It is a sign that we have a healthy regard for the needs of people that legislation such as this can command widespread support in this House.</P>
      <P>Recently there was a number of public announcements and statements by IBEC and other organisations to the effect that European social legislation will have a detrimental impact on the business and economic life of the country. While IBEC, which is one of the social partners, has a right and duty to express this view the benefits which flow from our membership of the European Union form part of a <i>quid pro quo.</i> In return we have ceded sovereignty and endured losses due to liberalisation of trade.  It is fair and appropriate, given that we have agreed to participate in the Single Market with the free movement of people, goods and services, that we should receive the full benefits under social and protective legislation agreed at European Union level.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the accession of the four new member states &mdash; Austria and Finland which have already voted in favour and Sweden and Norway which I hope will follow.  I agree with Deputy Flaherty that these countries, where social and protective legislation is in place, can be of assistance to Ireland which is continuing to try to benefit from such provisions given that member states such as the United Kingdom are determined to move in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both this week and last week the Houses considered the question of European Union enlargement.  Deputy Michael McDowell's contribution to that debate was very disappointing.  In particular he deprecated the Social <Col N="1207" /> Chapter.  It is important that Irish people can avail of its protection.  I expressed the criticism that it does not go far enough; a minimalist approach has been adopted.  Deputy McDowell and others who blindly follow the low wage, low skill philosophy of the British Government should realise that we are being compensated for the disadvantages incurred through our participation in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>This Bill is giving effect to the decision of October 1992 of the Council of Ministers.  The formulation and implementation of European directives is fraught with difficulty and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is trying to come to grips with the topic.  Previously a committee of this House dealt with secondary legislation, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs deals with it now.  This is a complex and demanding task and I hope that proposed directives and draft directives can be considered by this House before they are finally formulated. It has taken about two years to implement this directive, which is certainly not as long as other directives have taken.  Its introduction is timely.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives effect to a directive which protects not only pregnant workers but those who have recently given birth and those who are breast feeding.  We should continually try to extend such protection.  The Bill re-enacts existing legislation together with new provisions.  This makes things easier for trade union officials and personnel managers as well as making legislation more accessible to workers who are trying to find out their rights.  The law is often obscure and inaccessible.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of welcome measures.  It extends the protection of maternity legislation to all employees who notify their employers of their condition regardless of the hours they work and their length of service. It is important that we are continually trying to keep our legislation up-to-date with changes in the workplace. Over the past decade there has been <Col N="1208" /> increasing casualisation of the workforce with a big increase in part-time, temporary and contract employment. Women are more likely than men to be in this type of employment.  This Bill is in step with those changes.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform, the labour affairs section of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Social Welfare will have to monitor continuously the changes in the nature of the workforce and the requisite changes in regulations.</P>
    <P>The protection offered to contract workers is being extended and improved by this Bill and the situation of those employed through employment agencies is being clarified.  This Bill extends protection not only to those who are pregnant and those on maternity leave but to those who have given birth within the previous 14 weeks or are breast feeding up to 26 weeks after the birth.  This is an example of how the legislation can support and promote good developments in parenting. The provisions for improved leave with pay for those receiving ante and postnatal care is very welcome.  Deputy Moffatt expressed my sentiments in this regard and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  Under this Bill time off with pay will be available for antenatal and postnatal care.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks the introduction, in a small way, of provisions for fathers to take leave.  It certainly is not cause for jubilation that a father would have to avail of these provisions following the death of the mother of his child but nevertheless it is a significant step that leave for fathers is being introduced. This issue needs to be addressed further and I am glad to note in the Minister's statement yesterday that the question of paternity is being examined in his Department and work is being done at European level.  I urge him to contribute as forcefully as possible at European level to drawing up directives on paternity leave.  He should not wait too long to extend this provision which has been introduced in a limited way in this <Col N="1209" /> Bill.  Perhaps we could look at its operations in our own jurisdiction and try to improve on it further.</P>
    <P>One of the best innovations in this legislation is the introduction of health and safety leave for women who are pregnant, who have recently given birth or who are breast feeding.  It is important where issues of health and safety arise for such workers that employers try to find alternative duties for them.  This legislation will give a significant push to employers who perhaps are not as co-operative as they could be or aware of the need.  The protection for night workers is also welcome.  Where a doctor certifies that night work is detrimental to the person who is pregnant, has given birth recently or is breast feeding a child, it may be possible to try to find alternative day time employment. Where this is not possible, either for night workers or other workers who need alternative postings, health and safety leave will be introduced.  I understand it is proposed that three weeks leave would be provided by the employer and that the Department of Social Welfare would introduce a scheme to continue that leave for a further period.  I look forward to its introduction as quickly as possible. When people see the provisions of this Bill in force these are the questions they will raise.  The sooner they can be answered the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the greater use of the rights commissioner process which is included in this Bill.  Having participated in a number of appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal I commend the work, diligence and fairness of the tribunal, but we know it can take quite some time for both sides to have their case heard.  People find it off-putting that it may take between six and eight months, or longer if there is an adjournment, for a case to be resolved by the tribunal.  Any mechanism to resolve disputes without recourse to the final tribunal is welcome.  It is also more speedy and accessible and possibly less costly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> Let me address the issue of monitoring and implementing workers legislation. I realise that what was known as the industrial inspectorate is not under the aegis of the Minister's Department, but the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Enterprise and Employment should consider the question of the monitoring and implementation of such legislation.  I have found that people have the perception there is a gap between a law that is enacted in this House, which guarantees them certain legal protections, and their experience when they seek that protection in the workplace or in other areas of their daily lives.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be widespread and effective advertising of this legislation's provisions when they are enacted into law.  I ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on this whole area to see what improvements can be made to make people more aware of their rights and, more importantly, to give them access to the necessary support and advice if that is necessary.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.  I look forward to continuing improvements in the area of equality and law reform.  The Minister launched another important Bill this morning.  I am glad that legislation is being produced regularly in his Department and I look forward to the introduction of much more legislation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has been described as modest but I believe it represents a milestone in terms of social legislation and progress in maternal and parental leave and parental rights generally.  The Bill complies with the commitments in the EU Council Directive 92/85/EEC and also meets the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which was agreed by the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to provide improved maternity protection for pregnant employees, employees who have recently given birth or employees who <Col N="1211" /> are breastfeeding.  In addition to existing protection afforded under the Maternity Protection Acts of 1981 and 1991, which will be re-enacted with amendments by this Bill, a number of new provisions are proposed.  These include the extension of the scope of the proposed Bill to virtually all employees, the granting of leave on health and safety grounds where a risk exists in accordance with the regulations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act where it is not objectively feasible to transfer the employee to suitable alternative work or to remove her from risk.  It includes the payment by employers of an allowance to be determined by regulations.  It also provides employees with time off, without loss of pay, for ante and post natal medical visits. It provides for the maintenance of employment rights in respect of periods during which health and safety leave measures apply and it includes the prohibition of dismissal from the beginning of pregnancy to the end of maternal leave for any pregnancy related reason.</P>
    <P>The Bill also covers the question of payment by employers during the first three weeks of health and safety leave. This provision was included to oblige employers to provide remuneration during the first three weeks of health and safety leave.  It also provides for leave for the father of the child in the event of the mother's death during the first ten weeks following the birth.  Special leave entitlements will apply to employed fathers where the mother of their child dies during the first ten weeks following the birth.  The Bill provides that this provision will apply to fathers irrespective of whether the mother of their living child was in paid employment.  This is a welcome development as many of us have known cases where a father was required to give up work on the death of his wife in order to look after young children.  This section represents progress in that whole area.</P>
    <P>The Minister will introduce regulations under the Bill to provide for the <Col N="1212" /> payment by employers of an appropriate allowance to employees during the first three weeks of leave.  The Bill also provides for regulations for time off for ante and post natal medical visits without loss of pay.  It also provides for the certification by employers of the existence of risk and of the non-feasibility of transferring an employee to suitable alternative work.  It includes also regulations for the procedures to be followed in relation to the submission and hearing of disputes and appeals.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some observations made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in its submission to the Minister on the Bill.  Perhaps when replying the Minister might comment on some of the points the congress has raised.  Congress has an important role to play as it has represented women in the workforce and has been to the fore in advocating reforms in this whole area of women's rights and protection for pregnant employees.</P>
    <P>Congress is concerned about a number of proposals in the Bill.  It is concerned that there is not any provision to implement the recommendations on maternity and parental leave contained in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which recommended amendments to the maternity legislation to bring maternity and parental leave entitlements into line with the European average.  It also recommended a substantial increase in the ceiling of £11,000 per annum for maternity benefit, provision for the replacement of staff on maternity or parental leave and the full implementation of the provisions of the pregnancy directive.</P>
    <P>The congress has welcomed the 1994 budget changes which increased the threshold for maternity benefit from £11,000 to £11,350 per annum.  It expressed the wish that this would be increased each year in line with inflation.  It also recommended that the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, increased the entitlement of paid maternity leave from 14 to 16 weeks and unpaid leave from four to ten weeks to <Col N="1213" /> bring Ireland into line with the European average.</P>
    <P>Congress also made comments and observations about some of the definitions in the articles of the Directive.  The definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; meets the requirement of Article 1 of the directive, but congress makes the point that an interpretation of &ldquo;pregnant worker&rdquo;, &ldquo;worker who has recently given birth&rdquo; or &ldquo;worker who is breastfeeding&rdquo; needs to be included to meet the requirements of article 2.  It also makes some points in relation to night work which was referred to by my colleague, Deputy Pat Gallagher.  Congress has expressed the wish that it would like further consultation on this area before any regulations are brought into effect.</P>
    <P>The congress is recommending an increase in maternity leave above the provisions of the directive to bring Ireland into line with the European average.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rights of an employee to take maternity leave, the 1981 Act requires employees to take four weeks before and four weeks after the birth.  Article 8 of the EU Directive requires two weeks before and two weeks after the birth.  Congress is recommending, therefore, that the provisions of the existing Maternity Protection Act, 1981, be retained to ensure adequate health and safety protection for women workers, particularly those in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The congress also made comments in relation to ante and post natal care.  It recommends that the full range of medical care is needed during and after pregnancy, including paid time off to attend ante natal classes.  The area of dismissal is dealt with in article 10 and congress makes the point that this provision needs to be expanded to include the provisions of article 10, section 2, which requires that an employer must cite fully substantiated grounds for dismissing an employee covered by this directive.</P>
    <P>In relation to the right of redress in article 12, congress makes the point that <Col N="1214" /> it should be made clear from the proposal whether it will be open to all workers to use this procedure if the current restrictions of the 1981 Act apply in relation to civil and public service employees.  It is recommending that the right of redress be open to all workers regardless of their employment status or employer, as provided in article 12 of the directive.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pay and employment rights in article 11, the congress is of the opinion that this proposal might mitigate against many women workers in the low paid workforce and whose jobs are already insecure.  Those women are in extremely vulnerable positions in the workforce and currently find it difficult to get time off for ante natal care. Congress feels that women in this position would be afraid to take health and safety leave if the employer had to pay for it as they would fear losing their jobs in addition to the difficulty they might experience in seeking to get paid for this time off.</P>
    <P>Congress takes the view that this provision might lead to discrimination against women having access to and employment in workplaces where health and safety leave is required to meet the provisions of the directive.  It seeks that payment, at least at the rate of current maternity benefit, should be made by the State during health and safety leave.</P>
    <P>As regards the health and safety articles, it makes the point that these are to be implemented by the Health and Safety Authority.  It points out that there is an overlap between some of these provisions and those to be implemented under the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994.  It recommends that the enforcement roles of the Health and Safety Authority and the Employment Appeals Tribunal be clearly defined to ensure workers have quick and clear access to redress in the event of an employer breaching the legislation.</P>
    <P>Congress welcomes the proposal to transfer to the father the residual maternity leave entitlements in the event of the death of the mother during <Col N="1215" /> childbirth as a first step in recognising the role and needs of men in parenting. It recommends that this provision be backed up by paternity and parental leave to allow women and men to combine work and family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it before the House.  It is a milestone in social legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who participated in the debate.  They displayed a detailed knowledge of the complex nature of the subject matter.</P>
      <P>The preparation of this Bill involved considerable detailed co-ordination between a number of Departments.  The technical nature and aspects of the directive gave rise to time consuming consultations.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Currie, I confirm that the guidelines to be issued by the European Commission have not yet been drawn up and this has undoubtedly contributed to the difficulty of finalising implementation here.  The Health and Safety Authority is primarily responsible for adoption of these guidelines.  In the absence of Commission guidelines, I understand the Authority is developing national provisions in this area.  The Bill will enable us to minimise any delay in meeting the directive implementation requirements.</P>
      <P>One of the important features of the Bill is its comprehensive coverage of all pregnant employees, employees who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding.  While an estimated one-third of the 50,000 or so births annually are to women in employment covered under the 1981 Act, some employees were not protected as that Act excluded some workers by reference to the hours of work or the fixed term nature of their contracts.  No such qualifications arise now, and that is right and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and Costello raised the question of cover for self-employed workers.  I would like to see <Col N="1216" /> progress made in this area.  However, this legislation deals with the protection of employees and their rights.  Self-employed workers regulate their own terms of employment and are not covered under such protective legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus and Deputy O'Donnell considered that the maternity leave provision was too short and Deputy Seán Kenny referred to the representations made by Congress.  The question of extending maternity leave or additional maternity leave arises in any review of maternity protection legislation.  I know that the second Commission on the Status of Women, as many Deputies stated, recommended that some extension should be considered. While I have not provided an extension in this Bill, I am not ruling out the possibility of such a move in the future.  However, it could be premature to instigate such a measure at this time while deliberations at EU level on parental leave and at national level on leave generally are at a relatively early stage.  Notwithstanding such deliberations, I have included in the Bill power to extend by order the periods of maternity leave and additional maternity leave, with the consent of my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.  Any response to the question of providing parental or paternity leave should await firm developments at EU level and nationally under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> so that the views of unions and employers can be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Very important considerations arise for employees and employers if statutory provisions are to be made introducing new or additional periods of leave for family, parental or similar purposes. I am firmly committed to making progress in this area and have secured Government support for the proposed EU directive on parental leave.  Unfortunately, the necessary consensus at EU level has not been achieved and the proposal is now back with the Commission, which is examining other options for <Col N="1217" /> progressing it.  The position of the Irish Government was made clear at all ministerial meetings I attended: we support the concept of parental leave.  At the last meeting I attended, the Commissioner indicated he would re-examine the directive in the light of the Maastricht guidelines.  I share the support Deputies Fitzgerald, O'Donnell, McManus, Wallace and Kenny expressed for the issue and will work towards the provision of family friendly policies and the encouragement of such practices and initiatives in the workplace.</P>
    <P>A number of points arose regarding the new entitlement to health and safety leave.  I do not think any Deputy can question the imperative requirement that full account should be taken in legislation of the basic health and safety matters that arise for women workers in a maternity context.  This is a new provision. As with anything new, there may be confusion as to how it will work in practice.  There is no useful Irish experience on which to make firm predictions. Nevertheless, in discussion with the occupational health and safety professionals of the Health and Safety Authority, it was intimated that very few workers will require this type of leave.  It is doubtful whether any but a small minority of employments contain serious risks for pregnant or other workers covered by the Bill.  In most employments where risks exist preventative protective work adjustment or alternative work options will be available.  Only in a few workplaces will granting of the leave entitlement be warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell inquired as to when the health and safety provisions would be put in place.  Regulations in this area are imminent and will be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher raised the question of social welfare regulations.  The Department of Social Welfare have already introduced regulations to give effect to the payment of employees on <Col N="1218" /> health and safety leave from the fourth week onwards.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing consultations between the Departments concerned and I assure Deputies that consultations with ICTU and IBEC will be undertaken as the matter progresses.</P>
    <P>There is obvious concern among employers in particular about their liability to pay the employee for the first weeks of leave.  Deputy Currie referred to this at length.  I have reviewed this concern but I am still persuaded that the employer's contribution towards the cost of the leave is fully justified.  In cases where this leave is granted the prospect arises for the Exchequer of meeting the cost of an allowance for the worker from the fourth week onwards. The full cost to the Exchequer, the taxpayer, could extend into many months. Although a very modest cost will arise for the employer to cover remuneration for the initial three weeks, the alternative costs of preventative or protective measures of work reorganisation will obviously not be incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that issue from the point of view of employees, some of whom have reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  ICTU has also made that point.  Taking all factors into account, a cap of three weeks on that liability will not make a major impact on womens' employment.  In other countries the employer's contribution runs for considerably longer than three weeks.  We felt that this was a fair and appropriate contribution by the employer where a risk arises in the course of the employment.  It must be remembered that we are talking about dangerous and risky work for a pregnant employee or an employee who is breast feeding.  Taking that factor into account, I think Deputies will agree that it would be inappropriate to absolve the employer entirely from any contribution liability and to place the entire liability on the taxpayer who may well have to carry it for many months at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The Bill will extend maternity protection to all employees &mdash; the previous limits are being dispensed with; it will maintain existing maternity leave levels for the moment; will enhance entitlement to paid time leave for both antinatal and postnatal care and will introduce health and safety leave and special leave for fathers in the event of the mother's death within 14 weeks of birth.  These proposals are backed up with dispute resolution and redress facilities and are effectively complemented by parallel measures on health, safety and social welfare aspects.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to bring before the House the Heritage Council Bill, 1994, which has already been discussed, and considerably strengthened by amendments, in the Seanad.  The Bill may be viewed as another part of the <i>corpus</i> of legislation in this area which I will bring before the Oireachtas.  It is an important Bill in its own right and I hope it will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  It will fulfil another commitment in the <Col N="1220" /><i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> and the intention expressed at the time of the establishment of the non-statutory National Heritage Council in 1988 to introduce legislation to regularise the position of the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  I understood it was available.  However, &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; should not be seen as a purely passive concept; it can also be an instrument of economic development if the linkages between development and the social and cultural patterns of the community are sensitively made.  This can be achieved by building an awareness among the Irish people of heritage and by making them confident and able to tell the story of the wonder of their own place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a kind of generic heritage or cultural policy which has an undoubtedly beneficial economic consequence. This is my approach to heritage.  It is not simply a matter of seeing these places as <Col N="1221" /> tourist centres or magnets but rather as places of immense interest which people locally know and respect and want to share with others.  This has a shared economic and intellectual benefit.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be viewed in the context of the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with its broad role in relation to culture and heritage.  In relation to the development of policy, the central role of my Department will be to decentralise the implementation of that policy.  Certaintly, An Chomhairle Oidhreachta will have an important role under the provisions of this Bill in contributing to the development of heritage policy.  In relation to other areas of my Department I also intend to proceed down the road of decentralisation of policy implementation and in this connection I hope to shortly introduce a Museum and Library Bill.  The intention of that Bill will be to give a degree of independence to the National Museum and to the National Library.  Of course, the Office of Public Works will continue to have responsibility for the day-to-day care and management of particular aspects of the physical heritage, but, as the Deputy will know, development of heritage policy is my responsibility.</P>
    <P>While it has not been included in the title of my Department, when the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;&mdash; or, more accurately, the Irish word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; is taken in its modest sense, it could be said to embrace all the work of my Department. In other words, it is that which binds it together.  It includes all those elements of Irish life today which have survived from the past and whose continuing survival into future generations depends on the attitudes and actions of the present.  Ensuring the protection of the Irish heritage in all its aspects and providing access to this heritage for all sectors of the population are central planks of my policy.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, in dealing with this broad heritage area to be realistic, requiring for practical purposes the division of the difficult elements by category.  For instance, for <Col N="1222" /> the Irish language we have Bord na Gaeilge, for the arts we have An Chomhairle Ealaíon and with the establishment of An Chomhairle Oidhreachta we will have covered the physical heritage. I have established within my Department a heritage policy unit which includes an archaeologist, an architectural historian and an ecologist. In addition to producing initiatives and overseeing the implementation of policy, an important function of that unit will be the processing of the advice from An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, producing practical policy statements and legislative proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 26 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently indicated that Government assistance will not be made available for the provision of a contract facility for the incineration of hazardous waste.  This decision was <Col N="1224" /> based on a review of all the factors connected with this matter.  The main considerations were as follows: clean technology and waste minimisation policies have been gaining ground in Irish industry, with some 54 per cent of hazardous wastes now being recovered or recycled; this trend will be further reinforced by Environmental Protection Agency licensing and by intensified measures to be introduced under the operational programme for environmental services which will be published shortly; there is already considerable on-site capacity in Ireland for incinerable wastes and some 70 per cent of wastes destined for incineration are now disposed of in Ireland at facilities to which new Environmental Protection Agency licences will shortly apply; the residual hazardous waste available in Ireland for a contract incinerator would be too small at present to support the commercial operation of such a plant; under the waste Bill to be introduced in November, the Environmental Protection Agency will be required to produce a national hazardous waste management plan; I consider that specific proposals to provide grant assistance for new infrastructure to deal with hazardous waste should await the making of this plan and should be concentrated on waste recovery options; some £10 million of expenditure cofinanced by the Structural Funds will be available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied, taking account of the above considerations, that the continued possibility of exporting certain quantities of hazardous waste for which there are no suitable treatment facilities in Ireland is reasonably guaranteed by the EU Regulation on Transshipment of Wastes.</P>
    <P>Two consultancy studies were carried out on behalf of my Department between 1988 and 1990 in relation to the feasibility of a contract hazardous waste incinerator.  The combined cost of these studies was some £94,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision not to proceed with a national incinerator but I am deeply concerned that we <Col N="1225" /> do not have a policy in relation to the disposal of hazardous toxic waste.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that the 19,000 tonnes of exported hazardous waste will not find its way to third countries? Trocaire, Amnesty International and Greenpeace are concerned that large quantities of toxic waste is finding its way to third countries who are being bought off because of the poor state of their economy.  Will the Minister agree that if we are trying to protect the environment sending toxic waste to third countries, who do not have proper disposal facilities, is doing nothing to solve the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the contention by Deputy Barrett that we do not have a hazardous waste policy.  He will be aware that there is a number of significant aspects to that policy: Waste minimisation, waste reduction, introduction of clean technologies and the safe disposal of hazardous waste on site or by export.  We do not and have not exported hazardous waste to Third World countries.  Hazardous waste, in the main, is exported to the UK and a little to France and Finland.  I agree fundamentally with the principle of what Deputy Barrett said that the continued export of hazardous waste to third countries is most undesirable.  As the House will be aware the European Union earlier this year banned the export of toxic or hazardous waste from EU countries to any third country.  That is being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was reasonably satisfied that the export market will continue to be available. What would happen if it was not?  There is an absence of a proper plan.  It is all very well to say we can dump our waste in some other country but if in future they decide they do not want to take our hazardous waste what will happen? To what part of Britain do we export our hazardous waste?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied that we can maintain that option of export.  As Deputy Barrett is aware that option was in doubt about a year and a half ago because the EU principle of proximity &mdash; that is, dealing with safe disposal of waste as close as possible to where it is generated &mdash; presented some problems for us.  Under the EU Directive on Transshipment of Waste we have been able to continue to export. The amounts of waste for incinerable purposes would not be enough to enable us to have a contract facility. There are insurance problems which we are trying to sort out in relation to exports but I am happy that these can be overcome and that we can continue to have that facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that we do not export hazardous waste to Sellafield in view of the fact that we are campaigning to have this extremely dangerous plant closed because of its proximity to Ireland and the serious damage that could result for this country in the event of a disaster?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett's question presents a certain problem for me. I have been enabled to make the statement in relation to not having a contract incinerator or not providing State funds for a contract incinerator by virtue of the fact that we have a derogation to export hazardous waste to the UK.  I do not want to go further than that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 17, 23 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Urban Renewal Act, 1986, empowers the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to designate areas in which he is satisfied there is a special need to promote urban renewal.  Areas are selected having regard to factors such as the extent of urban decay, location and general characteristics, potential for redevelopment, historical or architectural significance, the need to promote residential accommodation, and the size and status of the towns concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to all the most recent designations, consultations took place with <Col N="1228" /> the local authorities concerned and these were supplemented by consideration of the relevant development plans, inspections of all areas by officials of my Department and consideration of submissions made by interested groups. Given that a range of tax incentives is applied to designated areas by order of the Minister for Finance, all decisions in relation to areas selected for designation were treated as strictly confidential until a formal public announcement was made.</P>
    <P>The designation of areas for the purposes of urban renewal is a matter for the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The powers of the Minister for the Environment in this regard were delegated to me under the provisions of the Environment (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order, 1993.  In practice, however, the final designations were agreed by the Minister and myself, taking full account of the advice of our officials.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that there is a special need to promote urban renewal in each of the areas designated under the new scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is a lucrative business if one is lucky enough to have one's property designated under the scheme?  Why were some areas chosen and others not? I understand that a number of areas which applied were not designated.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the series of articles written by Mr. Frank McDonald in <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlighted some serious decisions taken by the Minister.  For example, in Longford only one side of the street was chosen, properties owned by the Taoiseach's wife and friends.  In Wexford certain properties were selected in the quay area and others were not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The profitability of the scheme for individuals was raised.  The purpose of a tax based renewal scheme is to attract private investment for derelict and run down locations.  The alternative would be to grant-aid development in such areas.  We believe the incentive approach is more efficient and few would argue that the scheme has not been an outstanding success to date. An incentive approach to urban renewal means somebody will make money.  The purpose of the scheme is to give incentives to attract people into areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is one side of the road chosen and the other not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that otherwise would not be developed and in doing so to enable the investors to make a profit.  If we did not have that option the scheme would fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In selecting areas for designation I <Col N="1231" /> have been guided by the physical needs of the areas concerned, not the ownership of the properties.  In most cases I do not know, and do not need to know, the owners of the properties concerned. That is not a consideration in selecting areas.  If I had to establish ownership before designating an area, it would be a recipe for inaction and inactivity.</P>
    <P>On the designation of areas in Longford, under the previous urban renewal scheme the Longford designated area comprised 21 acres, including Great Water Street, Bridge Street, Main Street, Richmond Street, Little Water Street and Church Street.  Two areas are included in the new scheme, due west of Main Street and the other at Bridge Street.  The following points are relevant to why those areas were selected.  The areas designated form a natural extension of the areas designated under the original scheme and will complete the renewal of the town centre area.  Both of the areas designated were commended to me by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The larger area designated includes Market Square which is in local authority ownership and contains a large semi-derelict storage shed.  That part of the town is run down and in need of renewal.  To the north of Market Square, again adjoining the old area, the shop frontages are generally in a fair condition.  However, it was considered prudent to include archways as they provide access to extremely run down backlands by two archway laneways. The smaller area at Bridge Street encompasses an old used cinema and the entrance to an unsightly meat factory. That area is in a prominent location and needs upgrading.</P>
    <P>While some individual sites within the designated area may be in a relatively good condition and are unlikely to benefit from the scheme, it is necessary to include them to create cohesive urban renewal areas rather than a series of disjointed blocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  3 and 19 together.  I have explained to the House on a number of occasions that I do not consider that it would be practicable or appropriate to attempt a redistribution of the rate support grant on a basis such as that recommended by the Institute for Fiscal Studies some years ago.</P>
      <P>The present system of rate support grant allocations has evolved over a period of some 16 years.  Adjustments to the system made over the years have generally been financially neutral for the local authorities.  Where increased overall allocations have been made available in the Estimates for a particular year, the additional funds have generally been allocated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis among the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for a new distribution system must take realistic account of the present allocations so as to ensure that no area suffers unnecessarily through disruption of important services.  Any new basis of allocation must also take account of the particular difficulties experienced by some local authorities. Where imbalances may exist under <Col N="1234" /> existing arrangements, they did not come about overnight and it would be imprudent to try to solve them otherwise than on a phased basis, possibly over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I will be taking account of factors such as the foregoing in settling the allocations for 1995 which I hope to be able to notify to local authorities shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be a severe setback to members of local authorities to hear from the Minister that he is not prepared to examine the possibility of a fairer system for distributing the rate support grant.  How can he justify a position whereby, for example, in Cork city the rate support grant per capita is £37.76 while in Dublin it is £49.41 and in Limerick it is £48.82?  How can the Minister justify that?  Moreover, how can he defend circumstances in which, in the case of Cork County, the rate <i>per capita</i> is £42.31 whereas in Tipperary South Riding it is £94.77 and in Tipperary North Riding £78.79?  How will the Minister explain that to the voters of Cork North Central or those of Cork South Central as he picks his way across footpaths that have fallen into disrepair and city streets choked with litter under public obsolete lighting?</P>

There are other local authorities in a similar position.  Just as I approached the Cork position last year &mdash; where I accept there are difficulties &mdash; I will endeavour to remedy their problems but I will not do it on the basis of Deputy Quill's suggestion which would visit a totally unnecessary imbalance on other local authorities within the context of their current difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  5, 51, 58 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>It is within the absolute discretion of each local authority to decide whether charges for services are to be levied in its area, and the scale of any such charges.  I have no function in the exercise of that discretion.  I have no doubt, however, that the elected members, in considering the matter, have due regard to the needs of their areas, the level and range of services to be provided and their cost, and all of the sources of revenue, including charges, available to finance those services.</P>
      <P>Almost all local authorities currently charge for domestic services and have done so in successive years in order to maintain and improve the level of local services.  Collection levels are improving and it is expected that local authorities will achieve their collection targets which total £50 million in the current year.  I have no proposals to remove or limit local discretion in the levying of charges.  I have not received a copy of the report referred to.</P>
      <P>All local authorities levying domestic service charges operate schemes to reduce or waive charges for householders whose incomes are low or who are experiencing particular hardship.  I am satisfied that the operation of local waiver schemes broadly complies with guidelines issued by my Department in 1985 on this matter.  I have no proposals to issue revised guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to me, nor do I consider any action by me is warranted, to prevent local authorities from taking such action as may be open to them under the law to secure collection of <Col N="1239" /> charges.  I am satisfied that disconnection generally arises only after other methods have proved unsuccessful and in face of persistent refusal to pay by householders who are believed by the authority concerned to be neither suffering financial hardship nor eligible for a waiver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary for the Minister to claim he has no role in the area of service charges when clearly that is not the case.  How does he think he can convince the ordinary, hard pressed householder of the legitimacy of the service charges when he cannot convince his Minister of State of their legitimacy?  If he has not seen the reported statements &mdash; which I find difficult to believe &mdash; perhaps I might jog his memory.  The Minister of State said fairly recently that these were an unfair and inequitable form of taxation which varies from one area to another and takes no account of ability to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The reported comments of his Minister of State shows he is clearly not convinced of the legitimacy of these service charges.  The Minister must be aware that householders, depending on their geographic location, pay varying charges.  For example, in Mayo the charge is in excess of £205 and in parts of Dublin it is approximately £70.  Coming from a party which in the relatively recent past won council seats on the basis that it would abolish these charges does he not accept that these are unfair and inequitable? Is he aware that in Scotland for <Col N="1240" /> example, it is illegal for a local authority to cut off water supply to houses?  Does he not recognise and understand that if a sanitary authority cuts off water supplies to individual households it creates an unacceptable health hazard?  Will he bring in legislation to deal with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of Minister Stagg's views but he started publicly that if these charges were abolished the funds raised at present through service changes would have to be raised elsewhere. The public should know the facts.  Service charges at present raise about £50 million.  The cost of maintaining public water supply and waste treatment systems for a year is £136 million.  Therefore, the service charges represent a little over 30 per cent of the maintenance cost without any regard for the capital cost.  Abolishing service charges would mean introducing alternative taxes and Deputy McManus should say exactly what is intended in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could then evaluate what is said.  It is often argued that this is double taxation.  However, when these charges were introduced we had a high level of personal taxation at 58 per cent, a middle rate of 48 per cent and a marginal rate of 35 per cent.</P>

      <P>When the Minister says that public representatives determine when people's water supply is cut off, he is talking about the policies devised by public representatives at local level.  The suggestion that people's water supply is only cut off when all other avenues are exhausted is not true. Computer printouts are automatically sent to householders telling them that if they do not pay the water will be cut off.  In many cases that happens and it is wrong.  Will the Minister not understand and accept that there are public health implications, that women with children find there is no water in the house, with serious sanitary implications, that he has a responsibility to ensure that basic essential services are maintained and that other means are used if it comes to the collection of money.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that if a Minister of State in his Department goes public saying that water charges will be abolished the people accept that as being accurate. The Minister now tells us that what the Minister of State said is rubbish.

      <P>In view of the Minister's claim that he will not intervene in the matter, is it not the case that he changed the rules of capital allocations to local authorities and, specifically in the case of Dublin City which does not have local charges, he now proposes that, instead of investing in capital needs in their waterworks system, as was the norm, he will bring in private capital to fund those investments, which means he is forcing that local authority to introduce water charges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case. The Deputy will be aware that a massive injection of capital funds is required to upgrade the water facilities for the city and county of Dublin.  A considerable part of that work will relate to conservation of existing water supplies. Unfortunately, we have not developed policies and methods in that regard nor have we contractors experienced in water conservation policies.  We have engaged outside consultancies to help us to devise policies which have been quite successful in other countries.  In other words, we will not be engaged in massive capital injection for building new reservoirs of water supplies when there is an extraordinary loss through existing systems.  That has nothing to do with the introduction of water charges in Dublin but with an analysis of problems and the best means of solving them by conserving water supplies, instead of draining finite resources.</P>

While local authorities in Dublin may have introduced service charges others that have not done so have not been penalised by a reduction in their block grant.  It would be helpful to householders if an instalment system for service charges were introduced.

      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): <i>The Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1995-1999</i>, <Col N="1251" /> which will be published shortly, will include provision for an expenditure of some £20 million on municipal waste management measures to be cofinanced from the Structural Funds.  The major part of this provision will be directed at improving recycling infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The strategy document <i>Recycling for Ireland</i> also envisages a considerably increased contribution to recycling activities from relevant private sector interests on the basis of the principle of producer responsibility.  IBEC has accepted the document's invitation to Irish business and industry to consider the development of voluntary arrangements in this area and has begun work to this end.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is envisaged that the major proportion of the £20 million will be made available to provide recycling facilities on landfill sites.  It is expected that in 1995, £2 million will be made available; in 1996, £3.5 million will be made available; in 1997, £5 million will be made available and so on as local authorities require it.  It is envisaged in the recycling strategy that 20 civic amenity sites will be provided in the short term and 70 such sites in the medium term.  It must be taken into account that a number of local authorities have availed of the grant schemes that have been in operation for the last five years &mdash; £2.5 million has been allocated to local authorities, community groups and the private sector for <Col N="1252" /> such developments.  Some local authorities are well in hand with developments while others are lagging behind.

We are in the early stages of developing the recycling strategy.  Markets are increasing, but obviously it will take much time and investment by local authorities and the private sector to seek out new markets.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister encourage the Minister for Finance to amendlegislation to allow for grant aid by Forbairt towards the development of recycling plants, which at present are excluded from grant aid?  Would he agree that with greater private involvement the number of markets could be increased?  The Minister is no doubt aware there is a direct connection between the availability of, say bottle banks and the amount of glass recycled. There was an increase in this area from 7 per cent to 29 per cent, with a corresponding increase in the number of bottle banks from 20 to 250.  The more collection points available the more likely the public will co-operate in recycling.  Will the Minister encourage local authorities to promote bottle banks in suitable locations in each of their areas to provide for the recycling of items such as glass, which is capable of 100 per cent recycling?</P>

There has been much discussion with local authorities in recent months, particularly in the lead-up to the launch of the recycling strategy, and they have been asked to take into account the need for extra bottle banks. Discussions also took place with Rehab and Kerbside with a view to giving grant aid for the provision of these facilities. There has been an increase in the number of such facilities and we hope that in the coming year there will be a further substantial increase in the number of bottle banks, cloth banks and other such facilities that are required not only in Dublin but in other parts of the country. We will be working very closely with local authorities, community groups, Rehab and Kerbside in this regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the target set in the recycling strategy, particularly in terms of household waste &mdash; 20 per cent &mdash; puts great pressure on local authorities? Is he aware that within the resources available to them local authorities will be unable to meet that target?  For example, in my county of Wicklow the recycling strategy and waste management plan that has been drawn up is a progressive one, but the target is set at only 10 per cent.  Will the Minister ensure that local authorities are in a position to achieve the targets?  Is he aware that without increased resources and a different approach in legislation to recycling, local authorities will be unable to meet the targets?  Will the Minister adopt an interdepartmental approach on this matter?  Recently, when we discussed a Bill on milk supply, I raised the issue of the use of milk bottles rather than unrecyclable material and was told that is not the concern of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  How does the Minister of State propose to get other Government Departments and local <Col N="1254" /> authorities to meet the aspirations outlined in this document?</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  The recycling targets are ambitious but the local authorities will not be the only key players in implementing the new strategy; business, industry and the public will also have a major role to play.  Up until now no European Union funding was available for the redevelopment of recycling facilities; £20 million co-finance is now available, most of which will be made available to the local authorities to help them to achieve the targets. These are ambitious but achieveable.</P>

      <P>In regard to the recycling campaign, is the Minister of State aware that south Tipperary is a leader in the field?  I had the honour of launching the extension of our campaign two weeks ago.  Not only have we the greatest number of bottle banks, but we also have delivered compost units for domestic waste to 1,000 homes. Recognising that such an initiative is a drain on resources does the Minister of State have any plans to make further funds available to local authorities? Does he accept that we need the co-operation of consumers?  Does his Department have any plans to launch a recycling campaign within schools to educate young people in particular to use bottle banks?</P>

I am sure the Minister will be able to confirm that he has received support from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. There is a substantial number of people who are unable to read.  Does the Minister agree that the inclusion of photographs on ballot papers at election time would do away with the necessity to make special provision for illiterate voters which can be the source of great concern and interference?

      <P>Following discussions earlier this year with National Newspapers of Ireland on their potential contribution to recycling, it was agreed that National Newspapers of Ireland and my Department should co-sponsor a study on the feasibility of increased use of newsprint waste for animal bedding and related purposes. The study is being carried out by Teagasc and is due for completion early in 1995.  Initial indications are promising both as regards animal health safety and potential new market capacity.</P>

I agree that the disposal of newspaper is a problem.  It was felt that the newspaper industry would have to be involved and the Department managed to do so on a shared basis and as much pressure as possible will be brought to bear to ensure a speedy conclusion to the study.</P>

    <P>It is not possible at this time to provide the funds necessary for a house improvement grants scheme.

      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response to what I thought was a positive question.

Local authority house repair grants were abolished by a Fianna Fáil Minister in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants were an encouragement to people to spend money which they could not afford on the repair of their houses rather than applying to be included on the local authority housing waiting list.  The number on the list is increasing every day and there is no possibility of being housed by the local authority.  The reintroduction of such grants would take the pressure off.  Would the Minister agree that repair grants should be reintroduced?</P>

      <P>Members of the Fine Gael Party say that Government spending is out of control and has to be reduced and yet Members put forward proposals for additional spending.  When the Fine Gael Party was in Government a colleague of Deputy McCormack's put in place the house improvement grants scheme in 1985.  The cost of the scheme, which was terminated in 1987, was £200 million.  It was a badly thought out scheme with wide application and anyone could qualify for a grant.</P>

      <P>We were paying out taxpayers' money at the behest of the Fine Gael Minister for the provision of sun lounges at the back of grandiose houses in Dublin 4 and the ordinary taxpayer had to pick up the tab.  This gave home improvement grants a very bad name. That is not to say that it is not desirable to have such a grant.  Our priority is the reduction of the number on the waiting list and the local authority housing programme is the prime area.  Since we came to office in 1993 the number of house starts per year has trebled and it now stands at 3,500.</P>

    <P>The condition of the housing stock is a matter of concern and as an ongoing process we will be looking at the possibility of a home improvement grant scheme.  The results of a national survey carried out on the housing stock in 1990 show the changes between 1980 and 1990.  In that period the number of unfit houses fell from 8.1 per cent to 5.5 per cent; the number of dwellings without a fixed bath or a shower fell from 19.5 per cent to 8 per cent; the number of dwellings without an internal WC fell from 16 per cent to 6.4 per cent and the number of dwellings without an internal water supply fell from 4.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent.  There is also a number of measures currently available to people <Col N="1265" /> to improve the housing stock.  The disabled persons grant and the essential repairs grant are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the argument by Deputy Quill which is part of our housing policy.  Last year implementing that policy, local authorities purchased 369 existing houses. These can be bought unfit at the point of purchase and renovated so that they are habitable or they can be bought fit for habitation.  We are encouraging local authorities to buy such houses, renovate them and lease them to tenants.  That is part of our policy and I am glad to have Deputy Quill's support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had given the background to this legislation and stated it was part of the corpus of legislation of which a number of Bills will form part. This legislation and the legislation for the National Museum and National Library, taken together, will provide a corpus of legislation which will bring the institutions into the modern world in terms of structure.  It will also provide a comprehensive base in addressing such an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said also that in putting the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis, it was appropriate I thank the people who served on the council to date.  I have already expressed my appreciation of the voluntary work of the members and those who assisted <Col N="1333" /> them.  In particular, I thank Lord Killanin who worked long and hard for the council.</P>
    <P>I outlined the meaning of the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; and its importance in my Department.  I said there are particular bodies such as An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which deals with the arts, and Bord na Gaeilge, which deals with the Irish language and that we will now have An Comhairle Oidhreachta which will deal with matters of the physical heritage.  I outlined also the functions of the National Heritage Council which were assigned to it in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to replace the existing council with a statutory corporation with a broad range of functions in the heritage.  The new council will also subsume the functions of the Wildlife Advisory Council, appointed under section 13 of the Wildlife Act 1976, and the functions of the Historic Monuments Council as provided for in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987.</P>
    <P>A new and important function which will also be given to the new council will be a special responsibility for buildings of architectural importance in public ownership.</P>
    <P>No one will welcome this Bill more than the Chairman and members of the existing National Heritage Council. They have long been concerned with the council's lack of a statutory footing. This Bill will provide that statutory basis for the council's extended functions and will integrate the heritage advisory functions under one body.  It will also strengthen the council's role in the protection of the architectural heritage by assigning a special role to it in relation to buildings of architectural and historic importance in public ownership.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this provision should be extended to cover heritage buildings in private ownership and while I have some sympathy with this point of view, the problem of preserving our architectural heritage is too complex to deal with in this manner.  I will, however, look at ways and means of <Col N="1334" /> improving statutory measures to protect the built heritage and I hope to introduce further legislation to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the presence of older buildings was often perceived as a barrier to progress and the task of their preservation deemed an unnecessary burden.  The tenor of public opinion has, however, substantially changed and the preservation of our rich and varied built environment from medieval cathedrals to historic houses to vernacular buildings, is now seen as an integral part of protecting our cultural patrimony. It is our responsibility to improve the existing mechanisms to protect our heritage and ensure its survival for future generations.  As part of this commitment to protect the built environment in an active way, we are preparing to ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Architectural Heritage which was signed in Granada in 1985.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of this Bill is to establish a statutory council comprised of persons with an interest in and knowledge and experience of heritage matters over the broad range.  The council will be entitled to establish its own committees in addition to those required under the provisions of the Bill and it will have the necessary staff and financial resources to enable it to carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a new and important role will be assigned to the new statutory council in relation to buildings designated as heritage buildings under the Bill in the ownership of a public authority.  An Chomhairle Oidhreachta will advise on buildings to be designated as heritage buildings and could effectively prevent &mdash; although I hoped such circumstances would not arise &mdash; a public authority from demolishing, altering significantly or disposing of a heritage building unless I agree, or where my agreement is not forthcoming, the Government agree with the plans of the public authority.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Historic Monuments <Col N="1335" /> Council and the Wildlife Advisory Council and the transfer of those advisory functions to An Chomhairle Oidhreachta.  Section 4 provides for the repeal of the legal provisions establishing the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historical Monuments Council. These physical heritage advisory functions will now be integrated under one body, An Chomhairle Oidhreachta.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the general duty of the council to propose policies and priorities in relation to the physical heritage and sets out a number of specific functions of the council, to promote interest in the heritage &mdash; which is important and will involve the co-operation of other Departments, particularly the Department of Education &mdash; and to co-operate with and co-ordinate the activities of State and public and private bodies in the area of the physical heritage. I appreciate the valuable work and promotion of responsible attitudes to heritage carried out by voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the council may make recommendations to me, that they may make such recommendations public and requires that I respond to them within six months.  Section 8 imposes a requirement on the council to respond to my requests for advice and information.  Section 9 provides that I may, after consultation with the Government and with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, confer additional functions on the council relating to the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a special provision introduced to increase the protection of the State's built heritage by assigning an active role to An Chomhairle Oidhreachta. If the Heritage Council becomes aware of proposals affecting a building it considers to be of heritage value which is owned by the State, a statutory body or other State agency or local authority, it may advise that authority in relation to such proposals but there is no obligation on the authority to accept such advice.  Under this section, buildings may be designated <Col N="1336" /> heritage buildings by me on the council's advice and the Department, statutory body, State agency or local authority would be required to notify An Chomhairle Oidhreachta of its proposals relating to such heritage buildings. They would be prevented from carrying out a proposal contrary to the council's advice without Government agreement, unless my agreement to such a proposal or to a modified from of it was obtained.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers the council to advise and assist any persons on matters relating to the functions of the council including making financial assistance available.  Section 15 sets out the circumstances as a consequence whereof the chairperson or any member of the council or committee of the council shall automatically cease to be a member of the council or committee, as the case may be.  These circumstances include bankruptcy, imprisonment and failure to disclose a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in any transaction or dealings with the council.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the exclusion from membership of the council of Members of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament. Section 17 requires that members of the council or of a committee of it disclose to the council or committee, as the case may be, any pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or material to, any matter which falls to be considered by the council or committee.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the council to employ its own staff, consultants or advisers.  The council will be required to ensure that an adequate proportion of its staff will be competent in Irish so that service may be given through Irish as well as English.  This section excludes from membership of the council staff, Members of either House of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for a declaration of interests in land by prescribed staff of the council or by any prescribed person whose services are availed of by the council.  It also provides that failure to <Col N="1337" /> make such a declaration, or the making of a false or misleading declaration, shall be an offence carrying a maximum penalty on summary conviction of £1,000 and on conviction on indictment of £10,000.</P>
    <P>Section 22 requires the council to submit a report in Irish and English to me within six months after the end of each year and provides that the council may publish the report.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Schedule provide for the appointment by me of the council consisting of a chairperson and not more than 16 ordinary members, for the period of office of such persons to be not more than five years and that such persons may not serve more than two consecutive terms; for a gender balance in the appointment of members of the council &mdash; Members will recall that when amending the broadcasting legislation and in the new regulations governing the appointment of the RTE Authority, I legislated for a gender balance &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on bringing forward this Bill.  It is the second major Bill he has introduced during his tenure as Minister and follows hot on the heels of the National Monuments Bill.  The speed with which his Department is dealing with these matters is welcome.  I welcome the Bill which is part of the corpus of necessary legislation in this area.  It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute, as the Minister has done, to the National Heritage Council which, since it was established in 1988, has carried out trojan work which has very often been ignored in many quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth recalling the terms of reference given to the council by the then Taoiseach in 1988.  It was required to formulate policies and priorities; to <Col N="1339" /> identify, protect, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage in the specific areas of archaeology, architecture, flora, fauna, landscape, heritage gardens and certain inland waterways; to promote among the general public an interest and pride in their heritage and to facilitate appreciation and enjoyment of it; to work closely with and make recommendations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies in relation to all matters coming within its general area of responsibility and to ensure the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field.  Departments and local authorities have been somewhat remiss in their willingness to co-operate with the Heritage Council in this area.  This is one of the main reasons the council needs to be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>It was also required to decide on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work, subject to the approval of the Taoiseach, to decide on the priorities for such expenditure and to advise the Government on the legislation establishing a statutory heritage council.  While certain irreversible damage has been done to our heritage during the intervening period, six years is not an excessively long time to wait for legislation which will establish a statutory heritage council.  There has been an increasing perception of the Heritage Council solely as a funding agency, while its role in formulating policy, determining priorities and allocating funds has been ignored.  This is one of the main reasons it is necessary to enforce two way consultation between the council and public and private bodies and individuals.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the recently published report of the Kerry County Enterprise Board which concludes that there is saturation of heritage centres.  I agree with that conclusion &mdash; the bubble has burst in terms of the number of heritage centres which can be maintained at a high standard.  While the plethora of heritage centres which has been <Col N="1340" /> developed in recent years is welcome in that it indicates an increased awareness and appreciation of our heritage, problems arise in regard to the future funding of these centres, particularly those which have been funded out of the public purse.  It is all very well to make a once-off capital allocation towards the construction of a heritage centre but someone has to meet its subsequent ongoing running costs.  It would be wise to take cognisance of the findings of the Kerry County Enterprise Board which, I think, would be recognised as a leader in the area of cultural tourism.  Heritage centres have made a substantial input to local economies by attracting tourists, but cognisance must be taken of the points made in that report.</P>
    <P>Heritage centres which do not attract a local input into their funding are the ones which will experience difficulties in meeting their future financial requirements. We should be extremely cautious about the allocation of funding and strive to ensure that new heritage centres have adequate local contacts before they secure public funding.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) provides that the council shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in its own name but shall not have power to hold land.  I understand the inclusion of this provision.  Local authorities and other public bodies are, for want of a better term, laboured with the responsibility of looking after buildings which have a heritage value but which give rise to an enormous cost burden. If the council could accept gifts of that nature it would be overrun with obligations which it could not possibly finance.</P>
    <P>The recent case involving the courthouse in Carrick-on-Shannon and the dispute which arose with Leitrim County Council highlight a problem which needs to be addressed.  I think the latter case has now been satisfactorily resolved.  Local authorities are burdened with the responsibility of looking after certain buildings, including courthouses. I am sure the Minister will recall from his days as a member of a local <Col N="1341" /> authority the numerous debates which took place among members who were dissatisfied about their responsibility to maintain these buildings at considerable expense.  Departments have by and large ignored the need to preserve public buildings.  In the case of Carrick-on-Shannon courthouse, the Department of the Environment proposed to make an allocation for new local authority offices and the courthouse was to be demolished.  Obviously it would not be possible for the local authority to refinance the reconstruction of that building and the Department should be made aware of its obligations under the legislation to consult with the local authorities. I welcome the Minister's intervention in this case.</P>
    <P>I availed of the opportunity during Question Time to look up the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; which is defined as &ldquo;that which is inherited&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why this Bill could not have been extended to include the National Library and the National Museum.  The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the Bill is to establish a body to perform certain functions in relation to the physical heritage.  This may be an unnecessary sectionalisation of the heritage area and it may have been possible to extend the scope of the Bill and make all heritage matters the responsibility of one body.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council could have been broadened to bring the heritage area under one body.  As the council has power to establish committees, it could have established a committee which would have statutory functions to deal with the National Library and the National Museum.  It is a demarcation for which I fail to see the logic.  The Minister may have some laudable explanation and, if so, I ask him to develop that point further.  The Bill is welcome and on Committee Stage I look forward to ironing out minor details with the Minister.</P>

      <P>There can hardly be a more opportune time for us to define what we mean by our heritage.  That is what the Minister has in mind in the legislation before the House.  It was a nice gesture to introduce the Bill in the Seanad.  It certainly gives recognition to a constituent body of this grouping that sits in a room which is, perhaps, one of our loveliest heritage items.  I have no doubt that the setting in which this Bill was introduced was not lost on the Minister when he decided to swop the prosaic ceiling on which we have to gaze for the lovely setting and surrounds of the Seanad Chamber with its fine ceiling.  I have no ambition to sit in that Chamber but I am occasionally a visitor and I marvel at the fact that Irish craftsmen were able to restore that ceiling which was damaged by wear, tear and age.</P>

      <P>Members campaigning in Cork know the feeling.  It is a source of great satisfaction to us that craftsmen were able to restore that ceiling and other elements of that room to its former glory of almost 200 years ago when the building was erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  It is another measure in the right direction when it comes to identifying, defining, cataloguing and putting in place proper provisions so that we can preserve and pass on valuable items of our heritage to another generation, who will do the same when their turn comes.  It is the right spirit in which to approach the turn of the century.  At most, only two elections will be held in this century. Occasionally when travelling in my car I hear people on the radio being asked how they will celebrate the turn of the <Col N="1343" /> century.  It would be great if legislators could celebrate it by having in place proper procedures, proper legislation, proper funding and resources and proper mechanisms to preserve what is good of this century and open the door to a new century.  That is another reason the introduction of this Bill is appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome measure and taken in its own right, will achieve much.  A number of other Bills, which may not come within the ambit of the Minister's Department, ought to be introduced parallel with this Bill.  There is a serious lack of a proper conservation Bill.  I am pleased the Minister proposes to include architecture by means of amendments which he intends to table. Surely one of the great products of our civilisation is the buildings we put in place.  We write our life stories on many pages but our buildings, big or small, on the scale of Georgian mansions in Merrion Square, farm buildings in the country or thatched cottages, are all part of the embroidery of our life story.  There must be a strong and determined attempt to preserve what is good in them and not to permit their demolition. Already, many good and interesting buildings have been demolished. In earlier times there was a different perspective in regard to what was worth preserving.  It is fundamental to preserve our good Georgian buildings. It is equally important to keep alive the life story, dwelling houses and other buildings attached to them, of people who lived in less lofty surroundings. They are an essential element of our civilisation and worthy of preservation. Will the Minister try to influence his colleague with responsibility in this area to press ahead with a proper conservation Bill?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  The time is right to put the National Heritage Council which has done such sterling work on a statutory basis.  That is its central provision. When that is done it is of fundamental importance that proper <Col N="1344" /> resources and funding are made available to enable that body to achieve its ambitions and meet the objectives of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, was gracious enough to accept three separate amendments in the other House, tabled by Senator John Dardis, on behalf of our party, and I thank him.  One of the amendments related to the age of an object which would qualify for inclusion.  The age in the Bill as originally drafted was 50 years.  We thought that was too long especially at the rate of obsolescence.  That limit may have been acceptable at the end of the 19th century but it is not acceptable at the tail end of the 20th century.  Because of the rate of obsolescence of all items, farm implements, machinery for the generation of electricity or buildings from which workers laid railways, should qualify for inclusion.  I thank the Minister for taking that amendment on board and fixing the age of the object at 25 years.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Title of the Bill was enlarged to include the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of the national heritage and that should be the overall objective. We must preserve, protect and pass on our heritage to future generations.  The Minister accepted an amendment creating a role for regional authorities giving us a better Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to a recent article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in which Kerry County Council correctly reminded us that we may have reached saturation point in terms of heritage centres and that if we proceed further down that road we may devalue and misinterpret the real meaning of our heritage.  The time has come to call a halt.  Our heritage is integral and we can only go so far in tailoring it to meet the whims of tourists many of whom, particularly those from Europe, have a discerning view of heritage.  In attempting to generate essential tourism revenue, we should not get caught up in peppering the country with heritage centres at the expense of preserving what is <Col N="1345" /> worth while and important.  This is important not only from a tourism point of view, but also for our young people whose birthright is a protected and preserved heritage.</P>
    <P>The time will come when the Heritage Council will need more teeth.  The Minister stated that the remit of the Bill extends only to property in public ownership, but that he would redress that matter.  I urge him to do so as soon as possible because a great deal of property which ought to be preserved is not in public ownership.  Many interesting houses are not in public ownership and local authorities have neither the power nor the finances to acquire and maintain such artefacts of interest.  That could be covered in a well drafted conservation Bill.  The House in which the poet Seán Ó Riordáin lived in Iniscarra, County Cork, would be of immense interest to our people, but it has fallen into grave disrepair.  The local authority does not appear to have the wherewithal to restore and maintain it and thereby make it accessible to the public.  It is difficult to imagine a time when the authorities in Stratford-upon-Avon would not preserve the house of Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway and others that date back to the 17th century.  Yet a small manageable house of one of Ireland's most significant poets &mdash; certainly since the 17th century &mdash; is not preserved.  Because it is not in public ownership and the local authorities do not have the necessary funding, it may be lost forever.  I hope that does not happen.  That is merely one example of many other such houses, some of which are in my area.  We must create a mechanism whereby properties not in public ownership can be acquired and preserved in accordance with the spirit of the Bill.  As the Minister gave a commitment in that regard, I will not elaborate the point.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of matters relating to our landscape and wildlife.  The wildlife division of the forestry Department did great work.  It was one of the most creative and successful divisions of that Department. <Col N="1346" /> Many wildlife areas in Cork and Kerry were developed and can now be used for the enjoyment and education of our children.  I pay tribute to the staff of that section who, in some cases merely because of an interest in wildlife matters, carried out great work.  Interest in wildlife is increasing among our young population.  Shivers run down my spine when I see ditches, hedgerows, and trees being knocked down to make way for modern farming.  The mainstay of our civilisation is agriculture; we do not have a great history of industrial development.  The pattern of the field and the hedgegrows put in place by our forefathers are an essential part of our our civilisation is agriculture; we do not have a great history of industrial development.  The pattern of the field and the hedgegrows put in place by our forefathers are an essential part of our civilisation and must be catalogued and protected.  For that reason I am pleased the Minister included matters of landscape in the Bill.  He also included waterways and locks, which hold a sense of mystery and wonder for the young and not so young.</P>
    <P>Do our railway lines not have something to offer in terms of this Bill?  Many railway station buildings were constructed in cut limestone and have beautiful intricate patterns of wrought iron.  These were ignored when railway lines were closed down.  A county register of housing stock should be drawn up and certain areas listed for conservation. That is the only way the integrity of our housing heritage will remain intact for future generations.  A strong case can be advanced for some type of tax arrangement which would enable people to retain interesting houses.  In the 1960s and 1970s anyway, it seemed to have been the fashion, for a variety of reasons, for people to move into what were described as the &ldquo;bungalow bliss&rdquo; type houses, leaving their fine houses to fall into dereliction.</P>
    <P>The last question I posed at the Question Time today to the Minister for the Environment related to the reinstatement of the house improvement grant, and the Minister quite rightly pointed out that, in its previous application, it had been grossly abused.  However a very strong case can be made for its reinstatement in specific circumstances. <Col N="1347" /> I have been considerably saddened to witness villages, some of which I know well, where fine houses built in the 1920s, 1930s or even 1940s are falling into disrepair and dereliction because families have died out.  This happens in country villages where younger generations are forced to go to cities to find work and make their homes.  I have seen villages die and good, solid, two storey, well designed, slate houses fall into dereliction while local authorities build sub-standard, shabby houses at the tail end of the village.</P>
    <P>Had there been any foresight or interest in our heritage, would not local authorities have been given the resources to purchase these houses, to perhaps install better plumbing in some cases, or to modernise others while keeping the villages and their streetscapes intact?  Surely that would be in accordance with what we are endeavouring to do under this Bill?  Will the Minister take those points on board, some relate to this Bill and others to impending legislation, but all are very important to me, and comply with the spirit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill to which we might address ourselves.  I note, that the Heritage Council will be required to publish an annual report which will be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas but this will not have to include accounts.  That does not constitute any major weakness inasmuch as there is provision that the accounts must be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; in which regard there is absolute transparency &mdash; but we must move towards a time when annual reports will include financial reports. Now is as good a time as any to put that principle in place.  It is very difficult to do it in respect of existing legislation or bodies.  When creating new bodies &mdash; and in a sense we are doing that today as we are giving an older body a statutory function &mdash; we should take that principle on board so that, in addition to providing an annual report, there would be a financial report.  In a sense <Col N="1348" /> that is the best way to ascertain whether the relevant legislation is achieving its aim and if sufficient finance has been forthcoming to implement its provisions. In addition, it is the manner in which we can ascertain whether moneys are being spent in accordance with the priorities we are attempting to lay down in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the Bill and have every confidence that, when enacted, it will make a very great difference here generally.  I shall table perhaps three amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter this evening.</P>
      <P>The increasing use of the Government jet by Ministers and Ministers of State for their personal convenience is creating growing anger on the part of the public who must foot the bill for this extravagant exercise.  In particular, the disclosure by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, that she requisitioned the Government jet to fly her home from Zurich represents one of the worst abuses of the ministerial air transport service yet to come to light.  It forms part of a wider pattern by those in power who insist on nothing but the best, regardless of the cost to the taxpayer. They are acting like the new Irish aristocracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the current Government did not start this trend; a Fianna Fáil Government decided to expend £17 million on Charlie's palace and a Fianna <Col N="1349" /> Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government decided to commit in excess of £15 million of taxpayers' money to acquire the Gulf Stream jet.  However, the current Fianna Fáil-Labour partnership Government has taken extravagance with other people's money to a fine art, a pattern established in the early days of this Administration when a plethora of advisers, handlers, spin doctors, managers and assistants, most of them party activists &mdash; many of whom are family members or friends &mdash; were recruited at a cost of £2.5 million per annum to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was at that time regarded with terror by those on the Government Benches, set an example, subsequently followed by many of his colleagues, when he decided that Fitzpatrick's Hotel in New York was not good enough for him and insisted on booking into the luxury Waldorf Astoria Hotel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the use of Air Corps aeroplanes perhaps that the extravagance of Government members is seen at its worst.  I have interesting statistics which show that during 1993 the total flying hours of all Air Corps aircraft was 4,936, of which 1,035 hours, or 21 per cent of all Air Corps aircraft, was accounted for in transporting Government Ministers.  So far this year more than 25 per cent of Air Corps flying time has been usurped in transporting Ministers.  Ever more frequently the Air Corps appears to be becoming the personal transport fleet of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While fully accepting there are occasions on which it is appropriate for the President, the Taoiseach and even senior Government Ministers to use Air Corps transport such occasions should be strictly controlled.  Government personnel, down to the most junior Minister, seem to be able to demand Air Corps transport for virtually any <Col N="1350" /> occasion.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste even met on 9 October to try to save the Government, and where did they meet?  In Baldonnel Airport because the Taoiseach was on his way back from a Fianna Fáil election convention in Cork while the Tánaiste was returning from the funeral of a party colleague in County Meath.  I do not believe either trip was appropriate to the use of Air Corps transport.</P>
    <P>Those in the Government who are specifically charged with looking after the interests of the less well off have a responsibility to lead by example and to ensure that they do not abuse public funds.  It was against this background that I was shocked to learn that the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, had requisitioned the use of a Gulfstream jet to take her and her party back from Zurich, simply to avoid the inconvenience of having to wait overnight for a scheduled flight the following morning.  The Minister was quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> on Tuesday last as saying she had to be back in Dublin on the following day for appointments but, according to Tim Ryan, the author of the article in the <i>Irish Press</i> she had no such functions listed for 14 October. What sort of example does the Minister believe she is giving to the poor by swanning around Europe in an executive jet?  What sort of message does it convey to her constituents in Dublin West who depend on social welfare benefits, which she stoutly defends, and who can barely afford the return bus fares to the city centre?</P>
    <P>It costs thousands of pounds per hour to keep the Government jet in the air, and the Minister should disclose to the House the cost to the Exchequer of Minister Burton's flight of fancy.  The trip should be costed on an hourly basis as is the case with any commercial airline, allowing for wages, capital cost, maintenance costs and depreciation. One commentator estimated that the cost of the trip was about £30,000.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of any women's, youth or community groups in <Col N="1351" /> her constituency who could use £30,000. If she is not, I can assure her that I could find about 50 in my constituency who would happily put that amount of money to better use.</P>
    <P>Never in our political history has a party changed so much by simply moving across the floor of the House.  The Labour Party was vigorous in its condemnation of the political culture of Fianna Fáil.  Now it has become a part of it.  In 1991 the Labour Party denounced the acquisition by the Government of a jet.  Now it uses it as others would use a bus.  Given its enthusiasm for jet travel perhaps the Labour Party might change the song its members sing at the party conference from Connolly's &ldquo;The Watchword of Labour&rdquo; to &ldquo;I'm leaving on a jet plane&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is time to introduce new guidelines governing the use by Ministers of Air Corps transport to stop the increasing abuse of the facility by Fianna Fáil and Labour Ministers.  Government jets should only be used when there is a compelling reason to do so and, where scheduled flights are available and cheaper, they should be used.  The convenience of a junior Minister and her spouse is not sufficient to justify a cost of £30,000 to the taxpayer for the use of Air Corps jets.</P>

      <P>In March 1979 the Government decided that the Air Corps should be provided with a twin engined jet transport aircraft, to be used as necessary to transport the President, <Col N="1352" /> Ministers and officials in connection with official duties.  A British Aerospace HS 125 aircraft was acquired and the Ministerial Air Transport Service commenced in July 1979.</P>
      <P>To allow the Government to fulfil European and other engagements during the term of Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 1990, the Government decided to lease a larger aircraft with transatlantic capabilities.  Subsequently the Government decided to purchase a Gulfstream IV aircraft and to dispose of the HS 125 aircraft.  The Gulfstream IVA aircraft, which can carry up to 14 passengers, entered the service in March 1992.</P>
      <P>The following persons may use the service: the President, members of the Government, Ministers of State and authorised officials of the public service. In addition husbands and wives may use the service if they are accompanying their spouses in a representative capacity on official business.</P>
      <P>A set of procedures for the use of the service was drawn up in 1979 and approved by the Department of the Taoiseach which authories each use of the service.  These procedures were revised in 1983, 1987 and 1993 but remained largely as originally approved.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a recent question from Deputy Durkan, the detailed cost of operating all Air Corps aircraft is being evaluated at present.  If the information is available when I answer Parliamentary Questions on Wednesday next I shall set out in detail the position.  It is my intention to be open on the matter and indeed, on all other matters.  We have no apologies to offer.  To be frank, I think this has got out of control.  What some people want us to do is to leave the jet on the tarmac and the crew in their bailiwicks and cycle to Government meetings and drink buttermilk to refresh ourselves at the end of the cycle to the fisheries council meeting.</P>

      <P>In respect of the very unfair attack on my colleague by the Deputy, Ms Burton Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, and her husband travelled at the request of the Government with the President and Mr. Robinson on a State visit to Tanzania.  It is customary for spouses to accompany Ministers on State visits, if possible.  The date of this visit was 6 October 1994, the return date was 13 October 1994 and originally the whole party was to return from Dares Salaam.  The arrangements for the President were changed and she went to Rwanda, a visit which was unconfirmed until a very late date.  The rest of the party of nine, including officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the President returned to Europe as arranged.</P>
      <P>The Ministerial Air Transport Service was used to bring the Minister of State, Deputy Bruton and other members of the party home from Zurich on the evening of 13 October, thus avoiding an overnight stay in Zurich.  During her stay in Tanzania the Minister of State stayed with Irish Government officials and Irish aid workers, hotel costs were therefore not incurred.  I visited Rwanda and stayed in Kigali under the same roof as Deputy Owen and was a beneficiary of her hospitality.  She has done wonderful work for Concern in Kigali.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the issue of transfer payments from husbands to wives.  I understand that in certain circumstances where a husband makes payments to his wife under a maintenance agreement, such payments are levied with PRSI.  If that is the case, it is outrageous.  Presumably when the husband earned moneys he paid PRSI appropriate to his station in life, whether as a civil servant, a self-employed person or a PAYE worker.  The taxing of such a payment from a husband to a wife seems indefensible. A constituent raised the matter with me and I was shocked when I read his letter.  I raised the matter to ask that something be done immediately to stop levies of this kind being imposed on transfer payments between a husband and a wife when there is not a moral, legal or reasonable basis for such a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  He asked that I apologise for his absence as he is detained on other Government business. The matter Deputy McDowell raised is important and with your permission, Sir, I will give the House some background information on it.</P>
      <P>If Deputy McDowell wishes to give details of his constituent's case to the Minister for Finance I will ensure it will be given the appropriate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation where an individual is making maintenance payments to an estranged spouse, PRSI contributions, health contribution and employment and training levy are chargeable on the paying spouse's income at the time it is earned and <Col N="1356" /> again on the maintenance payments on their receipt by the receiving spouse.  I should point out that this contrasts with the income tax treatment of such payments. For income tax purposes the payer is allowed a deduction in respect of the maintenance payments in the computation of his or her income.  The maintenance payments are then chargeable to income tax in the hands of the recipient.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the legislation in question rests with the Departments which administer the various schemes, namely, the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; PRSI Contributions, the Department of Health &mdash; health contributions and the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; employment and training levy.  My colleague the Minister for Social Welfare addressed this issue in a response to a parliamentary question on 24 November 1993.  He indicated at that time that the payment of social insurance contributions by both spouses was important in the context of benefit entitlements.</P>
    <P>The payment of separate PRSI contributions enables each spouse to build up a social insurance record in their own right, and they can both, in due course, qualify for a pension.  Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and I agree with the Minister for Social Welfare that coverage under the system should be extended as widely as possible and should afford protection to separated spouses.  It is therefore appropriate that a social insurance contribution be levied on the maintenance payment.</P>
    <P>The charging of the health and employment and training levies to both spouses is another matter.  For the purposes of these levies the person receiving the maintenance payment is treated in the same way as a self-employed person with the maintenance payments made by one spouse to the other being regarded as reckonable income.  The liability to the various charges is the same as for a self-employed person and no allowance or cognisance is taken of the fact that the maintenance has <Col N="1357" /> already suffered deduction of levies in the hands of the payer.  This is clearly anomalous.  Unlike social insurance contributions no specific benefits accure to the individual involved.</P>
    <P>It is clearly undesirable that the one segment of income should be subject to a double charge where, but for the fact of separation, the couple would suffer only one set of impositions.  The number of such cases is small but it is rising and it may be expected that the incidence will continue to rise.  Once again while in the case of social insurance the provision of a separate benefit entitlement constitutes a justification, the double charging of such payments to the levies is difficult to defend.  The issue is a complex one affecting a number of Government Departments as well as the Revenue Commissioners who collect the levies.  I have arranged that discussions should take place between officials of my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Enterprise and Employment to examine the position in detail with a view to bringing forward proposals for more equitable arrangements.  I am confident that following these discussions a satisfactory solution can be found to what is essentially a complex administrative problem. I am grateful to Deputy McDowell for raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has failed completely in his duty to provide a proper level of service for farmers in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offices of the Department of Agriculture in Davitt House, Castlebar are open Monday to Friday from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.  It is impossible for the Department to provide a proper level of service to the farming community in County Mayo and other counties within those hours.  Equally, it is impossible for individual farmers to make contact with the Department by telephone between <Col N="1358" /> those hours as the lines are constantly jammed.</P>
    <P>The staff in the Department of Agriculture in Castlebar do a first class job under very trying circumstances.  A full time staff of 12 deal with 11,000 headage claims and 10,000 sukler cow grants from County Mayo alone.  In addition, this staff have to deal with 4,000 sheep headage claims and 5,000 ewe premium claims together with related problems associated with areaaid application forms and extensification grants.</P>
    <P>What can farmers do?  Farmers from areas like Louisburgh, Achill, Ballycroy, Belmullet, Kilmaine, Shrule or surrounding areas, who attempt to contact the Department by telephone often fail to do so and they then have to drive a round trip of up to 100 miles only to find that they cannot gain access to the offices and, if they do that there are no facilities therein to discuss their application problems in any degree of privacy.</P>
    <P>Many farmers like to call to the Department to have problems arising from their claims dealt with on an individual basis.  There is no space in the Department of Agriculture section of Davitt House for private conversations to sort out those problems.  It means, therefore, that staff have to be accosted by individual farmers in the corridors or on their way in or out of the building in an attempt to validate their claims.  The space on either side of the foyer of Davitt House is now being used as a store room and the building generally has taken on a tatty look indeed.  There is a clear need for an upgrading of facility and a brightening up of the building in general.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance to immediately allow for the recruitment of further temporary staff in addition to those presently employed, to allow for greater opening hours of this section of the Department to enable the public to call and deal with their problems, to allow for greater telephone access by the public to this section and <Col N="1359" /> to make arrangements for interview rooms to be provided whereby individuals calling to sort out their claims forms and problems arising therefrom can discuss those problems with officials of the Department in some degree of privacy.</P>
    <P>It should be standard practice that as the Department of Agriculture requires all farmers to apply for EU agricultural assistance by a particular date so also should the farmer be entitled to receive his grants by a specific date.  There are literally thousands of man hours wasted every year in dealing with queries arising from delays in agricultural payments. If the Minister regards farming as a business then prompt payment of grants and subsidies should be standard practice.  This would alleviate the necessity for farmers to seek long term credit from co-ops and farming supply services.</P>
    <P>In addition I call upon the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make arrangements with the Minister for Finance for an upgrading of the general facilities at Davitt House, for the arrangement of proper space at the entrance to the building and for a brightening up of the facilities and conditions under which staff have to work.</P>
    <P>In view of the huge output to be dealt with by staff at the Department of Agriculture section, Davitt House, they should be allowed work in the optimum conditions.  The public have a right to expect that they should have greater access by longer opening hours and better facilities in which to have their claims dealt with.</P>
    <P>My call, therefore, is for the Minister to respond as a matter of urgency to these claims in view of the very busy period ahead in the agriculture sector.  I extend an invitation to the Minister to visit Davitt House, Castlebar, to see for himself the problems at first hand and to understand the necessity of upgrading facilities there immediately.  This is a source of personal concern to thousands of farmers and I hope the Minister responds adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this issue which is obviously of great concern to him.  From February this year, the decision was taken to operate restricted opening hours for dealing with personal and telephone callers at all my Department's local offices, the special beef premium unit in Portlaoise and the Castlebar office.  The opening hours were limited to 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Monday to Friday.  This measure was initially taken to facilitate final processing of 1993 premium and headage schemes and it was decided to continue with the restricted opening hours to ensure the earliest delivery of payments under 1994 schemes.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that a consequence of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was to switch the emphasis in the agricultural support system away from market supports such as intervention purchasing towards direct payments to farmers.  This entailed the introduction of new schemes and a higher level of direct payments to the farming community.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of applications received under the various schemes &mdash; more than 650,000 in 1994.  An ever increasing proportion of farmers' income stems from these payments and my major priority is to ensure that all eligible claims are paid within the timeframe set out in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> To this end, I have ensured that additional staff were assigned to the local offices, to the special beef premium unit and at headquarters and that a major computerisation programme designed to assist the delivery of payments was installed in these offices.</P>
      <P>Faced with the volume and complexity of schemes to be administered, the stark choice facing me was to continue with normal opening hours and run the risk of delaying payments to farmers or restrict opening hours to mornings only and concentrate resources on processing payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various measures which I have <Col N="1361" /> introduced have enabled my Department to issue in excess of £613 million to farmers in respect of 1993 and 1994 applications.  They have been a major factor in our performance in delivering payments under the 1994 ewe premium and deseasonalisation slaughter premium schemes where some 98 per cent and 95 per cent of applicants have already received payments.  Ireland's performance in making 1994 payments is well ahead of the rest of the European Union.  We were one of only two member states that commenced 1994 ewe premium payments in July.  By the end of August when 95 per cent of farmers in Ireland had received ewe premium payments only one other member state had made any significant payments.  We are now starting payments under the sheep headage scheme and will be commencing other headage, special beef and suckler cow premium payments from 1 November, up to three weeks ahead of 1993.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention that these restricted opening hours should continue any longer than necessary.  I am personally committed to providing the most comprehensive service to the farming community and I will review opening hours as soon as possible.  The additional resources which I have put in place involving staffing and computerisation in particular have already contributed to significant advances in 1994 and will be even more effective from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the urgent need for the appointment of a fifth temporary teacher for Ballingarry national school. I commend and congratulate the teachers whose dedication and commitment to the children of this school is <Col N="1362" /> exceptional.  I also congratulate the parents who have shown tremendous determination and consistency in this matter. Their efforts have resulted in many improvements in the school.  I acknowledge the appointment by the Minister for Education of a remedial teacher to this school.  The people of the area are very grateful for this facility.  However, all the good work achieved by that appointment will be undone because the school now has larger classes due to the present pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>The Department has recognised the social and economic needs of the area by giving this school disadvantaged status.  The problems are acute and they must be addressed on an individual basis.  Class sizes are too large as the school is only two pupils short of the required number for a fifth teacher.  The school, like many others, has experienced a serious decline in numbers in recent years and the number of teachers has been reduced from six in 1992 to five in 1993 to four as and from 1 September 1994.  This has resulted in a major reorganisation of resources in the past three years.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the appointment of a remedial teacher and the designation of the school with disadvantaged status will be counter-balanced by the large class sizes.  The essence and value of education depends totally on class size.  There is little point having a remedial teacher and disadvantaged status if class sizes are larger than was the case previously.  These pupils require individual attention and much progress has been made with them as a result of improved resources.  However, everybody's morale has been damaged by the fact that the classes are now larger than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to judge the need for the appointment of a fifth teacher on an individual basis.  This school is only two pupils short of the requirement and there are indications that two pupils will be joining the school during the school year.  However, the regulations laid down by the Department of Education are such that the <Col N="1363" /> school will have to operate with four teachers for the entire year because it was two pupils short at the start of the school year.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to show the same interest and caring attitude towards Ballingarry national school as she has shown in the past.  We appreciate the additional resources made available to the school, but they can only be 100 per cent beneficial if class sizes are kept to the level of the past year.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, is here to respond to this motion.  He is close enough to south Tipperary to have a personal interest in the educational provisions in the area. Ballingarry school is making a modest request and in view of the many teachers unemployed at present and the advantages that will evolve for the students from the appointment of a fifth teacher, I consider it not only right but prudent judgment of the Minister to proceed with this appointment forthwith.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am aware of the problems in this area as I live just across the Border.  I have met several deputations from the school in the past.  I hope we will be able to resolve the problems.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing which has been entered into between the Government and the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Ballingarry national school, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1992 was 140 pupils. Accordingly, the school had a staffing in <Col N="1364" /> the 1993-94 school year of a principal and four assistants.  However, in September 1993 the enrolment had dropped to 122 pupils giving rise to a staffing in the current school year of a principal and three assistants.  Accordingly, in June 1994 the fourth assistant's post was suppressed.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year details were announced of an extra 54 schools which were included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Ballingarry national school was one of these schools.  Unfortunately, there were no additional posts available for allocation to these schools this year.  However, all these schools will benefit this year from a higher rate of capitation grant.  In the event of additional resources becoming available, the needs of these schools will be considered in the context of allocating additional staffing resources.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, all infant classes in all schools designated as disadvantaged have a maximum class size of 29 pupils for the current school year. The Department is examining proposals for the introduction of a maximum class size of 29 in all classes in all disadvantaged schools and I expect an announcement and a decision in this matter shortly.  Ballingarry national school would be allocated an additional post if the maximum class size of 29 for all disadvantaged schools is introduced.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department will inform the chairperson of the board of management of Ballingarry national school as soon as a decision in this matter has been reached.  I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's plans for responding to housing needs are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government which states clearly that the aim of the Government's policies will be to reduce pressure on local authority waiting lists to the greatest extent possible.  In particular, the Government is committed to speeding up implementation of the plan for social housing and to making a much more substantial provision for local authority housing.  These commitments are re-iterated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and are being met in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept, as suggested in the question, that there is a housing crisis. The Government have demonstrated its commitment to reduce local authority housing lists by the extra funds it has <Col N="1268" /> provided over the last two years to expand the house building programme, to promote greater use of the various schemes in the plan for social housing and to fund increased activity in the voluntary housing sector.</P>
    <P>The overall housing capital allocation for 1994 is almost £302 million an increase of over £113 million or 60 per cent on the 1993 outturn of £189 million. The 1994 budget contained the following special capital provisions to increase output of new dwellings and improve existing dwellings; an extra £12 million for the local authority house building programme; an extra £2.5 million for the remedial works scheme; an extra £1.5 million for the installation of bathrooms; an extra £2 million for the task force on housing aid for the elderly; a special new provision of £3 million to supplement the resources of local authorities with large flat complexes in meeting the cost of replacement of defective windows.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and voluntary bodies have responded positively to the provision of these extra resources.  I expect that, between the local authority, voluntary and other programmes, together with vacancies arising in the local authority rented housing stock, over 9,000 households in housing need will be accommodated this year and again in 1995.  This number compares very favourably with the corresponding figures of 7,100 in 1993 and 6,100 in 1992.  It means that annual social housing output will have increased by 50 per cent in two years.  It follows, therefore, that with the Government supporting an annual availability of over 9,000 units of accommodation, there is improved general access to housing and a shortening of the length of the time on waiting lists.  Homeless people seeking permanent housing, along with other categories of persons in need, benefit from the larger number of units of accommodation becoming available.</P>

Responsibility for signposting of non-national roads is a matter for each road authority, financed from its own resources supplemented by the annual discretionary State road grants.  It is a matter for each authority to monitor the standard of signposting on the non-national road network in its area and to determine the priorities for the expenditure of funds available for such roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special scheme of State grants was introduced in 1987, with the co-operation of Bord Fáilte, to improve the signposting of regional roads in areas of high tourist amenity.  To date, a total of <Col N="1270" /> £650,000 has been allocated to 26 county councils under the scheme, including grants of £25.000 each to seven county councils this year.</P>
    <P>I have arranged the preparation of a detailed traffic signs manual for use by road authorities.  The manual, which will be available in 1995, will outline a code of good practice to be followed in the provision of traffic signs on all classes of roads.  I am confident that it will lead to significant improvements in signposting throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Local authorities, their representative associations, and a variety of other bodies organise seminars, workshops, conferences and the like on various aspects of local government and these are widely attended by local councillors. Ministers and officials of my Department frequently attend and contribute to these events.  The Institute of Public Administration provides facilities for councillors such as lectures, seminars and conferences, and it produces a quarterly publication, &ldquo;The Local Authority Times&rdquo; on issues of interest to local authority members and officials alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own Department published a booklet entitled &ldquo;Local Government and the Elected Member&rdquo; in 1991.  In addition, many other departmental publications are of direct relevance to local councillors; in some cases, sufficient copies of these are sent to local authorities to permit distribution to each <Col N="1271" /> councillor, while in other cases, copies are made available on request, either from the Department or through the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have recently been discussing with the local authority associations ways of strengthening their resources and I have agreed a substantial increase in the annual funding of the General Council of County Councils.  This should enable the council to develop further its informational and back-up services for councillors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £20 million has been invested in recent years on sewage treatment <Col N="1276" /> designed to improve water quality in Lough Derg and in the river which feed into the lake: secondary treatment has been provided at Athlone, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Birr, Tullamore and Nenagh. A major application for EU Cohesion Fund financing has recently been submitted to the European Commission. The work involved, which will cost some £30 million, includes major schemes in Roscrea, Portumna, Clara, Ferbane, Castlerea, Moate, Scarriff, Athlone, Banagher and Killaloe as well as the ugrading of facilities and the installation of phosphorus removal at a number of other sites.</P>
    <P>My Department has been financing a programme to provide pump-out facilities for wastes from pleasure craft in the Shannon system.  Facilities have been provided or are in course of provision, at Mountshannon, Dromineer, Athlone, Ballina-Killaloe, Carrick-on-Shannon, Shannonbridge, Tullamore and Edenderry. Facilities will be provided at Portumna and Ballyleague in conjunction with sewage treatment proposals.</P>
    <P>A range of measures has also been developed which will assist in dealing with inputs to Lough Derg from farming. These include the new REPS scheme and the new control of farm pollution scheme which commenced on 1 September 1994.  A code of practice for nitrates is also being finalised and should be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place in a national context with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Associations regarding the promotion of the use of phosphate-free detergents.  Considerable progress has been made in the increased use domestically of phosphate-free products which now represent about 40 per cent of overall domestic consumptions of washing powders and liquids.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of local measures and initiatives for the improvement of Lough Derg water quality is being undertaken by the Mid-West Regional Authority. <Col N="1277" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): The ban on the sale, marketing and distribution of coal which was introduced in the Dublin area in 1990 was designed to remedy a situation in which air quality standards for smoke had been regularly breached for several years.  I have recently announced that a similar coal ban will be introduced in the Cork City area on a precautionary basis.  The combined annual cost of the special fuel allowance associated with the coal ban in Dublin and Cork will be some £7.2 million.</P>
      <P>The Government has demonstrated its readiness to extend the coal ban as circumstances require.  However, its application must, given the significant costs involved, be targeted on situations of proven serious smoke pollution by reference to statutory air quality standards. In this regard, it should be noted that average annual smoke concentrations for Cork city have been running at twice the annual average of other areas in the country.</P>

Notwithstanding this, I am asking the local authorities concerned to further examine whether, having regard to the available legal advice and to the circumstances of particular flat blocks, a way can be found to allow the sale of flats to tenants who have expressed an interest in purchasing.</P>

      <P>The problems created for local authorities by the ever-increasing costs associated with public liability claims are a legitimate cause of concern. I am concerned, not only with the direct financial costs of paying the higher insurance premia resulting from increasing awards, but also with the resources used up in processing and investigating claims.  This combination of increased <Col N="1280" /> costs results in a poorer standard of service for the entire community.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the legitimate claims of genuine accident victims. However, there is no doubt that attempts are made to defraud local authorities.  I include in this category not only those who make claims in respect of accidents which may never have happened but also those who, having had an accident, exaggerate their injuries in an attempt to maximise the potential damages.</P>
      <P>It is my duty to speak out about this drain on public funds.  It is estimated that local authorities are now faced with claims amounting to £130 million.  If only one quarter of these claims were fraudulent or excessive, both the scale of the problem and the urgent need to eliminate the abuse become obvious. Those who seek to fleece local authorities by their selfish actions must be left in no doubt that such behaviour will no longer be tolerated.  I am, therefore, strongly encouraging local authorities to continue their efforts to challenge unsustainable claims and to eliminate the causes of claims.</P>
      <P>I accept that sections of the road network are in need of improvement and that is why unprecedented levels of funding have been made available in recent years for the improvement of both national and non-national roads.  A total of £195 million will be expended on the construction and maintenance of national roads in 1994.  In addition, the Exchequer has provided a record £106 million this year for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads, an increase of £31 million or 41 per cent on 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that the Northern Port Access Route should proceed on a priority basis, subject to: the route being constructed as a dual carriageway, mostly in tunnel, from the Airport Motorway at Whitehall to the North Port; the route being classified as a proposed national road, thereby placing its construction under the overall responsibility of the National Roads Authority; and the implementation of the project being accompanied by traffic management measures, including tolling and a truck management system on the lines recommended in the DTI final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is most anxious that <Col N="1284" /> this project be implemented as quickly as possible and I am therefore asking the National Roads Authority to take immediate steps to commence the necessary preparatory work, in co-operation with Dublin Corporation.  The authority is also being asked urgently to assess the scope for competitive private sector participation in the design, construction and/or financing of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 60, 62, 66, 74 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The average failure rate, nationally, for driving tests in the year to 7 October 1994 was 46.3 per cent and this level has varied only marginally over the years. The factors taken into consideration in the conduct of the driving test are laid down in an EU Directive and are prescribed in Irish law.  The test is designed to ensure that holders of driving licences can drive competently and safely and with due regard for the convenience and safety of other road users. Quite apart from the necessity to comply with EU law, it would be inappropriate to lower the standard of test to enable a higher proportion of applicants to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the need to monitor the conduct of driving tests in order to ensure compliance with the legal requirements and to ensure, as far as possible, uniformity and equity in the application of tests.  To this end, the performance of driver testers is monitored by supervisory driver testers whose activities, in turn, are supervised by a chief tester.  Supervisory testers, from time to time, travel in vehicles while tests are being conducted in order to observe at first hand the performance of the tester, to permit subsequent discussion of the test with the driver tester, and to make suggestions for any changes in conduct.  In addition, test results are analysed by reference to test centres, individual driver testers, and categories of vehicles, with a view to identifying any measures that may be <Col N="1289" /> necessary to ensure uniformity of standards. Training and retraining of testers is also carried out</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question arises from my request that local authorities should seek to involve local communities in contributing, whether in money or kind, towards the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their areas.  The experience where pilot schemes have operated since 1992, based on co-operative efforts, has reinforced my view that this approach can make a valuable contribution towards restoring defective roads.  Communities in these areas have displayed a willingness to play a role in finding solutions to road problems which affect them.  This support can add significantly to the return from public investment in these roads and enable local authorities to undertake more extensive programmes of work than would otherwise be possible.  This willingness to participate is now evidenced by waiting lists of applicants wishing to contribute towards road work schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pilot schemes have established that there is considerable scope to attract community support for road improvement and maintenance programmes for non-national roads generally.  Accordingly I have requested all local authorities to investigate the potential to promote and harness community support for road works in their areas and have suggested that a portion of this year's discretionary grant allocation might be reserved for suitable road schemes.  I have indicated that these <Col N="1290" /> investigations should not be confined to minor rural roads, but should have the widest possible application, including investigation of the scope for support for works in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for local authorities to determine the conditions and administrative arrangements applied to road schemes undertaken by them with community support, including any requirements concerning payment of a contribution towards the cost of road works and the nature of the activities which might be undertaken by the local community.</P>
    <P>On a broader level the practice of payment for services is well established and is fundamental to the ability of local authorities to perform their statutory functions to the standard the public has come to expect and demand.  In this context, account should be taken of the fact that this country has a higher mileage of public roads per head of population than many other, and more developed, countries.</P>
    <P>The question of applying charges in respect of national roads is appropriate to the National Roads Authority.  The authority, at my request, is investigating possibilities in this regard with a view to raising up to £100 million which would be used to accelerate work on upgrading the network of national roads.</P>

      <P>The question of funding for this scheme, and for water and sewerage projects generally, has to be considered in the context of the resources available under the National Development Plan. The high level of existing commitments and the demands of schemes already prioritised for investment account for all finance available to the water services programme at present.  It is not <Col N="1291" /> possible therefore to provide funding for this scheme at this stage.  However, the position will be regularly reviewed during the period of the National Development Plan.</P>

    <P>I consider that wearing of cycle helmets can best be dealt with by educational and awareness campaigns such as those operated by the National Safety Council.  At my request, the council is prominently featuring the benefits of wearing cycle helmets as part <Col N="1293" /> of their 1994 programme.  During September, a specific campaign aimed at parents and children stressed the importance of wearing helmets.  The Rules of the Road booklet also encourages this.</P>

      <P>On European Community definitions, the ratio of General Government debt to Gross Domestic Product at end 1993 is estimated at 96.1.  Its subsequent evolution will depend on a variety of factors which are difficult to predict accurately. However the ratio is expected to decline significantly during 1994; and as stated in Ireland's Convergence Programme 1994-96, the General Government deficit will be contained within 3 per cent of GDP.  This will continue to keep the debt ratio on a downward path at a satisfactory pace.</P>
      <P>On 19 September last, the EU Council of Finance Ministers welcomed Ireland's Convergence Programme.  It noted the strong performance of the Irish economy including the sound fiscal position and the continued reduction in Ireland's debt ratio.  The Council also welcomed the firmly expressed commitment of the Irish Government to continue to pursue policies conforming to the requirements for moving to stage 111 of European Monetary Union.</P>

An Post operates a formal system of internal monitoring of service quality at all post offices to ensure that standards, including queuing times are being maintained.

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is seeking information as to the names of the person or persons who were the registered proprietors of a particular bookmakers premises in 1988 and 1989.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of 30 June 1994, my Department does not maintain records of the ownership of bookmakers premises.  The Garda Síochána do have a function under the Betting <Col N="1298" /> Act in issuing certificates of personal fitness in respect of persons seeking a bookmakers licence and certificates of suitability of premises where a licence is sought in relation to a particular premises. However, the licences are issued by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda would not have records of whether a licence was, in fact, issued in a particular case or, if issued, its date or period of duration.  Only the Revenue Commissioners would have such details.</P>
      <P>In the case of a person wishing to ascertain who is the currently registered proprietor of a particular bookmakers premises, the Act requires that the certificate of registration issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the proprietor must be displayed prominently in the premises.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my replies to questions on 3 February and 9 March (Official Report Volumes 438 (No. 3) and 440 (No. 2) at columns 689 to 695 and 327 to 328 respectively) the Garda Commissioner instituted an internal inquiry into matters which had come to light in relation to certain operations of the Garda Anti-Racketeering Unit (ARU).  A number of changes took place in the unit as a result of that action.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, certain other information came to light and the Commissioner instituted a further investigation. I can confirm that that investigation was finalised and that the Garda report on the matter was sent to me by the Commissioner on 27 May 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The main conclusions of the investigation were as follows:</P>
    <P> (1)  The installation of a tape recorder in the Office of the ARU in Garda Headquarters and the taping of telephone conversations, at the direction of the Garda member in operational control of the former ARU at the times relevant to the investigation, were justified and in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>(2)  Adequate arrangements were not in place in the ARU at the relevant times for securing audio cassette tapes.</P>
    <P>(3)  The obtaining of a sum of £200 in July 1992 by the Garda in operational control of the ARU from a private organisation &mdash; INFACT &mdash; in connection with the investigation of illegal copying of video cassettes, was not for the benefit of the Garda, and was not used as such.  But the investigation concluded that it would have been more prudent if the Garda member had sought the sum through the usual channels within the Force so as to negative any allegation of improper payment and use of money from third parties.  (It had been established in the first internal inquiry that payments totalling £250 were made by INFACT to some members of An Garda Síochána, as unsolicited out of pocket expenses in connection with searches by the ARU to detect breaches of the Copyright Acts.)</P>
    <P>(4)  The working relationship between the INFACT organisation and the Garda ARU at the relevant times appeared to have been a professional one, involving a close working relationship between the member in operational control of the ARU and the Director General of INFACT.</P>
    <P>(5)  No sustainable evidence was discovered as to the identity of the person who removed cassette tapes <Col N="1300" /> from the office of the ARU, or as to the identity of the source of their distribution to a third party. </P>
    <P>The report also confirmed earlier evidence of poor inter-personal relationships, including strong conflicts of views, between certain members of the former ARU</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geogh-egan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The document provided by IMPACT entitled <i>The Probation and Welfare Service in Ireland: Confronting Crime, Serving the Community, Working with Offenders</i> deals with the main aspects of the work of the Probation and Welfare Service.  It draws attention to the important role of the Probation and Welfare Officer in a range of community-based and institution-based activities.</P>
      <P>In my Department's policy document the <i>Management of Offenders</i>&mdash;<i>A Five Year Plan</i> there are a number of measures aimed at utilising to the greatest possible extent the Probation and Welfare Service and addressing the issues raised by IMPACT.  These measures include the introduction of the concept of Positive Sentence Management which will facilitate a move to planned and programmed releases, where justified and earned, under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  Another is the development of more community sanctions and measures at the court stage.  Other measures incorporated in the Five Year Plan include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of community based Probation and Welfare facilities to manage offenders on release from custody before the expiry of sentences.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of a formalised aftercare service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" />&mdash;the provision of an enhanced Probation and Welfare Service to offenders while in custody.</P>
    <P>These services are designed to have a positive effect in leading those in custody towards a constructive crime-free life in the community on release.</P>
    <P>In the Law and Order Package which I announced last December, I secured Government approval for the employment of 50 additional staff in the Probation and Welfare Service over the period 1994 to 1997 for the above purposes. The number of Probation and Welfare Officers currently employed by my Department is 184 and a further 16 are in the process of being recruited. Additional staff will be recruited over the next two years to bring the total number of Probation and Welfare Officer posts up to 237.  This represents a significant increase in the number of posts since 1985 when the Whitaker report was being prepared and the approved staffing level was 169.</P>
    <P>The views put forward by IMPACT in the document entitled <i>The Probation and Welfare Service in Ireland, Confronting Crime, Serving the Community, Working with Offenders</i> will, of course, be taken into account in the implementation of my Department's Five Year Plan for the Management of Offenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geogh-egan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the statement in question was made in the context of a recent pre-budget submission to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  In the absence of specific details about the cases in question, it is not possible to comment on the findings contained in the submission.  I have asked my Department to contact Women's Aid to get more details. However, I can assure the Deputy that this issue is one which receives the highest priority from myself and the Garda authorities.  In this regard, the Garda Commissioner, earlier this year, issued directions on the approach to be taken by the gardaí in incidents of domestic violence.  These directions set out the manner in which investigations should be conducted (and reported) and state that where a power of arrest exists in respect of a domestic violence incident. <Col N="1306" /> that power should be exercised and the offender charged.  I understand that legislation being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, will further extend the powers of arrest in these situations.</P>
      <P>Another example of the resolve of the Garda authorities to deal effectively with this issue is the establishment of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit &mdash; formally known as the Woman and Child Unit. The unit was established in March 1993, and it is staffed by gardaí who are highly trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults. The functions of the unit include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children. Enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders are also carefully examined.  The unit works in close contact with the Garda Community Relations Sections and liaises with organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which deal with violent or sexual crime against women and children.  It also deals with the drafting of protocol on the role of the Garda Síochána in these cases.</P>

      <P>There is provision in the Human Resources Operational Programme currently being finalised to support the establishment of creche facilities for pre-school children and afterschool provision for older children. There will be an initial focus on the needs of mothers in areas of identified disadvantages.  This addresses one of the main obstacles preventing women from re-entering the education system or the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care training is being developed to meet the increased demand for child <Col N="1308" /> care workers.  Under management training measures being proposed in the Programme, experienced and qualified child care workers will be trained in order to develop the pool of people with the skills needed to manage a child care facility.</P>
    <P>FÁS supports the direct provision of child care facilities by local groups through the Community Employment programme.  Through its Community Training programme it can also support the physical establishment/refurbishment of community based child care facilities by providing labour and supervision. The availability of these facilities assists individuals in local communities to access training, educational and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>FÁS is also involved in the provision of child care training.</P>
    <P>Data is not available on the level of funding involved in these activities. However, it is expected that the current level of assistance will continue in the coming years.</P>
    <P>While there is still some way to go in developing child care facilities, recognition of the need to do so is now an integral consideration in the development of my Department's programmes.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for paying a redundancy lump sum to an employee rests with the employer in the first instance.  If the employer is unable or refuses to pay, there are remedies open to employees.  For a payment to be made to an employee from the Social Insurance Fund entitlement must be established either by (i) a redundancy certificate given by the employer or on <Col N="1309" /> his behalf, or (ii) by decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person on whose behalf the Deputy is inquiring has received a favourable decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  At that point she would have been advised by the tribunal to pursue the matter with her former employer and, if she failed to obtain satisfaction within a reasonable time to refer to Form R.P. 14, which is an employee's application for a lump sum payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  To date my Department has not received such an application from this person.  If she has requested payment of her redundancy lump sum from her employer, as advised by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and has not had a satisfactory response, she should apply to the redundancy payments section of my Department by completing the appropriate form R.P. 14, which my Department has now sent directly to her.</P>

      <P>The information available indicates that chimney fires are the most common fires in domestic premises and the incidence tends to be higher in the winter period.  A number of positive steps are being taken to reduce the incidence of house fires.  This week is National Fire Prevention Week which I formally launched on behalf of the National Safety Council some days ago. The week's theme is &ldquo;Fire Alert &mdash; Planning for the Family&rdquo; and a very extensive programme of events has been arranged to keep the message of fire safety in the home before the public. Activities include intensive radio and publicity campaigns, open days at fire stations, distribution of leaflets and posters to local communities, local radio and press promotions, and lectures in schools by local fire brigades.</P>
      <P>Public emphasis is also being laid on the tremendous aid which smoke alarms are to fire safety in the home.  Last year's project by the National Safety Council to instal 1,000 alarms in the homes of elderly people living alone in Dublin is being extended this year to the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway, and being continued in Dublin; in all, the homes of 4,000 elderly people and people who are physically handicapped will be covered.  I am glad to have been able to assist in the extension of the scheme by providing a special grant of £20,000 for it this year.  As part of the current year's &ldquo;Reach Out &mdash; Be a Good Neighbour&rdquo; campaign, which is concerned with improving the safety and well-being of old and vulnerable people living alone, a further 500 smoke alarms are being installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing authorities have been reminded of the need for adequate fire <Col N="1313" /> safety measures in both new and existing local authority dwellings.  It has been recommended that each housing authority should take steps to actively encourage their tenants to provide and keep in working order, suitable smoke detectors-alarms.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of new houses, whether local authority or private, the guidance documents issued by my Department to accompany the building regulations contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape, including the provision of smoke alarms, internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade.  In effect, in the absence of more effective identified safeguards, it is mandatory to install a smoke alarm in any new or reconstructed house.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently made a substantial contribution to fire safety in the home through the publication of the <i>Guide to Fire Safety in Flats.</i>  This document should be of particular relevance to the many families who live in flats and apartments, as well as landlords, managers and owners of such properties.</P>

      <P>There are no official statistics available on the percentage of lamb losses due to predatory foxes.  However, estimates generated within the Department would suggest that on average between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of lambs suffer mortality each year in Ireland due to various causes.  The main causes of loss are: (i) weather conditions, (ii) birth difficulty, (iii) infection and disease and (iv) death due to marauding dogs, foxes and birds of prey.  As a very rough estimate, each of these causes accounts for about a quarter of annual losses.</P>

      <P>The target set in the Programme for Government of increasing planting to 30,000 hectares per annum, combined with the introduction earlier this year of significantly increased forestry grants and premiums, has substantially raised the level of planting throughout Ireland, particularly among private landowners.  In order to accommodate the growth in the number of forestry grant applications, to keep delays in processing such applications to a minimum and to focus the expertise of my Department's forestry inspectorate on the more complex cases, a system was introduced earlier this year whereby a number of contractors carry out, on behalf of the Department, assessments of forestry projects.  In order to ensure that they would have the necessary competence and resources, certain minimum criteria for participation in this scheme were drawn up and advised to all contractors known to the Department.  It was open to all contractors who met these criteria to apply to participate in the new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six forestry contracting companies met the necessary criteria and these now participate in the new system, in accordance with strict administrative and technical guidelines drawn up by <Col N="1320" /> the Department.  The participating contractors report to the Department, in accordance with these guidelines following site-plantation inspections.  On receipt of these reports a percentage of cases are selected by the Department's forestry inspectorate for further inspection. Cases not chosen for further inspections are approved on the basis of the contractor's report.  All cases which have environmental concerns are referred to the Department and are dealt with directly by the forestry inspectorate.  It is important to note that each and every site will be visited by a forestry inspector at least once, at preplanting, post-planting, or maintenance grant stage.</P>
    <P>This new system should free up forestry inspectors around the country to deal more expeditiously with applications from other forestry contracting companies and with the more complicated cases.  The objective is to provide a better service to all those seeking forestry grants, whether via contractors participating in the new system or otherwise.  The new system is being monitored and its operation will be evaluated in coming months.  At that stage I will consider extending the scheme to other forestry contracting companies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which will be published shortly, contains proposals for improving public transport services throughout the Greater Dublin Area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the northside of Dublin the basic three line light rail network recommended by the DTI includes a line to Ballymun.  The Government's objective is to have two priority phases of this basic network constructed during the period of the National Development Plan at an estimated cost of £200 million and the Government will decide in due course on the two priority phases to be constructed.  A fourth light rail line to Finglas via the old Broadstone railway line and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords also form part of the full DTI recommended light rail network.</P>
      <P>The DTI has recommended further evaluation of a conventional rail link from Dublin Airport to the DublinBelfast railway.  Possible extensions of the DART to Malahide and Greystones are also included in the DTI recommendations along with upgrading of the existing DART system including certain stations.  The DTI also recommends an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services, improved public transport interchange facilities and provision of secure park-and-ride facilities on the public transport network.</P>
      <P>Apart from the proposed £200 million light rail expenditure, it is not possible to be more specific about the prospects for implementation of the many other public transport projects until a full evaluation of these has been carried out, bearing in mind that the full cost of all of these projects would greatly exceed likely available funding.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of general practitioner services under the General Medical Services Scheme (GMS) rests with the chief executive officers of the health boards.  The current arrangements governing entry to the General Medical Services Scheme were agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation in August 1989.  Vacancies arising or new posts created under the GMS are filled to the degree necessary to provide a proper level of access to general practitioner services for medical card patients and to ensure that patients have a reasonable degree of choice in selecting a practitioner having due regard to the viability of practices in the area in question.</P>
      <P>Entry to the scheme is by way of open competition and contracts under the scheme are offered to general practitioners who are successful following competition between suitably qualified applicants.</P>
      <P>Patient choice is an important tenet of the GMS Scheme.  It is the medical card holder who selects the participating doctor whom he/she wishes to provide general practitioner services.  The current GMS contract sets a limit on the number of patients which may be placed on a doctor's list.  An upper limit of 2,000 applies except in exceptional circumstances and a health board which contracts with individual doctors for the provision of services to GMS patients may specify a lower limit in certain circumstances.</P>

    <P>The ophthalmology department in the Mater Hospital is staffed by five consultant ophthalmologists and one locum consultant ophthalmologist.  The hospital provides ophthalmology services to patients in North Dublin and the North Eastern Health Board area. The number of public outpatients seen daily is approximately 100.  A total of 2,033 inpatients, 720 day-cases and 22,779 outpatients were treated at the ophthalmology department in the Mater Hospital in 1993.

    <P> * In relation to the South Victoria, Cork, the hospital is currently validating its waiting list. The hospital considers that this validation exercise will demonstrate that a number of women on the present waiting list have had the procedure carried out elsewhere or do not wish to proceed with the operation.  The South Victoria have contracted to carry out an additional 140 sterilisation procedures this year under the 1994 Waiting List Initiative for which a special sum of £50,053 has been allocated in respect of gynaecological operations. </P>
    <P>A number of the above hospitals do not maintain formal waiting lists in respect of patients requiring sterilisation operations since there is no waiting time in these hospitals once the decision to proceed with the operation has been made.</P>

      <P>An Bord Altranais, by rules made in accordance with the provisions of the Nurses Act, 1985 and approved by me as Minister for Health, determines the requirements to be met by applicants for admission to training programmes leading to registration in one of the four basic divisions of the register.  These rules provide for the admission of mature applicants (aged over 24 years on 15 October of the year of application) without having attained the minimum educational qualifications specified.  The actual selection of candidates is a matter for each individual school of nursing to determine as employer of the successful candidate for the duration of the training programme. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be outside the remit of An Bord Altranais to intervene in this selection process in circumstances where the provisions of its rules have been complied with by the school of nursing.</P>
