      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 17.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 10 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; (2) the following arrangements shall apply to the resumed debate on No. 17: (i) the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall be called on to contribute to the debate first; (ii) the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 30 minutes; and (iii) Members may share time; (3) business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>Yesterday in the budget the Minister for Finance promised that <Col N="1950" /> legislation would be introduced to control the budgetary activities of health boards.  On checking the records it would appear that this legislation was also promised by Deputy O'Hanlon when Minister for Health and by Dr. O'Connell when he was Minister for Health and that it has been promised several times by the present Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the recorded references in my file.  What I would like to know is why there is such a delay in introducing this legislation in view of the fact that many private business have not been paid by health boards over the years on time because of poor financial management within the health boards in the absence of this legislation which has been repeatedly promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, legislation has been promised.  I ask Deputy Bruton to jog his memory because the Bills he has referred to relate to institutional reform. As he well knows, it is a different matter to give statutory powers to control spending in the health boards.  In the budget yesterday the Government approved an allocation of £100 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £15,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1994, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, and for payment of grants and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all appalled at the stupid and insensitive bomb attack on the Linenhall Library at the New Year which almost ended in disaster.  The Linenhall Library contains a priceless part of the heritage of the whole island of Ireland.  Its foundation <Col N="1954" /> was linked to some of the Belfast founders of the United Irishmen.  It is a symbol, one of the most important historical collections on this island.  Fortunately, nothing of irreplaceable value was touched by the fire, although I understand it was a very close miss.  Nevertheless, there was significant damage.</P>
    <P>As a gesture of goodwill and a contribution to help the Linenhall Library to repair the damage, replace books and, above all, develop its services my office contacted the Librarian, Mr. John Gray. This contribution represents a gesture of goodwill and solidarity by the people in this part of Ireland with one of the finest old Belfast institutions at a moment when its very survival was threatened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this imaginative and appropriate gesture of the Government.  It is well known that the Linenhall Library performs for Belfast some of the functions that the National Library performs for Dublin.  It is a repository of information for researchers.  In a sense it provides physical evidence upon which the history of all the peoples and people of this island is recorded.  Indeed the papers there probably are encouraging in one sense to any who study them in that they remind us that the problems we think are insoluble today have been faced many times before by our predecessors.  The decision of the Government to provide resources for the Linenhall Library emphasises the importance of the study of history and an understanding of history in seeking solutions to our current problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Provisional IRA attempted to burn a library in which much of the history of its own movement is preserved indicates one of two things, neither of which give cause for much optimism in dealing with it.  Either it is profoundly ill-informed and did not know that this Republican material was there &mdash; and if it is that ill-informed about a matter so fundamental to its own history it is not surprising that its understanding of the history of other traditions on this island might be somewhat deficient &mdash; or it is an organisation simply not in control <Col N="1955" /> of itself and this was not an operation ordered by a guiding intelligence within the IRA but some sort of freelance operation. If either of these explanations is true it must give the Taoiseach some cause for concern about the robustness of any commitments being entered into on behalf of the Republican movement if they can do such an ill-informed thing as attack the Linenhall Library.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach has done all he could and this House has done all it can in supporting this Estimate.  It is an imaginative gesture and I warmly commend the Taoiseach and the members of the Cabinet for having made it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support what the Taoiseach is doing.  It is a very small amount of money but it is a very big gesture and one that is appropriate, particularly at this time.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton it is rather ironic that the library containing the best collection of Republican history was destroyed by the IRA.  I find it strange too that at the beginning of last week when the IRA and Sinn Féin published details of their dealings last year with the British Government one of the places they lodged the information was in the Linenhall Library.  I hope it is a reminder to all of us of not just the human destruction and economic loss that the IRA terrorist campaign has caused but of the huge loss to the cultural life of this country over many years.  Happening, as it did, on the first day of this year, it was a bleak opening to the New Year. However, I do not want to say anything that would not encourage those who are engaged in violence to move away from their violent activities, move towards peace and join the rest of us in finding a political solution to the dreadful atrocities that have gone on for too long now on this island.  It is right that the Supplementary Estimate should be moved and that we should not have to wait until later in the year when we come to deal with the Estimates.  I compliment the Taoiseach on this gesture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join the other party Leaders in welcoming this gesture by the Taoiseach and the Government.  I hope it is not the last contribution that we will make to this kind of institution, not only when they are damaged by the depredations of the IRA or any other paramilitary organisation.</P>
      <P>The key to understanding why the IRA would bomb a library is that it has a myopic view, a very blinkered view of what history is and of the rights of other people who are their neighbours in Northern Ireland.  It does not accept that anybody other than itself has a right to a history or to a past or, indeed, a right to a different view of where they came from. Book-burning, as we know, is in the best tradition of Nazism.  I do not equate the IRA with Nazism, but it certainly has the potential to be Nazis.  It seems that much more must be made of the fact that it would even consider attacking, in the way it has done, a library which stored not only the record of Republican history but the history of the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  It is a marker for understanding the nature of the organisation that we are dealing with when we are dealing with the IRA.  It is beyond dispute that an official operation such as that was would not be carried out unless it had approval from those in charge at the Belfast level.  I, therefore, argue that it was not a mindless act, not an act carried out by some freelance operator but a deliberate attack on the heritage and history of the people of this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget fails to address Ireland's long term social and economic failure.  A country that disposes as much resources as we do, and which yet has no work for 300,000 people, is a social and economic failure.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that neither of the Government parties recognises this national failure.  To introduce a tinkering budget when it has so much leeway for radical reforms shows how mediocre the thinking of this Government really is. There is no sense of impatience or urgency, just a complacement feeling that it is sitting on a huge Dáil majority in good economic circumstances and it can coast along.</P>
      <P>The Minister has £200 million to spend yesterday, for one reason and one reason only &mdash; the dramatic fall in interest rates that flowed from the devaluation of the pound, a devaluation which he opposed. The Tánaiste even inferred, when I called for the devaluation last year, that I was treasonable.  Yet if the Government had not eventually followed Fine Gael's advice on devaluation last years, there would not have been £200 million to spend yesterday.</P>
      <P>I strongly disagree with the political priorities of this budget.  It will slash mortgage interest relief for all those who pay the top rate of tax, which is most full-time workers.  In that way, it will discourage people from being self-reliant and from borrowing to provide their own homes.  Instead, the Minister offers more money to build local authority houses.</P>
      <P>The budget cut health insurance relief. In that way, it will discourage people from being self-reliant and taking out insurance to provide for their own health costs.  Instead, they will be encouraged to rely on public waiting lists.  In doing so, it runs directly counter to an all-party Dáil committee report produced by Deputy Liam Kavanagh of the Labour Party only last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister failed to take Fine Gael's advice and reintroduce the tax allowance for children and introduce a tax allowance for spouses who look after children. This shows that the Government has no <Col N="1958" /> respect for the International Year of the Family.  It also shows that the Government does not understand the huge disincentive to work caused for parents of large families by the current tax and welfare codes.  While the social welfare code give an allowance for children, the tax code for workers does not.</P>
    <P>The budget is, quite rightly, providing financial support for marriage counselling, but it fails to recognise that the disincentives to work affecting large families, and the lack of any recognition in the tax code of the costs of rearing children are among the chief causes of the financial pressures that drive so many families apart.  Many widows too who have a job will find, as a result of this budget, that they will have to give up their job if they are to keep up their pension.  This is another curious way of marking the Interntional Year of the Family.</P>
    <P>We are told that this budget is helpful to employment because it broadens the standard rate band for a married couple from £15,350 to £16,400.  I would remind the Minister that the Fine Gael tax proposals for the 1994 budget, which were costed down to the last penny, provided for an increase in that band from £15,350 to £20,000.  Fine Gael provided for a £5,000 widening of the standard rate band, the Government could only manage a £1,000 widening.  That is the difference between serious tax reform and tinkering.  Against a background in which, in 1993, tax receipts and spending increased at six times the rate of inflation, this Government could only manage an average income tax reduction of £3.41 per week for the PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>The really dispiriting thing about this budget, about the National Development Plan and all the economic proposals of this Government is that there is no development philosophy.  There is no coherent statement on the threats to, or the opportunities for, Ireland in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House have children between the ages of ten and 16, but very few of them will be able to say with honesty that this budget, in which <Col N="1959" /> the Minister had more leeway than any Minister for almost 20 years, will improve the chances of those young people finding a job in Dublin or Cork rather than Los Angeles or Adelaide.</P>
    <P>If they do get a job in the Civil Service after April 1995, they will be the subject of blatant age discrimination.  After April 1995, young newly recruited civil servants will have to pay three times as much PRSI each week as older civil servants, even though they may be in the same grade and doing the same job in the same office. I have serious doubts about the constitutionality or the compliance with European Union Treaties of such age discrimination proposals in regard to PRSI for public servants.  It is not equal pay for equal work.</P>
    <P>Let me now outline what I believe should have been the developmental philosophy of this budget.  The underlying premise of our developmental philosophy should be to keep the jobs we already have as well as creating new ones. Existing Irish jobs are in danger because of the increased skill and competitiveness of work forces elsewhere.  Improving the knowledge and skills base of the Irish work force should therefore be the overriding economic and social priority of any Irish Government.  That should be explicit.  It should be more important than any other economic or social objective. The priority of saving jobs by increasing the training and educational capacity of one entire work force is not reflected anywhere in this budget.</P>
    <P>In the past we could have ignored competition from places like Korea, Hungary and India, yet, today, American companies are moving highly sophisticated operations to those countries, operations that might previously have come to Ireland.  For example, J.C. Penney's is now having its microwave cookers designed in Korea, General Electric is having its lighting fixtures designed in Hungary and Motorola is having its software programmes written in Madras in India.  This is because the Korean, Hungarian and Indian work forces are rapidly catching up with Ireland's educational <Col N="1960" /> and skill levels.  With a little investment in education it is possible for many countries which were far behind us five years ago to catch up with us.</P>
    <P>The priority should therefore be to upgrade continually the competitiveness, skill and flexibility of Ireland's work force in order to keep ahead of this rapidly growing competition.</P>
    <P>The clear focus of all governmental activity should be to preserve jobs by preserving our competitive edge in terms of skill and education.  We now live in a world where we can no longer take for granted the advantage that OECD countries enjoyed over others for some time. Five or ten years ago there was no GATT deal and we were able to keep those countries out.  They were way behind us in terms of access to technology.  Now eastern European countries, India and other countries are rapidly catching up with our skill levels.  Of course their wage costs are substantially lower.  I do not argue for a reduction in wage costs here, but if we are to earn higher wage levels than those countries, we must have commensurately higher skill levels than those countries.  If we are to maintain our income advantage we must constantly maintain a commensurate skill advantage over other countries with whom we compete for work because there is now an international market for work.  Under the new GATT deal work that needs to be done can now be done anywhere in the world.  There is relative freedom of investment worldwide.  We are in an open competitive market for work.  Therefore, the focus should be on making our work capacity competitive with other countries.  I would regard that as the central developmental philosophy that should have been, but is not, contained in this budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the following proposals which are consistent with that central developmental philosophy.  Firms which invest in agreed programmes to upgrade the training of their work forces should qualify for a 50 per cent cut in their employer's PRSI.  Why should a firm that conscientiously gives its <Col N="1961" /> employees time off for training every year, and spends the firm's money on training, pay the same PRSI rate as a firm which does not bother to update its employees' skills and allows their skills to become, literally, redundant over time?</P>
    <P>Firms which employ research staff in Ireland &mdash; and they are few in number &mdash; should have their employer's PRSI on those staff written off entirely.  We need research to take place here if we are to generate extra jobs.  Our current 10 per cent corporation profits tax actively discourages firms from conducting research here because the tax allowance they receive is lower than that which they can obtain in other countries worldwide.  If we are not to have less research conducted in firms here than in firms elsewhere in the world we must take other action to encourage the carrying out of research here.  I suggest employer's PRSI in respect of research employees should be written off.  Lack of spending on research is the reason we have to rely on foreign, not home-grown investment for new jobs at present.</P>
    <P>Firms in difficulty should be given a direct financial incentive to retain and retrain staff rather than make them redundant.  It is ironic that we give an income tax relief on a redundancy lump sum but give no tax reliefs or incentives to firms or employees who agree to reduced working hours as the preferred means of cutting the wage bill to save jobs.  In other words, we give no tax relief to a firm which decides to spread the pain among all its workforce and keep the jobs while we give tax relief to a firm which gets rid of a specific number of employees.  That is wrong, it is something that can easily be changed and it is something this Government promised to change.  On page 13 of the joint programme the Government parties committed themselves to devise a scheme &ldquo;aimed at providing employers and employees with alternatives to redundancy where labour cost reduction programmes are sought&rdquo;. Nothing has been done about this promise despite the redundancies in Digital, A. T. Cross and many smaller firms during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> We must also remove the bureaucratic obstacles to the creation and the taking of part-time jobs.  PRSI and income tax administration costs deter small businesses and homes from offering their first part-time job to a person outside the firm or the home.  We should revert to the old idea of a daily stamp on the employee's card, which would be an easy and non-bureaucratic way for very small employers to cover income tax and PRSI obligations.  The old system where an unemployed person could sign off for a day and only lose that day's benefit, no matter how much he earned on that day, should be restored also.</P>
    <P>Individuals as well as firms should be given a direct cash incentive to invest throughout their lifetime in their own retraining and education.  For instance, an early school leaver should be entitled to a pro-rata education voucher, calculated in proportion to the schooling he has missed by leaving school early.  This voucher could be cashed in to cover the fees and maintenance for an improved training course at any stage later in life. This would encourage people to take courses as and when needed rather than artificially cram all education into the first 21 years of life.</P>
    <P>This proposal, which I have made on many occasions, has been recommended by the European Commission in its White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  It is worth nothing that a person who leaves school with only the junior certificate forgoes £15,000 of State spending on education which they would have received had they continued in the education system up to third level.  It is only a matter of social justice to find a way to give them back that money in the form of a voucher they can cash for training and education at an appropriate time later in their lives.  I was interested to note that that proposal has been taken up by the European Commission and recommended to governments in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>We must maintain educational standards here as the best in the world.  We must not slip into second place; we must not slip behind in the competitive educational <Col N="1963" /> race, and there is a competitive educational race in the world at present, a race, through education, to preserve jobs.  Irish 13 year olds have come out badly in recent international tests in science. Of 14 countries surveyed Irish 13 year olds were rated the lowest in terms of their knowledge of science.  Their rating in mathematics has also been undistinguished.  It is well known that our competence in foreign languages falls far behind that of our continental European competitors.  Yet, there is no informed debate about this matter.</P>
    <P>I skimmed through the recently published Report of the Convention on Education and I saw no reference to the issue of comparative standards of our education system at different stages with other countries.  That issue does not exist for those debating education here at present.  Yet if we accept the thesis that education is one of the ways in which we compete on the world stage to preserve jobs here &mdash; it is one of the most important educational issues we face &mdash; all the debate about education is concerned with is how much resources should be provided for education, who should control it, but none of it is about the choices we make about how to use the money we spend on education or about the results, compared internationally, we achieved for all we have spent.</P>
    <P>For instance, the choice we have made to devote so much time &mdash; in the region of six hours out of a 24 teaching hour per week &mdash; to teaching Irish at primary schools has meant that less time is spent on other subjects.  This makes no difference to more talented pupils, those who go on to third level, who can easily catch up on other subjects later which they may have missed out on at primary level, but I believe this priority has a significant adverse effect on pupils in the medium and lower ability ranges who leave school early.  They are the students about whom I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an objective study on the impact of the distribution of time in regard to subjects at primary level on early school leavers.  I agree Irish should <Col N="1964" /> remain a compulsory subject for all students for at least the first nine years of schooling because it is the basic part of our culture.  However, we need to ask whether primary school children must spend more time each week on Irish than they do on mathematics.  We must also ask whether, as a result of this time distribution, it is right that there is no space at all in the primary school week for science or a continental language.  We must ask whether the time spent on Irish is spent as well as it ought to be.  If more time was spent on oral Irish, a higher level of competence could be achieved in a shorter time.  It is my experience that the competence in oral Irish of six year olds in primary schools is as good as that of ten year olds.  Competence does not improve and enthusiasm diminishes.  One must therefore ask whether the methods of teaching Irish and the time devoted to it are appropriate.</P>
    <P>Irish should be compulsory and everybody should be competent in the Irish language, but current policies are not working.  They are shaped in such a way that primary school children are denied teaching in continental languages and science.  That does not matter for the people who go on to third level, the elite in our society, because they can catch up. When we congratulate ourselves on our educational system we are thinking our PhDs, MScs and MAs; we are not thinking about junior certificate school leavers, the people who will become redundant and who will have to find jobs elsewhere.  If their basic competence is not good enough.  We have failed these people.</P>
    <P>I want an objective international study of the comparative competence of Irish ten year olds, 13 year olds and 16 year olds, right across the ability range, to satisfy ourselves that our competence in mathematics, in science and in foreign languages is not falling behind the best in the world.  We should also bring in external examiners each year to tell us how Irish standards in each subject in the leaving and junior certificate compare with those countries with whom we compete <Col N="1965" /> for jobs and investment.  I want to repeat that unless our education is the best in the world, there is a danger that a peripheral island like Ireland will continue to lose employment.  Our overall aim must be to ensure that our education and facilities for retraining will be so good that firms will go out of their way to locate businesses here, in spite of the disadvantages of Ireland's peripheral location.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remove the systematic discrimination against the service sector in the tax code.  It is in private services that the majority of the new jobs can be created, not in manufacturing.  To this <Col N="1966" /> end, the corporation tax rate for services should be reduced from 40 per cent towards 27 per cent.  It is wrong that the corporation tax rate on a services company should be four times as high as the corporation tax rate on a manufacturing company.  The Minister did nothing about this discrimination in the budget.  The VAT registration limits for small businesses should be increased.  A personal income tax allowance should be granted to people who create jobs in their own homes, for example, child care and home nursing.  Large numbers of jobs could, in this way, be brought from the black economy into the white economy.</P>
    <P>We should introduce a charter of rights for small enterprises.  This charter should require that all State agencies pay interest on debts overdue to small businesses.  It should also provide for a strengthening of competition law in Ireland.  Our present competition law looks fine on paper but it does not work and small businesses in competition with big businesses are the main losers, even though it is small businesses who create jobs and mainly big businesses who make people redundant.</P>
    <P>The eight proposals I have outlined could form the basis of a genuine partnership to solve the jobs crisis on a long term basis.  What we need are long term policies, not the patchwork that was presented in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget does not appear to have any medium or long term strategy.  It does not identify any priorities.  It gives no indication of the Government's intentions in regard to employment and tax reform to the year 1997.  The Government went in the right direction in some areas.  It is very much a budget with a little for everybody in the audience, and I find that disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, shortly after the Government took office, it presented to this House its first budget.  It told us it was not an indication of its strategy or its overall approach to the economic issues of the day because it did not have sufficient time to set out such a strategy.  It said it was very much a holding budget and that we would see as the year went <Col N="1967" /> on what was its real thinking, approach and strategy.  Since then we have had the National Development Plan and the pay talks which are currently under way and now we have what the Government would like us to think is its first budget. However, I do not see it as the Government's first budget.  I very much see it as part of its approach to the issues of the day.  The Government is clearly a high spending, high tax Government; let there be no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>This morning on the Order of Business when Deputy Bruton raised the issue of funding for health boards the Minister for Health took great pleasure in shouting across the floor that he had achieved £100 million for the health boards.  What exactly does that mean?  It means that those health boards that were prudent, that did not run their activities with huge loans that could not be sustained, will be penalised and the health boards who were not so prudent will get an amnesty from the Government.  I know that there are serious difficulties with health board funding, but I hope that before the money is allocated criteria are put in place to ensure that this never happens again.  The fact that this money is amnesty money, money the Government would like us to think might never have been collected, does not mean it should be thrown away.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the amnesty was the most disgraceful feature of last year's budget.  Two-thirds of the money raised in that amnesty, as was outlined to Deputy Cox yesterday in reply to a parliamentary question, came in as a result of the 15 per cent tax being applied to money which the Revenue Commissioners already knew was owing.  How much money has been brought back to be invested in this economy?  The claim was made last year during the budget debate and the Finance Bill that the amnesty would bring in millions of pounds that were lost to the Irish economy, to be invested in employment creation.  However, none of that money has been brought back.  It was not even a requirement of the amnesty that the <Col N="1968" /> money had to be reinvested in this economy.  The amnesty was a disgrace and I hope we never see anything like it again.  It has rightly annoyed complaint taxpayers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the proceeds from the amnesty be spent on onece-off projects. There was concern that the Government would use the amnesty money in this year's budget as part of current expenditure and worry as we approach next year's budget as to where to find the money to fund the ongoing programmes.  In so far as the amnesty is being applied on a once-off basis I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the Progressive Democrats' approach to unemployment, the fundamental issue facing this country. As my colleague Deputy Cox said in the House yesterday in response to the Minister's Budget Statement, there are effectively 350,000 people unemployed.  Just under 300,000 people are on the live register, approximately 18,000 people over 55 years of age are looking for work, approximately 6,500 people are engaged in part-time work who would prefer to have full-time jobs and 35,000 to 38,000 are working in various FÁS schemes, social employment schemes and programmes of that kind.  Effectively 350,000 of our people are unemployed. In addition, 67,000 students will leave our educational system this year.</P>
    <P>By any standards, we have one of the best educated populations in the world, and we certainly have the best educated English-speaking population in Europe. We have the best educated unemployed of any country.  These people should be the priority, not only of the Government but of everyone in this House.  Thousands of our people are being put into what my party has described as human set aside, where they have no alternative but to be unemployed and receive unemployment benefit.  If they engage in any kind of work they will get no benefit of any kind. In order to receive unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit under our social welfare system they must sign on and be available for work.</P>
    <P>We will spend approximately £1 billion <Col N="1969" /> paying people to be unemployed.  This is a scandal of such proportions that it has to be the priority for all of us.  This is why last week my party published a community employment programme in which we propose that work should be offered to people who are unemployed in return for their unemployment assistance and that they should get an additional premium of £20.  We believe that this should be compulsory for the 85,000 young people under 25 on the live register. Much play has been made of the fact that we would make this compulsory.  Rather than looking at the negatives of making it compulsory, I believe the vast majority of young people &mdash; I have discussed it with many of them &mdash; want to be given worthwhile activity instead of being treated as people who have no contribution to make to the development of this country.  Our programme would compel the State to provide them for three days per week with worthwhile activity in the community, voluntary and public sectors. We all know there is lots of work to be done and that there are thousands of people available to do it.  It is up to us to match the people with the work.  The Government said yesterday that it was committed to introducing a community employment programme and I welcome that, but it is not at all the kind of programme required or the kind of programme which can deal with the seriousness of our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the submission from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  His only response to that submission is that he will have 1,000 people to work in the community by way of a pilot project for a one year period, along the lines suggested by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  That is a token response.  The problem is so serious that we cannot begin to tackle it in such a minor way.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has made great play about the difference it is making to Government and the fact that this is a partnership Government.  The word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; seems to be an excuse to avoid dealing with all the issues of the day.  The greatest pleasure the Labour <Col N="1970" /> Party seems to get is from spending money.  Spending last year increased by 8.5 per cent at a time when inflation was 1.5 per cent.  As Deputy Cox said, since the Progressive Democrats left Government current Government spending has increased by 17 per cent.  I do not believe the Government has any strategic approach to deal with the fundamental problem affecting our economy.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister said that changing the tax wedge, making it more lucra-tive for employers to employ more people, was not the panacea for all our economic ills.  I certainly agree that it is not the panacea for all our economic ills but, as Culliton said, it is the most potent force available to the Government to generate employment in this economy. Changing our anti-work tax system, making it more beneficial for individuals to work harder and for enterprising individuals to invest, is the way to generate employment.  I could give many examples of the way our tax and welfare system discourage the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I visited a small manufacturing concern in Drogheda, County Louth.  It is interesting to note that in 1971 approximately 1,500 people were employed in the clothing and textile sectors in Drogheda and that today there are fewer than 100 people employed in those sectors in that town.  I visited a small manufacturer who employs 60 of those people and asked for his views on the economy and what the Government should do in the budget.  This man, who is very frustrated and is disillusioned, wondered if we in Dáil Éireann really understood what the problems were for small business people.  He told me that if he moved across the Border, 50-60 miles up the road, and started the same operation with 60 employees he would save £250,000 in one year in pay roll costs. Can any of us imagine the effect of knowing that on an enterprising person who is providing opportunities for himself, his family and his mainly female workforce of 60 in Drogheda, a town which has an unemployment level in excess of 35 per cent?  He is not the only person who feels like that.  I recently met an employer from <Col N="1971" /> Ballina who employes 300 people in the same sector.  If he moved across the Border to Enniskillen, 40-45 mile away, he would save £750,000 a year in payroll costs.</P>
    <P>These people wonder if we are really serious about the unemployment problem when we allow the high tax on employment in our economy.  In Northern Ireland and Britain PRSI on the labour intensive textile sector is 5.6 per cent &mdash; it was reduced by a further percentage point in the recent British budget.  Yesterday the Minister decreased employers' PRSI to 9 per cent and decreased PRSI by 3.2 per cent for everyone with a salary below £173 per week.  In so far as this is a start I want to welcome it, but it is not enough.  It will not make the Irish textile and clothing sectors compeitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> their Northern Ireland or British counterparts. Rather it will put further pressure on the 15,000 people employed in this sector &mdash; 8 per cent of all persons employed in manufacturing are employed in that sector.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government is serious about trying to create jobs.  Apparently during a recent &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme the Minister of State at the Department of Finance spoke about Third World kinds of jobs.  She did not want any of these factory jobs in this economy.  Maybe she was talking about jobs in the Irish textile sector.  Perhaps this is the Government approach. Despite all the pressure from IBEC and much public comment, there was virtually nothing in the budget in this regard.  This is very disappointing. Approximately 3,000 jobs have been lost in this sector in the past three years and I believe more jobs will be lost unless the Government reconsiders this issue.</P>
    <P>Why is this sector so uncompetitive? The minimum wage in the textile sector in Ireland is approximately £131 per week while in Britain and Northern Ireland it is the equivalent of approximately IR£113 per week.  Despite the £28 difference in gross pay costs, employees in Great Britain and Northern Ireland take home <Col N="1972" /> £2.66 more than their counterpart in the Republic because of the PRSI tax systems which operate in this economy.  I accept that removing the health and training levies from those on an income of £173 or below will certainly make a contribution towards allowing people in that sector to have increased take home pay but it is not enough and will not go any way towards dealing with the fundamental problems in that sector.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated by independent consultants that every 1 per cent achieved in wage competitiveness creates 4,000 jobs.  If the Government had chosen to make employment more attractive it could have provided another 28,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the difference in the levies for the income earners below £9,000.  I welcome this measure because it will help the low paid in particular but at £9,000 we will come to what I call a Beecher's Brook.  We will face enormous difficulties because for everybody earning £175 or £180, just slightly above the limit, the full rate of PRSI will have to be paid by the employer on the whole income, not just on the margin above £173, in addition the levies will have to be paid on all that income by the employees. We will go back to a situation highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Cox, during the debate on the Finance Bill through the committee of this House in which we heard many examples of people being worse off on higher incomes.  It is ridiculous that a married person with a dependent spouse living in local authority accommodation could be worse off earning £15,000 in terms of take home pay than they are when they earn £8,000. A person earning £12,000 loses £1,300 disposable income over and above what somebody on £8,000 would earn because of our differential rents and the way our social welfare system integrates with those on low pay.  Those problems will be exacerbated by the manner in which the Minister removed the two levies and dealt with employers' PRSI.  He will have to look again at how that affects people at the margins.</P>
    <P>We should integrate the tax and PRSI <Col N="1973" /> systems.  After all, PRSI is a tax on work. The Progressive Democrats would have preferred if in this year's budget the Government had chosen to remove PRSI from the first £3,000 of income.  That would have benefited the low paid workers but in particular it would not have allowed for the type of unemployment-poverty traps that will now exist at the margins as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that it was very much a budget with a little bit for everybody in the audience and I wish to refer to the manner in which it was delivered.  A two hour budget speech is absolutely crazy and it is the most boring day in this House.  We need to improve the way the budget is delivered.  It does not have to be as long and much of what the Minister read out could have been distributed by way of briefing notes or included in the principal features of the budget.  The fact that every Member of the House received a copy of the Minister's speech &mdash; and I welcome that &mdash; meant that virtually nobody listened to the speech.  Everybody was able to read well ahead of the Minister.  For next year I certainly hope that we will improve our procedures in this House and that we will not have the long, rambling, boring debate that we had yesterday simply for the sake of reading material into the record.  I know when Deputy Bhamjee comes here he likes to sit and listen to everybody but he is probably the exception.  Most people like to contribute rather than merely listen to a speech that they can read as it is being delivered.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the question of property tax.  As the Minister knows, property values differ greatly from urban to rural areas.  This tax will divide people between urban and rural areas and lead to a huge division in their attitude because of the Government approach.  It is a tax based almost on the look of a house.  It has to be determined who lives there, what their income is, the state of repair of the house and so on.  It is a tax on middle income people, on those who have tried very hard to save money having worked extremely hard, who are <Col N="1974" /> trying to educate their children and providing for health care and so on.  The property tax in particular will be a further penal tax on them and, as Minister Woods in particular is aware, in the Dublin region, in Cork, Galway, Limerick and in the cities essentially, but particularly in Dublin, a £75,000 house is typical right across many of the middle class areas of this city, north and south.</P>
    <P>Many people in Dublin who voted for the Labour Party and who thought they were voting for something different will now be heavily penalised because they are trying to provide a decent home for themselves and their families.  If they are in the VHI they will be further penalised. Instead of the Government encouraging people to provide their own health care it is seeking to discourage them.  VHI is very expensive, particularly on families. With high levels of tax on work people have used it, I accept, as an opportunity to give themselves some relief but until such time as we make a bigger effort and show a greater indication that we will decrease the level of tax on work, it is premature of the Government to indicate what it will do in relation to VHI and mortgage interest repayments and allow them only at the standard rate of tax.  It is interesting that the Minister gave an indication of his thinking in relation to this matter.  He was quite clear that these allowances will now only be allowed at the standard rate but we have been given no idea what the Minister or the Government intend to do in terms of tax rates or the level of PRSI in 1997, unlike the attitude to VHI and mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>Many people may consider that £26,000 per year is a high income but I do not accept that.  For a family with young children or perhaps with children in third level education, not receiving grant aid, paying a mortgage with VHI commitments and running a family car, it is a very low level of income indeed. The employer will have to pay £549 more in PRSI costs to keep that person in employment.  The employee, according to the principal features, will benefit to the tune of £649 so there is a difference <Col N="1975" /> of £100.  I accept the employer will pay £549 and that the employee will gain the £649 but when the employee has paid the difference in the mortgage interest relief, the difference in VHI and the property tax, how much better off will he be? Given that we will be increasing substantially the costs for the employer, many people in that sector will be put out of work or will be much worse off.</P>
    <P>The property tax on houses valued at £75,000 is only the beginning, I have no doubt about that.  The last time the Labour Party was in Government it set the threshold at £60,000 for property and £20,000 for income.  The £60,000 threshold was worth much more then and property values have escalated.  Many more people will be included but I have no doubt that it is part of the Labour Party policy approach to this economy that those who are trying to help themselves, who want to be independent of the State will be penalised under this partnership Government.  Many of the people who thought that there would be a change, that justice would be put into economics and trust put into politics, regret that they cast their vote on the last occasion for a party that will heavily penalise them simply because they are trying to help themselves.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that we need to encourage self-reliance, to encourage those from all incomes brackets who are trying hard to have a decent standard of living, who want to work and to get on with their lives, who do not want the Government to do things for them.  They want the Government to provide the economic framework to allow them to get on with it.  Whether they come from urban or rural areas the vast majority of the people I meet want to be allowed to become more self-reliant, more enterprising.  Rather than encouraging them, the Government has sought to penalise them at every possible opportunity. I accept that radical, projobs tax reform will not generate all of the jobs we require in our economy but certainly, as Culliton said, it would be the most potent weapon in that regard.  Therefore, <Col N="1976" /> I regret very much that the Minister has not chosen to do so.</P>
    <P>We have the highest level of tax on work of all of the OECD countries.  We have the second highest unemployment level in the industrialised world.  One would think that work was some kind of luxury here, that we really did not want people to work, that we wanted to put every obstacle in their way to prevent them from working.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made in post-budget comment by Labour Party Deputies that this is a budget to help low income earners, that it is a budget that will tax the wealthy and help the low income earner.  It surprises me that the Labour Party, with its recent new found support, would regard middle income earners in urban areas as the new wealthy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note some facts in our economy.  For example, for every ten people in the private, wealth-creating sector of our economy, they have to keep 22 others.  The ten people investing their money in enterprises, generating employment, generating wealth here, are the people who are being really penalised by the policies of this Government.  For example, their counterparts in Denmark have a different scenario where, for every nine people in the private sector creating wealth, they must keep ten others. Therefore, the Irish entrepreneur, the Irish wealth-creating person, must keep more than twice the number of dependants as his or her counterpart in Denmark. That is one of the reasons Irish goods are not competitive in certain markets.  It is one of the reasons we, as a country, must begin radically to tackle that fact alone.</P>
    <P>I have been surprised at the attitude adopted to the current round of pay negotiations. The attitude being adopted by the Government is one of, &ldquo;we will have the social partners dictate the policy for us; whatever you can agree will be acceptable to us; all that is important is that we have agreement&rdquo;.  That comes before everything else.  Behind closed doors, in an undemocratic fashion &mdash; as far as I can see &mdash; people who are not elected by <Col N="1977" /> the general public are deciding pay and fiscal policy for our economy.  Quite honestly, I do not consider it is appropriate. It is not the right strategy for a country with our economic ills.  It seems extraordinary that employers, in particular, are prepared to accept that we can have an 8 per cent rise in wages over the next three of three and a quarter years, whatever may be the period.  Since every reduction of 1 per cent in the cost of employment would generate an additional 4,000 jobs would it not have made more sense had the employers, in particular, and the unions concentrated on take-home pay and reducing the cost of employment?  Would it not have made more sense had the pressure been put on the Government to reduce PRSI, which is a tax on work, to reduce the levels of tax on work, which would have had two effects?  It would have kept down the cost of employment, could have reduced it substantially and increased workers' take-home pay, which would have been much more beneficial as an employment strategy on the part of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is the case that those who are in jobs seem to believe that, once their individual circumstances are being catered for, the overall macro view of what is required can be left aside.  That may be the attitude of the social partners but they are not elected to run this country. The Government is responsible for the country's economic strategy.  The Government is responsible for the budget presented yesterday.  I know some blame was being put on the poor civil servants; they are in a no-win position in that they are blamed if it is the wrong thing whereas the Minister gets the credit if it turns out to be the right thing.  They were not the civil servants who gave us this budget.  Rather the Minister and his Government presented this budget, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Coalition Government, with its 35 seat majority, presented us with this budget.  Despite the euphoria &mdash; and there is a lot of euphoria in the media this morning &mdash; I have yet to see a budget that has not been well received initially by media commentators. I do not believe this is the <Col N="1978" /> right budget; I do not believe it will be well received; I do not believe it will help employment.  On the contrary, it will put further pressure particularly on some of the vulnerable sectors in our community.</P>

      <P>In my remaining minute I want to briefly summarise what I believe should be Government strategy.  Deputy Cox spoke about the Olympics strategy for the Community Games performance. I agree with him when he said that when one looks at the fundamentals, one would think this economy was top of the league with a 3.5 per cent growth rate whereas the European Union average was 0.5 per cent and Britain with a negative growth rate.  One would think that our economy was doing extremely well whereas the reverse is the case.  On the ground ordinary individuals are experiencing extreme difficulty in making ends meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget, with a little bit for everybody in the audience, is one that did not integrate the National Development Plan, the pay talks and the budget strategy. It is very much a piecemeal budget, one that throws a little bit of money here, a little bit there, the kind of politics the Labour Party really enjoy.  Indeed we saw evidence of that this morning when the Minister for Health made great play of the £100 million that will be given to the various health boards.  It is a lost opportunity.  The only thing I can say in favour of the Government is that it availed of the opportunity in this budget to reverse its policies of last year, to eliminate the requirement of spouses paying probate tax, a tax that should never have been imposed in the first place, and to abolish the 1 per cent income levy.  They were the only two budgetary proposals that got a cheer from Government backbenchers yesterday. They cheered the reversal of their policies of last year.  I ask the House: is that the kind of Government in which one could have confidence to give employment to the thousands of our people unemployed, to give more incentive to <Col N="1979" /> those at work, to create a more self-reliant society and encourage enterprise and initiative?  It is not; it is a failed and missed opportunity which I regret very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by commenting on the staggeringly high unemployment rate prevailing here and demonstrate that that is not the true story, not all of the bad story, in that we have, give or take a few, 300,000 people now unemployed, near enough to 20 per cent of the working population.  Were we even conservatively to take into account how many more people would be without employment here were it not for many having emigrated over the past ten years, then we would be talking not about 20 per cent but about a 30 per cent underprovision of jobs for our young people continuing apace at present.</P>
      <P>Against a background that undoubtedly contains all of the ingredients for providing a proper climate for job creation and development, when interest rates have been reduced drastically, inflation brought well under control, with GNP and exports rising one might well ask: what is wrong since they constituted the formula for development recognised worldwide?  We must now stop, think and ask ourselves, against a background of developing technology, mechanisation, why these ingredients do not necessarily work any more.  We find ourselves with this wonderful background, high reputation internationally, as bringing our overall economy and financial structures right into line but to what avail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is rampant with no sign of the numbers decreasing despite the fine tuning touches heading in the right direction.  In other words, one could apply almost wishful thinking to the various little touches contained in the budget in the direction of helping to relieve the <Col N="1980" /> hostile tax climate that forces, and has done for years past, every ambitious businessman, every person who employs people, to endeavour to ascertain how they can reduce the numbers of employees rather than what would be much more pleasurable to them and of benefit to the country, to be encouraged to take on more workers.  That is the sad picture.</P>
    <P>In any business, big or small, employers try to avoid taking on further employees because of the burden of the levies and PRSI and having to deal with bureaucracy.  The outlook has been improving but we flittered away the opportunities presented by the budget in various ways that will have little impact on the number unemployed.  Many of the changes will work against creating employment.  How can anybody suggest it is fair or reasonable to lower the income and property value thresholds of residential property tax?  How does the reduction in the income threshold and the property value threshold tally with the very severe shortage of housing?  Is this the way to encourage people to buy their own home against all the odds?</P>
    <P>I have witnessed several recessions since I became a Member.  It is a well established phenomenon that when the construction industry is in difficulties, we are in recession.  I am not suggesting that we start building, as we did in the past, merely to give people work and to keep them from being idle, but we need the construction industry's products.  We need more houses and we need to encourage building by reintroducing grants for repair and maintenance of the existing housing stock.  We have not been adding to the housing stock at the requisite levels during the past ten to 12 years.  We need to carry out a serious investigation of the benefits that could accrue from giving incentives to people to undertake to build a house or to repair and maintain existing houses.  When we were less well off we encouraged people to embark on building new houses where possible but above all to repair and maintain the existing houses.  I suggest that properly pitched grants for housing, far from being a <Col N="1981" /> burden on the Exchequer, would benefit it when account is taken of the numbers who would come off the live register and the taxes paid by persons employed directly or indirectly in the construction industry.  Our economy would benefit. One cannot hope that the Government will have a change of mind because we have thrown away the opportunity presented by the favourable financial situation in which the Minister for Finance found himself.</P>
    <P>I believe we could create jobs by paying those who stay at home.  By paying people an attractive amount of money to stay at home to rear their children we would be meeting the needs of those who feel impelled to go out to work because of necessity and offering them the opportunity to be more happily employed looking after their families.  By so doing their jobs would be freed for younger people who are unemployed.  Lest that be regarded as a straight handout, it should be treated as taxable income and in those households where the additional money was not needed, part of the wife's income could be clawed back in taxation.  This idea has been kicked around for a number of years.  At one stage Fine Gael publicly proposed that housewives be paid £9 per week.  I remember suggesting in the early eighties that the figure should be £30 per week.  Taking account of inflation we should be thinking in terms of £100 per week now.</P>
    <P>One of the things in our taxation code that irks me is that the dead are taxed. This is scandalous.  Nobody can say that those who have paid their due share throughout their lifetime have not paid their way.  The money they have saved as a result of their diligence should not be taxed after their death.  It is morally wrong that this should obtain.</P>
    <P>Back in the early eighties a Fine Gael led Government, in which Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance, decided to hike substantially the price of petrol. The newspapers carried the story just as yesterday a morning's newspapers reported many of the things that were contained in yesterday's budget.  The <Col N="1982" /> same old sieve is leaking but that is nothing new.  A delegation from the Hotels Federation and some other interest groups want to meet the Minister and I accompanied it.  We implored the Minister not to put additional taxes on petrol because of its impact on tourism. We were then largely dependent on tourism but according to the Government we will be more dependent on it in the future.  The impact of this measure has devastated the counties south of the Border.  Despite pleas to various Ministers since then, the tax on petrol has never been lowered.  Lest we might retrieve some of the ground we lost as a result of people going to shop across the Border, the Minister decided to put an extra tax on petrol.  This will ensure that those devasted Border counties cannot make up lost ground.  If one drives along the Border roads one will see derelict filling stations.  We have enough problems on the southern rim with only one road in four available to our people to traverse the Border.  We depend on the inflow from the Six Counties, and this is especially important in my county.  In recent weeks, since the British Government increased the price of petrol it had come to the stage where we could retrieve some of the ground we had lost and this would have given some hope to the forgotten people on the southern rim of the Border who have never received consideration from this House since partition. The six counties north of the Border have their problems but we have problems, too.  We have been deprived and instead of helping the Minister for Finance sees an opportunity to level up the prices of petrol again and forget about the past, to the detriment not only of those counties but of the tourism trade as a whole.</P>
    <P>The price increases in beer, spirits and wine are a detriment to tourism.  There is no point in the Minister saying the publicans have been bad boys and that the brewers have increased prices way beyond inflation.  Surely that should not be the approach.  If he is so concerned, why not ensure that the Government introduce price control?  One must <Col N="1983" /> remember that pubs and restaurants are as much part of the tourism scene as are the hotels which have been helped over the years.  The services provided by pubs and restaurants have never been recognised as part and parcel of what we have to offer.  Without them we would have little to offer when it rains.</P>
    <P>These latest increases will discourage further tourism from North to South.  We have lost the opportunity, in very favourable circumstances, to grasp the nettle and do something to create employment and wealth.  I ask the Government to have a further look at the Structural Funds and not to fritter them away.  Much has been frittered away already, leaving nothing of any real permanence in its place.  We missed the boat yesterday, but perhaps that will teach us to ensure we do not miss the next one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify at the outset that the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, is a registered political party and that I am spokesperson for that party.  I find it very strange in this House that the country outside these four walls knows of the Green Party as a party but in Dáil Éireann, on budget day, I am not a party. When the two H Block people were elected they could have got together and could have spoken here for an hour yesterday as a party.  There lies the complete lack of logic which I find time and again in this House and which has been highlighted by this budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lack of reality permeates a number of aspects of the budget.  We hear glowing references to GNP, GDP and healthy economic indicators.  If one looks closely at what GNP comprises, one will see that the more dependent we are on services the more use we make of hospitals; the more car crashes we have the more we use garages, resulting in higher VAT charges, all of which is helping GNP.  We assume that the Government, by welcoming such a healthy situation, is welcoming this type of calamity.  When the Opposition parties believe the nonsense of these absurd indicators I ask what type <Col N="1984" /> of Dáil Éireann this is meant to be when 300,000 people are unemployed?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox asked whether it is time to review the indicators which underline this budget.  In spite of economic growth &mdash; as we call it &mdash; unemployment is up 40 per cent since 1990.  I presume Deputy Cox is unhappy about the Progressive Democrats policy in that regard, considering that the Progressive Democrats were part of the Government for most of that time.  Others, including Democratic Left, admit it is difficult to turn growth into jobs.  Of course it is difficult.  This is 1994.  Technology does most of the boring work and makes most of the profit.  The old song sung in the pubs &mdash; if anybody is in them &mdash;&ldquo;MacAlpine's Fusiliers&rdquo; would, in a modern form, probably be called MacAlpine's computer and earth moving operators.  The idea of many people being required to do heavy work is no longer part of the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>Why are we still playing this economic game by rules invented by landlords at the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century?  It was they who decided what was good and what you paid for.  By and large good work meant working for them in their factories.  Most of that work was boring and soul destroying, although one may have got two weeks' holidays and after long years of service a gold watch on retirement.  Not so valued was work such as raising a family, caring for people in the community and craft work which made one independent.  Growing food for your family was not even considered work; that was called &ldquo;staying at home&rdquo;, as Deputy Blaney said.  Even today if people do not leave the house at 8.30 a.m. or 9 a.m. the perception is that they do not work.  That was accepted by politicians so long as machines needed people and so long as women were not involved.</P>
    <P>The whole system breaks down when machines do not need people and when women want to get involved.  We than have chaos because the rules do not follow the conditions.  Why are these rules still accepted?  Automation ought to be a way of releasing people from soul <Col N="1985" /> destroying work.  There is no point in being a Luddite.  Boring work is not good for you.  One can see what boredom does to the animals in Dublin Zoo; it is a warning for us all.  Economists ought to be able to tell us that when there is less work we should develop systems of sharing it more evenly.  When machines are making most of the money we ought to concentrate our efforts in distributing those profits and resources fairly to the people they have displaced.  What have we got?</P>
    <P>The Minister with £200 million at his disposal has lost the opportunity to make a break from the failed out of date rule book.  Instead of making a break the Minister has used pounds like drops of glue to try to patch the cracks and mend a failed system.  This is creating greater feelings of alienation.  The Minister has said this budget is about creating sufficient employment, not 300,000 jobs. Perhaps it will be enough for Dublin Central or for sensitive areas where people are outspoken enough to make their cases.  Is the Minister saying that anybody who is left without a job is useless?  What will the Minister say to those who cannot find work even though he has provided sufficient employment?</P>
    <P>I do not have time to outline the alternatives but I would encourage people to acquire the Greens economic policy &mdash; Communism, Socialism and Capitalism, One Down and Two to Go Towards a Sane Economy &mdash; and read it.  It is radically different from this budget and would need to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at France, for instance, a developed country where the working week is being reduced.  They have recognised that work is not available to require people to work the old hours of the industrial revolution.  They have reduced the working week and encouraged work sharing to spread the work in a sensible way.  The Government seems to be hung up on what can only be described as the economics of the cancer cell &mdash; the more one grows the better off one will be.  Unfortunately we are proving to ourselves that that is failing abysmally.  We are living on a planet with <Col N="1986" /> finite resources.  If we shared work, people would have the opportunity to be creative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the help given to Tailors Hall.  The guild which built Tailors Hall operated under a different rule to the one under which the Minister operates.  It did not operate through competition which is considered a sacred cow in economic progress.  It operated through co-operation. When a tailor got a length of cloth at a bargain price he did not try to make a bigger profit and put his colleagues out of business, he shared it.  It was not quantity which was the deciding factor or the yard stick, it was quality.  Tailors were not allowed to work outside of natural light, not because they were trying to curtail their working hours but because the quality of their work would be affected.  Instead of operating on current indicators of competition and quantity they operated through co-operation and quality.  We have come to the time when we need to re-examine many of the indicators that have landed us in the mess in which we are.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said I would expect him to be favourably disposed towards enterprise which is sustainable, but it should also be ecological.  The proposed expenditure of £1.5 million to monitor meat production shows that the Minister is aware of the dangers of contamination. The most labour intensive sector of agriculture which does not use imported chemicals and fertilisers, the organic sector, has been completely ignored.  The £1 million announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry some weeks ago for those involved in horticulture who suffered from the spring floods is an absolute disgrace. It will not even help people with their bank loans and they will be put out of business.  People involved in horticulture will have to sell out in order to pay the banks who are getting away with profiteering.  The result will be that more land will be put up for rezoning.  That will cause problems in Dublin North and where is the claw back on the profits from rezoning?  It is not there.  I wonder who is calling the shots in this budget which <Col N="1987" /> certainly is not related to the need of the people.</P>
    <P>Due to the time constraint I have to curtail my contribution but I would ask that ecological taxation be brought in to replace income tax because if we continue to squander our finite resources the price will rise and in the next generation we will be unable to afford the type of energy consumption to which we have grown accustomed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the improvements we are providing in this year's budget are: a 3 per cent increase in all weekly social welfare and health board payments; an extra increase of 3 per cent or £1.60 a week, to bring all short term rates up to the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; a further increase of £2.10 a week to disability and unemployment benefits &mdash; this gives an overall increase <Col N="1988" /> of 10 per cent in the personal rate and pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit is being discontinued for new claims from July; an increase in the rate of child benefit from £20 to £25 for the third child and from £23 to £25 for subsequent children; a new contributory pension for widowers subject to an earnings limit after one year's receipt of pension; improved earnings disregards with tapering arrangements for lone parents who take up work; a new earnings disregard of £100 for the carer's allowance where there is a spouse with earnings; a new scheme of adoptive benefit similar to maternity benefit; further improvements to the maternity benefit scheme; increase in the minimum payment of unemployment assistance where a beneficiary is living at home; widows between 60 and 65 will retain entitlement to free schemes available to their husbands prior to death; further easing of the social welfare measures introduced in 1992; and further support to the extent of £2.5 million to the voluntary and community sector.</P>
    <P>Before describing some of the improvements in detail, I would like to illustrate the package of rate increases by way of a few examples.</P>
    <P>A couple with four children on long term unemployment assistance will receive an increase of £6.12 or 3.7 per cent a week, including child benefit, bringing their total weekly payment to £171.17.  A couple with three children on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will receive a total of £150.10 a week, taking child benefit into account.  They will be £6.75 or 4.7 per cent a week better off.</P>
    <P>A widower or a deserted wife with four children on a contributory pension or payment will receive an increase of £5.52 or 3.7 per cent per week, including child benefit.  This new payment will be £153.27 per week.  An old age pensioner couple on a non-contributory pension will receive an increase of £3.60 a week bringing their weekly pension to £61 each.  A couple with three children on unemployment benefit or disability benefit will receive an increase of £8.85 or <Col N="1989" /> 6.2 per cent bringing the new rate to £143.35 a week, including child benefit.</P>
    <P>A general 3 per cent increase is being given in all weekly social welfare and health board payments with effect from July.  This increase applies to personal rates, adult dependent and child dependant allowances.  Over 822,000 people and their 627,000 dependants will benefit, including pensioners, widows, lone parents and families who are out of work because of illness of unemployment.  The cost of this increase will be £97 million in a full year and some £43 million this year. This more than maintains the real income position of those who depend on social welfare, given the current very low rate of inflation and the anticipated rate for the year of 2.5 per cent.  Once again, we are meeting a major commitment in the Programme for Government and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In addition to the general 3 per cent increase, a further increase of 3 per cent, or £1.60 a week, is being given to all short term weekly payments to bring them up to the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates.  The short term payments in question are disability benefit.  Unemployment benefit, injury benefit, short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and unemployability supplement; 185,000 people benefit.</P>
    <P>All long term payments &mdash; representing 80 per cent of all weekly recipients and including pensioners, widows, lone parents, deserted wives and the long term unemployed &mdash; reached the priority rates in July 1991.  This special increase completes the picture in relation to achieving the priority rates for all weekly social welfare payments.  All rates are now at least 90 per cent of the Commission on Social Welfare's main rate, £65.40.  The cost of this special increase amounts to over £15 million in a fully year and almost £7 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>The new widower's contributory pension is a huge breakthrough in the development of our social insurance system.  It is by far the most significant measure to be introduced in social welfare <Col N="1990" /> since I brought the self-employed into social insurance in 1988.  It also marks a major step forward in providing support for families where the wife has died.</P>
    <P>The new contributory pension for widowers will be introduced from October next.  It will be available to widowers on the same terms and subject to the same contribution conditions as currently apply to widows in respect of claims arising from October next.  Under the new arrangements, both widows and widowers will be entitled to a contributory pension for the first year after which a qualifying earnings limit will apply.  I am conscious of the sense of loss and trauma experienced and the adjustment required in the immediate aftermath of bereavement. Existing recipients of widow's pensions will not be affected in any way by these new arrangements.  They will continue to receive their pensions irrespective of their level of earnings.</P>
    <P>The income limit proposed will be tapered between £12,000 and £16,000 per annum, that is, £230 to £310 in weekly terms.  A reduced rate of pension will be payable above the £230 weekly earnings level while no pension will be payable where earnings are in excess of £16,000 per annum, which is well in excess of average industrial earnings.  Where a reduced rate of pension is payable, the full amount in respect of child dependant increases will be paid.  The requirement in relation to income will not apply at pension age which is 66 years of age.  It is estimated that the number of widows claiming under the new scheme and affected by the earnings limit will be minimal.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in the new scheme for transitional arrangements which will apply to men who became widowers within one year of the introduction of the new pension.  In their case, they will also be entitled to the new pension for 12 months before the earnings requirement will apply.  Widowers of more than one year's standing will be eligible to apply for the new pension subject to the earnings requirement.</P>
    <P>This first-time scheme is being introduced <Col N="1991" /> at a significant cost of some £16 million in a full year.  I will be keeping the operation of the new pensions under close review to ensure that the position of widows with young children is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Further significant improvements are being introduced for child benefit in line with our overall approach of developing child benefit as the main element of child income support.  Last year, the monthly rates for all children were increased to £20 for each of the first three children and £23 per child thereafter at a very substantial cost of £50 million in a full year.  This year, the higher rate of £23 is being increased to £25 and, in addition, is being applied to the third and subsequent children.  The new payments structure from next September will be £20 for each of the first two children and £25 for each thereafter.  This improvement will cost almost £13 million in a full year and £4.5 million this year.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement, more than ever, is providing much needed support to workers trying to bring up families on low pay.  Take-up under the scheme has increased on this time last year with some 9,600 families currently getting FIS. Over 30,000 children benefit from this payment.  The very substantial improvements brought into effect last year are beginning to have an impact on take-up under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Building on last year's improvements, the weekly income thresholds are again being adjusted to take account of the tax measures announced in the budget.  The eligibility thresholds are being increased by £10 and families will get an increase of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the need to encourage lone parents, especially single mothers, back into the workforce.  To improve the position for young mothers who want to take up work, the means test is being eased.  The current earnings disregard of £6 for each child is being replaced by a flat-rate disregard of £30 and a 50 per cent taper where earnings are above £30 a week. Where earnings exceed the new disregards, <Col N="1992" /> the amount of lone parent's allowance payable will be reduced by £1 for each £2 earned, instead of the £1 for £1 arrangement currently applied.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the impact of this important improvement, a lone parent with one child earning £80 a week will be £19.90 a week better off in their lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by the case made in particular by the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation that a reduction in the rate from its present level of 12.2 per cent would provide a boost to firms in the traditional, labour intensive manufacturing sectors such as clothing and footwear.  Those sectors have suffered from the impact of lower-cost foreign competition, including competition from the UK where insurance contribution rates favour low-paid employment.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, to weigh up the cost of any concession in terms of lost revenues to the social insurance fund from which workers and their families draw their social welfare entitlements. However, in view of the fact that revenues to the fund have been very healthy in recent years and in keeping with the pro-jobs thrust of the budget, I will, as announced yesterday, be introducing changes in the employer's PRSI rate effective from next April.  The employer's rate will be reduced to 9 per cent in respect of employees earning up to £173 a week, that is, £9,000 per annum. Where earnings exceed that amount, the normal rate of 12.2 per cent will apply to all earnings up to £496 a week which is the PRSI ceiling for employers of £25,800 per annum.</P>
    <P>My main concern in introducing this concession is to help employers in labour intensive industries to maintain and increase jobs.  This concession, together with other budget measures in relation to the income levies, a moderate rate of pay rises in the new pay agreement plus low interest rates and the generally favourable climate for business, should allow for a more positive jobs outlook in these sectors.  Indeed, I am very heartened by the news in the last two days that a <Col N="1993" /> number of clothing firms will be creating new jobs in the near future.</P>
    <P>This new lower contribution rate is not confined to manufacturing and will, of course, also apply in the services sector. Here I hope that the concession would have the effect of reinforcing and stimulating the upward trend in employment that is evident from the 1993 labour force survey published this week.</P>
    <P>Employers will also benefit from the waiving of the levies on behalf of employees who are medical card holders. Again I expect that this will have a positive impact on employment and in particular enhance the job chances of those on the live register.</P>
    <P>This year, the personal rates of disability benefit and unemployment benefit are being singled out for an increase of 10 per cent, £5.40 a week, which will put them on a par with the new long term rate of unemployment assistance, which is £61.00 a week.  This special additional increase in the basic personal rates arises from the decision of the Government to discontinue pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit for new claimants with effect from next July.  The savings from that measure are being devoted in full towards this special increase which will also apply to disability benefit from which pay-related benefit was discontinued in 1992.</P>
    <P>This restructuring measure will ensure a more equitable and effective use of the overall resources available to those in receipt of short term benefits.  Fewer than half those receiving unemployment benefit also receive pay-related benefit.  The special additional increase of 4 per cent in weekly payments will mean that those getting disability or unemployment benefit will receive an overall increase of £5.40 per week, or nearly 10 per cent overall.  In addition to utilising the available savings, this special additional increase will cost £2.7 million this year.</P>
    <P>A significant improvement in the carer's allowance is being introduced this year.  In addition to the general 13 per cent increase, changes are being introduced to the means test through provision of an earnings disregard of £100 in respect of <Col N="1994" /> working spouses.  Most criticism of the allowance has focused on the stringency of the means test, particularly where the spouse of a carer was working.  I am pleased, therefore, to be able to ease the means test.  An extra 500 carers will now qualify for the allowance and a further 350 existing carers will get increases.</P>
    <P>For example, a carer whose spouse had earnings of £160 a week will now receive a payment of £34.00.  They would not previously have been entitled to any payment. The respite care fund, which I established last year, will be provided with a further £500,000 this year to continue its valuable work.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be in a position to announce the following changes in the &ldquo;free schemes&rdquo;: a pensioner being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance will in future retain eligibility for the free telephone rental allowance.  Previously, this was discontinued because the living alone condition ceased to be satisfied; similarly, pensioners aged 75 or over who no longer live alone will retain eligibility for the free telephone rental allowance. The age requirement of 80 which applies in the case of retaining the free electricity allowance will also be reduced to 75; widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes will retain entitlement to them, notwithstanding their age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have been very keen on that and I am particularly pleased to be able to do it this year.</P>
      <P>The free electricity allowance scheme is being extended to include night storage electricity schemes.  This extension will allow unused daytime units to be offset against the cost of night-time units and will enable pensioners with night storage heating to maximise their units under the scheme; the free travel companion pass is being extended to all wheelchair users currently entitled to avail of free travel under my Department's scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the impact of the <Col N="1995" /> remaining measures on social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce the following adjustments: the earnings limit of £30,000 for entitlement to treatment (dental, optical and aural benefits) is being increased to £35,000 and to £70,000 where there is a dependent spouse; the level of redundancy payment at which unemployed people may be disqualified from receipt of unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks is being increased from £12,000 to £15,000; provision of £1 million has been made in the budget to allow me to implement changes in the rules governing entitlement to unemployment benefit in the case of part-time workers.  The precise details of this measure will be announced in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of adoptive benefit is being introduced for adoptive mothers or fathers at a cost of £0.2 million in a full year.  This new scheme will provide for payment for a period of ten weeks.</P>
    <P>Young unemployed people living at home who qualify for unemployment assistance currently receive a minimum payment of £5.  This minimum payment is being doubled to £10.00</P>
    <P>A number of improvements are being introduced to the maternity benefit scheme, as follows: the provisions of the scheme will be extended to women who have a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy &mdash; the current duration is 28 weeks; husbands of women who claim maternity benefit, who are in receipt of social welfare payments will continue to receive full rate child dependent increases for the duration of the maternity benefit.  This improvement will avoid a situation where families found themselves worse off financially for the duration of the maternity benefit claim because of the loss of the half rate child dependent increases.</P>
    <P>Payment of the adult dependent allowance is being continued for six weeks after the death of an adult dependent in the case of retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, old age (non-contributory) pension, pre-retirement allowance and invalidity pension.  All <Col N="1996" /> social welfare payments now provide this six weeks after death cover.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved an additional £2.5 million in support of grants to voluntary and community organisations.  This amount is in addition to the allocation of £4.73 million already provided for in the 1994 Estimates for my Department.  It brings the total amount available this year to £7.23 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the various allocations are as follows: an additional £100,000 is being provided for the scheme of once off grants to voluntary organisations, bringing the 1994 allocation to £850,000.  The respite care fund scheme, which I introduced in 1993, has proved enormously successful.  Over 90 separate projects to provide respite breaks for full-time carers were assisted from the fund in 1993.  An allocation of £500,000 in 1994 is provided to continue this fund.  Another initiative which I introduced in 1993 was the allocation of £100,000, to support voluntary projects to help lone parents return to the workforce or to second chance education. I am doubling the allocation for 1994 to £200,000.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-four is the International Year of the Family and the Government is providing a special grantin-aid of £400,000 to the steering committee for the year representing the non-governmental sector.  This allocation will enable that committee to grant-aid family organisations who wish to host events or bring forward initiatives to celebrate the year.  I am also providing a special allocation of £250,000 to assist the work of family resource centres.</P>
    <P>I am increasing the allocation for the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups to £700,000, an increase of £100,000 over the 1993 allocation. Since I introduced it in 1990, this scheme has seen an enormous growth in the number of local groups providing personal development and informal educational opportunities for women in disadvantaged areas.  I want to ensure that the same opportunities are available for men and am providing an allocation of £100,000 for initiatives with men's <Col N="1997" /> groups.  Details of how this scheme will operate will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Many of the groups funded under the women's grants scheme have developed to a stage where they reach out to a wider number of woman and provide a wide range of personal development and parenting courses, pre-vocational and educational opportunities and child-minding facilities.  In recognition that more established and developed groups require more support and a longer term funding commitment, I am providing an additional allocation of £100,000 for a new scheme to provide enhanced funding for the more developed groups.</P>
    <P>An additional allocation of £700,000 is being provided for my Department's Community Development Programme, bringing the total allocation to £2.2 million. This will allow for continued funding for existing projects and maintain the momentum of expansion of the programme into new areas.</P>
    <P>An additional £250,000 is being provided for projects to combat the problems of moneylending, bringing the total allocation of £750,000.  Thirteen local projects were funded in 1993 and my intention is to establish additional projects in 1994 in Galway, Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, the midlands, areas of Dublin not served by existing projects and in other centres around the country.</P>
    <P>This programme has given real hope to many people on low incomes caught in a cycle of indebtedness.  I intend to develop and expand debt advice and household budget management services as an integral part of the overall services offered by my Department to social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>The household budgeting facility is proving to be very popular.  More than 2,000 people in the greater Dublin area, Kilkenny, and Waterford are having deductions made from their weekly payments to meet bills such as rent, ESB and gas.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years, the opportunity is taken at budget time to announce a number of special grants to voluntary and community organisations; <Col N="1998" /> they have become known as the budget specials.</P>
    <P>This year I am making provision for the following grants, totalling £1,180,000.  Women's Refuges &mdash; £100,000 &mdash; a special provision for new refuges and to assist existing refuges. Grants to assist organisations working with homeless boys will amount to £100,000.

Bawnogue Community Centre will receive £25,000 towards the construction of a community centre to serve the Bawnogue area.  A sum of £25,000 will go to a community development bursary scheme to enable people working in the community to access relevant training in community development. The Capuchin Centre for Homeless Men will receive £25,000 and the Cheshire Foundation in Ireland will receive £25,000 to run a number of independent living training courses for people in their sheltered housing units.  Community Action Network will receive £50,000 to assist the organisation with its personal development, community development and other courses and to allow CAN to undertake preliminary community development work in areas not served by the community development programme.  Crosscare will receive £40,000 for a special project which deals with teenage problems in a family context. Energy Action will receive £50,000 to continue and extend its work of insulating homes of the elderly and other disadvantaged groups and to allow for extension of initiatives to rural areas. Forum, North West Connemara will be given £30,000 for a pilot rural transport project aimed at devising a new and co-ordinated <Col N="1999" /> approach at meeting the transport needs of elderly people, women in the home and others in isolated rural areas.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 is to be given to Inisbofin Development Association towards the construction of a community centre on this offshore island.  ICTU is to receive £40,000 to enable it employ two training officers to develop the social welfare advice role of its unemployed centres. Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed is to receive £24,000 towards the employment of a resource worker to co-ordinate the provision of advice and information to the unemployed and a research project.  The Irish Red Cross will receive £50,000.  The society has been running a pilot training programme for its volunteers on care for the elderly and infirm and to give some respite for carers.  The grant will allow the programme to be expanded and run on a national level in co-operation with the health boards and public health nurses.  The Irish Wheelchair Association will receive £50,000 towards the cost of a pilot peer counselling project to assist people with disabilities to become more independent.  Loughboy Area Resource Centre will receive £10,000 and the Mountview Youth and Family Centre will receive £15,000.  The Moyvalley Resources will receive £20,000 towards the establishment of a centre which will encourage the enterprise aspects of community development.  The National League of the Blind of Ireland will receive £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps headquarters will receive £30,000 for the following units towards the purchase of ambulances: Greenhills, Walkintown; Mulranny, County Mayo; Newbridge, County Kildare; Portlaoise, County Laois; Castlebar, County Mayo, and Baldoyle. The order is helped in its purchase of ambulances with a grant of £5,000 per ambulance.  Parentline will receive £25,000 to extend the group's helpline, extend this organisation's service outside Dublin and extend the network of parents' support groups.  Poverty 3 will <Col N="2000" /> deceive £16,000 to increase awareness of the poverty programme and a conference of rural projects.  St. Francis Hospice Home Care Service will receive £25,000 towards the purchase of transport for the centre's users.  St. Michael's House will receive £30,000, and the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland £20,000 to provide matching funding for the Association's WORKLINK project.  The Shanty Educational Project will receive £20,000 towards the cost of establishing a centre to meet the need for pre-school education and child care while parents avail of second chance educational opportunities. The Tallaght Childcare Project will receive £20,000 and Threshold, £20,000 for the establishment of a housing debt policy unit.  The Wallaroo Pre-school, Cork will receive £15,000 to enable the project to continue and Women's Aid will receive £35,000.</P>
    <P>This is a good and progressive budget for social welfare.  We are providing real improvements for all our customers at a cost of £157 million.  We are now spending £3.8 billion on our social welfare services and we are doing it with increasing effectiveness.</P>
    <P>We will continue to develop our services in an imaginative way and to invest in those people who look to us for support and protection.  This is the commitment of this partnership Government and of the social partners with whom we can chart a better future for all our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by telling the Minister for Social Welfare how pleased I am to hear some of the changes he has announced, particularly those relating to the retention of entitlements to widows aged between 60 and 65 years whose husbands had entitlements to free schemes. I have been advocating the introduction of that measure for some time and I hope next year the Minister will be able to <Col N="2001" /> make that available to all widows of people entitled to those free schemes and that the age requirement will no longer exist.  This is a progressive measure and will assist a small number of people, but people who are in a difficult position.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the free travel companion pass to all wheelchair users.  That scheme deserves further attention.  As there are a number of categories of people with a similar need, will the Minister consider extending the scheme next year?  I welcome also the further provisions for the continuation of the after death payment.  Those are all very constructive measures, but it is regrettable that more of what is being billed as a great give-away budget has not been put into such measures.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of the budget which I can only characterise as an admission by the Government of past errors, some of them very gross errors. My colleague, Deputy Yates, referred to some of them yesterday.  It is clear that the abolition this year of the 1 per cent income levy imposed last year is a belated admission by the Government that there was never a need or justification for that measure and that it was introduced in a panic last year, similar to the probate tax, when the Government could not agree on a rational expenditure programme.</P>
      <P>The probate tax is another case in point, but the Government has not had the decency to go the whole hog and abolish it.  Changes have been made in relation to that tax but it is still badly framed.  It is a tax which hits vulnerable people at a most vulnerable time in their lives.  As my colleague, Deputy Yates, pointed out yesterday, people who might be able to pay that tax from the proceeds of an estate they were about to inherit could not do so because of not being in a position to derive income from the estate first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect then, the probate tax forces people to borrow on the basis of the income they will eventually receive from their inheritance.  A tax that has that result is self-defeating and unduly onerous and oppressive.  In the light of the changes the Government made in the <Col N="2002" /> area of probate tax this year it is obvious that it has accepted the proposition that this is a bad tax, that it does not form part of a rational tax reform programme and should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I note that changes are being made in the probate tax in regard to the assessment of the value of an agricultural estate, but it will still have repercussions for the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>This year the Government admitted to a serious error made some years ago when ACOT and An Foras Talúntais were merged to form Teagasc.  At that time the new body was crippled because of a lack of funds.  Its administrative budget was slashed and we have been living with the consequences of that ever since.  Deputies who have any rural element in their constituencies know the problems Teagasc has had during the years to meet the demands being made on it.  Because of the CAP reform to which this Government and its predecessor agreed, without putting up any fight, there are greater demands on Teagasc to help farmers, particularly small farmers in the west, to deal with the challenges that face them.  Since the GATT package was announced at the end of last year, an arrangement with which the Government is happy, there will be even more pressure on Teagasc to give farmers the type of advice they need to reorient their production systems and the pattern of production on their farms to deal with lower prices worldwide, lower export refunds and greater quota restrictions.  At the same time we will have to hand over a greater part of the European Union's market to our GATT competitors who have not accepted any restrictions on their production.  That will mean a major change in the way we plan the composition of our farm output and how we go about pruning costs and making ourselves competitive.  It will require a major input from Teagasc and all we have this year is a belated admission by the Government that the problem exists.  We should never have had to make that extra provision.  What is provided now is a little extra funding for Teagasc to make up for it having been spanceled <Col N="2003" /> since it was set up.  The Government is taking credit for allocating £2 million last year and this year to the small farm development programme.  Does it know what is happening on the ground?</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a Teagasc centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, an area where farmers need the advice to which I refer.  The staff in that centre do not know if it will be open in a few months' time.  They do not have funds to carry out the necessary research work.  There is no researcher in that centre and no one there, apart from a development officer, has any role in trying to relate the work of a Teagasc centre to the needs of farmers. The £2 million made available will not resolve the problem on the scale needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance &mdash; and probably the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; are taking credit for allocating £2 million to the administrative budget of the Department of Agriculture to help it deal with delays in payments under premium schemes now in operation.  That allocation should have been made a long time ago.  Since we resumed after the summer recess on 6 October last year I have sought to draw the Minister's attention to the criminal delays in payments under many of those schemes.  The only answer I have received from the Department of Agriculture &mdash; not from the Minister because he never seems to be here &mdash; but from his hapless Ministers of State, indicates how much money has been paid out.  Do they know that people are still waiting for the payment of the special beef premium for which they applied in February last year, payments which should have been made in June?  They have been told in the last few weeks that because of a problem with the computers in the Department of Agriculture they will now have to resubmit the identity numbers of the cattle for which they applied for grants.  That has caused chaos among farm families.  There has been a belated admission that there is a problem and £2 million will be made available this year for the administrative budget. However, I am not sure it will be enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday <Col N="2004" /> told us, with a smile on his face that he would allocate £1 million to deal with the problem of potato and vegetable producers who were wiped out last summer. If the sum of £1 million was allocated solely to the potato and vegetable producers, it would go nowhere near meeting their problems.  They cannot pay their bills for last summer's production.  No reference has been made, as Deputy Lenihan would say, &ldquo;good, bad or indifferent&rdquo;, to the difficulties experienced in that same wet summer by tillage producers down a strip of the east coast in Counties Wicklow and Wexford.  The problem is particularly bad in County Wexford and no provision has been made for those tillage producers.  The allocation of £1 million to potato and vegetable producers will not begin to deal with that problem.  The producers are not looking for assistance, a replacement of their income, they are looking for a minimal form of assistance that will allow them to plant for another crop season. Although the Minister for Agriculture promised the then President of the IFA, Alan Gillis at a meeting to discuss a new national pay agreement last monday week that he would meet representatives of those groups so far he has not done so.  He does not seem to want to know about them, but he will hear about them. They cancelled a picket outside this House a week or two ago on the understanding that the Minister for Agriculture would meet them to discuss their problem. the Minister for Agriculture does not like getting into discussion with those people.  Now we find that £1 million, which had been announced previously, will be allocated to those producers, but that is not a real contribution to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provisions for the farm retirement scheme, that much delayed scheme promised in spring, early summer and late summer of last year and on which final agreement was reached only ten days ago.</P>
    <P>Five million pounds was provided in the Estimates this year for that scheme, An extra £2.5 million is provided for in the budget, but there is no thanks to the <Col N="2005" /> Minister for that.  It was clear that if the scheme came into operation £5 million would not cover it.  The Minister is simply anticipating the fact that he will have to provide more money for the scheme in 1994 and, instead of having to come in later in the year with the inevitable Supplementary Estimate, he is trying to gain brownie points by telling us he is making a much bigger allocation for the scheme. It should not have taken so long to get this scheme into operation.  It should have been worked out long before now, and nobody will be impressed by the gesture of the Minister in providing an extra £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>The budget makes an additional provision for county roads.  In the Budget Statement the Government claims great credit for a provision which is 113 per cent of the provision for last year.  The amount is being increased by £15 million over and above the Estimates and will amount to the enormous sum of £28.3 million for county roads.  Who does the Minister think he is kidding?  That amount of money would not be sufficient to deal with the problem in my county alone.  It would not be sufficient to deal with the problems in County Cavan about which my colleague, Deputy Boylan, has been talking for a long time.  I assure Deputy Bhamjee that it will do nothing for County Clare.  Many counties experience the problem whereby county roads are literally falling apart.</P>
    <P>In parts of my county farmers have to plan the route to transport silage from their fields to their farmyards.  They cannot take the shortest route because the roads simply will not support the silage wagons, or the potholes are so big that they would break them.  Dairies refuse to send milk lorries to many areas because the potholes would banjax the springs of the milk lorries.  Every rural Deputy knows that school bus operators do not want to send their buses through roads all over the country because they are afraid that the cost of repair of the buses would be huge.  Every Deputy is aware of the damage done to cars of ordinary citizens from travelling on <Col N="2006" /> county roads, although some of us do not seem to be affected by it.  I heard recently that Deputy Bhamjee had a meeting with SIMI representatives in his constituency, told them quite blandly that more tax would be imposed on cars and they would have to put up with it.  That showed the sympathy he had for motorists and road users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MoosajeeBhamjee" hpid="Dr. Bhamjee Dr. Bhamjee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That society is trying to sell cars to people who know perfectly well that after three or four months they will have to replace the shock absorbers as a result of the bad conditions of the roads.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister for Finance this morning on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; modestly disclaiming any suggestion that the spin doctors could have anything to do with this budget.  He said that so many people are interested in the budget that the spin doctoring cannot work.  Who does he think he is kidding?  The whole layout of the budget shows the involvement of the spin doctors, as do the headlines in the newspapers today.  They say that this is a give-away budget.  I have examined the figures in the Principal Features of the Budget and as a result of the tax changes, the Government is raising extra revenue of £110.9 million.  If you look at the give-aways, the Government is giving out £303.05 million.  Therefore, there is a net give-away &mdash; that is what you would call it &mdash; of £192 million.  That will not appear in any of the newspapers because they are looking at the changes in income tax, the £83 million given back by way of the levy and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the figures are further examined one finds that the Government is taking credit for the £83 million it is giving back in the 1 per cent levy which should never have been introduced in the first place, and for the fact that the PRSI allowance is again being maintained this year.  It says that constitutes a give-away of £37 million. Neither of those is a give-away.  The two figures together amount to £120 million. We find that 60 per cent of what is presented as a give-away in this budget <Col N="2007" /> is accounted for by money that never should have been taken from people in the first place.  Therefore, this is not a give-away budget &mdash; I compliment the spin doctors on their success in presenting it as such.  When the next tax give-away of £192.2 million is compared with the figure for income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Accepting that there is £192 million of a give-away, what could have been done with that money other than the plethora of things that appear in the budget?  The changes in the marginal relief rate, child additions and personal allowances in the income tax code will cost £89.9 million in 1994, and they are small changes.  What could the Government have done if it had concentrated a full £192 million in these areas alone without doing any of the other little things?  If the Government had concentrated on those areas it would have been able to make a far bigger change in the marginal relief rate, child additions and personal allowances, at one stroke it would have done more to increase the prospects of employment for a great many people by reducing the poverty traps than it has done with all this plethora of things that took the Minister for Finance an historic and mind-numbingly boring two hours to read yesterday.</P>
      <P>This budget is another giving in, and I know how it happens because I know the Labour Party quite intimately of old and I know Fianna Fáil's penchant for the appearance rather than the substance. The Government has made a bags of this budget by trying to do so many of the right things, nothing will amount to very much.  It has spread the jam so thinly that people can hardly get the taste of the raspberries, and raspberries therefore are what the Government deserve for this budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the budget there was great hype about the amount of money available to the Minister for Finance to spend.  A graveyard in my constituency was severely flooded for the second time in nine months &mdash; some graves had sunk approximately six inches &mdash; yet despite several phone calls to the Department there was only a promise that money might be made available to deal with this problem.  The county council had no money to deal with it.  If the Government properly looked after the welfare of the country at large there would be no question of the Minister for Finance having a bonanza at his disposal. Councils have been starved of funding: <Col N="2009" /> they have no money to build houses, repair roads or deal with emergencies. Health boards will be given an injection of £100 million from the amnesty to help them keep going.  They will not be able to provide a luxury service with this funding: once the debts have been paid they will only be able to provide a basic service.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the budget would have been like if the money from the tax amnesty had not been available to the Government &mdash; most of that money being given out is based on the yield from the tax amnesty.  Despite all the good fundamentals in our economy, I wonder how well it would stand up if we did not receive funding from the EU.  I should point out that Teagasc had to sell 77 acres of land in Oakpark in my constituency to pay debts for which the Minister would not provide funding.  Another burning issue is funding for schools.  It is almost impossible to get the Department to agree on final figures.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the 1 per cent levy has been hailed as a major achievement.  I think the Minister is lucky that no criminal charges were brought against him for the introduction of this levy last year.  He should be glad no charges were brought against him in court.  The effect of the probate tax has been lightened by the exemption of spouses.  Nevertheless, this tax, which ought to be a source of embarrasssment for any Government, should be abolished completely.</P>
    <P>I am worried about certain aspects in regard to health.  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>The main areas of hospital treatment targeted for special attention were those where long waiting times were causing the greatest hardship, including hip replacements and eye surgery.</P>
    <P>I am completely in favour of helping those people who need hip replacements but I am appalled that no priority has been given to those on the waiting list for heart operations.  After all, if a person's heart stops beating, they die.  People can endure an extra few months suffering while waiting for a hip replacement or <Col N="2010" /> eye surgery &mdash; it is wrong they should have to wait &mdash; but people cannot afford to wait a few months for a heart operation; it is a matter of life and death.  The number of people on the waiting list for heart operations is unbelievable, and I am amazed that these people together with people waiting for hip replacements and eye surgery have not been made a priority.  I hope the Minister for Health will deal with this issue in his own way.</P>
    <P>Our roads are beginning to crumble. The number of potholes used to be a joke but now people are complaining about potholes which cover a stretch of road. People coming around corners drive into these potholes, get punctures and almost wreck their cars.  The budget is geared towards the European and local elections, but it should be remembered that if we have a wet summer and our roads are not repaired before these elections people will not be able to get to the polling stations to vote.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £15 million from the tax amnesty, or an increase of 113 per cent brings to £28 million the amount of money available for our roads.  Last year, the amount allocated for roads was £13 million.  My local authority estimates it will cost £800,000 to upgrade the road from Carlow to Hacketstown and approximately £1 million to upgrade the road from New Ross to Carlow, giving a total of approximately £2 million.  The authority would need approximately £3 million to upgrade the county roads, yet it will only receive a few hundred thousand pounds for this work.  My colleague, Deputy Crawford has told me that it has been estimated it will cost £40 million to upgrade the roads in County Cavan and approximately £36 million is required to repair the roads in County Monaghan, giving a total of approximately £76 million for two counties.  From where will this funding come and how will people travel in the meantime?  I have met sensible people who are very irate about the state of the roads in their counties.  The people of Carlow are lucky in so far as their roads are probably in a better condition than the roads in many other counties. I know we had a wet winter but the <Col N="2011" /> roads in Carlow are beginning to crumble.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in the earner's allowance introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  We have all been calling for this improvement for years.  While the improvement may not be as great as we would wish, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction, and maybe next year we will see further improvements.  I also welcome the changes in regard to widowers.  We can bandy figures about but, to be blunt about it, a 3 per cent increase is not worth a tuppenny curse to anyone.  Inflation is estimated at 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent of nothing is still nothing.  This is the difficulty.  Three per cent of £30,000 is one thing but 3 per cent of £55 is nothing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the areas of agriculture and food, I was going to quote from the Minister's speech about research, etc., but I do not have time.  The sale of land, as happened in the case of Oakpark, is not the way to fund research.  Housing construction was non-existent but it has started to improve.  The idea of hitting, so to speak, people who are paying VHI and mortgages with a property tax is totally unacceptable.  These are the people who have to pay for higher education grants and provide the money for everybody else.  This budget, which has a bit for everyone, might appeal to some people but it will do nothing for the economy in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sharing budget founded on the twin pillars of economic growth and social justice. This budget takes a series of bold and imaginative leaps into the area of tax reform and the integration of tax and social welfare.  I welcome the changes in relation to social welfare which seek to consolidate the concept of social protection, but for somebody who lives on a social welfare income the income element is only a part of the total services consumed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this budget those on a low income, families who are poor, will benefit <Col N="2012" /> not just from the changes in social welfare but from a whole series of carefully calculated social spending measures.  These measures are designed to improve radically the quality of health care, education and access to housing and the environment.  Running through this budget is a commitment to sustainable economic growth alongside a determination to improve not only the income but also the quality of life of those who depend on social welfare, and this is our twin commitment to economic growth and social justice.</P>
    <P>It astonishes me that the Deputies opposite can so readily unite to dismiss the package of reforms announced yesterday. Year in, year out, they have called for reforms, but when they come, their sole response has been to run like scared rabbits from the implications. What a totally pathetic and dishonest posture is their repeated claim to be the champions of reform.  This is now shown to be a totally shallow claim as all they present is their true colours in this Dáil. The protection of some extremely narrow vested interests, which have formed the basis of their pronouncements since yesterday, preclude them being able to support real steps towards reform when they are taken.</P>
    <P>There is serious inequality in this society and it has devastating effects.  It creates poverty, it denies incentives to employment and enterprise to many individuals and to very large communities. The approach in this budget has been to tackle that inequality on two levels &mdash; on the direct expenditure level by major improvements in social areas of expenditure, in housing, welfare, health and education, bringing the benefits of economic recovery to the most deprived sections of the community and it also tackles that inequality by commencing major steps in tax reform by the elimination of serious poverty traps, disincentives to employment and by the basic restructuring of the tax codes in the area of property tax and the discretionary nature of tax reliefs.  These reforms are essential ingredients in modernising our tax system and indirect investment to job <Col N="2013" /> creation and they also have an indirect, but vital, social component.</P>
    <P>In the run up to this budget, as in the run up to many other budgets, a series of respected national and international organisations called for a fundamental tax reform which would essentially centre around the widening of the tax banks, increases in personal allowances and the gradual eroding and withering away of discretionary reliefs.</P>
    <P>There has been, as the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, a whole series of reports recommending this approach.  In newspaper articles and interviews many individuals on the Opposition Front Bench have called for the same kind of radical tax reform and have vehemently supported the recommendations of, for example, the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>Yesterday saw the beginning of such a reform package on a phased basis with the increases in personal allowances allied with the beginning of the restructuring of discretionary reliefs.  Yet, amazingly, when this measured package of reform on a phased basis is put into operation what do we get from the same Opposition?  They scurry away, rubbishing progress towards their supposed policies and exposing the reality of their vested interests &mdash; the haves should have and the have nots can whistle in their self-imposed situation.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is not an easy subject.  Let us be honest about this.  This Government has, in this budget, attempted to take the first steps in such a phased programme of tax reform.  On the basis of yesterday's budget the average family will gain substantially by the widening of the tax bands even when set against the loss of part of the discretionary reliefs.</P>
    <P>Did I really see last night left wing radicals of yesteryear tripping into the division lobbies to vote against modest increases in excise duties on cigarettes and alcohol to provide the resources needed for improvements in health, education and welfare?  It was truly an astonishing sight &mdash; that some on the benches opposite who entered this House on a reputation for radical social policies <Col N="2014" /> should now rise to resist the very taxation changes that, in the not too distant past, were the essential ingredients of the policy package they presented to the electorate.  Like disciples of St. Augustine, their prayer is obviously &ldquo;Lord let us have reform, but please not just yet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This budget contains a coherent package of social measures.  These concern, in part, my Department but alongside them there are proposals in health, education and community employment. Together these represent vital new opportunities for deprived communities to come into the economic and social mainstream of our society.  They form a radical package to improve the quality of life for people who are disadvantaged and poor, not just in terms of improving income but in improving the quality of services in education, housing, and all the essential areas.  The clear bias in the social spending proposals in this budget is toward the disadvantaged, both as individuals and for communities, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I can understand the difficulty of being in Opposition, the temptation to oppose everything for opposition sake, but the intellectual dishonesty of the left Opposition is staggering.  The opposition of the right is a welcome reminder of their inability to grasp the fact that equity demands sharing and that tax reform is fundamental to achieving true equity. Tax reform means reform, genuine reform, and not just tax reduction.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to specifically address the budget as it affects my Department.  This budget contains a £157 million package for social welfare.  The Government is determined to protect and improve the position of those of our citizens who depend on social welfare.  A total of 1.5 million people will get an increase of 3 per cent in their weekly social welfare and health board payments; this more than matches the anticipated rate of inflation and meets the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>A total of 185,000 people will get a special extra increase of 3 per cent &mdash; £1.60 a week &mdash; to bring them up to <Col N="2015" /> the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and one of the commitments in the Programme for Government.  This also has the effect of rationalising a number of social welfare payments.  We hope to continue with a systematic programme of rationalisation and simplification of the system over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Larger families will benefit from an increase in the higher rate of child benefit to £25 which will be payable for the third and subsequent children.  The burden of poverty falls particularly heavily on women and this improvement is further recognition by the Government of the need to ensure that adequate resources go directly to women working in the home looking after their families.  Again, all of the reputable agencies have indicated in numerous reports that child benefit is one of the best mechanisms of attacking poverty in families with children.</P>
    <P>For the first time, widowers will get an entitlement to a contributory pension. This new pension is a significant advance in the protection given by the social welfare system to families where the wife has died.  It also shows clearly this Government's commitment to equality of treatment between men and women across all areas of public policy.</P>
    <P>There will be an improvement for carers with a new earnings disregard of £100 where there is a working spouse. This will mean an extra 500 carers can get access to the allowance and will increase the payments to a further 350 existing beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Widows and old people will benefit from improvements in the free schemes. Everyone agrees that the free schemes are very important to the recipients and I am very pleased that we have been able to remove some of the more unacceptable restrictions on these schemes. Widows aged 60-65 will now be able to retain these allowances if the couple were entitled to them.  There are also important improvements for old people and wheelchair users.  These all provide further evidence of the caring nature of <Col N="2016" /> this budget.  I was particularly struck by the representations made to me by Deputies from all parties, but particularly from the Labour Party, about how these type of restrictions affected many people in practice.  I am pleased we have been able to significantly modify them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that changes are taking place in the world of work &mdash; changes which have potentially profound implications for the future.  We have, in the past, been accustomed to thinking of a traditional work pattern which was associated with predominantly male, full-time and permanent employment. Evidence of changes in these work patterns can be observed in the growth of part-time employment, increased participation by women in economic life and the increasing importance of self-employment. Some sectors of the economy are more amenable to changes &mdash; the growth in services sector employment which was confirmed in the recently published Labour Force Survey results for 1993 is an example of this.  These trends show signs of vibrancy in the labour market and demonstrate that increasing flexibility in employment patterns can bring increased employment and incomes.</P>
      <P>While increased flexibility in the labour market is welcome, it should not be achieved at the expense of the protection of the individual in employment.  Our society is noteworthy for the extent to which we are prepared to pool the risks of sickness, unemployment and old age which are faced by individuals.  The social insurance system has shown itself in the past capable of adapting to changed environments.  The extension of social insurance to self-employed workers and part-time workers in the past few years demonstrates this ability to evolve and grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the Department of Social Welfare, want to ensure that the evolution in working patterns does not damage the extent of social protection which is extended to individual workers.  In this <Col N="2017" /> connection, I have noted recent developments in a number of areas but particularly in the construction industry related to the increased use or, should I say, abuse of self-employment.  I would be concerned if workers were being forced to accept working arrangements which deprived them of protection from loss of income through sickness or unemployment. I am initiating a review within my Department to look at this issue and to consider the implications of these developments for the social protection of the workers and for the social welfare system itself.</P>
    <P>When appointed Minister of State I was given specific responsibility for the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  This is a complex and technical question, so I set up a working group of experts in this area to advise me and the Government how we should tackle integration.  My intention is that the long acknowledged problems will be addressed in practice.  I do not want simply more reports being added to the volume obtaining.  While the expert group has to deal with creating a sustainable long term answer, I asked it to suggest some measures which could be undertaken in this budget to reduce disincentives to work.  In the short time scale for their interim report, the group was able to look at a limited number of areas only and were conscious of the need to restrict their interim proposals to measures which would be implemented in the time frame of a single budget.  However, the group did come up with three specific proposals: first, that the means test for lone parents allowance should be eased in order to make it more attractive for lone parents to take up work; second, that the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders have to pay the employees' health contribution and employment and training levy should be abolished; the medical card holder would be exempt from these levies in the same way as widows/lone parents, and third, that measure should be taken to improve the take-up of the family income supplement scheme, popularly known as FIS.  I am delighted that we have been <Col N="2018" /> able to make progress on all three recommendations.</P>
    <P>In relation to lone parents, the budget includes relaxation of the means test for lone parents allowance.  Under the old rules, a lone parent was allowed to earn very little before the allowance was reduced, pound for pound.  Under the new arrangements, the first £30 per week of earnings will be ignored.  Above that the allowance will be reduced by £1 for each £2 of earnings.  This is, in addition, recognition of child-minding and travel expenses for the lone parent.  This will greatly reduce the poverty trap facing lone parents who want to take up work and recognises especially the child care costs involved for a lone parent to take up employment.</P>
    <P>The proposal to remove the liability for the health contribution and employment and training levy from employers of medical card holders is also being implemented with effect from next April. This is only one of a number of measures which we are undertaking in order to reduce the level of PRSI paid by low paid employees and their employers.  We have also reduced the rate of employer's PRSI in respect of lower paid employees and we have introduced an income threshold below which employees do not have to pay the health contribution and the employment and training levy.</P>
    <P>Many Members will be aware that the level of take-up of FIS was far lower than the targeted levels would suggest. In relation to the recommendation on FIS take-up, it is envisaged that the Department will have the technological capacity, from end October 1994, to identify many potential FIS beneficiaries by drawing from data on its central records and child benefit computer systems.  This will enable the Department to contact potential claimants directly to inform them of their entitlements under the scheme.  Since the expert group began its work the FIS take-up has increased &mdash; as a result of special examinations undertaken in the Department &mdash; by 25 per cent and we anticipate an even greater take-up in the next year resulting from an advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> In the longer term, the working group is examining, or intends to examine, a range of basic income options, the possible restructuring of child income support, the appropriate unit of assessment, the financing of alternative structures and the role of non-cash benefits.  I have asked the group to finalise its main report before the end of the year, and I look forward to receiving its final conclusions.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the ESRI undertook a &ldquo;Survey of Income Distribution, Poverty and Usage of State Services&rdquo;, funded jointly by the EC, the Department of Social Welfare, the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI itself.  This created an invaluable database of a kind which was not previously available in this country. For the first time, comprehensive information was available on the nature and extent of poverty and the relationship between poverty, the tax and social welfare systems and the labour market.  A very substantial body of research has been undertaken on the basis of this data.</P>
    <P>High quality research and analysis of this type is of critical importance in the formulation and assessment of anti-poverty policy.  As Members know, there are many myths surrounding social welfare and poverty.  However, the existing data is getting out-of-date, and no comparable survey has been undertaken since 1987. I have been aware for some time of the need for a similar survey to be undertaken in 1994.  I am particularly pleased that the Government has agreed to providing the necessary funds in the budget to enable the survey to go ahead this year.  My Department will work closely with the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI in the carrying out of this survey. It is my belief it will contribute substantially to our understanding of the real incomes of families on low incomes or social welfare incomes at present.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the substantial increase in the budget in the Department of Social Welfare's allocation for support for voluntary and community activity in 1994.  The budget provided an additional £2.5 million for support of voluntary activity in 1994.  This brings the overall <Col N="2020" /> allocation this year for support for voluntary and community activity to £7.23 million.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Department, of course, is one of income maintenance. However, in recent years the Department has engaged in a broader welfare role concerned with the well-being of its clients in the broadest sense and with facilitating communities to address the problems facing them.  The Department has a number of programmes designed to encourage and facilitate persons in receipt of welfare payments to make the transition to employment or self-employment, or to foster personal and community development in disadvantaged areas thereby acting as a precursor to social and economic development, what is referred to by economists as &ldquo;capacity building&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The additional funds to be made available for support of voluntary and community organisation in 1994 include an additional £750,000 for the community development programme, £400,000 for grants to mark the International Year of the Family, an additional £250,000 for projects to combat the problems of moneylending, £250,000 for family resource centres, £100,000 for women's refuges and an additional £100,000 for the scheme of grants to locally based women's groups.  An additional £700,000 is also being provided under the community development programme bringing the total allocation to £2.2 million. The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the cost of equipping and staffing local resource centres. These centres provide a focal point for community development activities in the area.  The 1994 allocation of £2.2 million will allow the programme to be extended to a number of new areas around the country and funding of projects already in the programme to be continued.</P>
    <P>Funding will also be provided under this heading to groups who encourage start-up community development initiatives in areas not served by the Department's community development programme and who provide training and <Col N="2021" /> support services for local community development groups.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Council for the Status of Women recommended that a minimum of £1 million should be available to fund grants to women's groups and that £100,000 should be allocated to similar work for men.  We have not simply achieved these targets but, in this area of women's groups, the target has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>This year an additional £100,000 is being allocated to the scheme of grants to locally based women's groups.  A further sum of £100,000 is being provided which recognises the need for enhanced support and a longer-term funding commitment to the more developed and established women's groups.  These groups provide invaluable personal development and community based education opportunities in disadvantaged areas.  The scheme will provide multiannual funding to a selected number of groups in disadvantaged areas to employ a co-ordinator and plan ahead, making their work more effective and enabling them to reach out to a larger number of women. In particular, I wish to see such groups becoming participants of local development programmes to benefit from these developments.</P>
    <P>The work of the large number of locally based women's groups that have grown up, particularly in disadvantaged areas, in recent years is extremely valuable in tackling the consequences of poverty and disadvantage.  Increasingly their activities are recognised as being very relevant to the world of jobs and the economy.  The groups are important in giving women the personal and social skills they need to access vocational training and to return to the labour market.  While such groups typically start with a concern about personal development and what might be termed family skills, they have a very real and developing role and potential in encouraging involvement by women in wider social and economic issues that affect them and their local communities, and in facilitating those women who wish to return to training and employment.</P>
    <P>I am determined that this work over <Col N="2022" /> the years will be fully integrated into broad local and community enterprise development.  Women have been the driving force in many of our most disadvantaged communities.  When there were no resources they supported each other, set up information centres and provided basic training and education. With tiny amounts of funding they expanded their services and energised their communities.  Now that there is recognition of the importance of community based local economic development and substantial resources for this purpose, I intend to ensure that women will be equal partners and beneficiaries. We cannot tolerate a situation where those who built the foundations are excluded from the construction of new hope and opportunity in their community. We have seen the quality of women's work, their creativity and innovation and this cannot be lost in the future.</P>
    <P>I have been heavily involved in developing the concept of local development to take advantage of and spend the European Structural Funds.  Quite honestly, I fear that as the larger agencies such as FÁS, the health boards and the trade unions become involved in local development what has been built up on a voluntary basis by the women's groups will be sidelined when greater sums of money are involved.  This year we will be commencing a series of initiatives to ensure that women remain involved in the local development process and take their full share of available funding.</P>
    <P>Training and education opportunities have been grasped by women, in particular and the grants to Aontas and Community Action Network &mdash; CAN &mdash; which the Minister mentioned earlier, recognise the invaluable work they do which has been particularly beneficial to women.  In addition, organisations such as Aontas and CAN, which provide education are enabling people from disadvantaged communities to qualify for the jobs in community development as more funding becomes available.  It is critical that people from disadvantaged areas get the jobs when funding is provided <Col N="2023" /> for jobs in community development. In allocating grants for the existing schemes, priority will continue to be given to groups in disadvantaged areas, whether urban or rural.  The range of activities which will be supported is extensive and will include personal development, assertiveness training, home management courses, literacy and numeracy courses, support services for parents with handicapped children and information and advice services.  The new grant allocations will build on activities and provide the impetus for groups to access mainstream training in particular.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that the Department of Social Welfare is making a special allocation of £100,000 for women's refuges.  I met with them before Christmas to establish their priorities and we will meet them again, in conjunction with the Department of Health, to discuss how these funds should be allocated but priority will be given to establishing refugees outside the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Women's Aid receives a special grant of £35,000 which will fund their interesting proposition to research the level of violence against women &mdash; information which will inform policy and support long term planning.  While groups such as Women's Aid are now being recognised and receiving more funding it is essential that we support such organisations to retain their essentially voluntary ethos which has contributed to encouraging women to seek help and end the violence they faced in their homes.</P>
    <P>Barnardos will receive a special grant of £40,000 to work with families, especially mothers who have not had access to women's groups and who are in particular need of support.  This is based on a number of pilot projects.  In this International Year of the Family I consider such projects invaluable.</P>
    <P>We will be supporting a major seminar to be held sometime towards the end of April in Clifden that will look at the lessons that have been learned from the Proverty 3 programme, which looked at rural poverty.</P>
    <P>An additional £250,000 will be allocated <Col N="2024" /> to tackle the problems of money lending.  In addition, I am pleased to announce that an additional allocation of £100,000 has been allocated to the Combat Poverty Agency for pilot work with marginalised young people in the 14 to 17 age group in disadvantaged areas. Young people in the age group are often missed.  Taken in conjunction with the additional allocations made to my colleague in the Department of Health for grants to community based sporting organisations we can actually do a substantial amount for community groups working with young people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I will be discussing the programme in relation to 14 to 17 year olds with the Combat Poverty Agency and we hope to have a series of programmes working in a number of areas which have been identified already by the agency.</P>
    <P>The budget strikes a balance between economic growth and social justice.  As a member of the Labour Party I am proud to support it.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the Opposition like to attack the budget merely because they are in Opposition. Naturally there are certain elements of the budget that I am pleased with but I have reservations about others.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Burton is the Minister who met a deputation of workers from the AIBP meat plant in Rathkeale, I trust she is aware that the work they are doing is of a casual nature and I hope the Minister will take an opportunity to address this matter in the proposed social welfare legislation next April.  This is a serious cause for concern to the workers.  Before I refer to roads, an issue which is pertinent to every public representative, I will deal with the county enterprise boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his budget last February placed great emphasis on the <Col N="2025" /> county enterprise boards.  At that time he promised that £25 million would be set aside for those boards.  He said also that commitments had been given which he anticipated would be honoured that £100 million would be provided by the financial institutions.  There was a long gestation process before the county enterprise boards came to fruition but eventually, in September 1993, the boards were notified of its membership.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Limerick County Enterprise Board I know that our board met immediately and initiated a process which had entrepreneurs from County Limerick applying for county enterprise grants.  At that time I could see the spirit of true job creation being fulfilled.  In the past, many of these people were precluded from grant aid, perhaps because they belonged to certain service type industries in a small community.  There was great enthusiasm, evaluation committees met and the information was furnished to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I understand that at the end of last year a total of £3.4 million was earmarked for projects approved by the county enterprise boards.  In this year's Estimates £9 million has been provided but I do not see it further extended in the budget.  This funding is totally inadequate for the county enterprise boards.  If one is serious about job creation, this is a classic example of where money could be invested wisely.  So far county enterprise boards, with the exception of Galway city and county enterprise boards, have not taken up the funds because it is not possible for them to do so.  What is going on? The Minister said in the budget last year the £25 million had been allocated and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment announced last September that he had allocated £9 million for the January to December period.  A certain amount of financial manipulation appears to be taking place.  I wish somebody would come clean so that county enterprise boards would know what funding they will have for the current year.  From the evidence to date there will be much interest in the county enterprise boards <Col N="2026" /> which I would not like to see stifled due to a lack of funding.</P>
    <P>Another issue which concerns us is county roads.  At a meeting of the council last week, lasting four hours, much debate took place on county roads.  Contributors from all over the county explained their difficulties.  I assured everybody at the meeting that the Minister, in his budget, would be extremely conscious of the need to provide adequate funding to enable national and county roads to be improved.  While I welcome the provision of £15 million as a step in the right direction, when it is distributed counties will end up with approximately £500,000.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council has identified that about 39 per cent of the county roads are in a serious condition.  In my electoral area 50 per cent of the roads are in a serious condition.  We have an acute problem.  I would have thought, in view of the imminence of the European elections when canvassers will use those roads, that adequate funding would be provided.  I detect a level of public aggression owing to the condition of the roads.  Many public representatives have experienced that aggression.  People who pay road tax feel particularly aggrieved.</P>
    <P>At a recent committee meeting when I asked the Minister for the Environment whether the road tax collected at national level should be pumped back into the roads, he smiled and said &ldquo;It goes into the national cake&rdquo;.  His flippant response was to ask whether health, social welfare and other areas should be deprived of funds.  People in certain parts of my constituency are talking about protests and withholding road tax.  That is symptomatic of the frustration at local level. The sum of £15 million is not adequate. I had said to people that because of the success of the amnesty possibly a large amount of that funding, on a once off basis, would be pumped into country roads.  I read recently that people in County Longford &mdash; the home at the Taoiseach &mdash; are talking about protesting and marching on Dublin because of their opposition to what is happening.  County engineers estimate that it would take <Col N="2027" /> approximately £22.5 million to restore our roads to their former glory.  I am not optimistic when I hear this and I think pot-hole politics will continue into the future.</P>
    <P>I recall attending a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs at which my party protested vigorously at the introduction of the probate tax.  We were assured that a small amount of revenue would be collected but we pressed the Minister not to proceed with this tax.  I am pleased that he has seen the wisdom of our advice and has responded to the pressure groups.  I compliment the farming groups for insisting that the probate tax be amended or abolished altogether.  My party believes it is a death tax.  It is iniquitous and unjust.  I compliment also the Irish Country Women's Association on their national campaign to ensure that all Deputies are familiar with this tax and their hostility to it.  It is a step in the right direction that spouses are not affected directly by the probate tax.  I ask the Minister to go all the way and to abolish it.</P>
    <P>There are many towns in my constituency with a strong historical perspective and many old buildings.  I would like to see the urban renewal scheme extended because it would enhance the character of those towns.  I welcome the fact that the scheme has been extended in this budget to many towns throughout the country but I am disappointed that no town in County Limerick is included. It is an excellent mechanism for improving communities and giving encouragement to improve many old buildings.</P>
    <P>We protested strongly last year at the imposition of the 1 per cent levy.  We are pleased that it has been abolished.  The Labour Party said it would only be in existence for a year.  When you consider the income tax buoyancy of last year when the yield was £149 million in excess of that anticipated and the yield from the 1 per cent levy, which amounted to £79 million, I wonder whether all the pain and hostility was worthwhile.  Its removal is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> We are often accused of opposition for opposition sake.  I would like to think that on occasion we put forward constructive suggestions and that when the Government has made a mistake they recognise it and make an amendment as necessary. I recall an occasion in Private Members' time when we pointed out the folly of imposing VAT on the clothing and footwear industry.  In the past year many clothing industries went to the wall, many of which were household names.  That was regrettable.</P>
    <P>There is much emphasis on training courses and developments to help people return to work.  By getting involved in the communities and various training courses they enhance their employment prospects. Where we have labour intensive industries we should put mechanisms in place to alleviate the type of problems we have experienced, for instance in the clothing and footwear industries.  If there had been a suitable response at the time of the Private Members' motion we could have saved jobs in the past year.</P>
    <P>The problems we have in maintaining county roads are understandable.  Since 1980, to effect economies, successive Governments have introduced rationalisation packages which resulted in the phasing out of road workers who opened up culverts to drain water of the roads although this problem is very evident as a result of recent heavy rainfall.  The number of road workers on county roads has been halved and we are now paying the price.</P>
    <P>If we want to create a mechanism for true job creation we should look at local authorities.  In Limerick County Council there were over 300 road workers in 1980 and now there are 150 road workers.  Was the rationalisation package worthwhile? Are we now paying the price as we cannot maintain many of our county roads, open culverts to let the water off, cut hedges or clean dykes?  We are trying to sell Ireland as a green country which is environmentally friendly.  I shudder to think what walkers will see on many of our county roads and the image of the country they would have.  It would cost <Col N="2029" /> marginally more to take a person from the social welfare system and provide him with a worthwhile job in a local authority. This is an area in which we could have innovation with regard to expanding the workforce and improving the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most pressing problem facing us is unemployment.  We have almost 300,000 people unemployed, the greatest number of people ever unemployed in the history of the State. The budget does not address the problem in the short or medium terms although some provisions may affect employment in the long term.  However, this time next year I fear that we will be looking at a scenario in which there will be 310,000 people unemployed.</P>
      <P>The budget provided an opportunity to do something radical about unemployment, to remove barriers to employment in our taxation system.  Apart from some welcome concessions in PRSI for lower paid workers, generally speaking there is little incentive to employers to employ people.  The Minister missed a marvellous opportunity although he had something like £300 million with which to manoeuvre.  He spread it across the Departments to keep people happy and to satisfy interest groups but he did not face up to the real problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my role as spokesperson on tourism I am concerned about a number of things. The economist, Paul Tansey, said that about one in every 13 of those at work here owe their jobs directly or indirectly to tourism, that tourism employment which accounts for 13.4 per cent of all services employment increased by 31,000 to 87,000 between 1986 and 1991, providing 70 per cent of the increase in total employment in that period.  He went on to say that tourism was a major source of foreign exchange earnings since the 1980s and that it has acted as a powerful stabilising force in the overall balance of payments.  He said that between 1986 and 1992 tourism earned us almost £2.5 billion in foreign exchange and made significant inroads on the almost £4.7 million deficit returned by other services <Col N="2030" /> sectors over the same period.  Tourism is an unseen but powerful instrument of regional policy and assists in raising incomes and providing employment in the poorest regions.</P>
    <P>Provisions in the budget will help tourism but they did not go far enough to help an industry that is targeted now with providing 35,000 jobs over the next five years.  A great case can be made for more expenditure on tourism and we should have taken the opportunity in the budget to do that.</P>
    <P>Tourism as we know it, serves as a stimulus to small business investment along the lines indicated in the recent Culliton report, in crafts, guesthouses and retail outlets which specialise for the tourism market.  The small scale nature of these businesses facilitate ease of entry to business and serves as an encouragement to entrepreneurs to establish their own businesses, thereby creating employment.  The extent to which tourism contributes to the various sectors of our economy can be illustrated by examples relating to its link with the agricultural sector.  If 20 per cent of a total of three million visitors to this country eat one steak here, it would create a demand for approximately 21,000 beef cattle. That would be equivalent to almost 10 per cent of the beef herd slaughtered for domestic consumption.  If such visitors consumed two rashers a day it would create a demand for over 100,000 pigs just to fill breakfast orders.  These are just two simple examples of how the tourist industry impacts on other sectors of the economy.  Several small projects submitted by county enterprise boards seem to be held up on the Minister's desk due to lack of finance.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, I appeal to the Minister to ensure they are approved as soon as possible.  I am a member of a county enterprise board &mdash; I do not want to make a big issue of this &mdash; and I supported the concept of such boards when others criticised it.  They are democratic and, more than any other agency, have a great potential.  Unless those who have been recommended for grant-aid receive confirmation shortly they will lose confidence <Col N="2031" /> both in the board and in the system under which they applied for grants.  Some very good projects have been submitted by individuals who believe they can exploit opportunities and fill a niche in the market.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that they are approved as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I now turn to the provisions in the budget relating to the tourism industry.  There is a need to make additional funding available for marketing.  In this regard I welcome the fact that £5 million has been allocated in the budget for this purpose. In 1985, £35 million was spent on marketing but last year only £22 million was spent.  This has an effect on the American market where the numbers are declining. At this time, for example, we have no representative in California, north of Los Angeles, in places like Silicon Valley where there is goodwill towards Ireland and we are doing well in terms of industry, to promote and sell this country as a tourist destination.  That is the feed back I am getting from travel agents.</P>
      <P>The American market was always a good one for Ireland but because of a lack of funding we have no presence on the ground.  I should also point out to the Minister that out of every $600 spent in America promoting foreign travel less than $1 is spent promoting Ireland.  Is it any wonder therefore that Americans are not travelling here in the same numbers? Furthermore, our share of the number of American tourists who visit Europe has declined by 8 per cent.  This has been a gradual process during the past few years. If we are to win back our share of the American market we will have to carry out an extensive marketing campaign in America.  Before Christmas £3 million was allocated for this purpose.  I hope that this money will be used wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> It should not be forgotten that we have a market of 55 million people right on our doorstep, the British market which, traditionally, has been our best market. Admittedly, most of the visitors from Britain are returning emigrants but they are classified as tourists.  Our share of the British market is only 4 per cent, the same as Portugal and Cyprus.  I am convinced, particularly if progress is made in the peace process in Northern Ireland, that we could double this figure rather easily with a little bit of effort, from 1.3 million to 2.5 million.  British visitors would find several of our attractions very interesting; they come from a similar climate, they are interested in culture and heritage and in a range of outdoor activities such as sea fishing, angling, boating, cruising, sailing and so on.  Walking has also become very popular in England.  We should exploit this market to the full if we are to create 35,000 jobs in this sector.</P>
    <P>At this time our share of the German market is 1 per cent; in other words, 230,000 people out of the total of 26 million who leave Germany every summer on holidays visit this country. Traditionally, the German tourist has been a big spender.  We should also target that country for a major marketing campaign.</P>
    <P>The improvement in capital allowances for the hotel sector which will enable hotels to write off capital expenditure over a seven year period rather than ten years as is the case at present is most welcome.  Between 1978 and 1989 hotels could avail of annual allowances of 100 per cent.  This was a major incentive to invest and reinvest in the nation's accommodation stock and related plant.  In the Finance Act, 1989 accelerated allowances were phased out.  I hope yesterday's announcement will mark a return to the previous position which undoubtedly encouraged investment in hotels with consequential job creation. In addition, the reduction in employer's PRSI and in the amount of tax paid by employees will prove beneficial for hotels and guesthouses which employ part-time and seasonal employees.</P>
    <P>The subsidised loans scheme for small <Col N="2033" /> businesses should be welcomed.  It is important to ensure that many tourism operators are eligible to avail of the scheme.  On the question of gift and inheritance tax, the more favourable reliefs should greatly facilitate the transfer of family businesses.  Again, this is important for the majority of Irish hotels which are family owned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the increases in excise duties.  Many people come to Ireland because they like to sample our drink, especially Guinness.  It appears that we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  Yesterday Deputy Yates emphasised forcibly that this will have an impact on our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> other destinations.  We already have the highest rates of tax on drink in Europe, 50 times greater than the rate in France, 16 times greater than the rate in Germany and almost double the rate in the United Kingdom.  In addition, the increase of 10p on a bottle of wine will not facilitate some of our restaurants.  The increase on petrol will not help.  While there are some positive features so far as the tourism industry is concerned the increases in excise duties will make us less competitive.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas £3 million was allocated to the Department of Tourism and Trade for marketing.  Yesterday a further £5 million was allocated to that Department for the same purpose.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who is present, should tell us where Bord Fáilte fits into this equation. Does this represent a vote of no confidence in Bord Fáilte?  Is it no longer responsible for marketing Ireland?  Is the Department of Tourism and Trade now marketing this country?  That question must be answered given that Bord Fáilte is demoralised because of a lack of funding. Recently I carried out a survey and Bord Fáilte did not come out of it very well but this was understandable given that it has not been allocated sufficient finance to fund a proper marketing programme. As a result it has had to bear the brunt of the criticism.  This is unfair.</P>
    <P>Yesterday £15 million was allocated for the county road network.  While this <Col N="2034" /> is welcome and will lead to some improvements there are for example 2,400 miles of county roads in County Kerry 50 per cent of which is about to disintegrate.  Recently the county engineer estimated that it would cost up to £24 million to bring these roads up to standard.  One can see just how derisory the sum of £15 million is.  I should point out to the Minister that most tourists travel to our tourist attractions by way of the county road network.  It is vital, therefore, in order to raise the morale of those involved in the tourism industry, that these roads are brought up to standard and that the problems are addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is about enterprise and employment.  It is about creating the framework within which we can stimulate economic growth so as to create wealth and produce jobs.  The budget has been carefully designed.  It is the product of considerable deliberation by the Government in the past couple of months.  However, it is only a part of the Government's overall economic strategy. It has to be seen in the context of the Programme for a Partnership Government and the action that has been taken consistently in the year since this Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months ago the European currency system was in turmoil and interest rates were out of control.  Many Irish companies, particularly small firms, were in crisis.  Jobs were being lost and businesses were being threatened with extinction. It is hard now to contrast the reality of last year with the position of today. The 1993 budget was designed to restore confidence and to provide stability within the public finances so as to ensure a base upon which economic growth and job creation could commence.  The mission of last year's budget has been achieved with considerable success.  The mark of that achievement is that the 1 per cent income levy, which was an income levy on employment and was introduced as a temporary measure in 1993, has now been removed.  To the Deputies departing the Chamber who referred to the <Col N="2035" /> difficulty and the pain that was caused by that levy I would say that the pain was worthwhile.  The stability within the economy today would not have been possible without the framework of last year's budget, including the levy.  We are now in a position to move forward and this budget gives us the instruments to ensure that real and substantial progress can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Enterprises with fewer than 50 persons account for around half of the private sector workforce outside agriculture. Seventy-five per cent of all jobs created in the European Union between 1989 and 1992 were in small and medium-sized enterprises.  Over this period job creation in small firms and particularly in very small enterprises with as few as ten employees exceeded their employment share in terms of the numbers of jobs created.  By contrast large and medium-sized firms suffered a decline in their share of total employment.</P>
    <P>Last year I spoke at the annual lunch of the Small Firms Association in the Burlington Hotel.  In the previous two months I had identified with them many of the concerns which small Irish businesses had experienced during the currency crisis and the economic difficulties they had to endure at that time.  They complained bitterly that nobody would listen to them.  I said at that lunch that we would listen and I invited them to set down what they felt was needed for enterprise to thrive and prosper.  In particular I wanted to hear what small businesses needed from Government in order to help them prosper, grow and create employment.  The taskforce for small businesses, comprising actual business persons, practitioners at the coal face, grew out of that meeting and made a detailed presentation to the Minister for Finance through me before this budget was drawn up.  Many of the things they asked for have now become a reality.</P>
    <P>This is an enterprise budget which will specifically do the following things at the request of business in Ireland.  There are too many to mention them all, but let me list some of them.  Capital gains tax will <Col N="2036" /> be reduced from 40 per cent to 27 per cent; risk is now being taxed at the same standard rate of income tax as employment and no distinction is being made. That is a clear signal to small businesses and to risk-takers in our society.  Capital acquisitions tax has been modified to help family-owned businesses to survive and to enable families to transfer ownership from one generation to another and maintain the vibrancy of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Another change that was sought for many years relates to sons and daughters working in the family business.  They were debarred from qualifying for the PAYE allowance.  They will now be given the same tax allowances as other members of the staff working in the family business.</P>
    <P>Compliance with VAT regulations will now be based on actual cash receipts rather than the invoices notified, considerably easing cashflow problems for many firms, particularly firms with incomes of less than £250,000.  The VAT thresholds for small businesses have been significantly raised so that some businesses have been taken out of the system altogether.  Finally, employer PRSI costs in labour-intensive industries such as clothing and footwear have been significantly reduced and a clear 3 per cent has been taken off the payroll cost.</P>
    <P>All these changes were sought by people in the field who felt they had been wasting their time talking about it because nobody was listening.  They have now got what they want.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, said yesterday these changes have been made in the confidence that the small business sector will respond and that the community at large will benefit from enhanced wealth and enhanced employment prospects.</P>
    <P>There is more for small businesses in this budget.  The income tax changes will make employment a more attractive option for many people.  These measures address many of the specific issues identified by the business community and they will go a long way towards addressing the problems which they have asked us to deal with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> Another major factor identified by the taskforce was the need for access to working capital.  This was identified repeatedly as perhaps the toughest barrier of all which prevented businesses from surviving and certainly from prospering and growing.  This budget uniquely provides for an enterprise fund of £100 million which will be made available to small and medium-sized businesses on terms and conditions which never previously existed.  I believe this measure will have a substantial effect on both the creation of new long term jobs and on the stabilisation of existing employment.  As a measure of its importance we are making £100 million available in long term loans at low fixed interest rates to small businesses. I want to emphasise three elements that are of critical importance and which have been long sought after. First, the loans will be at low rates of interest.  Second, those rates will be fixed for a ten-year duration.  The rate at which loans will be available is 6.75 per cent. This rate will be guaranteed for the first £30 million borrowed and we expect, on the advice of both the ICC and the National Treasury Management Agency, that the rates available for the balance of the £70 million will not vary significantly from the figure of 6.75 per cent.  With the introduction of these loans we are responding to the express needs of small businesses, as suggested in the preliminary proposals of the taskforce.  This, in addition, is consistent with the recommendations of the Moriarty taskforce which looked at the recommendations of the famous Culliton Committee, particularly in relation to the area of commercial finance.</P>
    <P>The duration of the scheme will be ten years.  Loan repayments will be fixed at the outset of the loan and this will mean that small businesses will no longer be at the mercy of fluctuating interest rates. They will be able to plan with certainty a significant part of their business.  This will provide encouragement for many small Irish businesses to develop.  In addition, no repayments will be made in the first two years and this additional assistance will provide an opportunity for <Col N="2038" /> projects to overcome the initial stages of development when they are at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer's contribution is to subsidise the interest rate which is being made available.  This subsidy will be 3 per cent of the loans outstanding and I have further ensured that there will be no personal guarantees attaching to these loans. This removes a major threat that has hung over the small business entrepreneur for many years.  Deputies will be more than familiar with the reality that while people can get access to working capital from their banks the terms and conditions are simply unacceptable to them and their families.  An additional benefit of this scheme is that no personal guarantee will be required from the borrower when doing business with ICC. The scheme will be administered by the Industrial Credit Corporation and operate within guidelines laid down by my Department.  Funds for the loans will be raised by the Industrial Credit Corporation and all credit risks will be borne by the Industrial Credit Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 10 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is participating actively and constructively in the development and implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union.  The provisions of Title V of the Maastricht Treaty, on which the CFSP is founded, were designed to enable the member states of the Union to develop their co-operation on foreign and security policy issues and to permit the Union to play a more coherent role in international affairs commensurate with its standing and responsibilities in the world.</P>
      <P>As a result of the detailed preparatory work carried out between the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in February 1992 and its entry into force on 1 November last year &mdash; work in which Irish representatives, including the Taoiseach and myself were fully involved &mdash; the Council of Ministers were able to act immediately on the entry into force of the treaty to adopt joint actions on humanitarian aid to Bosnia; the sending of European Union observers to the elections in Russia; support for the transition towards a democratic and multi-racial South Africa and the launching of an initiative for a security pact in Europe.  Joint actions in relation to the Middle East peace plan are also under consideration.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the speech made by the President of the Commission to the Institute of International Strategic Studies in Brussels.  He was speaking in his own name and not expressing a position agreed by the member states of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> The Maastricht Treaty makes special provision, under Article J4, for issues arising under the CFSP which have defence implications.  Such issues may be referred to the Western European Union for elaboration and implementation. Ireland has become an observer to the Western European Union and regularly attends meetings of the Western European Union in that capacity.  As an observer we do not participate in Western European Union decisions and observer status does not require us to undertake any mutual defence commitments or military obligations under the Brussels Treaty establishing the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Discussions on the scope and content of a future common defence policy and on the question of a common defence are for further negotiations.  The treaty specifically provides for an intergovernmental conference in 1996 to review the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The results of these negotiations will have to be agreed unanimously by all the member states.  As stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to putting the outcome of any future negotiation that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>I have already made clear to this House that there is a need for a full and informed discussion of the question of European security and defence in the light of the ongoing developments in this area and in preparation for the intergovernmental conference.  I am considering the possibility of publishing a document on the matter.  I expect that the discussions of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will also make an important and substantial contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste gave a very woolly reply to a specific question.  I asked him to elaborate on his opinion in respect of the implementation of a common foreign and security policy and the role he would like to see played by Ireland particularly as we are a signatory of the European <Col N="2041" /> Union.  Will he agree that his statement today conflicts with statements made outside this House during the last Dáil session by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who indicated that we will line up with neutral members such as Sweden and Austria and play our role in ensuring that military neutrality is not interfered with in the context of a common foreign and security policy arrangement under the treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, there is need for a full and informed discussion on the question of European security and defence and it is timely that we should publish a document on those matters.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which has been very active since its establishment, will have a major role to play.  Obviously, consideration must be given to such matters prior to the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  I had discussions with officials in my Department in relation to the best format for such a discussion document.  I said previously in this House that it is important the Irish people are well informed on fundamental matters in terms of security and defence because of the many changes in recent years in relation to European security and the widespread debate in many European countries on European defence matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The desire of the people of this island for lasting peace and for genuine political progress is palpable. Both objectives are intimately linked, in the Government's view, and our commitment to the achievement of both is total.</P>
      <P>We are ready to explore all avenues which hold out the prospect of making genuine progress towards a political settlement of the Northern Ireland problem. We regard the peace process as a prelude to comprehensive political negotiations, not a substitute.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have made clear on many occasions our desire to see talks resume at the earliest opportunity, involving the Irish and British Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland.  We believe that the goal set for the talks, namely to achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the people of these islands, remains valid and achievable.  Talks would of course have greatly enhanced prospects of success in a climate of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, for our part, are ready to enter such talks without preconditions.  The timing of a fresh round of talks must, <Col N="2044" /> however, remain a matter of uncertainty until such time as the Unionist parties can be persuaded to come to the table.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in Dublin tomorrow, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I will have an opportunity to consider the outlook for fresh talks.  This question has been under discussion between us for the past year and both Governments have been preparing our positions for a possible resumption of talks.</P>
    <P>The best chance of securing a successful outcome to new talks lies in preserving their confidentiality.  Accordingly, I do not believe it would be helpful at this stage for the Government to make public the position which we intend to take at future negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is now some six weeks since the Joint Declaration was signed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  During that period, the Irish Government has spared no effort to ensure that the declaration's contents are understood, and its historic significance appreciated, by the widest possible audience in Ireland, North and South, and indeed internationally.  We have sought to highlight the central idea behind the Declaration, which is that the problems of Northern Ireland, however deep and intractable, have to be resolved exclusively by political and democratic means.  The Declaration offers a political framework which is meaningful and fair for both traditions, and removes any possible basis for the claim that violence can somehow be justified because of a lack of political alternative.</P>
    <P>We have also taken every opportunity to stress the very real recognition and protection which the declaration affords to both traditions in Ireland, nationalism and unionism.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have been in close and continuous contact on all matters relating to the Declaration and its follow-up, including through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference will afford a further opportunity for joint consultation on the reactions to date, on the outlook for the <Col N="2045" /> future and on the options open to the two Governments.</P>
    <P>We hope that all parties will accept the declaration as a framework for peace and that violence will be abandoned forever in favour of an exclusive commitment to the political process, leading to comprehensive negotiations involving the full spectrum of political opinion on the island.</P>
    <P>We hope in particular that the paramilitary organisations on both sides will respond positively to the opportunity which now exists to turn away from the violence which has caused so much human suffering on all sides, and which achieves nothing other than to deepen already bitter divisions and put off the goal of reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>It was of course accepted at the outset that the Declaration raised fundamental issues and that it was reasonable patience and time should be allowed for full consideration of it.  It is equally reasonable, however, to make clear that that period cannot be indefinite.  The Governments will not allow the momentum of the declaration, or its great potential for the future, to be lost, particularly in view of the support expressed for it by the broad mainstream of both traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the long established policy of the Government regarding talks with groups which engage in or support the use of violence for political ends.  The declaration itself makes clear the view of both Governments that political dialogue on the way ahead should involve only &ldquo;democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards the Government's position on the Forum, I refer Deputies to the various statements made by the Taoiseach to the Dáil on this issue, most recently during Question Time yesterday. One of the most valuable functions such a Forum could fulfil would be to enable democratic parties on the island to take stock of the new possibilities for advancing the process of healing and reconciliation which would open up in the wake of a total cessation of violence. I do not think it useful at this stage to <Col N="2046" /> speculate what position the Government might adopt on the issue if we are disappointed in our hope of a shift towards the peaceful resolution of differences among Irish people, which is so fervently desired by the vast majority of the people living on the island.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that one of the problems in creating trust on this island is that the overall appreciation of the two communities as to what is possible in terms of a Northern settlement should be publicly known? Will he agree that it is most unhelpful for people to speak in terms of the process being open to virtually any outcome when that may convey to some people that there is a risk of wholly improbable outcomes being pressed for by one side or another in the negotiations?  Would it not be more sensible for the Dublin Government to indicate that it accepts that, for the foreseeable future, Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom and that the substance of the negotiations must be within that context, first, how there should be linkages between the North and the South and, second, how Northern Ireland can be radically transformed internally to make it a place open to Nationalist participation and aspirations?  Will the Tánaiste not agree that we do damage constantly by failing to address that political reality and posturing as if anything could happen as a result of these negotiations when we know in our hearts that the ballpark within which a settlement lies is much more clearly defined than some of the rhetoric used by politicians suggests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I assumed office and took responsibility for dealing with this matter, working with the Government we have been reasonable and sensible in our approach to tackling the difficult <Col N="2047" /> problem of Northern Ireland.  I have said today that we are prepared to enter talks without any pre-conditions.  It is important that we should try to keep an open approach because there is a danger in setting out what one sees as a solution to the problem in that one may automatically exclude people on either side of the divide.</P>
      <P>The problem of Northern Ireland has been stated many times in this House and outside.  The problems are extremely complex and at times seem intractable. As Deputy McDowell said, it is extremely important to build up trust between the constitutional parties on this island.  A certain amount was achieved in the course of the talks that took place in 1992 but maybe not all that one set out to achieve was achieved.  Deputy McDowell is familiar with some of the circumstances.  However, progress was made.  During the past 12 months a level of trust has been established between parties and politicians on this island which did not exist previously.  I hope that gives us a foundation to be optimistic in relation to making progress for the future.  It is extremely important that the politicians on this island &mdash; hopefully all politicians on this island &mdash; committing themselves to non-violent and democratic solutions to our problems, will come to the table as soon as possible to see if we can make progress in terms of establishing the peace and reconciliation we all want.</P>

      <P>In view of the Tánaiste's recent statement that there is a possibility that talks will get underway without the involvement of Sinn Féin if they do not come to a decision in relation to the Declaration, will he indicate the basis of such talks?  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Declaration would not be the basis of three stranded talks, but would be complementary to them.  In that event, there is a commitment in the Declaration to changing the Irish Constitution in the context of a general agreement or, to use the phrase, &ldquo;part of a balanced constitutional accommodation&rdquo;. <Col N="2048" /> Is that now the Government's position?  If so, it supersedes the Government's position in the previous set of talks where there was an inability on the part of the Government at that time to give a commitment on the possibility of changing the Irish Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clear to the Deputy from the many statements made by the Taoiseach and me during the course of the past 12 months that in the context of discussions taking place and looking for an overall framework within which to make progress, obviously the constitutional question must be considered. One would hope that the round of talks taking place within Northern Ireland at present will clearly establish a framework for the recommencement of talks within Northern Ireland.  The Declaration of 15 December added a new momentum to the process.  The search for talks and the Declaration are complementary and I hope we can recommence talks, with all parties participating.  There is a political momentum on this island and one must not lose sight of the fact that the contents and aspirations of the Declaration would appear to be supported by the majority of the people on this island.</P>

      <P>The Government of EI Salvador has requested the United Nations to verify the elections and I understand that the United Nations <Col N="2049" /> Electoral Assistance Unit will shortly be issuing invitations to States, including Ireland, to send observers to the EI Salvador elections.  I will propose that the Government responds positively to this invitation.</P>
      <P>As regards the possibility of making a financial contribution to electoral education, the United Nations has informed me that it does not intend to get involved in this area.  The United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit is of the view that there is adequate experience available in EI Salvador on the holding of elections. On this basis, I feel that the limited financial resources available to the development aid programme should be directed to priority areas.</P>
      <P>The use of political violence in El Salvador and the recent killing of candidates in the forthcoming elections are matters of great concern to the Government. With our partners in the European Union we have condemned these incidents and have taken the matter up directly with the El Salvadorean authorities.  The murders are currently under investigation by the United Nations.  Members of the European Union have sent representatives of their police forces to assist the UN Observer Mission and the authorities in El Salvador in the conduct of these investigations.</P>

Regarding the postelectoral situation will the Tánaiste outline how this country could assist El Salvador by way of direct financial assistance when the new democracy one hopes will be formed as a result of the peace process will be in place?  In view of the fact that we have been involved, by way of contributions through the EU in the peace process, will the Minister say what contributions we will make to this country after the elections?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 13, 23, 41, 56 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Last July, in fulfilment of the commitments on development assistance contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I launched a strategy plan entitled &ldquo;Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth&rdquo;.  The strategy plan charts the ways in which an expanded aid programme could provide greater assistance and give economic and technical support to people in developing countries.  It identifies new countries as the target for Irish aid, new programmes and new channels for the expanded programme. In addition, it emphasises the importance of co-operation and the free flow of ideas between the Government and the non-governmental aid community in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to report that substantial progress has been made since last July in implementing the recommendations of the strategy plan.  The necessary arrangements are being made to translate the increased spending on ODA into real action on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal actions to date are as follows.  Development co-operation offices are being set up in two new priority countries &mdash; Ethiopia and Uganda.  We have personnel out there on the ground setting up the offices and finalising detailed plans for an Irish aid <Col N="2052" /> programme in those two countries.  There will be a further official level visit next month to Mozambique to set in place assistance towards rehabilitation projects in that country.  Programmes in the existing priority countries &mdash; Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan and Lesotho &mdash; are being expanded.  In addition to extending existing activities, new districts and sectors have been identified and selected on the basis of where need is greatest.  Other targets of Irish aid include Somalia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and suitable projects in these countries are being identified for Irish aid funding.  Officials from my Department are in discussion with the major voluntary agencies such as Goal, Concern and Trócaire to devise new co-financing arrangements with them.  The Government has established a new advisory body on ODA &mdash; the Irish Aid Advisory Committee.  The committee is to provide independent advice on matters relating to development co-operation. It has met twice and will meet again next week.  Plans are under way for a meeting of a national forum on development aid to take place in April or May.  The forum will provide an opportunity for NGOs and other interested groups to put forward views on the Irish aid programme as well as allowing for consideration of broader aid issues.  A recent mission by officials of my Department to the Occupied Territories identified a number of projects in Gaza and the West Bank for immediate assistance for the first year's budget of US$1 million as promised at the Washington Conference last October.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, had a successful mission to Vietnam and Cambodia in November and projects such as clearing of mine hazards as well as power generation have been identified for assistance by us.  An increase in funding for emergency relief in 1994 will enable Ireland to respond promptly and effectively to disasters as they occur.  As promised, a review of the refugee agency got under way at the end of 1993 and is nearing completion.  A review of development education was recently carried out and a number of structural changes <Col N="2053" /> are being considered.  One of the major initiatives in the Programme for a Partnership Government is the mandate which has been given to APSO to expand the scope of its activities and to increase the number of Irish people working in developing countries.  APSO will receive funding of £7 million in 1994 compared with £4 million in 1993.  The envisaged number of placements is 900 in 1994, a significant increase on the 450 placements in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Vote for International Co-operation in the Abridged Book of Estimates for 1994 reflects the Government's pledge to increase Ireland's spending on ODA.  The overall cash increase in ODA for 1994 will be in the order of £17 million. This means that over two years the spending on ODA will be increased by £30 million.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government has put ODA back firmly in a position of prominence in terms of international issues facing the Government. The strategy plan is well under way and I am confident that we will continue to make progress in enacting all of its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy plan is quite detailed in that it identifies what needs to be done and the problem areas, but it is not very specific on how this country will set about alleviating the problem.  The Minister mentioned Mozambique and said that Ireland could participate in the rehabilitation programmes on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and could explore the feasibility of establishing a full scale bilateral assistance programme in Mozambique.  It has become clear&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to ask a question. It has become clear that plans are under way for rehabilitiation in Mozambique. Would it not be appropriate to consider Mozambique as a priority country for our bilateral aid programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2054" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The question involved in establishing our programmes is one of priorities.  We had a very strong commitment to four African countries and we have increased that number by two. Obviously there are other cases where we can get involved on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The commitment of the Government is second to none in terms of ensuring that, in co-operation with the NGOs and other organisations, we fulfil our international obligations.  The question of Mozambique &mdash; we already discussed this issue in the House &mdash; is a very difficult one.  We have said we will consider the position in Mozambique to see where we can best give help and I will keep that matter under consideration.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the reports from the Irish-Mozambique solidarity group which call for the putting into practice of new models for emergency aid delivery.  That matter is under examination at present.  Where possible we will be willing to improve and learn from the lessons of the last decade in terms of our aid programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that an official delegation from his Department visited Mozambique.  Will he give a little more information on that visit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can provide all the details in relation to that visit.  Senior officials of my Department visited Mozambique recently to look at the position on the ground and had discussions with the NGOs there with a view to finding the best way Ireland can contribute and assist the development of Mozambique.  I will make the details available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on keeping his promise to increase ODA this year.  It should go on the record that I, on behalf of my party, welcome the fact that that commitment is being maintained.  I put it to the Minister, as I did on a previous occasion, that the focus needs to be centered on the question of the debt of developing countries. There is a coalition of NGOs in Ireland who are specifically addressing <Col N="2055" /> that question.  Has the Minister met this coalition of NGOs and, if so, has he made any commitment to them in terms of the steps he intends to take at international level to press for a resolution of the debt problem of the developing countries?  It is this factor above any other which causes such misery and death in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the Deputy's remarks.  I and my Department are aware of the problems he has outlined arising from the burden of debt carried by many Third World countries.  This is a major issue for the world community and it has to be tackled on a global level.  I believe Ireland's role will be one to support the efforts of the main agencies through which the problem is addressed for example, the World Bank and the International Monetary fund &mdash; and to argue for a fair hearing for developing countries.</P>
      <P>Given the level of crisis faced by Third World countries, I have to say on the experience of the last ten to 15 years, that we are probably no nearer to a solution to their massive problems than we were ten to 15 years ago.  From our discussions, I know the European Union is very conscious of the support necessary and obviously consideration has to be given to writing off the debts of the poorest Third World countries.  These problems require a global response.  Obviously we have to target our aid programmes to the areas where they can be of help, and I and my European colleagues are mindful of the need to address this issue in a global way.  I have not met representatives of the organisations involved but I would be willing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the speed and accuracy of the distribution of aid from developed countries to the Third World, with particular reference to the possibility of aid falling into the hands of military groups, etc.?  Has he used his good offices with his counterparts in the various developed countries <Col N="2056" /> which supply arms, ammunition and, in particular, landmines to the countries in question with a view to getting them to desist this practice?  It seems ridiculous that a country could send a lorry load of aid to a country on one flight and a lorry load of munitions and landmines on another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised two very succinct points with which I will deal separately.  It is extremely important that we seek to ensure to the best of our ability that aid arrives at its target.  We have all read about difficulties in this area in the past, and we have had some experience of it.  Obviously all the international agencies strive to ensure that the aid reaches those people who need it most. There have been problems in this respect from time to time, for example, in Somalia and in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>With regard to the supply of arms, there is a determined effort among developed countries to ensure that humanitarian aid is not given on the one hand and arms of destruction sold on the other.  This issue is very high on the agenda of the European Union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy plan refers to the possibility of moving beyond Africa, where most of our efforts are concentrated at present.  Of course, this has to do with limited resources.  Reference is made to extending aid to Asia, for example, Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh.  I see that a member of the Bangladesh Parliament has joined us in the Distinguished Visitor's Gallery.  Can the Minister give a timescale within which we might see an extension of the direct bilateral aid programme to countries in Asia, for example, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam?  Can he give a resumé of the Minister of State's recent visit to Cambodia and Vietnam?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an objective of the <Col N="2057" /> strategy plan that we would try to broaden our focus.  Despite the increase in overseas development aid and the fulfilling by the Government of its commitments in this regard, it is important to ensure that we focus our aid in a proper manner.  We have said we are prepared to look at new countries, such as Cambodia and Vietnam.  The Minister of State recently visited these countries and there are prospects of aid being directed towards them.  I hope we can do this within a very short time.  I also hope this matter can be discussed by the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which deals with overseas development aid, in the near future. At the same time I want to emphasise the importance of ensuring that our aid is directed towards those most in need.  We have built up a good volume of experience from our dealings on the African continent where, I think, our main focus will remain for the foreseeable future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="2059" /> Nos. 9, 28, 45, 49, 53 and 58 to 60, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The continuation of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the killings and wanton destruction there, are matters of the greatest concern to the Government. Ireland is fully engaged with our European Union partners in promoting a settlement.  We participate in the International Conference under the auspices of the European Union and the United Nations; we contribute to the UN Force, UNPROFOR, and to the European Union's Monitor Mission; we are implementing the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro; and we support the victims of the conflict.  At a national level we have recently made a further significant financial contribution of £500,000 to the international relief effort.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to believe that the best hope for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian conflict lies in the negotiations underway in the International Conference.  The Co-Chairmen, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, enjoy the full support of the Irish Government, and of the other members of the European Union who have expressed the hope that they will continue to offer their valuable services to the conference.</P>
      <P>Some progress has been made in the negotiations.  Last summer under the auspices of the Co-Chairmen the Bosnian parties developed a peace package acceptable to all three sides.  This included the concept of a Union of three constituent republics.  However, the subsequent detailed negotiations reached an impasse last autumn, particularly over the amount of territory to be assigned to the Muslim majority republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then Ireland and the other members of the European Union have been working to unblock this impasse. To this end the Union has developed a plan of action with three key elements: first, a settlement in Bosnia, building on the package already accepted in large measure by the Bosnian parties; second, interim arrangements in Croatia which would serve as a basis for a peaceful <Col N="2060" /> settlement there; and third, the improvement of the delivery of aid as envisaged under the European Union's joint action.</P>
    <P>In return for co-operation in the peace process, the EU indicated that it would be prepared to support a phased suspension of UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.  These sanctions, the most comprehensive set of measures ever imposed by the UN, include measures under which the assets of Serbia and Montengro have been frozen.  The Union has made it clear that this phased suspension will not be supported by the EU until Serbian implementation of a peace plan in Bosnia has been verified.  It has also been made clear to Croatia that lack of co-operation in the peace process would result in the imposition of sanctions on that State also.</P>
    <P>To underline the seriousness of its concern the Foreign Ministers of the Union met the parties to the conflict as well as the leaders of Serbia and Croatia on 29 November last and again on 22 December. We explained the plan in detail to the parties and pressed them to negotiate, within the conference, on this basis.  In particular, we pressed the Serbian side to make the necessary concessions to meet the demands of the Bosnian Government that one-third of the territory of Bosnia be assigned to the Muslim-majority republic.  This is now agreed in principle but the precise location of the territory has still to be settled.  The Union also demanded that the Bosnian Serbs should permit the immediate opening of Tuzla airport to enable relief supplies to get through.</P>
    <P>However, the elements of agreement and the pressure exerted by the European Union have not been sufficient to persuade the parties to end the war. Fighting continues in central Bosnia and Sarajevo continues to be shelled by the Bosnian Serbs.  The delivery of humanitarian aid continues to be blocked in certain areas and the Serbs refuse to allow Tuzla airport to be reopened.</P>
    <P>Faced with this situation there have been calls for the UN to use force, in particular air power, in Bosnia.  The relevant Resolutions of the Security Council <Col N="2061" /> authorise UNPROFOR to take all necessary measures, including the use of force, to achieve certain objectives in Bosnia. Clearly, however, the UN bears a particularly onerous responsibility in deciding on military action.  It must address several difficult and complex questions.  For what purpose should force be used?  Should it be used to get humanitarian aid through for more limited objectives, such as opening Tuzla airport, or only in self-defence? What of the likely outcome?  Would military action result in an escalation of the conflict?  Would it provoke attacks on UNPROFOR forcing its withdrawal? Could it break the consensus which has operated in the Security Council up to now?  I believe that these and other serious questions will need to be weighed carefully before any decision is taken on the use of military force in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>In addition to the calls for military action, there have been suggestions that the UN should pull out of Bosnia.  I could not advocate such a course.  UNPROFOR has, through its determined work in difficult circumstances, performed a vital function in Bosnia.  I hope that its mandate will be renewed in March when it is reviewed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The negotiations between the Bosnian parties are to resume early in February. Given that the military option is being pursued on the ground, no one could be overly optimistic about the possibilities for an early settlement.  I hope that this valuable opportunity for peace will not be lost and I believe that the European Union and the international community generally must continue to maintain political pressure on all the parties to arrive at an agreement.  To do otherwise would consign the suffering people of Bosnia to further misery and destruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as an freagra fada a thug sé dúinn.  Ba mhaith liom a rá freisin go n-aithním an obair ilghnéitheach atá déanta go dtí seo chun síocháin a bhaint amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the midst of all the background information I am anxious to know if the Minister accepts that Bosnia has suffered <Col N="2062" /> greatly.  I would argue it is the most injured party in the conflict and will have to relinquish the most territory in this three way plan.  In pursuing the peace process, would the Minister indicate whether the Government is considering the proposal to withdraw food aid to bring pressure on the Bosnians, particularly to accept the plan envisaged?  Does the Minister accept that Tuzla airport is not as endangered as some say given that UN flights are apparently able to get in and leave?  The suggestion has been made that food aid would not be able to get in. Is the Government clear, in pursuing the peace process, that it will not do so at the cost of humanitarian aid and it will not be used as a weapon to bring pressure, particularly on the Bosnians?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In a very difficult situation it is extremely important that all our efforts, and the humanitarian efforts of the international community, should be maintained despite the difficulties, the frustrations and the blockages, for example, in various locations of getting humanitarian relief through.  I do not believe that should be used as a weapon of war which is what it would amount to.</P>
      <P>In regard to who is carrying the most onerous task of the warring factions, for the past 12 months I have been involved in many discussions at European level and, indeed, at international level in relation to this conflict.  The parties are not very far apart in relation to the territorial divide.  We had a meeting on 22 December in Brussels with the leading parties and there was a prospect in the course of that day's negotiations that further agreement could be reached to bring the negotiations to a conclusion.  Unfortunately, that was not the outcome of those discussions.  The question of Tuzla airport was very much on the agenda that day because there is a strong feeling at both UN and European Union level that the opening of that airport would be of enormous benefit in relation to the provision of humanitarian aid.  We continue to press for access to Tuzla airport but it has not proved possible to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the conflict began the European <Col N="2063" /> Union has allocated a total of 690 million ECU in humanitarian assistance for relief operations.  The total amount in 1993 is 400 million ECU.  The European Union, and its member states, has been the largest contributor by far to assisting the international relief effort.  We have contributed between 60 and 70 per cent of aid and despite the difficulties and frustrations and, as Deputy Durkan said the aid falling into the wrong hands at times, we have an obligation to ensure that relief is brought to the many people in the former Yugoslavia who are suffering.</P>

      <P>First, would the Tánaiste agree that the European Parliament's apparent doubts about Lord Owen are not helpful and that if we are to make any progress continuity is preferable to changing jockeys at this late stage in the proceedings?  The Tánaiste said that the three parties were not far apart on the territorial issue.  Second, would he indicate whether it was conceded that the Muslim majority area of Bosnia was to have access to the Adriatic coast?  Third, in relation to the use of force, is he aware that the apparent position of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutrous Boutrous Ghali, is that he will only use force when called upon to do so by his envoy in Bosnia?  It would appear a consensus has not been in operation in the United Nations Security Council; the only consensus is to do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with the three component parts of Deputy McDowell's question.  First, in relation to the call from the members of the European Parliament on Lord Owen's position, on the one hand I can understand a certain sense of frustration, one we have all felt in dealing with this problem.  At the same time, in regard to my dealings with him at meetings and briefings and his reporting back to the European Union, who employed him on this mission which is not easy at the best of times, I believe he has discharged his duties in a tireless and exemplary manner with his <Col N="2064" /> colleague, Thorvald Stoltenberg.  As far as I am concerned, certainly arising from our last meeting in Brussels in December, the European Union at ministerial level will support Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg in their efforts.  Despite setbacks they continue to try to start negotiations and will continue to do so. Ultimately, it is a question of arriving at an agreement between the parties.  They have negotiated in very difficult circumstances. At times it is like negotiating on shifting sands &mdash; you think you have an agreement between all the parties on a Saturday but it is gone by Monday because of internal pressures between the various factions.</P>
      <P>The question of access for the Bosnians to the Adriatic is an important factor and at the most recent discussions in Brussels it was not a question of agreeing access but where the port access would be. Many opinions were offered.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the call for air strikes, my understanding is that the Secretary General, and the members of the Security Council, are currently discussing the specific modalities of the authorisation of air strikes.  The Security Council has the responsibility under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter for deciding what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.  The Security Council Resolution A.36 provides for the use of all necessary measures through the use of air power in and around the designated safe areas to support UNPROFOR in the performance of its mandate.  It stipulates that measures such as the use of air power can be taken under the authority of the Security Council and subject to close co-ordination with the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>That is the position.  It has been discussed, as the Deputy will be aware, on many occasions.  There are conflicting opinions as to the use of air power in the first instance.  By attempting to use air power one is then effectively saying that one is taking out the United Nations troops, the UNPROFOR mission, which would exacerbate what is already a very difficult situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that this is a very difficult situation.  The reason the military option has not been exercised up to now is the difficult terrain involved. Would the Minister accept that this conflict and the impotence of the European Union in dealing with it and obtaining results to date is damaging the Union itself?  Would the Minister also agree that this frustration expressed by the vote in the European Parliament is very far from being helpful to the cohesion of the European Union, particularly in relation to issues such as common foreign and security policy?  Can the Minister give the House any indication of the likely unanimity of the United Nations if a military intervention policy option was exercised? In particular, would he comment on whether there might be a Russian veto at the Security Council in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I think Deputy Hogan is moving ahead of the position obtaining.  Having attended at least one meeting per month, in some months two and three meetings, at which this has been on the agenda, I have to say there is a palpable feeling of frustration and anger that the Yugoslav crisis seems to be interminable.  Obviously there are limits to what one can do.  In deciding on strategic options one must be very careful not to render a bad situation worse.  I have heard colleagues express views that, had they a number of days available, they would solve the problem themselves, that is at the highest level.  I politely suggested that I could recommend some other place after they had finished with former Yugoslavia.  More than anything else, it was an expression of frustation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is an understanding of the efforts of the European Union and of the United Nations in what we have been endeavouring to do in terms of humanitarian aid, UNPROFOR and the presence on the ground of many troops. We see the various conflicts that have taken place, evidenced by recent discussions at military level in the former Yugoslavia.  We must endeavour to assist the peace process.  Ultimately the parties <Col N="2066" /> themselves, the leadership of the various factions within former Yugoslavia, must arrive at a settlement.  The European Union is the main contributor to humanitarian aid.  We are available to assist in any way possible and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Air strikes are a double-edged sword, if I may use that expression.  The same view has been taken by the United States administration, the European Union administration and the Russians.  There appears to have been a fair degree of unanimity between the European Union, the Russian Parliament and leadership and the United States.  We want to be helpful but we want to ensure that our help does not cause more problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, unfortunately, it is not possible to turn the clock back and undo the horrors that have been prepetrated in the former Yugoslavia?  Would he agree that the question of either ending the arms embargo on some of the groups involved, or the use of air strikes, would have to be weighed against the possibility that the net result could be an extension of the conflict into other areas in the Balkans?  Would he agree that the last thing we would want to do is widen the war and engage other ethnic groups in conflict?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether the Irish Government has taken a position on any arrangement that may evolve from negotiations between the three groups involved?  Have we made it clear that any states established as a result of these negotiations would be firmly based on the United Nations Charter on the recognition and defence of human rights and pluralism within such states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with Deputy De Rossa in relation to one's attitude to the lifting of the arms embargo on which there has been widespread discussion. There are those, and I would be one of them, who believe that if one succumbs to that option, effectively one is telling the combatents to fight out the war to the bitter end.  That is an option that has to <Col N="2067" /> be avoided.  Obviously the same applies in relation to the air strikes.  I would be very slow to support the idea of air strikes.  Then there is the whole question of increasing the conflict.  There is a widespread view that the whole of the Balkans could very easily become caught up in this conflict.  I do not want to use the term &ldquo;containable conflict&rdquo; bearing in mind the men, women and children we have witnessed in recent days being killed in the conflict.  We must pursue our efforts for a peaceful resolution.  There has not been a great opportunity for spelling out how we would react if, for example, three new republics were established. Obviously, we would want them to be established on the basis of the United Nations Charter.  Certainly that would be our aim, what we would be working toward and supporting.</P>

      <P>May I bring the Minister back to the evacuation of seriously injured people in Sarajevo to western countries?  I believe that 2,000 beds have been made available by the international community under the United Nations MEDIVAC Committee's arrangements for the transfer of seriously wounded people from Sarajevo and that, to date, only 231 people have actually managed to get out?  No doubt the Minister is aware that last week the Bosnian Health Minister appealed to the European Union to endeavour to speed up this evacuation process.  Would the Minister say whether this Government has responded positively to that appeal?  Is he not concerned that the United Nations MEDIVAC Committee meets quite lethargically once a month to discuss this matter?  What is his response to that dilemma?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that Tuzla airport is open to certain military flights.  If I am correct in that assumption, would the Minister say whether Tuzla airport is open to humanitarian aid in general, since the importance of humanitarian aid cannot be over emphasised? Would the Minister say whether it is clear to all involved that humanitarian aid does not include arms?  Where does the definition of &ldquo;humanitarian aid&rdquo; begin and end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my understanding also that humanitarian aid certainly does not include arms and, in relation to this conflict, I am not aware of arms having been included.  The question of the reopening of Tuzla airport is on our agenda.  Enormous pressure was exercised at the meeting held in Brussels on 22 December last to get agreement on the reopening of the airport for humanitarian use.  Operational decisions will be taken by UNPROFOR and people on the ground.  I understand people are reluctant to use the airport because of the conflict.  The UNPROFOR contingent are very anxious that Tuzla airport be reopened.  Apparently it would render the delivery of humanitarian aid a great deal easier because of the distances that must otherwise be travelled.  It is a proposal we shall certainly pursue in the hope that somebody will realise that humanitarian aid is for the benefit of all communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating all the difficulties in this matter, would the Minister agree with me that one thing the European Union powers certainly can do is reiterate to the Serbians acting in Bosnia that anybody who uses aerial bombardment of a multi-ethnic city, such as Sarajevo as a tactic in this matter will be held to account, that it is a war crime to bomb civilians?  Should this continue I suggest that the European Union make it clear to the Serbian Government that sanctions will remain in place until the Serbian community produce for trial those who are authorising and conducting that savage bombardment of civilians.  Is <Col N="2069" /> the Tánaiste aware that during the so-called Christmas ceasefire 50 people were killed and 300 injured?  Is it not abundantly clear that until those who are firing the mortars and shells into Sarajevo believe that one day they will be caught and put on trial they will keep the Bosnian Government under pressure?  Will the European Union make lifting of the sanctions conditional on bringing to account the people who are engaged in that barbarous campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the continuous shelling of Sarajevo is something we all deplore and the European Union has taken a very strong position in relation to it.  There are difficulties in relation to the proposals on Sarajevo.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the Geneva invincible package in relation to the proposal to have Sarajevo and Mostar under UN and European Union supervision.  Obviously that is unacceptable to the Bosnian Serbs but at the same time there is absolutely no justification for the bombardment we have seen in recent days.  This matter will be on the political agenda of our European meeting on Monday week. There is no question of sanctions being lifted.  Perhaps the Deputy is suggesting that more strenuous warnings should be given in relation to the conduct of the shelling.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12, 18, 30, 35, 36 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has had diplomatic relations with Turkey since 1951.  At present, our Ambassador in Rome is accredited, on a non-residential basis, to Turkey.  We also have an Honorary Consul in Istanbul.</P>
      <P>In 1979, Ireland opened diplomatic relations with Kenya and established an embassy in Nairobi.  As part of an overall review of our diplomatic representation overseas, this embassy was closed in 1988.  Our Honorary Consul in Nairobi deals with consular issues arising.</P>
      <P>Ireland's resident diplomatic network is small and, because of resource constraints, is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  The size and spread of our embassy network is kept under continuous review and adjustments are made from time to time in the light of our foreign policy priorities.  It would be inappropriate to speculate on possible developments in relation to any particular country, especially since any decisions on opening new embassies must be made in consultation with the Government concerned.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that Turkey has a resident ambassador in Ireland and full diplomatic relations with our Government and that we are the <Col N="2071" /> only EC country that does not have an ambassador resident in Ankara is it not desirable that we should establish diplomatic relations with that country in the not too distant future?</P>

This matter is kept under constant review and I am aware from the files that the matter has been subject to review on an annual basis.  It is a question of priorities.  As the Deputy will be aware a decision was made recently to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa and we now have an ambassador resident there.

I heard the very short answer the Tánaiste gave to Deputy Foxe but I wonder if he knows more?  I have spoken to many Kenyans who had great praise for the Irish Consulate when it was operational in Nairobi.  This was a very busy and outward looking consulate and certainly the parliamentarians, teachers, doctors, missionaries and others who are working there, often on a voluntary basis, miss it. Given our past, which has a great deal in common with that of Kenya &mdash; some would say a great deal more than with our EU partners &mdash; as a former British colony, would he consider the links with Kenya to be of considerable interest economically?</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a resident embassy in Kenya has not been ruled out.  If resources permit I would like us to have a stronger presence on the African continent.  I am aware of the work done by our Ambassador there over a number of years.  Because of our historical links with Kenya we would wish to re-establish an embassy there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reply to Deputy Tom Foxe should not indicate that I am not aware of the difficulties in relation to human rights issues in Turkey.  This is a matter on which I had long discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey on his visit here last year.  These are matters which we raise on an ongoing basis.  The question of establishing a resident <Col N="2074" /> embassy in Turkey is under constant review.  It is a question of trying to make the best of limited resources.  In recent months we have opened embassies in Finland and South Africa.  I hope we will be able to extend further in the next few years.</P>

      <P>The Trinidad Terms are proposals for a debt reduction initiative put forward by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major in 1990.</P>
      <P>While Ireland supports the proposals, we would not consider it appropriate to make representations on a bilateral basis to other Governments, which may not do so.  In our view, remedial action can only be established through continued discussion in the various international fora which are addressing the issue of developing country debt.  The role which the Irish Government can best play is to support the international efforts being made to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>At the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank last September, the Minister for Finance called for a debt relief package to be formulated for the poorest regions, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, that would at least be in line with the Trinidad Terms.  All member countries of the IMF and the World Bank, including Japan, were represented at the meeting, and are therefore fully aware of Ireland's position.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has answered the question.  I attempted to raise a similar question with him but it was refused.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on a recent report, published by Oxfam, on the failure of IMF and World Bank policies in relation to the debt of developing countries.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 37 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by Deputy McManus has been a matter of continuing concern to the Government.  The recent acquittal of the two soldiers charged with the murder of the young man in question has done nothing to alleviate the deep sense of unease and concern felt within the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland over the adequacy of the existing criminal law as it relates to the use of lethal force by the security forces, the question of controls over the use of such force and the accountability of those involved.  The Government has consistently conveyed these concerns to the British Government in clear terms and has called, through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference, for a thorough examination of the whole area of the use of lethal force by the security forces in Northern Ireland.  The British authorities have indicated that a number of issues are under review in this context.</P>
      <P>The notion of a new offence &mdash; other than manslaughter or murder &mdash; is in my view one which presents significant possibilities.  It is among a range of ideas and suggestions that we have put to and discussed with the British side through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
      <P>I intend to discuss all of these matters further with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the forthcoming meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he agrees that the not dissimilar case which has arisen since this question was tabled gives an added urgency to raising, through the Anglo-Irish Conference, precisely the question of the British Government amending the criminal law? What has happened in this case, where an innocent man was shot dead and his brother injured and the two charged soldiers walked free, serves only to undermine public confidence in the security <Col N="2077" /> forces and in the judicial system.  It is a matter of urgency and in the interest of constitutional parties, North and South, that confidence in the judicial process and the security forces ought not be undermined by allowing people in these circumstances to escape with impunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent judgment is a reminder of the tragic killing in September, 1991 of a completely innocent individual.  This, and similar cases in recent years, illustrate the problems surrounding the use of lethal force by the security forces in Northern Ireland and the deep and widespread dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the existing criminal law, the controls over the use of force and the accountability of members of the security forces.  My priority would be to see that decisive action is taken in order to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy such as that which befell Kevin McGovern.  I will be raising this matter tomorrow at the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would this Minister agree that the possibility of evolving a new and separate offence of using unnecessary or excessive force, negligently causing the death or serious injury of civilians, should be introduced? It is abundantly clear that manslaughter and murder charges, under existing practice in Northern Ireland, cannot deal adequately with the question of blame in this matter and do not provide a sanction. Would he agree that the European Convention notion of providing strong protection for civilians against the use of force by the State should be the principle underlying the criminal law in Northern Ireland?  Is he aware that the standing advisory council on human rights in Northern Ireland has expressed doubt in this area?  There seems to be a general consensus among those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report by the British Government's standing advisory committee on human rights and I share the view stated that action must be taken to counter the possible effect which the current practice has in increasing the alienation of sections of the Nationalist community from the lawenforcement authorities in Northern Ireland.  From our consideration of these issues, and other events down through the years, there are three main changes required: tighter legal and operational rules governing the circumstances in which the security forces may open fire; provision for an independent element &mdash; for example, a police force in Britain &mdash; in the investigation of such incidents, and the revision of the existing law, including the establishment of a wider range of offences in lethal force cases.  I believe the latter is necessary because of the obvious difficulty in securing convictions in murder prosecutions against members of the security forces and the virtual impossibility, in the light of the 1975 ruling by the House of Lords, of bringing a lesser charge in cases where lethal force was intentionally used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of the view that manslaughter might have been a charge or something more defined, as Deputy McDowell outlined?  Is he of the view that manslaughter tends to be a charge that does not hold water in Northern Ireland cases involving the killing of innocent civilians by security forces and will he raise this matter at his next meeting with the British authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The US authorities have assured me that all Irish passport-holders who are genuine football supporters will have their visa applications dealt with sympathetically. In accordance with US regulations, passport holders resident in Northern Ireland should apply to the US Consulate-General in Belfast.  I am sure that the Consulate will take the same constructive approach in dealing with applications as the US Embassy in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to match tickets remains difficult.  I met the managing director of World Cup Travel Services, <Col N="2080" /> Mr. John Lane, during his recent visit to Dublin.  World Cup Travel Services is a company jointly established by FIFA, the Zurich-base international football federation, and the World Cup Organising Committee in New York.</P>
    <P>In my discussion with Mr. Lane, I emphasised two points in particular: first, the need for an adequate supply of tickets for the large numbers of Irish supporters wishing to travel and, second, our concern about reports that tickets are being offered for sale at exorbitant prices on the black market in the US.  Mr. Lane undertook to do his best to increase the allocation of tickets for Irish tour operators but was not optimistic that he could supply enough to meet the demand.  With regard to black market tickets, his unequivocal advice was that fans should have nothing to do with ticket touts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the tickets made available through the travel trade, there is also an allocation directly by FIFA through national football associations.  In an effort to increase our allocation through this channel, I have written to the general secretary of FIFA in Zurich, emphasising the tremendous interest on the part of Irish supporters in travelling to the US matches and requesting FIFA to make every effort to increase the supply of tickets available here.</P>
    <P>Overall, the ticket supply remains problematic and there is no guarantee that demands will be met.  I assure Deputies, however, that we are staying in very close contact with the FAI and the travel trade and we will use every channel open to us to ensure the best possible allocation for Irish fans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for Question Time I was indicating that this is a budget for enterprise and employment, creating the framework <Col N="2125" /> within which we can stimulate economic growth to create wealth and, consequently, produce jobs.  I referred to the new enterprise fund, the £100 million of working capital that would be made available to Irish industries on unique terms.  With this measure I have provided small businesses with a significant shield in terms of the duration of the loans they can get and the terms and conditions under which they can borrow.  It is, however, the small businesses who must use this shield for their further development and for the creation and stabilisation of jobs.</P>
      <P>This scheme will complement the packages introduced by the commercial banks together with small businesses over the last six months.  We can also look forward to upwards of £10 million to be made available from Irish pension funds for venture capital investment and the coming on stream of the Edinburgh European Union subsidised loans schemes later this year.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, county enterprise boards are now operating in each county and city throughout the country.  The enthusiasm and commitment which they have brought to promoting enterprising initiatives is reflected in the fact that over £3 million in grant assistance for projects was approved by the boards in their first eight weeks of operation this year.  I can now confirm to the House that the Government is committed to ensuring that the boards will have the resources they need to do the job they have been set.  I wrote to all the boards this week confirming that the Government has approved £500,000 as an initial target for each board's grant approvals for the current year.  I will be prepared to adjust that limit upwards having regard to the quality of their action plans and the progress they are making in implementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is even more in this budget for small businesses.  The whole area of compliance and regulation with the Revenue Commissioners and the other regulatory authorities will be integrated and simplified to reduce the paper work and, where possible, eliminate bureaucracy. <Col N="2126" /> This is a budget for enterprise in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>It is also a budget for employment and its main thrust will be to reward those at work, particularly the lower paid.  The Labour Party does not apologise for concentrating its efforts in that area.  The lower paid have had to carry a disproportionate burden of our PAYE taxation system.  Therefore, we have unashamedly concentrated the focus of our income tax relief on the lower and middle income groups as part of a strategy which, over time, will ensure that the majority of workers will pay income tax at the standard rate of 27 per cent.  The effect of the taxation changes will be to make work more attractive for those able to get jobs.  The combined economic policies of the Government, as reflected in the budget, will ensure that the GDP of the economy will grow by 4 per cent in 1994.  With inflation predicted to be at 2.5 per cent for the year the economy is now in a position to move forward.  We must ensure that the movement is to the maximum benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>Last year the rate of unemployment projected in January was for an average of 310,000 but the real figure was approximately 296,000.  This year the projected rate of unemployment, using the same model as last year, is a figure of 289,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a few minutes.  I am comparing like with like. That figure remains unacceptably high and we have to reduce it.  The stimulus to the economy which the State is giving through this budget will ensure that employment will increase in 1994 but the rate of increase will not be sufficient to meet our needs.  For that reason we have taken a new and imaginative step to develop and expand the third sector of the Irish economy with the community employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the end of the year up to 40,000 people will be employed in a new employment <Col N="2127" /> programme which will replace the social employment scheme, the community employment development programme and Teamwork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme which I introduced nine years ago has provided work and employment for over 100,000 people, 30 per cent of whom went on to find full-time employment in the public or private sectors.  It was confined to persons who were long term unemployed and over the age of 25.</P>
      <P>The community employment development programme was introduced in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> company areas as a response to economic and unemployment hardship. Its terms and conditions were more generous than the social employment scheme and it provided an element of training and personal developments. Teamwork was an employment programme for young people and many voluntary organisations, particularly in the health sector, found it an invaluable programme which ensured they were able to undertake their important work.</P>
      <P>The new Community Employment Programme draws from the extensive experience which FÁS now has of managing and operating those programmes and integrates the best features of all three in a combined and unified system which will provide clarity for both the participants and sponsors.  It will work in the following manner with the following conditions: community employment programmes will operate throughout the country providing part-time work together with personal and skills development opportunities for the unemployed.  In the designated areas under the Local Development Programme, LDP, it will be operated as a key resource where special additional efforts will be made to improve the progression chances of participants through co-ordinated area action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> Projects undertaken within the programme will be for community and public benefit and may be sponsored by public bodies and voluntary organisations. Commercial State or private companies will be eligible for consideration as sponsors of special projects carried out under the Local Development Programme.</P>
    <P>As I said, the programme will provide up to 40,000 places on a voluntary basis by the end of 1994.  The scale of provision envisaged represents a doubling of end 1993 levels of participation on FÁS temporary employment schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The following will be eligible to participate in the community employment programme: persons aged 21 years or over in receipt of unemployment assistance; persons in receipt of unemployment benefit for more than one year; persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance for more than one year; other special categories e.g. Youthreach progression participants, referrals by the National Rehabilitation Board and persons combining a period on a recognised programme.</P>
      <P>Within the total eligible pool of over 200,000 persons approximately, priority in recruitment will be given to the older and longer term unemployed and other priority groups targeted in area action plans.  As a target, 25 per cent of all places will be set aside for the very long term unemployed, i.e. those aged over 45 unemployed for three years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants will receive a weekly allowance consisting of a personal payment and additional payments for any adult or child dependants as follows: personal allowance, £77; adult dependent allowance, £33.70 and each child dependant £12.80.  This means that a single participant will receive £77 per week while a participant with an adult dependant and two children will have take home pay of £136.30 per week.  In addition, all <Col N="2129" /> participants with a previous entitlement will retain secondary and other benefits. Participation will be for 20 hours per week or 40 hours per fortnight.  Participants will be recruited initially for one year but many may be retained by sponsors for a second year with the agreement of FÁS in the following limited circumstances: as key participants, e.g. to undertake core administrative or specialist work or where the participant would benefit from continued participation in terms of additional training and development to help them find employment in either the public or private sector or in cases where no other suitable, eligible participants are available.  In the case of older participants unemployed for more than three years, efforts will be made to provide places of up to three years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that we want to try to get as many people as possible into the system because all the evidence shows that if those who have been unemployed for a period of time can get work experience they will find it easier to find employment in either the public or private sectors.  Approximately 30 per cent of those who have taken part in the social employment scheme have managed to find work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would prefer to have more people taking part and we will be considering this through time.  In the original social employment scheme provision was made for 10,000 participants.  At that stage, it was felt that it would not be possible to employ that number of people within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stated that, in contrast to the social employment scheme, the new community employment programme will have a development module for participants averaging 25 days during the initial 12 months of the scheme; a minimum <Col N="2130" /> of 15 days will apply to this module. Additional development modules will be provided to particpants being retained for a second year.  Development modules will include personal-employment skills, technical skills relating to project work and support for own time development. Development modules will be available to participants on projects of 11 workers or more and amalgamation of smaller projects to reach this level will be facilitated by FÁS.  Training grants will be provided.  Development modules will be phased in over 1994-95, starting initially in areas covered by the Local Development Programme.</P>
    <P>Sponsors of projects will be approved by FÁS for periods of up to two years, subject to annual review and availability of budgets.  Under the present system, they are approved on a yearly basis and <i>per capita</i> grants for materials and supervision will be provided.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the Community Employment Programme will provide a key resource in areas covered by the Local Development Programme, with funding for the programme in those areas being provided from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach through FÁS.  Specifically, the programme will link with local development programmes in the following way.  Selection of participants through FÁS will take account of the recruitment priorities agreed in area action plans and will also link with initial contact initiatives which will give supportive counselling inputs to participants; FÁS will provide for job guidance inputs prior to and during the programme.  Within area action plans realistic objectives will be set and measures identified for implementation by FÁS, to encourage and facilitate progression by participants, following CEDP, to education, training and employment.  Special projects which provide enhanced work experience-development and whose content is linked explicitly to local development objectives will be encouraged by FÁS working in co-operation with area partnerships.  Such projects will be approved for up to three years subject to annual review by FÁS, <Col N="2131" /> and will qualify for top-up capital-materials grants from a dedicated fund of £3 million per annum, to be provided under the disadvantaged areas sub-pro-gramme of the Local Development Programme. Commercial State or private companies will also be eligible to sponsor such projects, carrying out work of community benefit.</P>
    <P>The details of implementation of the Community Employment Programme are being finalised by FÁS to enable it to start from 1 March this year.  FÁS will be in direct contact with sponsors of existing schemes to discuss implementation and to minimise disruption.  Deputies who have an interest in this programme should contact their local FÁS regional managers for the specific details of how the programme will operate in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The Community Employment Programme will require and, I know, will obtain the full support and co-operation of the social partners both at national and local level.  I was pleased to hear the comments of the president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions yesterday in response to the budget expressing concerns in regard to the need for increased employment.  He repeated these concerns on radio this morning.  I presume, therefore, that the Government and local communities will receive the full co-operation of the social partners in ensuring that all local authorities who wish to avail of the Community Employment Programme will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Major Religious Superiors has, among others, been looking at the whole question of unemployment in our society and in particular the whole world of work in the changing context of the world's economy.  We all need to be able to move in new and imaginative ways to ensure that alienation and social exclusion in our society is not brought about because of a person's inability to find gainful employment.</P>
    <P>The third sector of employment utilising the Community Employment Programme is the basis upon which a future integration of all persons willing voluntarily <Col N="2132" /> to contribute their skills and abilities to our society can be encouraged and facilitated.  The ideas which have been articulated by the CMRS and others will be investigated in pilot projects over the course of this year.  They contain the basis for a radical transformation of the whole area of employment within the third sector of our society, the active engagement of persons in the third sector will in no way damage the competitive basis of the private sector and its wealth creating functions or the employment structures of the public sector which are an essential component to the efficient infrastructure in our society.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to reject outright the accusation by Deputy Yates in this Chamber yesterday, as quoted in the newspapers today, that &ldquo;The Labour Party thinks that the private sector, deep down, are a shower of chancers&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the kind of colourful phrase used by Deputy Yates' predecessor, Deputy Noonan, and Deputy Yates felt obliged on his first outing as Finance spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party to emulate him and use that phrase.</P>
      <P>Anybody looking at this budget and at the thrust in favour of enterprise in general and small businesses in particular coming from the Department of Enterprise and Employment for which the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party has responsibility can clearly see that the small business sector and the private sector of this economy have never had such a favourable response from a Department through the budget to the stated needs they expressed through the task force on small business and through the numerous representations they have made to me and to my colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is a good budget.  It is focused; it has a strategy and it is the product of a number of months' work.  It builds on the success of last year's budget &mdash; and I use that phrase advisedly <Col N="2133" /> because so much was said against last year's budget at the time.  Last year's budget set out to achieve something nobody thought was possible at the time &mdash; the stabilisation of the Irish economy. We are in a more stable position now than anybody would have predicted this time last year and that takes into account the extra provision that had to be made from within resources for the Aer Lingus rescue package.</P>
    <P>This budget rewards risk and enterprise. It encourages employment.  It will help the economy to grow and therefore to create new jobs and within that context it unashamedly focuses its priorities on low and middle income groups who have carried the burden of taxation for too long.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that the Labour Party in Government has had a clear and sustained input into this budget as can be clearly seen by anybody who wants to examine it in detail.  Working together Labour and Fianna Fáil have transformed the economy in the last 12 months.  This time last year nobody would have believed that the new partnership Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour together would have brought about a situation where only ourselves and Luxembourg qualify for participation in the European Economic and Monetary Union under the Maastricht Treaty criteria.  This time last year nobody would have said that the new Government would be able to negotiate successfully the transformation that has occurred in Aer Lingus, and nobody this time last year would have been able to say that the business confidence within the community would be at the level it is today.</P>
    <P>That is what has been achieved and it has provided the basis for this year's budget which now takes us forward and will give us the momentum to move forward. We can do great things in this economy in the next year.  Last night on one of the television programmes two independent economists, one from a firm of consultants and the other working for the current affairs programme &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; talked about the possibility of <Col N="2134" /> the Irish economy being overheated.  This time last year nobody would have thought this was remotely possible, and certainly nobody could have said that one would be looking at the prospect of an Irish economy being overheated while still staying within the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty criteria.  This is the product of very sound financial management by Labour and Fianna Fáil working together and I therefore reject as outright nonsense the stupid remarks that were made by Deputy Ivan Yates, perhaps out of desperation, seeking to find something on which to attack the budget yesterday afternoon.  We believe in a mixed economy but, more important, because we believe in it and are also a Socialist Party, we know how to make a mixed economy work in a way that seems to have eluded Fine Gael over the years. I am proud to commend this budget to the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before Deputy Higgins speaks, I was minded earlier today to seek a quorum simply to try to get this House to take the budget seriously.  However, since it is late on a Thursday afternoon I will not call a quorum, but it is a sad reflection on this House that in large measure the debate has been a head-to-head of word processors attended by nobody.  I want to record that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on the record that I stand four square behind the comments made by Deputy Yates yesterday.  His first performance as spokesperson on Finance, very much off the cuff, replying to the Minister's budget speech which lasted two hours, was superb.  It was a valid repudiation of many of the assertions which the Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would have us believe is part of this Government's so-called success story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the enthusiasm of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for what he calls a budget for enterprise <Col N="2135" /> and employment.  In justifying the 1 per cent levy he mentioned that the pain was worth while.  I wonder was the pain worth while to the 40 workers who lost their jobs at Claremorris Limited?  Was the pain worth while to the 300 workers whose jobs at A.T. Cross are now on the line?  Is the pain worthwhile to the 800 people whose houses were repossessed last year because they lost their jobs and have not been able to meet their mortgages? I wonder is the pain worth while to the 296,000 people who face the dole queue every weekday and for whom this budget offers no hope whatsoever?</P>
    <P>In the past, budgets have come in every hue, shape and size.  We have had hair shirt budgets, we have had give-away budgets.  I do not think it was simply that this budget was well leaked in advance and that we heard all the more salient details from various economic commentators, the Cliff Taylors and the Michael Ronaynes.  Perhaps it is part of the new Labour philosophy of open Government to leak the budget in advance so that what we get in the House by way of presentation from the Minister is very much the leftovers, a bit like stale porter.  This is a bad practice and should be frowned upon.  In terms of preserving its own integrity any Government worth its salt should revert to the long established practice of keeping the details of the budget a secret until such time as it is presented to the people to whom it should be presented first, the Teachtaí Dála, the people sent here to represent the people of Ireland from various constituencies.</P>
    <P>This was a bad budget.  We have had bad budgets, colourful budgets, hair shirt budgets.  However, I cannot think of any budget as drab or as grey as yesterday's performance since I began to take an interest in budgets.  It was a dull budget, and it was particularly dull in the light of the great expectations that something very significant was about to happen.  The tragedy, apart from the lack of colour, was the failure of the Government to use its very powerful position and the fact that there is responsible Opposition in <Col N="2136" /> this House to really bite the economic bullet and employ some kind of cutting edge in order to eat into unemployment.</P>
    <P>This is a budget of bits and pieces. There is a bit added here and a bit substracted there but between the checks and the balances, the swings and the roundabouts, there is nothing much in it for anybody.  It is a &ldquo;keep the finger crossed&rdquo; budget, a budget hoping that something will turn up; it is a holding operation, it is treading water and that is not what we need at this juncture.  There is absolutely no vigour in it, no energy, no dynamism, no positive thrust, no attempt to bite the economic bullet.  Certainly there is very little realisation in it that the Government has 100 seats, the largest majority ever, a mysteriously high opinion poll rating, responsible Opposition and some real money with which to tackle the problems, and yet it failed miserably to do anything significant about the two millstones that are pulling this country down &mdash; unemployment and the crippling national debt.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was looked upon as a missed opportunity, and irrespective of how the Minister for Enterprise and Employment may try to defend his colleague, it was a missed opportunity and that is how economic commentators saw it in the post-budget period.  This year's budget was a double disappointment.  It was disappointing in its content and it was disappointing because when Minister Ahern was Minister for Labour he had been chomping at the bit, anxious to spread his wings and develop his full potential in an economic Ministry.  When the &ldquo;Mercs and perks&rdquo; were being given out by the previous Taoiseach Deputy Ahern made no secret of the fact that he wanted Finance or nothing.  He got Finance but, unfortunately, he has not produced anything because budget after budget have been failures and disappointments.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister was particularly loud in his praise of our fiscal financial performance.  He said that Ireland's fiscal performance has been among the best in the European Union over the years.  No matter how we try to <Col N="2137" /> delude ourselves by talking about keeping the Exchequer borrowing requirement below 3 per cent of GNP, the Exchequer borrowing requirement in this budget is £593 million.  When added to the 1992 national debt of £28.5 billion, our national debt is almost £30 billion. The raw reality of that statistic is that 60p of every £1 collected in income tax by the Minister will as a result of yesterday's budget go to servicing the national debt. Effectively, that is wasted money.  The Minister missed a golden opportunity yesterday to do something positive about this when he had some real cash.  As long as that national debt hangs around our necks we will go nowhere, and ratios are irrelevant in that context.  The fact is that our national debt is steadily increasing. When the Minister had the figures on his side he should have done something about it.</P>
    <P>Ireland has become an unemployment society.  In spite of all the rhetoric the Government has given up the ghost.  In the last election the people voted for change; they voted for The Labour Party in an effort to bring about a change in the country's dismal unemployment record. They invested heavily in The Labour Party as the instrument of that change, but if one takes unemployment as the barometer of success, that was an extremely bad investment; it has backfired. For a Government that has put jobs at the top of its agenda, a figure of 300,000 unemployed is appalling.  I note that the Minister patted himself on the back with some glee because the predictions for last year were not met.  That is part of a conditioning process.  In reality, unemployment will continue to increase and the Government accepts that the position will deteriorate.  Despite all the economic data, the forecasts, the figures and the analyses nobody at Government level is in a position to indicate when we will turn the corner in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>Statistics for this country are frightening. In the first year of a partnership Government who talked about putting trust back in politics, receiverships increased by 63 per cent.  There were 716 <Col N="2138" /> liquidations, 30 per cent of office space is vacant and 11 per cent of costly IDA advanced factory space built on a wing and a prayer in the hope of attracting industry is unoccupied.  Redundancies have increased by 26 per cent.  We have had the Culliton and Moriarty reports, the recommendations of which were loudly commended and the broad thrust of them accepted.  Rather than acting on those recommendations, the Government spent most of its time on bureaucratic reorganisation of State agencies.</P>
    <P>As if we did not have enough State agencies with a plethora of bodies such as FÁS, Forbairt, the IDA, Bord Fáilte, CTT and so on we now have county enterprise boards and the sub-division and amalgamation in some cases of agencies which have failed.  By amalgamating agencies which are proven failures we are guaranteeing a collective failure.  We have layer upon layer of State agencies many of whom are staffed by individuals who do not have real experience of the cut and thrust of economic life outside. There is no recognition of the fact that if a person is to manage a State agency or work in a Government Department which handles a large portion of the public purse, whether it is the Department of Enterprise and Employment or the Department of Finance, he or she needs experience in the competitive world.  Most civil servants never worked in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world and have never had to endure the buffeting of the recessionary winds or competitive practices.  Those people need experience in the competitive world.  Any reorganisation of the public service, whether in the IDA or the economic ministries, should include the key personnel in those offices being expected to work in the real business world outside in order to experience the pressures and become conditioned to the reality of economic life and bring that experience to bear on their policy decisions.  In saying that I mean no disrespect to those involved.  They are of a high calibre and intellect and have tremendous ability, but experience is the best means of training, honing, refining <Col N="2139" /> and giving a person the perception needed for the real world.</P>
    <P>As in previous years we have had announcements of initiatives and programmes in this budget.  We have gone down that road before and many programmes have been unsuccessful.  I welcome the FÁS schemes in that they afford people the dignity of a day's work.  I recall the present Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Labour announcing an initiative under which we would liaise with Holland and other EC countries in regard to apprentice exchanges.  The number of such exchanges is not very flattering and perhaps the Minister might give that idea another kick-start because it is a potentially good one.  The global figures mentioned at that time were far from realised. That is what makes people sceptical, especially those on the dole queue.  The lid is being kept on them in respect of social welfare increases.  With a figure of 300,000 unemployed, unless we turn the corner soon we will be on the brink of a social backlash.  In that regard the taxing of unemployment benefit which one receives for only a 15-month period following the trauma of losing one's job is unfair and insensitive.  That measure should not have been introduced in the budget.  People receive unemployment benefit for a short time following which they receive unemployment assistance for which they are means tested.  If one spouse is working that is automatically taken into consideration in determining a person's means.</P>
    <P>I had hoped this Government, with its huge majority and so-called healthy fiscal position which boasts of a 4 per cent growth rate, low inflation, a balance of trade and an educated but disappointed workforce, would use this budget to restructure economic life here.  However, there has been no restructuring and no reforming.  What this Government needed more than anything at this juncture was a budget to foster employment, but this budget falls far short of that. Despite what the Minister for Enterprise <Col N="2140" /> and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said in regard to nurturing employment, the reality is that because of our taxation regime and our PRSI &mdash; not because of high wages &mdash; it is far more cost effective and economic for a person to have a garment made in Manchester than in Claremorris.  That is why the clothing industry is buckling at the knees.  The budget has done nothing to resolve that situation.  Unfortunately, because of the vulnerability of the clothing industry at present there will be more closures.  The clothing industry is on a hiding to nothing.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech there is a heading, &ldquo;Agriculture and Food&rdquo;, but I respectfully submit that the word &ldquo;Food&rdquo; should not have been inserted because the food industry has not been mentioned in the speech.  The food industry represents a squandered opportunity for job creation.  From a reply to a statistical question I asked the Taoiseach yesterday in relation to the imports of confectionery products for the year 1992, I learned that we imported sugar confectionery, not containing chocolate, to the value of £33.8 million, chocolate and chocolate goods to the value of £55.4 million and pastry, cakes and biscuits and other bakers' wares to the value of £70.2 million. Those figures represent a total of £159.4 million of confectionery imports, long life products, which are to be found on the shelves of supermarkets from Ballybay to Ballybunion throughout the length and breadth of this country.  With some encouragement all those products could be manufactured here.  Yet, the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Enterprise and Employment show scant concern for import substitution.  There is a strong bakery trade in my county.  I know several bakeries who have the know-how and the will to counter the importation of confectionery products, but the official policy of the IDA is singularly directed towards exports.  I do not understand why people do not realise that £1 saved on substituting an import has exactly the same value as £1 obtained from exporting a product.  Yet, there is no evidence that <Col N="2141" /> our blinkered, rigid bureaucratic approach is about to be broken down and in the meantime the imports continue to grow apace.</P>
    <P>The aim is to create 35,000 new jobs in tourism during the next six years.  That is a noble aim and it is possible, but I do not believe it will be realised.  The tourism industry seems to be a mighty conundrum. Global figures are thrown out in relation to the number of bed nights and so on, but their accuracy is questionable. Many assertions have been made about the booming tourist trade and last year being a good year. However, the people at the coalface providing guest house accommodation had a bad year and, unfortunately, I do not believe 1994 will be much better because we have not grappled with the nitty-gritty of the problem.  Costs are simply too high.  Car insurance costs, care hire and, following the budget, the cost of food and drink, are too high.  We have developed a fine array of large hotels with good facilities, on a par with the best hotels in the world, which provide top class accommodation.  The Minister has provided £5 million, mainly for marketing, and that is welcome as marketing is vitally important, but I make a special plea for funding for the small hotel sector which does not receive any grants and which are fundamental to the tourism industry. Until now hotels with 40 rooms did not qualify for European Regional Development Fund funds.  I urge the Minister to greatly reduce the qualifying threshold to assist the small hotel sector.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister should lay heavy emphasis on 1994 being the International Year of the Family and then proceed to introduce one of the most anti-family budgets in the history of the State.  Mortgage relief has been slashed. The same applies to VHI relief, which is the main health safety net for many middle income families.  Disability and unemployment benefit have been taxed, but this will arise only in the case of a married couple where one spouse is working.  There has been a monumental failure to pay tribute to the family during the International Year of the Family in <Col N="2142" /> that tax relief for dependant children has not been restored.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional allocation for Youthreach, but planners still do not seem to accept that there would be no need for many education rescue initiatives, such as Youthreach, meritorious though they are, which try to help people who left school without educational qualifications if sufficient resources were invested at primary school level.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education appreciates more than anybody that there is a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach to education.  Unfortunately, primary education, the corner-stone of education, is very much the poor relation.  It has been proven time and time again that education intervention at the earliest possible date pays dividends. Unless we get matters right at primary level, get the three Rs right and pupils are able to proceed from one class to another, having reached a competent standard in the previous class, there will be a major education deficit.  This involves remedial teaching at a later stage, Youthreach, VTOs and other compensatory schemes whereas if the money was invested at primary school level much trauma and expenditure down the road as well as the social problems which arise would be eliminated.  We have a good education system here.  Wittingly or otherwise we seem to train people psychologically to apply for rather than create a job.  We train people in the cast of employee rather than as an employer. The Green Paper referred to an enterprise culture but that idea has not been fleshed out.  I do not know how one creates enterprise entrepreneurial skills and the capacity to &ldquo;give it a lash&rdquo;.  Those skills are lacking and the education system, for all its merits, tends to cast people in a conservative rigid mould.  I understood there would be some relief for education in the budget given the signpostings for the higher education grants sector.  In this House we have laboured the point that in all the discriminatory, anti-PAYE anomaly ridden systems nothing could compare with the higher education grants system. <Col N="2143" /> Recently, I received a letter from a parent in County Tipperary who has two children in third level education and one child at home.  The father's income is £18,000.  The mother decided three years ago to go back to work and is earning a mere £8,000.  The family's income is £26,000 which seems a good income.  The reality is that it is reduced to £19,000 when the figure for income tax, including the 1 per cent levy that applied last year and PRSI are taken into consideration. The mortgage of £4,200 reduces their income to £12,000.  The college fees for their two children must be paid in total and taking their VHI contribution into account the family's net disposable income is £123.50 per week.  If that family had stayed on the dole their income would be £132.50 per week and they would be entitled to a medical card, clothing allowance and various ancillary benefits, possibly free fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that covenants will be reconsidered in the context of the review of higher education grants which is due to be announced at the end of February.  I do not know what will emerge from that review because the scheme needs to be shaken from top to bottom.  Unless there is a fundamental overhaul and cognisance of the difficulties and hardship faced by thousands of PAYE workers who have no escape hatch the review will have been in vain. There is room for improvement. Recently, I asked the Minister the cost to the Exchequer of covenants last year and I understand they cost £33 million in terms of tax savings.  I hope there will be more than a token recognition of the plight of the PAYE sector in the forthcoming review.</P>
    <P>I come from the west where there are five counties.  In the Six Counties in the North there is a massive human tragedy unfolding.  I commend all the efforts to bring about a cessation of violence and a peaceful solution to enable the North to develop as a social and economic entity. There are 1.5 million people in the North and the number is increasing; there are 500,000 people in the west and the <Col N="2144" /> number is decreasing.  Between 1926 and 1991 the population in the west declined by 132,000.  Recently I asked the Taoiseach for the number of townlands in the west which had disappeared from the electrol register between 1926 and 1991. They are Galway, 224; Leitrim, 145; Mayo, 175; Sligo, 67 and Roscommon, 148; a total of 759 townlands have no population.  All that remain are tumbledown homesteads.  Villages that were once vibrant communities are now dead. If we had an up-to-date assessment of the position between 1991 and 1994 we could possibly add another 50 or 60 to that figure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will make the long overdue announcement that a regional technical college will be built in Castlebar.  Castlebar is entitled to a fully fledged regional technical college, with no outreach or subsidiary courses to the regional technical college in Sligo or Galway.  The case has been proved and the plans are on the drawing board. Promises have been made but time and again they have been broken.  We will accept nothing less than a fully fledged regional technical college for Mayo.  That could prove to be at least part of the catalyst to getting the economy of my county back on the rails.</P>

      <P>As always, I found Deputy Higgins's contribution to be interesting and lively.  As there is very little time left in this debate I will refer to some remarks made by the Deputy.  He spoke about a scheme to allow civil servants take part in business life.  Deputy Ruairí Quinnn, Minister for Enterprise and Employment, put forward this idea but I do not know as yet what the take up will be. Everybody who is interested has been informed of it.  It would be an advantage for civil servants who have strong commitment to integrity to become involved in private industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the apprenticeship scheme, announced by Deputy Brian Cowen when Minister for Labour, which enables an exchange of apprenticeships <Col N="2145" /> between countries.  Last September a group of 24 young Cork people went to Cologne under this scheme and I visited them there on 3-4 January.  I also met some of the employers with whom they work.  These young people are enjoying the experience and are learning fast.  FÁS is about to enter a bakery apprenticeship agreement which would involve people travelling to another part of Germany.  Following that, agreements, will be sought involving apprentices in all trades.  The young people in Cologne, who are fitting into the scene there will receive training, a job and a passport for life.  In this area of Germany there are 20,000 apprentice vacancies in the various designated trades and we are working towards extending the scheme to these areas.  In view of the fact that one can travel quickly and easily from one part of the world to another, this is an idea that should be gladly taken up.</P>
    <P>As I came into the House Deputy Higgins spoke about Forfás, IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  While many people mock this tripartite arrangement, it is very sensible.  Forbairt will be enabled to concentrate much more closely on indigenous industry and import substitution, to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>It is remarkable that, in perhaps one of the wettest countries in the world, for a period of six to eight weeks large areas of Dublin city had no water supply or had a very ineffective and inefficient water supply.  We have been informed by the local authority that the northern fringe of Dublin is supplied with water from the Ballycoolen reservoir at Leixlip.  For the last three or four months the water supply has been reduced by 1-1.5 million gallons of water per day, which is totally unacceptable.  I hope the Minister will redress this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the weeks before Christmas in many <Col N="2146" /> districts in my constituency, estates such as Limewood, Eannafort and Clonshaugh, people had their heating systems on, with no water flowing through the pipes.  For a number of weeks after Christmas districts which are not in my constituency &mdash; I am sure I can speak for my colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall &mdash; such as Finglas and Glasnevin, had no water supply for up to four days at a time.  This caused great inconvenience, particularly for families with children and senior citizens.  Friends of mine who live in Raheny had the unenviable experience over Christmas of telling American relatives who were staying with them that it was not possible to take a shower.  I imagine those Americans got a very bad impression of Ireland.</P>
    <P>To add to the present difficulties, permission has been given for the building of 1,100 houses in the north of my constituency and permission is about to be given in another parish for 800 or 900 houses.  Effectively, another town the size of Castlebar, which was referred to earlier, will be created without providing proper water supply.  This is unacceptable. I have been informed that INTEL, which is located in Kildare, uses 500,000-750,000 million gallons of water per day.  This water comes from what used to be our supply and is used to manufacture chips.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has taken some action in this regard. As chairperson of the general purposes committee of Dublin Corporation I was pleased to attend the opening of the extension at Ballymore Eustace.  The key problem seems to be in the Ballycoolen reservoir in Leixlip.  Fingal County Council has a tender for £4 million for absolutely <Col N="2147" /> necessary works, for example, pump and ground water improvements at Ballyboughal Ring in Fingal, but there seems to be no movement in this area.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has taken some action, I applaud him for his efforts in helping to finish the north city arterial watermain which will bring water from the south side of the city to the north side.  I call on him to help Fingal County Council and the authorities in County Kildare in their efforts to restore an adequate water supply to the north side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister might be interested to know that one of my predecessors who was responsible for the water supply in Dublin has a statue erected in memory of him in O'Connell Street.  The people of Dublin are very aware of the importance of a decent water and sanitation system.  If there are no improvements in this respect in the short term there will be no statues erected in memory of me or any other members of the Government. Rather people will make their displeasure clearly known.  I ask the Minister to take some action on the water supply in north Dublin city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like first to clarify my Department's position in relation to water supplies. As the Minister explained recently in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Broughan, matters pertaining to the operation of water services, including the maintenance of supplies and pressures, are the responsibility of the local authority concerned.  The Department's function is limited to prioritising, assessing and providing funding for new or improved water and sewerage facilities from among proposals submitted to us by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of overall water supply for the greater Dublin area, my Department <Col N="2148" /> is in regular and close contact with the relevant local authorities with a view to ensuring as co-ordinated an approach as possible to capital works so as to anticipate and respond to new requirements and problems.  My understanding is that the Dublin authorities are doing everything possible to ensure an equitable distribution of the available water supply.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the water and sanitary services programme in 1994 will amount to an historically high £122 million.  By any standards this is a very significant investment, as is the provision of approximately £605 million in the National Development Plan for the period 1994-99.  Maintaining this high level of capital provision is seen by the Government as the logical consequence of the commitments given in the 1990 Environment Action Programme.</P>
    <P>The greater Dublin area has already benefited from a substantial share of recent investment in water services.  Since 1990 over £44 million has been spent on water and sanitary facilities in the area. This has enabled the completion of several important schemes including the contract 1B of the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant, which increased daily capacity at the plant to 50 million gallons.  In addition, my Department has recently approved the advertisment of tenders for the next phase of this scheme which will increase treatment capacity to 70 million gallons per day.  The provision of a sophisticated telemetry system to enable the management not only of water production, but also for the distribution of supplies, was completed in 1993.  In addition, work is ongoing on the rehabilitation of Dublin watermains.</P>
    <P>The problem experienced with the water supply in the Dublin area largely relate to quantity.  These problems are being addressed by the Department on a number of fronts: source augmentation, the provision of trunk delivery mains and the refurbishment of the various distribution systems.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the plans for the development of the Ballymore Eustace plant.  Two further schemes are central to alleviating the problems in the <Col N="2149" /> north city area.  The benefits of the first of these, the north city arterial watermain, will come on-stream in February when phase one of this scheme is commissioned. The second scheme is the Leixlip water treatment plant.  In this regard, the Department has had extensive discussions with the Fingal Council in relation to the upgrading and expansion of plant capacity.  In addition, tenders for a new intake at Leixlip are being examined in the Department.  A decision in relation to these tenders will be made in the context of the 1994 provision.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the Government has made, and is set to continue, substantial investment in Dublin's water infrastructure.  I would like to assure the Deputy that everything possible, both short and long term, is being done to ensure that an adequate supply of good quality drinking water is available to the people of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue which relates to one of my constituents who abided by all the rules and regulations governing the social welfare system.  I raise this matter to illustrate how sometimes it does not pay to abide by the rules and regulations and to be honest.</P>
      <P>One of my constituents who was made redundant some years ago could easily have decided to go on the dole and take life easy, but instead he used the few pounds he received on redundancy to set up a business with a colleague.  Unfortunately the recession caused the business to partially fold after a few years. His colleague agreed to hire him so as to prevent the business folding entirely.  In order to put matters on a proper footing I advised him at the time &mdash; he agreed to this &mdash; to register for unemployment assistance and not to sign on and work at the same time, as some people do.  He abided by the rules and regulations and did the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything was okay until an investigating <Col N="2150" /> officer decided to interview him. I appreciate that the investigating officer was fully in order in carrying out the interview &mdash; fraud needs to get detected &mdash; but I want to stress that the interview was carried out in a subjective way.  I was not at all impressed with the report of the interview.  In fairness to the person who carried out the interview, who is not present to defend himself or herself, I will not go into the details of this investigation. I stress that the person being interviewed was honest and straight-forward at all times.  He signed off on the days he was working in accordance with the regulations and abided by all the rules.  The only thanks he has received for his honesty has been the non-payment of any social welfare benefit since last July.  In an effort to be of assistance somebody decided to consider whether he was eligible for unemployment benefit.  Of course, under one of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; measures which still applies in that area a person who does not suffer a substantial loss of income during the previous 13 weeks does not qualify for unemployment benefit.  Following the due process, the powers that be decided that he did not suffer a substantial loss of income by working for two or three days and signing on for the other days.</P>
    <P>Slowly but surely this man is being ground down and concerned in a very small area.  People in such circumstances normally go into the black economy and draw dole full-time.  I am not saying that this man will go into the black economy &mdash; he is very honest.  I am asking the Minister to do something about this case and other possible cases.  The people who defraud the system do not declare themselves. People who have a name and number are not the ones who cause the problems.  I ask the Minister urgently to investigate this case with a view to ensuring that this man is fairly and honestly treated, in the same way as he treated the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputy Durkan.  The person concerned was fully employed up <Col N="2151" /> to January 1988 as a shareholder-director employee with a firm in Leixlip.  On termination of his employment he applied for unemployment assistance and qualified for the maximum rate with no means assessed against him from 26 January 1988.  Payment of unemployment assistance continued up to 5 July 1993 when, following a review, his claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that he had failed to fully disclose his means.</P>
      <P>The investigating officer involved, having fully examined the case and having interviewed the applicant on a number of occasions, was not satisfied that all means had been fully disclosed as required under the Social Welfare Acts. It was considered that he had some other source or sources of income.</P>
      <P>The applicant was informed that he had the right of appeal against this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 7 July 1993 but it was not returned.  He has not yet formally lodged an appeal.</P>
      <P>Following representations from the Deputy on the applicant's behalf the case was submitted to another investigating officer for review.  This officer also concluded that the applicant's means were not fully disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inquiries were also necessary to establish if the person concerned had an entitlement to unemployment benefit on foot of his pay related social insurance contributions from casual employment from 1988.  The Department had great difficulty in determining from the applicant's employer details of his casual employment.  That is according to the records of the investigating officer. The Deputy submitted a statement to the Department on the applicant's behalf in relation to the employment.  A deciding officer determined that the applicant had an entitlement to unemployment benefit from 1 January 1991.  As the applicant had been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate no additional payment was due to him.  He was not entitled to unemployment benefit <Col N="2152" /> from January 1990 as there were insufficient contributions paid or credited in the 1988-89 contribution year.</P>
    <P>He was deemed to have requalified for unemployment benefit with effect from 12 January 1993.  It was then necessary to determine the extent of his casual employment.  Accordingly, his employer was asked to specify the number of days worked by the applicant in the 13 week period prior to 12 January 1993.  This was required in order to establish if the applicant had sustained a substantial loss of employment in accordance with social welfare legislation introduced in January 1993.  It has been established that the applicant's normal level of insurable employment was two days per week.  As he is currently working two to three days per week, he does not sustain a substantial loss of employment and, therefore, is not entitled to payment of unemployment benefit in respect of days of proven unemployment in any week that he is employed for two or more days.</P>
    <P>The applicant was informed of this decision on 7 December and was also informed that if he was not satisfied with this decision he should lodge an appeal within 21 days.  No appeal has been received to date.</P>
    <P>In April 1991 social insurance cover was extended to all employees earning £25 or more.  This extension of social insurance cover benefited a considerable number of workers in that for the first time they could qualify for a range of services including unemployment, disability and maternity benefit at graduated rates of payment.  The substantial loss of employment provision was introduced in tandem with this extension of social insurance cover with effect from January 1993.</P>
    <P>As indicated in this House this morning, provision of £1 million has been made in the budget to allow changes to be implemented in the rules governing entitlement to benefit, with particular reference to the substantive loss of employment provision.  The precise way in which this will be done is under consideration and details will be announced <Col N="2153" /> in the context of the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I stress again to the Deputy that his constituent is entitled to lodge an appeal and we would welcome such a move.  The Deputy is invited to attend the appeal if he wishes with his constituent and the deciding officer will consider the case again but he must lodge an appeal.  I ask Deputy Durkan to inform his constituent of the technical requirements in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the late spring and early summer of last year we had exceptionally heavy rainfall to the point where for the two months of May and June rainfall in County Dublin was almost three times the normal level.  In counties Kildare and Wicklow it was almost two and a half times the normal level and in County Wexford it was two and a quarter times the normal level.  That was followed by persistent rain through the months of June and July.</P>
      <P>That has created enormous problems for a great many agricultural and horticultural producers in those areas.  The case of the horticultural producers and potato growers in north Dublin and south Meath is well documented; we have heard all about it although the Minister has taken no action in this regard so far. In fact, in most cases huge proportions of their crops were literally washed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to cereals, sugar beet, fodder beet, potatoes and other crops, in County Wexford a total of 11,124 acres were seriously damaged and 6,241 acres were destroyed.  That has created an enormous income problem for those growers.  Their position at the moment is that not only have they been unable to pay last year's bills but they are not in a position now to request the kind of credit they would normally seek in order to start a new year's operation.  Most of these people have lost a huge proportion of the output <Col N="2154" /> of their farms for the season, including 1993, and the majority of them are simply not in a position to restart production for this year.  Therefore, their situation is extremely perilous.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that he was making available £1 million to deal with the problem.  That would not begin to deal with even a part of the financing problem that those producers face.  However, so far as the Minister has not released any application forms for this money and he tried to persuade the listening public last night that the problem was that farmers had not bothered to apply for any of this aid.  Farmers cannot apply for this aid because no application forms have been made available. The Minister for Finance announced yesterday in the budget that £1 million was being made available.  This is the same £1 million that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced some weeks ago.  Not only are they trying to pull the wool over our eyes, they are trying to spend the same £1 million twice.  They are making it impossible to allocate this aid because no application forms for this aid are available.</P>
    <P>That sum of money will go nowhere towards meeting the problem.  These people do not want handouts, they want assistance to enable them to begin to fund their operations for this year, taking account of the fact that most of their income for last year was literally washed out and they have no basis on which to start their operations this year.</P>
    <P>What concerns me most is that I can find no evidence that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry understands the problem.  For example, last summer he told me when we were three feet deep in Rathangan trying to harvest silage that he had seen no weather problems anywhere in the country.  As far as I can determine he has not sought anything other than the £1 million that has been made available.  If the Minister thought for one moment about the problem and took the advice of the Teagasc officials who have carried out detailed surveys, he would find that there is a <Col N="2155" /> major financing problem for this relatively small number of growers in north Dublin, south Meath, along the coastal strip of Wicklow and in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now take some action to put in place something similar to the funding system that was announced for small businesses yesterday in the budget under which finance is being made available at 6¼ per cent to help them get over their difficulties?  I would like to ask the Minister if he would begin to consider a measure such as that.  He should wipe the slate clean in regard to what has not been done up to now and start again.  Will the Minister discuss this problem with representatives of the growers involved? Last Monday week, for example, the Minister promised to meet the then President of the IFA, Alan Gillis, following a meeting on a national pay agreement to discuss this matter.  That meeting fell through.  The Minister has not met any of the representatives of these people.  I would like him to undertake now to meet the representatives of these groups, come forward with some reasonable system for financing so that they can get their operations underway again and resolve a problem that should have been resolved a long time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes is aware, I announced in November that I was providing £1 million for the purpose of assisting horticulture and potato growers who suffered a major or total crop losses due to the period of difficult weather in the spring of 1993. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern confirmed during yesterday's Budget Statement that this same money is being made available.  Both the Minister for Horticulture, Deputy Brian O'Shea and I have met with producer representatives on this matter, as has the Minister for Finance.  I want to say straightaway that we are continuing our consultations and have arranged to meet with representatives again on Thursday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the horticulture and potato sector the principal crop affected is the potato <Col N="2156" /> crop.  My information is that the bad weather resulted in a general reduction in yields.  However, as a result of the reduced production, potato stocks have been lower than at this time last year. The reduced stocks have resulted in significant price increases which, in many cases, have compensated farmers for the losses in yield.  The current producer price of, for example, Kerr's Pink is about £155 per tonne compared with £105 per tonne this time last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right if one has tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, Records are getting about £115 per tonne compared with £55 per tonne last year.  I recognise that some farmers in potato and horticultural production were seriously affected.  That is why I am endeavouring to do what I can for them and why I am in consultation with groups from the regions affected.  I acknowledge that there is a problem and I am endeavouring to do something about it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cereal sector, while I accept that harvest yields for cereals were somewhat disappointing in 1993, market prices remained firm and were broadly in line with prices for the previous year.  This was despite a cut of around 19 per cent in the intervention support price which in theory should have led to a similar reduction in market prices.  To compensate them for the reduction in the support prices, producers were paid arable aid at the rate of £148.42 per hectare and a total of approximately £45 million was paid to them in 1993.  Therefore, the combination of firm market prices and the payment of arable aid compensated farmers for any reduction in yields.</P>
      <P>Bad weather must be accepted as part of the normal risk associated with the growing of crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>However, despite the balancing effect of improved prices, I <Col N="2157" /> want to put on record again that I accept that a number of growers in the worst affected areas have been very seriously affected.  It is my intention that the assistance available will be confined to those people.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Health, amid his busy schedule, for coming into the House this evening.  I am raising a case in respect of which I am aware the Minister has been briefed by the parents of the child who died only last weekend.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to instigate an immediate inquiry into the failure by staff at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, to operate standard international neurological management practices in the case of a child referred to Beaumont Hospital by Wexford General Hospital following a serious head injury which resulted in his death.</P>
      <P>I speak of a six year old boy who, tragically, sustained a very serious head/neck injury accidentally at a gate in Barntown in Wexford, an area with which the Minister will be very familiar. When he was brought to Wexford General Hospital a major paediatric head injury was identified and the normal standard neurological practices put into play. As he was not breathing he was immediately ventilated and given mannitol, both practices to reduce the size of the brain and to prevent swelling of the brain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was referred immediately to the neurological unit at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.  When he arrived there those on duty and in charge failed to operate what can only be described as standard, international neurological management practices for any serious head injury.  It is that which must be questioned and investigated in detail.  Those in Beaumont Hospital insisted that he be taken off the ventilator when he arrived, an extraordinary and shocking act given his serious head injury.  Despite the protestations <Col N="2159" /> of the nurse and those who had accompanied the child by ambulance from Wexford &mdash; they even referred them to those in Wexford who had been treating him &mdash; those in charge at Beaumont Hospital insisted, went ahead and took the child off the ventilator.  Within 24 hours the child's brain had swollen, which would have been expected given the injury he had sustained, and very shortly and tragically he died.</P>
    <P>The questionable neurological management practice is what I want the Minister to investigate.  The trauma for the parents on losing their six year old boy through this accident is one thing but to have question marks about how their child was subsequently treated compounds their anguish and heartbreak. Apart from this case &mdash; tragically nothing can be done for the boy concerned &mdash; we must learn all we can about procedures involved because, at present, few people in Wexford General Hospital could refer people to Beaumont with an easy conscience.  It is the major concern about other referrals that underlines the urgent need for the immediate investigation and reporting by the Department on this case.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this tragic death will have taught us all something about practices. It is a delicate case.  I know there is so much only the Minister can say here this evening, but as he knows the case and the people involved I know I can trust <Col N="2160" /> him to immediately instigate a report, followed by a medical inquiry, into why standard international neurological management practices were not operated when this serious paediatric head injury case was transferred from Wexford General Hospital to Beaumont Hospital last July.</P>

The fact that the Parliament drew attention to the lack of gender balance among the nominees and the fact that there were no women among the group proposed will be carefully noted by the Council and by the member states.</P>

      <P>The Brussels European Council held in October 1993 set the objective of completing the current round of enlargement negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway by 1 March 1994.  Accession of the new member states would then take place on 1 January 1995, following ratification of the accession treaties by both the <Col N="2082" /> member states and the applicant countries and consideration of the matter by the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are led on the Union side by the Presidency and the Commission which act on the basis of negotiating positions established in advance by the member states.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in the negotiations to date and ministerial meetings at the end of last year succeeded in closing a significant number of chapters. As is often the case, a number of more difficult topics have been left until close to the end.  Detailed and intensive work will be necessary notably on regional policy, agriculture, the budget of the enlarged Union and fisheries in coming weeks in order to respect the deadline. With effort and good will on all sides it should be possible to complete the negotiations in accordance with the schedule established by the European Council.</P>
      <P>Ireland has welcomed the prospect of early membership of the Union for these applicants.  Irish economic and political relations with them are excellent and they have much to contribute to the process of European integration.  No major obstacles relating to Irish interests have been encountered in the negotiations to date.</P>
      <P>The implications for the Union and for Ireland of the negotiations in all of the remaining areas are being followed closely.  Our national input to the formulation of the Union's draft negotiating positions as established by the Commission involves a careful and co-ordinated inter-Departmental analysis of the issues at stake.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has followed with concern the deteriorating situation in Sudan since the coup of 1989.</P>
      <P>Southern Sudan in particular has had to endure much human suffering and misery as a result of the ongoing civil war and famine.</P>
      <P>Ireland has frequently expressed concern about human rights violations in Sudan.  The Irish Ambassador to Khartoum has, on instruction, discussed these concerns with the Sudanese authorities and the issue has also been raised by my Department with the ambassador of Sudan to Ireland.  Ireland co-sponsored Resolutions on human rights in Sudan at the United Nations in 1992 and 1993, as well as at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in early 1993.</P>
      <P>In April 1993, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs visited Khartoum and raised Ireland's concerns about the humanitarian tragedy in the south.  Following his visit, he wrote to UN Under Secretary-General Jonah, urging greater involvement by the UN on both the humanitarian and political fronts.</P>
      <P>At my meeting in New York last September I raised the issue with UN Secretary-General Dr Boutros BoutrosGhali and discussed the situation in detail with him.  I have also taken the matter up with the US authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has also provided humanitarian assistance to help in alleviating the suffering and Irish voluntary organisations have been active in Sudan.  In 1993, the Government allocated £1.26 million from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for relief operations in Sudan.  Most of this assistance has been channelled through Irish voluntary agencies such as Concern and <Col N="2084" /> GOAL for their respective emergency health and feeding programmes in Southern Sudan.  In addition, we contributed £350,000 to the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan.  The conflict in Sudan has also created a huge problem of displaced people and we have contributed £100,000 to relief programmes from Sudanese refugees which are operated by GOAL, Concern and the Irish Mill Hill Fathers.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing humanitarian assistance and food aid in Southern Sudan, Ireland has had a bilateral aid programme in Sudan since 1975.  In 1993, the Government also provided £128,242 through the NGO Co-funding Scheme, in support of a number of small local projects undertaken by Irish and local Sudanese NGOs.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government have welcomed from the outset President Clinton's consistent interest and concern in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the course of my meeting with the President in Washington on 16 November, I explained to him the importance which the Government attached to the efforts which we were making with the British Government at that time to create a framework capable of delivering lasting peace, stability and reconciliation.  I found him to be extremely supportive of these efforts and willing to make whatever contribution he could to assist them towards a successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any contacts on this issue which may have taken place between the President and the British Prime Minister arose because of the President's own decision, and not at the behest of the Irish Government. The Government greatly appreciate the strong support which the <Col N="2085" /> President expressed for the Joint Declaration which the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister signed on 15 December 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Together with our European Union partners, Ireland has implemented in full the sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolutions 748 of 31 March 1992 and 883 of 11 November 1993. Ireland fully supports these resolutions through which sanctions were imposed upon Libya because of its failure to comply with UN Security Council demands that it co-operate fully with the investigation into the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie and of UTA flight 772 over Niger.  A total of 441 innocent lives were lost in these two appalling outrages.  Three of the Pan Am victims were Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Security Council has demanded that the two Libyan nationals accused of the Lockarbie should stand trial in the appropriate United Kingdom or United States court, and that the Libyan Government satisfy the French judicial authorities <Col N="2086" /> with respect to the bombing of flight UTA 772.</P>
    <P>Ireland endorses the view of the Security Council that the Libyan authorities have not yet fully co-operated with the French and British investigations into the two bombings.  Until such time as they do, we will continue to support the maintenance of these sanctions.  On 10 December 1993, the Security Council renewed the sanctions imposed by Resolution 748 for a further 120 days.</P>
    <P>The question of any further sanctions against Libya would be a matter for the Security Council to decide upon.</P>

      <P>The 80 strong Irish transport contingent has been carrying out its functions in an exemplary manner since its arrival in Baidoa on 4 September 1993.  The former UN Force Commander, General Bir, has praised the highly professional standard of the contingent. The unit fulfils a key function in servicing transportation requirements of other countries' contingents in the region.  The participation of the Irish troops in UNOSOM reflects Ireland's strong commitment to helping Somalia and its people.</P>
      <P>In November last year the Security Council decided to undertake a fundamental review of the mandate of UNOSOM by February 1994.  To this end they requested the Secretary-General to report on the situation in Somalia and to provide an updated plan setting out UNOSOM II's future concerted strategy. The Secretary-General reported to the Security Council on 6 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He finds that while the level of security in the countryside is far superior to that <Col N="2087" /> of 18 months ago the Mogadishu area remains tense.  Progress towards national reconciliation and reconstruction, which is essential to Somalia's future, has run into the major obstacle of deep division between the two main factional groups &mdash; the Group of Twelve, of which the most prominent leader is Ali Mahdi Mohamad, and the Somali National Alliance (SNA), under General Aidid.</P>
    <P>Peace talks between the factions, which were held in Addis Ababa, broke down on 11 December.  A key task of UNOSOM in the coming weeks will be to unblock the process of national reconciliation between the Somali factions.</P>
    <P>In so far as the future of UNOSOM is concerned the Secretary-General has outlined three options relating to the mandate and functioning of UNOSOM as regards security</P>
    <P>&mdash;the first is a continuation of UNOSOM II's current mandate with the addition of an extra brigade.  This would call for disarmament, coercive is necessary, as well as a capability for defence against attacks on UNOSOM's personnel</P>
    <P>&mdash;the second option calls for voluntary disarmament and the deployment of about 16,000 troops to protect ports, convoys and refugees</P>
    <P>&mdash;the third option calls for the deployment of 5,000 troops which would keep control over Mogadishu airport as well as other important ports and airports.</P>
    <P>Although his preference was for the first option, the Secretary-General has recommended the second for consideration by the Security Council.  This option was chosen because he considered it &ldquo;extremely doubtful&rdquo; that the required level of resources would be available after 31 March to continue UNOSOM's current mandate.</P>
    <P>Ireland's participation in the UNOSOM operation falls to be reviewed by the Government in the normal way before the end of February.  In this connection I await with interest the review to be conducted by the Security Council <Col N="2088" /> and the decisions it will take on the future of the Force.</P>
    <P>In addition the Minister for Defence will be reporting to the Dáil in the near future on the operational aspects of Ireland's commitment to UNOSOM in accordance with the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General has confirmed that whatever option is selected for the future of UNOSOM, the UN will continue its efforts to promote national reconciliation and institution-building. He states clearly that without an adequate UN force there would be an early resumption of civil strife.  I agree with this.</P>
    <P>I believe that the international community, through the UN, has played and will continue to play an important role in providing humanitarian assistance to the Somali people, and in helping the process of national reconciliation.  Ireland will continue to be active in support of that effort.</P>

      <P>The Government is continuing to support strongly, in line with its commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the process of developing and strengthening the CSCE in response to the new security situation that has emerged in Europe following the end of the Cold War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decisions of the Helsinki Summit in July, 1992, pointed the way for the enhanced role that the CSCE can play in the new European Security architecture. They led to the establishment, in Vienna, of a new Forum for Security Co-operation <Col N="2089" /> to undertake new negotiations on arms control, disarmament and confidenceand security-building, as well as a new capability in the area of conflict prevention.  Last year, a Secretary General of the organisation was appointed, and new structures have been put in place in Vienna to help ensure that the CSCE can respond to serious threats to peace and security in the CSCE area.  In response to these changes, Ireland's delegation to the CSCE in Vienna has been strengthened by the establishment recently of a new separate post of Head of Delegation.  With these additional resources, the Irish delegation will be able to maintain its involvement in the expanding workload of the CSCE.</P>
    <P>At another level, the Government has been providing practical support for the ongoing conflict prevention and observer missions of the CSCE.  In former Yugoslavia, the EC Monitor Mission, in which there are currently six Irish personnel serving, is working under a CSCE mandate, with participants from several non-EC CSCE member states. We have indicated our readiness to provide personnel to the CSCE long term missions in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvojdina if these are reactivated, and next week, two customs officials will begin a tour of duty with the Sanction Assistance Mission in Macedonia.  In addition, an Irish officer will soon take up duty with the CSCE Mission to Georgia. The question of Irish participation in other CSCE missions is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>We have also been participating in a wide range of CSCE meetings and seminars relating to security in Europe.  In addition, I would like to express my appreciation to the Members of this House who attended, in the summer of last year, the CSCE parliamentary assembly in Helsinki.</P>

      <P>Enlargement negotiations are currently under way with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. These negotiations, which are entering their final stage, involve the applicant countries taking on the body of treaty provisions, laws and rules on which the European Union is structured.  It is expected that the applicant countries will be in a position to join the European Union by 1 January, 1995.</P>
      <P>The focus in European integration at present is on the application of the provisions of the Treaty on European Union which came into effect on 1 November, 1993.  The Treaty provides for economic and monetary union, a common foreign and security policy, strengthening the powers of the European Parliament, a range of justice and home affairs matters and other issues including the social charter. These provisions amount to a significant enhancement of the process of European integration.</P>
      <P>All the applicant countries in negotiation have indicated that they accept and are willing to implement in full the provisions of the Treaty on European Union from the time of accession.  Their membership should therefore lead to a boost to the integrative process, as previous enlargements of the Community have done.</P>
      <P>Beyond the current round of enlargement, applications from Turkey, Malta, Cyprus and Switzerland remain under consideration.  In addition, the European Council in Copenhagen last June agreed that the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the Union once they are able to assume the obligations of membership.  The European Council on that occasion also noted that an important consideration would be the capacity of the Union to absorb new members while maintaining the momentum of European integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> It can be expected that the enlargement issue will be prominent on the Union agenda for some time to come. At the same time the member states will implement the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and will have the opportunity to review how aspects of the Treaty are working during an intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996.  Ireland continues to favour closer integration of the Union in a balanced way while at the same time being open to its responsibilities to our European neighbours who are entitled to seek membership.</P>

      <P>Norway applied to join the European Community in November 1992.  The Commission evaluated the application and found that Norway was already highly integrated with the Community in the economic area, that its accession would not pose insuperable problems and that it would indeed strengthen the Union in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>That view was endorsed by the Council of Ministers and negotiations opened in April 1993 and are ongoing.  They are led on the European Union side by the Presidency and the Commission.</P>
      <P>In general Ireland has welcomed the prospect of early membership of the Union for countries like Norway.  Our economic and political relations have been close and we share a similarity of views on a range of issues on the European and international agenda.  Norway has much to contribute to the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full impact of Norwegian accession both for the Union and for Ireland as a member state can be precisely and globally assessed only when the negotiations have been completed in all sectors. Some of the most important areas such as agriculture, regional policy, fisheries <Col N="2092" /> and the question of budget contribution are still under negotiation.  Together with other member states Ireland takes part in the formulation of Union negotiating positions to be put to Norway. The Irish input to this process involves a careful and co-ordinated inter-Departmental analysis of the issues at stake and the implications for this country of negotiating positions proposed by the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union is set out in Article J.4 of the Maastricht Treaty.  Under these provisions the European Union may request the Western European Union to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.  The Treaty called on the Foreign Ministers of the Union to adopt the necessary practical arrangements in agreement with the institutions of the Western European Union.  The European Council, meeting in Brussels on 29 <Col N="2093" /> October last, endorsed a set of proposals made by the Foreign Ministers on the arrangements that will govern the relations between the Union and the Western European Union.  These are set out in document 9252/1/93 a copy of which has been placed in the Dáil Library.  They cover such matters as the kinds of situations in which the Union may make a request to the Western European Union, consultation procedures between the Union and the Western European Union, co-operation between the Presidencies of the Union and the Western European Union, and the synchronisation of the dates and venues of meetings.</P>
    <P>Although the Maastricht Treaty specifies that the Western European Union is &ldquo;an integral part of the development of the Union&rdquo; the Western European Union remains a separate organisation operating within its own Treaty framework &mdash; the Brussels Treaty of 1948.  The arrangements agreed by the European Council make it clear that decisions of the Western European Union are to be taken in accordance with the decision-making procedures of that organisation.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals at the moment for the further development of the Treaty relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Western European Union Permanent Council on 18 January, which Ireland attended as an observer, the Spanish delegation invited all members, associates and observers of the Western European Union to participate in a joint military exercise which is being conducted by France, Italy and Spain from 15 to 25 November next.  The Government does not intend to participate in this exercise.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, in the period that has elapsed since agreement was reached on the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, there has been a significant evolution in the international security situation.  This change has been most marked in Europe in the aftermath of the ending of the Cold War.  It is reflected in the major reappraisal of their roles being undertaken <Col N="2094" /> by bodies such as Western European Union, NATO and the CSCE and the development of new forms of co-operation, such as the &ldquo;Partnership for Peace&rdquo; initiative.  The review of the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union which will take place at an Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, and to which I have referred in the reply to an earlier question, will need to take account of such changes.  As I have already indicated to this House, there is a need for a full and informed discussion on the question of European security and defence in the light of the ongoing developments in this area and in preparation for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  I am currently considering the possibility of publishing a document on the matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of nuclear weapons, Ireland's opposition to nuclear weapons is of long-standing and well-known.  Successive Governments have made clear our policy of seeking the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a nuclear test ban treaty. This remains our policy.</P>

      <P>Article 138 (b) of the EC Treaty requires the European Parliament to draw-up proposals for the establishment of a uniform procedure for election to the Parliament which will apply in all member states.  The European Union Treaty which came into force on 1 November 1993 provides that the Council will lay down the appropriate provisions with the assent of the Parliament.</P>
      <P>On 10 March 1993 the Parliament adopted a resolution proposing a uniform procedure.  This procedure would be based on proportional representation and a list system.  The Council of Ministers has yet to debate the proposals from Parliament.  I think it is most unlikely that in the time remaining before the European Parliament elections, the Council will be able to adopt a position on Parliament's proposals and secure its assent to that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will give careful consideration to the Parliament's proposals when they come to be debated in Council.  The principle that the electoral system should be <Col N="2096" /> based on a system of proportional representation which is fundamental to the Parliament's position, is one which we share.  Nevertheless, electoral procedures are particularly sensitive and existing procedures are rooted in the historical development of democracy in each member state.  Consequently, I anticipate a complex debate in the Council on the details of Parliament's proposal and extensive exchanges with the Parliament before agreement is reached.</P>
    <P>The agreement at the Edinburgh European Council to increase the number of members of the European Parliament was given effect by a Council decision on 1 February last.  This decision is directly applicable under Community law and its implementation does not require legislation in Ireland as there is no change in the number of Irish MEP's.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the speech made by the President of the Commission to the Institute of International Strategic Studies in Brussels.  He was speaking in his own name and was not expressing a position agreed by the member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Under Article J.4.2 of the Treaty, issues arising under the Common Foreign and Security Policy which have defence implications may be referred to the Western European Union for elaboration and implementation.  Relations between the Western European Union and the Atlantic Alliance are a matter for the member states of those organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion on the scope and content of a future common defence policy and on the question of a common defence are for further negotiations.  The Maastricht Treaty specifically provides for an intergovernmental <Col N="2098" /> conference in 1996 to review the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>
    <P>The results of these negotiations will have to be agreed unanimously by all the member states.  Moreover, the Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that the outcome of any future negotiation that would involve Ireland's participation in a Common Defence Policy will be put to the people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>Following the imposition by the UN Security Council of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia-Montenegro, it was decided, in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to assist the states bordering Serbia and Montenegro in enforcing these sanctions.  Many of these new states did not, and indeed still do not, possess the means to enforce strictly the UN sanctions.  Sanctions assistance missions were, therefore, established, to which CSCE participating states were asked to contribute.  These are the missions to which the Deputy refers.  Ireland, <Col N="2099" /> together with most of our partners in the European Union, and many other CSCE states, offered to participate in these missions. The decision to participate, in Ireland's case, reflected our involvement in the CSCE and also in the ongoing efforts of the European Union to help bring about a peaceful settlement to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to provide two customs officials, selected on a voluntary basis, to serve in the sanctions assistance mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Civil Service vacancies are concerned the position is that virtually all Departments and offices have since 1991 operated a system of administrative budgets.  Under this arrangement, the allocation of resources, provided in the administrative budget, between payroll costs and other administrative expenditure is a matter for departmental decision and it is for Departments to decide, without reference to my Department, whether any alteration in its staffing <Col N="2102" /> level up to middle management level is desirable.</P>
    <P>In relation to posts above these levels, departmental managements are expected to keep their organisation, structures and staffing dispositions constantly under review to ensure effective and efficient use of staffing resources and this may result in alterations of staffing profiles as vacancies occur.  In addition, sanction to fill vacancies is forthcoming only where my Department is convinced that the continuance of a post is essential to the effective operation of a Department or service and where its filling can be accommodated within the constraints of the budgetary allocation of the Department or office concerned.</P>

The areas where the allowance was to be paid were determined on the basis of districts.  These are Garda administrative areas &mdash; each comprising five or six stations &mdash; under the supervision of superintendents.

I will, of course, continue to exercise overall policy supervision, provide a block grant to the authority and carry out certain quasi-judical functions in relation to national roads, including the determination of compulsory purchase orders and motorway schemes.</P>
      <P>A compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of lands necessary for the proposed Donegal town bypass was received from Donegal County Council on 24 September 1993.  A public local inquiry has recently been held into the objections made to me against confirmation of the order and into the propriety of confirming it in so far as it relates to extinguishment of public rights-of-way.

      <P>The person named applied for reserve quota under category 2 of the terms and conditions for allocation of reserve quota.  This category provides for reserve quota to be allocated to flockowners who can demonstrate that the operation of the quota limits will jeopardise the viability of their holdings and who have embarked on (i) a farm improvement plan involving sheep production drawn up by 1 January 1993 or (ii)  a finance restructuring plan related to sheep production drawn up in conjunction with Teagasc by 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>The person named was initially notified that he was ineligible for reserve quota because the date the farm improvement plan was drawn up appeared to be after 1 January 1993 due to the poor condition of the copy received with the application for reserve quota.  He is now being notified that he has been allocated a reserve quota of four premium rights based on the difference between the quota already allocated to him and the number of eligible ewes he presented under the 1993 ewe premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The National Heritage Council distributes national lottery funds, subject to my approval, to heritage projects which come within its specific terms of reference. I understand that the council received an application for grant assistance towards the cost of the restoration of St. Mary's Church of Ireland, Maynooth, County Kildare, in October 1991.  The work involved included the restoration of the church tower.</P>
      <P>A condition of any grant assistance awarded by the National Heritage Council is that it must be used to complete the work involved.  In this case the council decided that St. Mary's Church of Ireland restoration committee would need to have a much greater percentage of its own funding in place before the council could consider this project for grant assistance.  The restoration committee was informed of the council's decision and asked to resubmit its application when a more substantial amount of the funding required has been raised.  To date the restoration committee has not resubmitted its application.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare administers a third level allowance scheme, which allows the older long term unemployed, who obtain a place at third level, the opportunity to pursue their studies while retaining entitlement to their unemployment payments.  Participants must be aged 23 years, or over, and have been in receipt of a payment for at least 12 months.  Higher education grants are not assessable against their social welfare entitlements.  That scheme was extended to include lone parents from the beginning of the 1993-94 academic year.</P>
