      <P>I wish to be associated with congratulations to Deputy Harney. It was a fitting tribute to a person who has made a big impact in a relevant way. I ask the assistance of the Chair in respect of the point raised by Deputy De Rossa. That matter was raised on Tuesday and Foreign Affairs questions will not be raised again until 25 May.  Unfortunately, because of the length of time devoted to the Taoiseach's questions we only reached Priority Questions yesterday and questions tabled on this matter were not dealt with.  Will the Tánaiste convey to his fellow foreign Ministers that there is a need for them to meet again today to decide what action can be taken.  They should not sit idly by while we read the heartbreaking letter from an Irish citizen written from a bunker in Gorazde and killings continue day in day out.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to give credit where it is due. My predecessor, Deputy Woods, is the author of this legislation and I see myself as the facilitator.  When I received the bones of the legislation I pursued the matter quickly and that is why the Bill is before the House with such alacrity.  Deputy Woods acted diligently on behalf of the workers of Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>My sentiments in introducing this Bill are a mixture of sadness and satisfaction; sadness at the recollection of the demise in November 1984 of Irish Shipping Limited after more than 40 years' service to the State; satisfaction because the Bill acknowledges the exceptional circumstances in which more than 300 employees found themelves because of the liquidation of the company and makes appropriate and equitable retribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited was established by statute in 1947 as a wholly-owned State company.  As most Deputies are aware, the company came into operation to meet the economic and trading requirements of the State during the Emergency in World War II.  Irish Shipping crews played a significant and heroic role in ensuring that essential goods were supplied to the State during those years. Because of the times that were in it the nature of the service in those early years was often dangerous and difficult and all Irish people owe a debt of gratitude to the crews involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> When hostilities ceased, Irish Shipping continued and expanded its operations. The company traded successfully for more than 30 years.  Its existence underpinned the Irish national merchant fleet. The State for its part was secure in the knowledge that minimum strategic trading requirements could be met with the company's vessels.</P>
    <P>As most Deputies know the shipping industry is both cyclical and volatile.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s Irish Shipping Limited experienced a downturn in trading.  As a result the company found it could not meet its financial commitments and tragically went into liquidation in November 1984.  This event had repercussions for the company's creditors, its staff and the State.</P>
    <P>The 300 or so staff of Irish Shipping Limited who lost their jobs were perhaps the hardest hit on a human or personal level.  Overnight their situation had changed utterly.  For them a monster rather than a terrible beauty was born. One day they were in secure pensionable State sector jobs; the next they were unemployed.  Many had devoted their entire working lives to the company and found themselves discarded in middleage.</P>
    <P>The staff were entitled to and received payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The company was not in a position to pay anything more.  This was small comfort to the staff who had had an exemplary industrial relations record and who were known worldwide for their high standards of seamanship.  They had no opportunity to negotiate any terms or try to rescue jobs.  Many in the community sympathised with the staff and this sympathy was shared by Deputies on all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>For the State, the collapse of Irish Shipping Limited was unprecedented. The company which in more than one sense was a flagship of the State and of the public sector had disintegrated.  The fleet was reduced by almost half.  Thankfully, the company left a legacy of highly trained and highly qualified ships' officers and cadets, many of whom have gone on to hold key positions in shore-based <Col N="1486" /> employment, for example, as ship surveyors, harbour masters and in ship management and operation.  I am sure these people were glad to get those positions. Nevertheless, I think many of them would have liked to continue in their seafaring career.  Tragically they did not have an opportunity to pursue their real profession and to go to sea with pride.</P>
    <P>A package of incentives was introduced in 1987 to encourage investment in modernisation of the merchant fleet.  I am pleased that as a result, and in contrast to the trend in other EU member states, the fleet increased from 142,000 deadweight tons in 1986 to about 190,000 deadweight tons at present.  While I am pleased with the shipowners' response to the incentives, there is no room for complacency.  We should not stand back and let things happen; we must ensure they happen in the proper context.  The fleet and Irish seafarers face stiff competition from other EU member states and third countries.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government provides for a review of the fiscal and regulatory measures affecting our merchant fleet, with a view particularly to enhancing employment opportunities for seafarers. In line with the programme I am currently reviewing ways in which the operating climate for the shipping sector can be enhanced to support the objectives of improved services and standards, the modernisation of the Irish registered fleet and an improved ability to compete. The strategic objective is to enable Irish shipping companies to meet international competition under comparable cost conditions but without compromising on safety or the prevention of pollution.  The intention is to ensure the maintenance and creation of employment in the sector and to facilitate productive investment to modernise and expand the fleet.</P>
    <P>The review which takes EU shipping policy trends and objectives into account is being conducted in full consultation with the industry.  However, to further inform this process the Department of the Marine plans to commission shortly an economic evaluation of the sector which will also address the case for <Col N="1487" /> additional support measures conducive to an efficient and competitive shipping industry.  In that context the various incentives currently available to shipping sectors in certain other EU member states are being examined.  These can lead to a distortion of competition between EU carriers.  Considerable differentials in operation and manning costs place European shipowners generally at a distinct competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> flags of convenience.  The pressures on European, including Irish, shipowners to move to such registries which offer liberal tax and operating regimes are considerable and growing.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to speak in detail about the provisions of the Bill. It is a short Bill which, I would like to think, has all party agreement.  It certainly has the agreement of the victims of the shipping company's collapse.  I hope the Bill will be dealt with expeditiously by this House, will go quickly to the Seanad and will be signed into law by the President.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of a committee comprised of people from various Government Departments and others. It will examine the various demands and the people concerned, or there representatives where appropriate, will be compensated as a matter of urgency.  These matters can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill provides the necessary framework for implementation of the Government's decision last December to make <i>ex-gratia</i> once-off payments to certain former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  The commitment I made at that time to introduce the necessary legislation at the earliest possible date has been delivered on with speed.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill certain former employees, or the representatives of deceased former employees, will be eligible for payment of a lump sum equivalent to three weeks' pay per year of service up to a ceiling of £50,000 per employee.  It is expected that more than 300 people will qualify for payment, at a gross cost to the State of £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> Those entitled to payment are persons who, at the date of liquidation of the company &mdash; 14 November 1984 &mdash; were employees of the company who had at that date at least two years' continuous employment and who make application for payment in the manner to be specified. Only those former employees who are eligible for payment may receive payment, as agreed by the people who negotiated the settlement with the Department of the Marine.  In this context I stress that applicants must have been in the employment of Irish Shipping Limited at the date of liquidation.</P>
    <P>A committee representing Government Departments is being set up to assist with the assessment of applications once the legislation is passed by the Oireachtas.  The processing of payments to the former employees will follow as quickly as possible after the Bill becomes law.  I am not trying to rush the legislation but I think the House will agree that the objectives of the Bill are achievable. Urgency is the key word and the sooner I stop talking and let others speak the better.</P>
    <P>The committee, which has been acting on behalf of former employees in seeking compensation, has indicated that the measures contained in the Bill are acceptable. I am grateful to the committee for its attitude in this regard.  I am grateful also to the officials in the Department of the Marine who gave considerable time and energy to bringing about what is a just and equitable solution to a serious problem affecting a tragically treated section of the community.  The officials in the Department of the Marine spent long hours and engaged in hard work to bring about an end to this tragic episode.</P>
    <P>I am confident, therefore, that these measures will facilitate a solution to the problem that a sad chapter in our economic and maritime history can be finally put to rest with dignity.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, on his effort to bring these proposals before us.  I would also like to mention the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, who raised this matter on a number of occasions.  I believe his were the first comments I heard in relation to a possible solution to this problem and, hopefully, the Minister of State will be back with us in the House shortly.</P>
      <P>My comments will be relatively brief.  It is important that the Bill passes speedily through both Houses and that the committee the Minister proposes to establish will be in a position to deal with the problems and bring to a welcome end the long suffering of the former employees of Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>In a sense this Bill represents a new dawn following a long and dark decade for these employees.  Obviously we would all wish that the events of 1984 had never transpired.  I was not a Member of this House then but everybody associated with Irish Shipping would agree that it was a dark day for the shipping industry and for the country when one of our flagship industries went into liquidation. We are now in a position to make right a wrong.</P>
      <P>Reading briefly through the Official Report of 1984 one can see that grave disappointment was expressed by the employees who appeared to be left without adequate compensation.  The point can be made, of course, that the Government of the day was acting on the best advice available to it and that it felt it was taking the right action.  We are told now that there is no such thing as papal infallibility, let alone Government infallibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some minor matters in the Bill which we can debate in greater detail on Committee Stage. I would be interested, however, to hear the Minister's views on the proposed structures.  He stated that the committee acting on behalf of former employees seeking compensation is quite happy with the measures contained in the Bill but I would like to know why the Minister has decided to set up the interdepartmental committee.  He has indicated that we are making provision for the <i>ex gratia</i> once-off payments to former employees of Irish Shipping and the overall thrust is to make provisions for a compensation package.</P>
      <P>In more conventional circumstances, rates of compensation, etc. would be matters for the Employment Appeals Tribunal to decide and I would like to know why the tribunal could not have decided who is entitled to compensation and what amounts should be paid.  I am slightly puzzled as to the reason this inter-departmental committee was set up and I hope the Minister will explain this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some questions concerning the amount of moneys to be paid.  I note there will be a ceiling of £50,000 per employee.  On the basis of an overall settlement of £3.5 million, that would involve approximately 300 people.  The Bill makes provision for a maximum of three weeks pay per year of service. According to the Bill the settlement terms will comply with the redundancy Acts.  There is a limit of three weeks per year of service with a maximum payment per week of less than £300.  I believe those figures were recently revised by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  The compensation per annum would be less than £900.  I <Col N="1491" /> wonder why this three week limit was included.  Would the Minister be willing to consider increasing it to four or five weeks or is he acting strictly within the Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the point the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum compensation payable will be based on three weeks service per annum.  That is as a result of the present redundancy payments legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with it really.  It is simply the agreement that was reached between the employees and the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can deal with that later. I have noted the Minister's statement that the committee acting on behalf of the former employees has indicated general satisfaction with the Bill but I was slightly concerned as to how these figures were arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some further information on the taxation of the compensation payment.  As far as I know, the present tax free allowance in relation to compenation or redundancy payments is £11,000 and anything over that would be taxable at standard rates.  The Minister for Finance will be represented on the interdepartmental committee and I would like to know if concessions will be considered in relation to the taxation of the compensation payments, having regard to the fact that ten years have passed since these events took place. If the standard provisions apply, the compensation will be, in some instances, taxed at rates of up to 40 per cent.  Will the interdepartmental committee make representations to the Revenue Commissioners to ensure some leniency will be allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that 25 per cent of those concerned are expected to <Col N="1492" /> be liable for tax, but the Deputy's point is a fair one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the ceiling of £50,000 per employee, the Minister obviously does not expect many people to reach the upper limit.  If only 25 per cent of the employees are liable for tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the number I expect should be liable for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, 75 per cent of the people eligible for compensation will receive about £11,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with satisfaction the Minister's commitment, as per the Programme for Government, to put in place measures to increase the possibility of employment in the industry.  An economic evaluation of the sector is underway. Hopefully, the evaluation will bear fruit and the views of the committee will be made known so that they can be debated and we can examine how to take the industry forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that incentives are available elsewhere which are not available to the Irish shipping industry. If the industry is to compete on an even basis, these incentives will have to be given in so far as finance and EU regulations allow.  I hope the Minister will be able to make progress in that regard because the sad loss of so many jobs in the industry in 1984 was a body blow.  We must look to the future and put the 1984 saga to rest and work from there. There should be many opportunities for job creation and increased employment in what was once a great industry and could be again.  Like the fishing industry, grant-aid will be the key part of any aid package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party has no difficulty with this Bill.  I will tease out on Committee Stage some of the points I raised.  I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas and those who waited so long for the money due to them will be <Col N="1493" /> paid in the near future.  Everyone who looks back to 1984 with an appropriate degree of regret and sadness can at least look forward to when the matter will be righted in 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I am pleased to see the problem resolved after ten years.  I compliment the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  The question arose earlier about ministerial infallibility. I will not deal with that but it is nice to see a Minister address an issue in a humane way.  The long ten year wait is over.  I expect the Minister to consider the suggestions made in a sensible fashion and ensure that problems will be resolved.  Ten years is a long time to wait for compensation and the matter of taxation should be looked at compassionately.</P>
      <P>For years, these men and women were ignored and treated as if they were tainted by the liquidation of the company instead of being seen as the innocent victims of a State enterprise out of control. I am pleased that at last some degree of justice is being meted out to the former employees of Irish Shipping who suffered most during that unsavoury episode in our national life when the unacceptable face of a State agency was exposed in all its greed and petty vanity.</P>
      <P>We can learn lessons from the demise of Irish Shipping; we must be alert for any abuse of taxpayers' money and that calls for even closer monitoring of expenditure and an emphasis on value and cost effectiveness.  Let us not forget that Irish Shipping was out of control; the State company ran aground on the rocks of unrestraint where no adequate measures existed to track the course of its commercial decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debacle was a hard and painful lesson to learn.  The whole degrading episode damaged our national image and reflected badly on this House because, in the final analysis, we are the legislators. We are elected to run the country on behalf of the people and the failure of Irish Shipping must to some degree be attributed to our lack of awareness through the State reporting structures <Col N="1494" /> that there were serious difficulties in the company.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are two different approaches in both the public and private sectors.  While the private sector is geared towards the performance and profit ethos, the public sector is often seen as the cosy, life long, secure, bureaucratic gravy train for those who lack a vision of Ireland; a sort of semi-retirement home for those whose first allegiance is not to the State but to their own financial and material comfort.  They are doing a disservice to all the hard working men and women who strive daily to improve our country through State enterprise. While a hurtful episode like the liquidation of Irish Shipping casts a cloak of gloom over the entire public service, we must not tarnish all State employees with the same brush.</P>
    <P>Yet, how often have we, as Members of this House, had to pass the picket of former employees of Irish Shipping? These men and women were forced to take their case to the streets of our capital city in a bid to win justice.  I am sure no one likes protesting, no one likes having to walk up and down outside Leinster House with placards trying to attract public support for a complicated case.</P>
    <P>We as legislators, however, must not forget the way these people were treated. They gave years of service to Irish Shipping; they were not responsible for ill-advised business deals and commercial decisions; they did not share in the high life, they were not allowed the luxury of some of the world's highest priced hotels. They were not the decision-makers; they were not the people with power.  They were the mere workers, the men and women who were cast aside when the good for some ship hit the rocks of cold reality and the taxpayers' money went out with the ebbing tide.  It has taken a long time and many years of fruitless but sustained lobbying for that tide to turn in favour of the workers.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill. Justice is being addressed today and our standing may be restored in the eyes of the people who have endured and suffered <Col N="1495" /> most from the tragedy of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for the payment of a lump sum to certain former employees of Irish Shipping.  I note that it shall be calculated on the basis of an amount equal to three weeks pay per year of service up to the date of liquidation, subject to a maximum of £50,000 per former employee.  What is the reason for this ceiling.  Why is there a cut-off figure of £50,000?  What if a former employee, due to his or her long service with the company, is entitled to a sum in excess of £50,000? Surely natural justice would dictate that he or she be paid the rightful entitlement.  Does the Minister know how many former employees will qualify for the maximum payment of £50,000?</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision to appoint an inter-departmental committee to advise and assist him in the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  I note that the people concerned, those former employees of Irish Shipping, will have 12 months during which time they must make application for payment of the lump sum.  I urge the Minister to make special efforts to highlight the importance of this Bill and ensure that all those who qualify for payment are informed.  We tend to feel, because of our close involvement with the business of this House, that the public know what happens within these walls but very often the people outside this Chamber are preoccupied with their own very pressing concerns and do not pay much attention to the activities of their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the Bill is widely advertised so that justice can be done to those people who were treated so shabbily in the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  I am glad that the personal representatives of deceased former employees will be eligible to apply for payment.  The Minister's decision to provide £3.5 million in the Vote for the Department of the Marine for 1994 will ensure that the necessary finance is available. The establishment of an inter-departmental committee comprising <Col N="1496" /> officials from the Departments of the Marine, Finance, Enterprise and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners should ensure the smooth administration of the scheme.  I commend the Minister on this initiative.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will bring to an end a disgraceful episode in our national and maritime history, an episode which is a salutary lesson to all on how a lack of proper accountability in the disbursement of taxpayers' money can lead to humiliation and prolonged suffering for innocent workers.  If any good is to come out of this distasteful liquidation it must be that all due care and diligence has to be taken when dealing with taxpayers' money instead of the devil-may-care attitude that seems to prevail in some sections of the State service in that respect.  When there is no proper appreciation of taxpayers' money it becomes devalued, a mere commodity to be used at will by those with political power in State companies.  We must not allow this culture of careless use of State funds to take hold.  Such a retrograde step would be a disservice to people.  I hope this legislation will restore faith in our commitment to natural justice.  I wish the former employees of Irish Shipping well and urge them to make application for payment as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of this Bill marks the final passage of one chapter in the saga of Irish Shipping.  Many questions about the background to the liquidation of Irish Shipping remain unanswered but at least this Bill &mdash; albeit almost ten years later &mdash; provides some form of financial compensation for those who lost their jobs as a result of the decision of the Fine Gael-Labour Government to scuttle Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While money is never adequate compensation for jobs lost and careers ended, the eventual decision to make these payments is a vindication of the ten year struggle for justice by Irish Shipping workers.  Rarely has the treatment of workers who so loyally served the State been so shabby and never before have <Col N="1497" /> workers fought with such courage, determination and tenacity to secure justice.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years Irish Shipping workers have lobbied, campaigned, cajoled and harassed Members of this House and other public representatives to see justice done.  I have no doubt that it was the realisation by this Government that the former employees of Irish Shipping would not walk away but were prepared to continue their campaign until they dropped, rather than any commitment to justice, that persuaded the Government to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Irish Shipping workers were given little consideration in the original decision to liquidate the company.  The tone was set by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who announced the liquidation of the company to the House on 14 November 1984.  His statement takes up approximately 260 lines in the Dáil Official Report, of which just eight are devoted to the plight of the workers, despite the fact that the 350 workers had an exemplary record of commitment to the company.  From the time of the company's foundation in 1941 to its liquidation in 1984 not one day was lost through industrial action.  Irish Shipping workers risked their lives to keep people supplied with necessities during the war years.  No hint of blame or responsibility for the difficulties of the company were ever attached to the workforce who were skilled, diligent and loyal servants of the State.  These workers were the biggest losers of all &mdash; they were dismissed with just statutory redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>I have a bulging file of parliamentary questions going back to 1985 which raised the treatment of Irish Shipping workers. In that period we have had four Governments and I have lost track of the Ministers who have held responsibility for the Marine portfolio.  While Governments and faces changed, the replies, excuses and equivocation remained the same.  We were warned of the dangers of creating &ldquo;dangerous precedents&rdquo;, unstated &ldquo;legal problems&rdquo; were cited and when they could think of nothing else Ministers were prepared to dive for cover behind <Col N="1498" /> the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  While Governments could bend over backwards to rescue highly profitable concerns like Allied Irish Banks from the effect of its commercial mismanagement of for example, ICI, and introduce and enact legislation within days, the Irish Shipping workers were repeatedly put off.</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government abandoned the Irish Shipping workers, Fianna Fáil cynically exploited them for electoral purposes. We all remember the photographs in the newspapers on the eve of the 1987 general election of Deputy Haughey surrounded by uniformed Irish Shipping workers to whom he had made geneorus promises about how he would ensure that justice would be done if he was returned to power.  Two years earlier Deputy John Wilson had come into the House and proposed the following motion in private members' business.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the loyal service given by employees of Irish Shipping to the people of Ireland until the liquidation of the company in November 1984, calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  pay adequate compensation to th staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  restore the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff to their pre-liquidation level,</P>
    <P>and further calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep-sea merchant shipping fleet to provide for the reconstruction of such a fleet.</P>
    <P>I think all of us would have supported such a motion at the time.  Even though Fianna Fáil has been in power for more than seven years since and has been in a position to honour the commitments made by Deputy John Wilson in his Private Members' motion and Deputy Charles Haughey on the steps of Leinster House surrounded by uniformed officers of Irish Shipping, it is only now that it is moving to honour those commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> This Bill falls short of what Fianna Fáil demanded in 1985.  Whereas Fianna Fáil sought six weeks salary for each year of service, the Bill only provides for three weeks salary for each year of service.  The pledge to restore pensions to their pre-liquidation level has been quietly forgotten about while the promise to reconstitute a national deep-sea merchant fleet has been abandoned.</P>
    <P>While the Bill deals only with compensation for the workers affected, it again raises the circumstances behind the decision to liquidate Irish Shipping. Needless to say, if the company had not been wound up there would be no necessity for this Bill.  The decision to liquidate Irish Shipping was an act of political and financial cowardice by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, a decision for which the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, must take primary responsibility.  Having failed to exercise proper supervision over Irish Shipping and ensure that those in charge were competent to run the company, the Government panicked when the proper course should have been to seek to sort out the company's problems and put it on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>It is probably fair to say that the financial problems which faced Aer Lingus in recent years were no greater than those which faced Irish Shipping ten years ago. Irish Shipping was scuttled but Aer Lingus was saved through the co-operation of the management and the workforce, albeit after a great deal of pain, suffering and sacrifice on the part of the workforce.  The decision to scrap Irish Shipping robbed this country of the best part of its deep sea fleet, an action from which we have yet to recover.  This still leaves Ireland vulnerable and potentially isolated in the event of a major international conflict when other countries' merchant shipping can be requisitioned for military purposes, as we saw at the time of the conflicts in the Falklands and the Gulf.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental questions about Irish Shipping which have never been answered.  Why has the unnecessary liquidation of Irish Shipping cost the Irish <Col N="1500" /> taxpayer over £120 million?  While I appreciate that the Minister has to leave the House on Government business.  I would be very pleased, even at this late stage, if the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, would give the House some answers to these questions. Why has the liquidation cost the taxpayer £120 million?  Why has it cost more to liquidate Irish Shipping than it would have cost to keep it going?  Why was Irish Shipping liquidated in the first place when it could have been rescued and restored to profitability by 1987?  Who or what was responsible for turning a consistently profitable company into a massive lossmaker over a period of 18 months between 1982 and 1984?  Why were so many people appointed to the board who had so little knowledge of shipping?  Were the needs of political patronage put above the commercial needs of the company?  Why did the company enter into long term chartering arrangements in a business which, as the Minister has admitted, is cyclical, and at a time when freight prices were dropping? Why has nobody ever been called to account for the serious indictment in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on semi-State bodies of 3 April, 1985 which stated:</P>
    <P>The committee indicts:</P>
    <P>(i)  the board of the company with failure to keep itself informed of the chartering developments;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the senior executives involved in the chartering agreements with acting without authority and apparently independently of the board,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Finance with failure to adequately monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>When will the taxpayers be given an explanation for the scandal of the Irish Spruce which cost twice as much to build at Verolme as it would have cost to build elsewhere, which cost the taxpayer £60 <Col N="1501" /> million to get out of the leasing arrangements and to pay for maintenance at Marseilles and which was eventually sold for a mere £3.75 million?  Why, at the height of the company's financial troubles, were some of its senior executives swanning around major maritime cities on seemingly bottomless expense accounts? This country lost £120 million and its strategic shipping fleet with the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  In no other democratic State would these serious questions remain unanswered years later.</P>
    <P>In a low key style the Minister for the Marine managed to present this Bill today as though it were concerned with nothing except the remedying of a long term injustice to a group of workers who served this State well.  That, of course, is true and, though it may be ten years after the event, it is welcome.  Nevertheless it is wrong to present the Bill as though there was nothing involved except the overdue compensation of the workers affected.  The country has suffered not just in the financial terms I have explained but in terms of its vulnerability and isolation.  It was a disastrous decision.  It is simply unconscionable that we should be here six years after an Oireachtas committee indicted the board, executives and the Department in the manner that they did and we still do not have any answers.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the Bill with some feeling, as I suppose one might expect of a Member representing maritime constituency and responsible for maritime affairs.  Through his Minister of State I would ask him to respond to the protest outside Leinster House yesterday by employees of another shipping company, the B &amp; I, who have major issues to confront and are anxious to have an interview with the Minister to put forward their point of view.  Although it would be unfair to say the Minister has refused to meet them, nonetheless he has not met them.  I would ask him to agree to meet them because there are issues confronting that company which require attention now.  If nothing else, we can learn from the experience of Irish Shipping when the Government was panicked <Col N="1502" /> into taking a decision that had such far reaching implications for this island nation.  I hope the legitimate grievances of the B &amp; I employees can be met head on by the Minister, that he will agree to meet them at an early date and seek to resolve the issues about which they are concerned.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, your office has advised me that amendment No. 7 I had tabled is out of order because it would impose a charge on the State.  I sought to do no more in this amendment that give expression to the wishes of former Deputy John Wilson in that motion which the entire Fianna Fáil Party supported in Private Members' Business in 1985 when they sought compensation for the workers concerned.  I think Deputy Kemmy and others would agree the compensation sought was more or less in line with redundancy settlements at that time and would not have been out of line.  I am sorry my amendment has been ruled out of order because it is important for the reason I have stated.</P>
    <P>In regard to the committee being established to monitor the assessment of applications, it is regrettable there is no representative of the former workers involved in it, nor any representation of the committee that has campaigned so assiduously over the past ten years.  It is important that there be some element of representation on that committee.  My amendment seeks to have somebody nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to participate in that process.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to take that amendment on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is overdue. Its provisions undo a terrible injustice to a small number of public servants who served this State well.  I regret it has taken ten years to do so and that, in the interim, we have lost so much in the interest of the State.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Woods, on the introduction of this Bill.  As the Minister said himself, it was with a mixed feeling of sadness and satisfaction that he viewed the introduction of this Bill, sadness at the demise of Irish Shipping Limited in an island nation like ours which no longer has a merchant shipping fleet.  As the House will know, Irish Shipping Limited was founded in 1941 for the importation of grain during World War II.  Throughout its 43 year existence a strike had never occurred in the company. Between the years 1960 and 1979 the company made a profit over 16 consecutive years, again an excellent record for a semi-State company.</P>
      <P>As some other Members have said, perhaps the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited should never have happened. Certainly many questions remain unanswered. For example, why did it cost the State so much to wrap it up?  With the benefit of hindsight one might conclude that the State could easily have kept the company going at much less cost to the Exchequer than was incurred in its liquidation.</P>
      <P>I am saddened that Irish Shipping no longer exists.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, the cost has been enormous and many questions remain unanswered about the manner in which this company came to an end.  The liquidation was carried out in a very hasty manner.  If a little more imagination had been used at the time the company could have survived and would probably be trading profitably today.  It was a sad chapter in Irish maritime history.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the former workforce is being compensated, and I compliment them on the dignified way in which they lobbied over the years.  They always made a strong case concerning the injustices done to them.  When I met them on many occasions I was embarrassed that they still had not been paid.  I am pleased that approximately 300 former employees will be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crazy that Ireland, as an island nation, does not have a stronger shipping fleet.  Many people here have a seafaring <Col N="1504" /> background and when seafaring is in one's blood it is very difficult to get away from it.  Seafaring goes back through many generations.  My wife is a member of a seafaring family going back many generations, indeed she has often threatened to go to sea because of my job.</P>
    <P>I hope when the committee is set up there will be no feet dragging.  I hope the work will be carried out efficiently and quickly because the former employees have waited long enough.  I sincerely hope they do not have to write to the Minister seeking final settlements.  The money is available and the former workers should get it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this matter being finally resolved, though perhaps not to everybody's satisfaction.  It has not been a good chapter for anybody including politicians but it is water under the bridge at this stage.  The matter was badly handled.  If common sense had prevailed at the time many of the problems could have been resolved and Irish Shipping could be up and running today and trading profitably.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am pleased that the former employees will be finally compensated.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for the diligence of his Department in compiling it. I pay tribute to my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  While in Opposition he continually raised the question of Irish Shipping workers and has now ensured that they will receive proper compensation for the many years of service given to Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of Irish Shipping is a proud one although it has been marred by tragedy.  The pride of seeing an Irish flag fleet operating on the oceans of the world during and after the Second World War was an indication for many that Ireland as a country had come of age.  It was against this proud background that Irish Shipping went into liquidation in 1984. Whatever about the legalities relating to liquidation and liabilities the treatment meted to Irish Shipping workers was not <Col N="1505" /> only wrong, it was immoral.  Seamen were left stranded in foreign ports without any money.  When they got back home they were told they would receive only a pittance for the many years of service given to the company.  Little consideration was given to their dedication to the company and the country, particularly during the war years.  It is to the credit of the former workers and their families many of whom are present, that they never gave up the fight.  I have no doubt the former workers, including those in my home town of Cobh, will welcome and acknowledge the decision by the Government to allow for <i>ex gratia</i> payments totalling £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 7 which allows for payment to the next of kin of former workers who died since the closure of the company.  This again shows the diligence of the Minister and the Minister of State in ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I am heartened that the Bill is receiving a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The former workers have waited long enough and it is proper that we do not prolong their wait.  In this regard I ask the Minister to ensure that the interdepartmental committee will be established quickly to ensure prompt assessment and processing of claims.  As Deputy Rabbitte requested, I also ask the Minister to include a member of the workers' group, who has fought earnestly for the payment of compensation, on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague Deputy Mulvihill I welcome the Bill.  It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.  It is more important to recognise a wrong and to take remedial action even now &mdash; better late than never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping has a painful history. There is no point dwelling on it as it is outside the scope of the Bill but I shall refer to it in passing.  Ten years have elapsed since the company went into liquidation in 1984.  During those sad and bitter years many of the former employees were left stranded on foreign shores without even the courtesy of a <Col N="1506" /> communication from the company to tell them what was happening.  As Deputy Rabbitte said it is a reflection on all of us &mdash; himself included &mdash; the trade union movement and all parties in this House that Irish Shipping was liquidated in that way.  It is easy for him to do a Pontius Pilate act and wash his hands of it and to blame the Government of the day.  I listened very carefully to his good contribution. He is excellent at rattling off criticisms but he did not utter one word about what he would have done.  It is very easy to come into this House and criticise &mdash; that is the job of the Opposition. It is even more important when dealing with an intelligent workforce, such as Irish Shipping, to say what you would have done in those circumstances. I do not deny it was a national débâcle which was painful for all of us.</P>
    <P>The background to the shipping business has changed in the past two decades. It is a volatile, cut throat business taken over by magnates.  The Greek shipping magnates find it difficult to compete, many of whom have suffered huge losses throughout the world.  It is also subject to booms and slumps, to change in trading in the commercial life of the world. The recession has adversely affected shipping and Irish Shipping would not have been immune to those changes during the past ten years.  There have also been changes in the crewing of those ships.  They introduced cheap labour, seamen who had no rights and no trade unions to stand by them.  This has been the direction in which the shipping industry has been moving in the past two decades.</P>
    <P>There were other domestic factors. Irish Shipping management was grossly inefficient and it was bad management that brought about the collapse of the company.  The Government of the day, the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition, was responsible to some degree and is not immune from criticism.  Deputy Rabbitte was wrong to castigate Irish Shipping without outlining the background to the collapse of the company, as I have tried. He made no constructive suggestions on how the survival of the company could <Col N="1507" /> have been ensured.  It is facile to blame the Government for this.  Would it be different if the company had been in private hands &mdash; there is nothing to stop Irish companies from operating a shipping company, and the Spanish fleet is controlled by private companies &mdash; but Deputy Rabbitte said nothing about that?  It is wrong to lay the entire blame at the door of Government and the public sector.  That glosses over the failure of Irish fishing to survive on the world market in the past 70 years.  We have no deep-sea fishing fleet.  It is worth questioning why shipping and fishing have failed but nobody suggests that we must look to ourselves for the reasons.</P>
    <P>I too wish that the terms of compensation could be improved and that they be increased to £7 million instead of £3.5 million.  Former Irish Shipping workers who contacted my office since the details of this Bill were announced welcome this measure.  They are very pleased that after a decade of neglect the wrong that was done to them is being recognised.  We wronged the employees of the former Irish Shipping Limited but now we are trying to correct those wrongs.  However, nothing can ever correct the pain, trauma and the suffering of those workers who were treated so shabbily ten years ago.  My Limerick office is close to the harbour where seamen have worked from for centuries. I often think of the men who died when their ships were bombed and torpedoed during the last World War.  They risked their lives to keep the lines of supply open so that we would have the wherewithal to survive.  I pay tribute to all the brave seamen.  My friend Dr. John de Courcy Ireland continuously upbraids me for our lack of support for shipping and fishing. I am pleased that former Irish Shipping staff in Limerick have recognised that we are trying to correct the wrong and to compensate them.  We are making a belated attempt to do right.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for making payments to the next of kin, a very decent and civilised gesture.  Ten years is a long time to have to wait.  Most of the workers <Col N="1508" /> who lost their jobs have not worked since and will never work again.</P>
    <P>We must learn a lesson from the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited and, above all we must ensure that it will never happen again to a State company.  We must try to ensure that staff are never treated in that uncivilised manner and that management is held fully accountable for the public moneys invested in a company.  That did not happen in this case.</P>
    <P>The standard of Irish management is very poor and if we were depending on such management there would be no future for the country.  Most of the multinationals have foreign management. That is a reflection on us.  The standard of management in the private and public service must improve and we have an obligation to taxpayers to ensure that this happens so as to ensure the viability and success of companies.</P>
    <P>This Bill is minute step in acknowledging that ten years ago we wronged the workers of Irish Shipping Limited.  I wish everybody who receives compensation well.</P>

      <P>I feel driven to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I warmly welcome the Bill.  In 1984 I was part of a small group of Fine Gael and Labour Government backbenchers who were angered at the manner in which it proved necessary to treat the employees of the then Irish Shipping Company.  I participated in many heated backroom debates to try to find a way that workers would not be left without compensation when they lost their jobs.  These highly skilled workers could sell Ireland anywhere and acted as ambassadors when their ships were docked in ports around the world.  The age profile of people who had spent years in the company meant that they would not find another job.  It was one of the saddest times in my political career when I had to listen to people in their fifties who had given a lifetime to the company being made redundant but without compensation that would allow them to live in decency while they looked for another job.  A number of these highly <Col N="1509" /> skilled people managed to find work.  A captain or senior officer on a ship is a valuable human resource for other shipping companies and I am glad that some of the people who visited my clinics and lobbied Members subsequently found work.  Many of them had to suffer very difficult years and literally devoted themselves full-time to the work of lobbying Government.</P>
      <P>I recognise that at the time the Government could not for very valid reasons pay compensation to the ex-employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  I am very glad that this matter is being dealt with.  I understand that previous Ministers, and the Minister, were involved in putting this package together.  At the time of the collapse Fianna Fáil in Opposition danced merry hell around us.  The party tabled Private Members' motions calling on the Government to pay the compensation. It was entitled to do so because it had a very good case.  In fact, I was trying to make the same case from the Government backbenches.  The Fianna Fáil Party has been in Government in one from or another since 1987 and it could have righted the wrong sooner.  Will the Minister explain the reason that it did not immediately set about doing this in 1987?  However, the compensation is better late than never.</P>
      <P>Some people may not receive compensation. I ask the Minister to be more specific and indicate the number and categories of ex-employees who will not benefit under the legislation and explain the reasons for this.  It is welcome that money will be paid to the families of deceased employees.  This is fair and just. The sums these people will receive are not large because the value of money has decreased and their lifestyles may have changed dramatically since they lost their jobs.  Because they were not paid compensation at the time their families may have been denied opportunities.  I do not believe that we can fully compensate them for the trauma and the difficulties they encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State opposite was not a Member of the House at that time but <Col N="1510" /> this was an issue which touched people's hearts.  It is interesting how some issues catch the imagination.  The fate of Irish Shipping workers was such an issue.  In programme after programme employees of the company outlined the difficulties that they were encountering and gained the sympathy of the public.</P>
    <P>The demise of Irish Shipping highlighted the difficulties being encountered by the shipping industry.  When does the Minister hope to receive the report that he is commissioning on the economic evaluation of the sector?  The case was made strongly at the time that with the demise of Irish Shipping we were gradually losing our capacity on the seas.  As the only island nation in the European Union we still have not managed to make a strong case at EU level for proper funding and assistance for this sector.  It would be no harm if in carrying out this economic evaluation the Minister drew on the experience of some of the people who are being helped in this legislation.  I am sure they could provide assistance and point to where the difficulties arose in Irish Shipping.  A number of issues led to the demise of the company and that is part of the reason it was so complex.  The Minister said that this economic evaluation will address the case for additional support measures conductive to an efficient and competitive shipping industry. We must make a strong case at European Union level because we are cut off from the rest of Europe by the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed at the outcome of the recent Council of Fisheries Ministers at which the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, was defeated 11:1 on the question of fishing rights in our waters.  I hope the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who will make the case at Council level will have more success than his colleague.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the minutes and reports produced by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies one will see that one Deputy Albert Reynolds was a member of the committee and participated in the questioning of the board of Irish Shipping and officials of the Department.  It is clear <Col N="1511" /> from some of the questions he asked that he was unhappy.  Fianna Fáil made political capital out of this issue.  It is sweet justice that he is in charge of the Government introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope we have learned our lesson and that we will not see a repeat.  There is an onus on the Government to ensure that workers who have paid their taxes and contributions which entitle them to certain benefits receive just compensation.  Even though I was an angry backbencher at the time I was not successful in convincing the Government that payments should be made.  I am glad they will be made now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The history of Irish Shipping has been outlined by other speakers.  During the war the people owed a debt of gratitude to and had great respect for the workers of the company.  At one time it was a shining example for other semi-State companies &mdash; I am a former employee of a semi-State company &mdash; but due to the cyclical nature of the business it ran into difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is hard to see how the decision, with which I disagreed, to put the company into liquidation was made in 1984.  I do not have the final figures but I am sure if the company was given funds at the time it would have battled its way out of its difficulties.</P>
      <P>The staff of the company were shabbily treated.  Those who work for the State or semi-State companies will not get rich on what they earn and do not share in the fruits when the company is going well. What they do have is security.  It was not the fault of the workers that the company found itself in trouble.  Justice is being done finally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect on the views now being expressed by the parties which formed the Government who made the decision to put the company into liquidation. The Labour Party object to privatisation and favour the provision of support for state companies.  I was amused that Deputy Owen chastised Fianna Fáil for taking so long to clean up <Col N="1512" /> the mess.  I accept that Fianna Fáil gave a solemn commitment to provide compensation for the workers, that we have been in Government since 1987 and that it has taken far too long to honour this commitment.  I am glad that it is being kept.</P>
    <P>We owe the Minister a debt of gratitude. As he mentioned this morning, his predecessors, in particular Deputy Woods, played a role in drafting the legislation. The workers also deserve our praise for continuing to lobby to ensure that the matter is resolved.  There must have been times when they were discouraged at the lack of progress.  While the Department of the Marine appeared to be helpful, the Department of Finance was blamed for adopting an unyielding approach.</P>
    <P>It is good that in the last few years there has been a more sympathetic approach by the Department of Finance which has led to the successful conclusion of this matter.  I am glad it is expected to pass all Stages of the Bill today.  I just hope that when the committee is set up there will be a minimum of bureaucracy and that matters will be dealt with speedily and efficiently because the workers have put up with enough delay.</P>
    <P>One of the fears expressed by the Department of Finance and others was that the Irish Shipping workers were not the only ones who were not well looked after.  Other people were not too well treated during the rough times of the late 1980s.  I hope the same sympathy will be shown to these much smaller groups, in some cases only a couple of workers, now that the Irish Shipping workers have managed to drive this agreement through.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised at the Minister's reference this morning to the increase in the tonnage of Irish shipping in recent years.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the B &amp; I line.  It is not a case of history repeating itself as the old jobs and functions of workers in B &amp; I seem to be dying slowly whereas the demise of Irish Shipping came sharply and quickly. However, there are workers in the B &amp; I line who feel they are not being well <Col N="1513" /> treated and that the guarantees given to them by the Government at the time their company was privatised are not being honoured &mdash; I have not seen these guarantees, but the workers claim that they got guarantees.</P>
    <P>The Minister represents a coastal area and B &amp; I line operates out of Dublin port, not Dún Laoghaire.  In this respect the Minister should be seen to give a hearing to everybody and take care that no charge is made against him that he is looking after his own patch rather than the overall good.  I do not suggest that charge could be laid against him, but some workers talk in those terms.  I hope the Minister will meet the workers and try to protect their jobs because, although the company in which they are now employed is a very successful company, it seems that the traditional routes serviced by B &amp; I are not now its main priority.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill and the speed with which it is going through the House after so many years of waiting and I hope the payments will be made to the workers as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I thank the Deputies for their contribution to the debate.  I appreciate the concern shown by many Deputies over the years, and particularly in recent months, for the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited. The debate has been constructive and there has been general welcome for the legislation.  I propose now to deal with some of the points raised and give clarification where possible.</P>
      <P>The events leading to the liquidation of Irish Shipping related to the chartering agreements entered into by Irish Shipping Limited which caused financial difficulties. That and the question of the cost to the Exchequer are separate matters, discussion of which is not appropriate on this Bill which deals with the position of the former employees of Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday's protest at B &amp; I was raised. This is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications <Col N="1514" /> rather than the Minister for the Marine. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment.</P>
    <P>The level of compensation, at three weeks pay per year of service, has been agreed by the workers' committee.  My understanding is that only five people will be affected by the ceiling of £50,000 and that these five are senior executives.  The three weeks' pay per year of service should be balanced against the public sector guidelines of two to two and a half weeks' pay per year of service.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of seafarers' employment it is not possible to state the exact number of people who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  It is estimated at about 320 people.  Seafaring staff traditionally sign a separate crewing agreement for each voyage and the liquidator contested the eligibility of some seafarers for redundancy lump sum payments.  Forty-nine seafarers successfully appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  More than 300 people, including 49 seafarers, were paid redundancy lump sums.</P>
    <P>As to whether the establishment of an interdepartmental committee is just another layer of bureaucracy which might involve additional State expenditure, the purpose of the committee is to enable the Minister to have the benefit of advice and expertise of people with experience in the areas of tax redundancy and finance when deciding on applications.  Rather than creating an unwanted layer of bureaucracy this should facilitate the efficient and speedy processing of applications. There will be no additional Exchequer expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Other questions that were raised related to how employees should go about obtaining payment and how soon payment would be made.  Former employees must make application for payment.  As soon as this Bill becomes law, the Department of the Marine will indicate, through newspaper advertising and the workers' committee, the manner in which applications should be made. All applications will be investigated by a committee specifically established for that purpose and payment will be made <Col N="1515" /> as soon as possible following investigation of the applications.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that an ICTU nominee should be appointed to the inter-departmental committee.  However, the committee does not purport to represent interest groups in the shipping sector.  Its purpose is to enable the Minister to avail of the expertise of persons in the tax, finance and redundancy areas so that applications can be dealt with as efficiently as possible.  If the ICTU were to be allowed to nominate a person to serve on the committee then the liquidator or the Chamber of Shipping or IBEC would also have to be invited to do so.  An enlarged committee would, if anything, delay investigation of applications.</P>
    <P>In regard to whether a ceiling will be applied for reckonable pay or whether payments will be subject to deductions for tax purposes, unlike payments under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, a ceiling will not apply to reckonable pay under this Bill.  Payments are subject to deductions at current rates and they compare favourably with those which applied at the time of the liquidation.  Only about 25 per cent of those concerned are expected to be liable for tax.</P>
    <P>In regard to the length of time which has elapsed between the liquidation and the introduction of the Bill, it was necessary to formulate an arrangement acceptable to the former employees which at the same time ensuring that the State was not exposed to other claims.  This Bill provides specifically for former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  As to why those with less than two years' service are being excluded from the scope of the Bill, it was considered desirable to impose some minimum service requirements. The two year requirement specified for payment of redundancy lump sums was a recognisable statutory operated arrangement and was, accordingly, adopted.  Approximately ten persons are likely to be excluded because of this arrangement.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the comments of the Minister for the Marine this <Col N="1516" /> morning in relation to the evaluation of the shipping industry, which will be carried out in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I noted from the debate this morning.  This Bill marks the formal ending of an era in our maritime and economic history.  We are being enabled to acknowledge in a concrete manner the service to our community by the staff of Irish Shipping Limited.  We are, in effect, paying our last respects to an old order and I am speaking for the Minister for the Marine and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, as one era ends another begins and we must look to the future. We must gear our shipping sector and our economy generally to meet the challenges posed by the new order as represented by the developments in the European Union and beyond.  I look forward to working with all interested parties to ensure that Irish ship owners and the State benefit and prosper from these developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on the question of reckonable pay?  Perhaps I did not correctly understand the Minister earlier.  The Minister of State stated that reckonable pay would not come under the normal limits of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  Yet, section 2 (2) of the Bill states that the amount of the lump sum shall be an amount equal <Col N="1519" /> to the product of three times the former employee's normal weekly remuneration within the meaning of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  That contradicts the Minister of State.  If this comes within the meaning of the 1967 Act, will the Minister explain why the limit that applies to normal redundancy entitlements does not apply in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Act, there are limits to reckonable earnings, but that will not be the position in this case.  A ceiling will not operate here.  As I understand it, this will apply to approximately five people.  If those payments exceed £50,000 a ceiling of £50,000 on the total payment will apply, but under the Redundancy Payments Act a ceiling is not applied to reckonable earnings.  The only ceiling which will apply is £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point about the £50,000 ceiling.  However, is it not the case that normal weekly remuneration will remain within the meaning of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 and that under that Act there is a strict application to normal weekly remuneration? It is not always the average weekly wage, a limit applies.  Some weeks ago the Minister for Enterprise and Employment changed the calculation for normal weekly remuneration, but is there still not a limit on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal weekly remuneration will be assessed under the provisions of the 1967 Act, but a ceiling will not apply.  That is the difference. The method of reckoning &mdash; allowable income &mdash; will remain the same, but there will not be a ceiling on that income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11.</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) a person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of Deputies De Rossa and Rabbitte, both of whom are attending committee meetings, I will speak on the amendment.  It provides for the appointment of a person to be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the proposed committee to advise the Minister on the implementation of various aspects of the Bill.  Essentially, the Bill <Col N="1521" /> provides for the payment of redundancy compensation.  As someone who raised the issue on a number of occasions I welcome the Bill.  It would be appropriate for the committee to include a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This section would appear to anticipate difficulties or unusual situations that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has requested the nomination of an additional member to the committee and I accept his point that the trade union movement should be represented.  Was the genesis of the committee a suggestion by the officials in the Department or representatives of the ex-employees?  As only a small number of people, approximately 300, are involved, full employment and salary records should be available.  There should not be a major difficulty in determining entitlements. Why could compensation payments not be made through normal channels rather than the proposed committee?  I accept the Minister's point that the special committee will not result in additional expenditure and, hopefully, there will not be a delay in expending those payments. The committee would seem to be an unnecessary layer as the machinery already exists for the examination and payment of such claims.  The Minister should indicate his views and those of the Minister for the Marine as to why it is proposed to establish the committee to negotiate settlements when the parameters are narrow and clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with Deputy Gilmore's point.  In the context of the general welcome for this legislation we would all desire that matters be dealt with and payments made to the former employees or their representatives as expeditiously as possible.  The proposed committee will not be viewed as being representative on interest groups.  If a representative of the ICTU was to be nominated to the proposed committee, the liquidator, the chamber of shipping or IBEC could also advance a case for <Col N="1522" /> representation and such representation could further delay the process.  The Department of the Marine decided to avail of the service of experts and to give transparency to the process.  Each application will be formally examined. The committee will be established in the context of providing transparency and speedily expediting the processing of applications and payments.  The legislation provides an appeal mechanism for unsuccessful applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Most applications for payment will probably be straightforward. In any company where 300 employees are made redundant disputes may arise in respect of the date of commencement of employment, continuity of employment and so on.  The former employees would require some assurance in respect of those matters.  The proposed committee will advise the Minister as to how to deal with those matters.  I note it is intended to appoint an officer of the Revenue Commissioners to the proposed committee.  That appointment would be helpful from the point of view of taxation of the awards.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what the appeals mechanism involves?  Will people covered by this legislation have recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal?  In a normal redundancy situation disputes may arise over many matters including the length of service, employment commencement date, some aspect of the employment record or levels of pay to be taken into account for the calculation of the redundancy payment.  In the normal course if a redundant employee is unhappy with some aspect of the redundancy package he or she would have access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, but because this redundancy effectively took place ten years ago there will be a time bar on that under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  I would like the Minister to explain the appeals mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to appoint within the mechanism being established by the Minister some body &mdash; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is the <Col N="1523" /> obvious one &mdash; which would keep an eye on the former employees' interests.  I am not saying that anybody would deliberately try to deprive people of their entitlements but sometimes opinions on these matters differ.  Given the experience of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this area, it would take a helpful approach to the matter.  I do not envisage the committee being engaged in conflicting debate.  Various Departments of will be involved &mdash; the Departments of the Marine, Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, who take a particular interest when lump sums are handed out, and the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; but there will be nobody on the committee to hold a watching brief on behalf of the employees, which would be helpful.  The Minister should clarify whether these people will have recourse, as in other redundancy cases, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the event of a dispute arising about the method of calculation of redundancy payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain the genesis of the committee. I agree with Deputy Gilmore on the appeals mechanism.  Under section 4 the only method of appeal is by way of representation to the Minister, the person who would have already refused payment.  The Minister is setting himself up as judge and jury, which is unsatisfactory. He will make a decision on an application and if the person is unhappy with the decision he has recourse to appeal, but the person to whom the appeal must be made is the Minister who has already refused payment.  That does not appear to be a satisfactory mechanism.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about appointing extra members to the committee.  I am not entirely satisfied with the setting up of a committee because this is a straightforward matter which could be sorted out without difficulty.  Perhaps a further mechanism needs to be put in place to deal publicly and clearly with appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1524" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns expressed by the Deputies would be legitimate in the event of difficulties arising.  In this case statutory redundancy has been dealt with and payments have been made.  For that reason the Employment Appeals Tribunal would not be involved.  We are talking about additional payments.  We all agree that this process should go ahead as quickly as possible.  Decisions will be transparent and will be based on facts and records which will enable the case to be dealt with without difficulty.  As part of the appeals process there is provision whereby, within 21 days of a decision being made on an application, representations may be considered.  In that context trade unions would have a meaningful role to play.  Difficulties are not anticipated in the processing of applications, but it is acceptable to have a small expert group to advise the Minister in the context of expediting the processing of applications.  In the event of disputes arising representations will be considered in the appeals process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is possible in the appeals process for representation to be made.  However, in the transaction of employer-employee business there is normally recourse to a third party to assess whether the method of calculation of redundancy payment is fair.  I do not anticipate that many disputes will arise; the vast bulk of cases will probably be straightforward.  However, a number of matters have to be taken into consideration. This issue has gone on for ten years and I do not know to what extent records have been maintained.  Even in a company which closes down today in which 300 people have been employed, as in this case, since World War II, records may not be complete and disputes will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The typical dispute that will arise is on the number of years' service and continuity of service.  The definition of service under the Redundancy Payments Acts is continuous service.  Is the Minister saying that calculation of redundancy payments will be on the basis of continuous service?  What will happen where <Col N="1525" /> there is broken service or where there is a dispute about whether a person's absence from the company for a period constitutes a break in service?  They are some of the difficulties that will arise. The question of what constitutes weekly remuneration may also arise.  Where a person has received a straightforward wage or salary that will be easy to calculate, but in some cases there may have been extra payments which have to be taken into account and disputes may arise as to the calculation of payment.</P>
    <P>While I fully applaud the Minister in bringing this long overdue legislation to the House and at long last arranging for long overdue payments to the loyal former employees of this company, it is not appropriate that he should be judge, jury and paymaster in this affair.  Applications will be made to the Minister and an interdepartmental committee will advise him on his decision.  A person who is aggrieved with the decision will have 21 days within which to appeal, but essentially the appeal will be to the Minister who made the decision in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable, in what is really no more than an advisory committee, to have a representative of a body with experience and an interest in the way in which redundancy lump sum payments are calculated from the point of view of the employees.  I am surprised that the Minister of State is resisting this amendment. It is not too much to ask, in an advisory committee which is advising the Minister of State is resisting this amendment. It is not too much to ask, in an advisory committee which is advising the Minister on how redundancy payments should be calculated, that a representative from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be present to look after the interests of the former employees.  I am surprised at the degree of resistance to the amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it or, if he cannot, to at least give a commitment that he will consider the matter again before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the points made by Deputy Gilmore but we should examine this legislation in the spirit in which it has finally arrived to <Col N="1526" /> the Oireachtas.  The Bill has not come to this House in a spirit of dispute; it has been introduced in a spirit of redressing a problem which has existed for a long time.  Deputy Gilmore is anticipating a level of dispute that will not arise.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for definitions.  The redundancy payments records, for example, which applied when payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts were made, can be made available and used.  Deputy Gilmore sees this as a confrontational matter, which is not envisaged in the Bill.  It is simply processing legislation to enable payments to be made, in addition to statutory redundancy payments, to the former employees of Irish Shipping.  This is to be carried out in a transparent way and is the thinking behind the availability of the advisory committee to the Minister.  If we increase the membership of that advisory committee, we could delay what we all feel is the most appropriate action, namely, to make payments to the former employees or their representatives as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>If we allowed a representative from the ICTU on the committee, other interests could legitimately claim a similar right. We should pass this legislation quickly through the Oireachtas, allow the processing to be done as quickly as possible thereby making the payments to the former employees speedily.  I ask the Deputy to accept in good faith that where appeals arise they will be dealt with in a sympathetic manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>Is Deputy Gilmore pressing his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a great deal of choice in the matter.  The Minister greatly exaggerates when he imputes that I am suggesting there will be a confrontational element or that this proposal will in some way have a confrontational element to it.  That is not the case and I thought I had made it quite clear that in the vast majority of cases I anticipate few problems.  In a case involving 300 people, however, who have been made redundant &mdash; and particularly where the redundancies <Col N="1527" /> were ten years ago &mdash; it is rare that there would not be a difference of opinion regarding the method of calculating the amount of payments, length of service, what constituted pay, etc.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is a fairminded man and has clearly anticipated that issues will have to be addressed &mdash; which is obviously why he set up this committee in the first place &mdash; to which he will not have answers.  He appoints to the committee, therefore, representatives from his own Department and a representative from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, who will have an input in regard to the law, regulations etc., governing the making of redundancy payments.  There will also be a representative from the Department of Finance who, presumably, will be there to keep an eye on the grand total of the cheques that will be issued ultimately and a representative from the Revenue Commissioners, who will keep an eye on what will be clawed back in taxation.  The Minister can hardly expect us to believe that the representative from the Revenue Commissioners will act as some kind of a tax consultant to the former employees in relation to their tax affairs.  All these people will be on the committee for a purpose and I am simply asking for a person on it who would be concerned with the primary interests of the former employees.  I suggested a representative from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; I am aware the former employees have set up their own committee, and that is another way of doing this, but the principle of having someone on this new committee to look after their interests is important.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is opposing this amendment and I ask that the question be formally put to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has convinced me in relation to setting up this committee, the fact that it is in place is an indication that minor difficulties or disputes are envisaged in regard to applications <Col N="1528" /> for compensation.  If such disputes should arise, it is important to have a person on the committee representing the interests of the former employees and who can make a case on their behalf. Other Departments and interests are represented on the committee.  They all have their own job to do but it would also be appropriate to have a representative of the former employees on the committee.</P>
      <P>Instead of the House dividing on the issue, will the Minister give a commitment to again examine the matter before it goes to the Seanad in the light of what has been said?  It is not Deputy Gilmore's intention to be divisive; it is in everyone's interest not only to have this Bill passed as quickly as possible by both Houses of the Oireachhtas but that the applications will be received and responded to.  The views expressed here are meant to be constructive and Deputy Gilmore is making a genuine case on which the Minister could look favourably. Perhaps before the debate in the Seanad he might go some way towards accommodating Deputy Gilmore's point of view.</P>

      <P>I fully accept that the points made by both Deputies are made in a constructive way, which has been the spirit of the debate so far.  I am not in a position, however, to agree to this amendment.  Information is available relating to the redundancy payments that were made following the liquidation and the expertise that the Minister for the Marine will have available to him on this committee will relate to the expedition of payments.  That is clear from the type of representations on the committee. This is an advisory committee, not a decision-making one.  The decisions at the end of the day will rest with the Minister who will process the applications as speedily and sympathetically as possible. If we add to the membership of the committee, it could mean applications would not be processed expeditiously. However, I will relay to the Minister the concerns expressed as soon as the debate concludes.</P>

It does not follow that if there is provision for a representative of, for example, Congress to be on the committee, IBEC and Uncle Tom Cobley should also be on it.  The specific interest of the former employees of Irish Shipping is the only one that needs to be reflected in the composition of the committee.

That is unsatisfactory as the court of higher appeal is the one which rejected the claim in the first instance and the Minister is judge and jury.  I appreciate the Minister of State is not in a position to offer any alternative.  The procedure cannot be described as effective when that is all it <Col N="1530" /> involves.  This section is unhelpful and should be more transparent.</P>

      <P>Section 5 provides for the conviction of a person who gives false information to the Minister when applying for a lump sum.  It is the first time I have seen that penalty for a person applying for a redundancy payment. What is it intended to address?  The Minister said basic information on this is already in place as a result of the statutory payments made some time after the liquidation. I am a little puzzled and troubled by this.  If someone is of the opinion that false information has been given, the applicant could be taken to court even though the applicant may have made a mistake or believed the information to be true.</P>

      <P>I see this section in the context of dealing with claims as expeditiously as possible and in deterring people from making false claims.  The section is not intended to cover genuine errors made or where it is necessary to make approximations.  Processing fraudulent claims would cause delay for the 320 people who have genuine claims. Those who are charged would have to be clearly guilty of a criminal offence and guilty of presenting false information.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being accused of injecting a less than harmonious note into the debate, this section is rather insulting to the former employees of Irish Shipping.  These people have waited for a long time for their money and it is wrong for the Minister of State to suggest that fraudulent claims etc. might be made.  Even if a person submits wrong information about years of service, the amount due to them, etc. in their application for compensation, at the end of the day the Minister will decide how much they should receive.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the history of Irish Shipping but it would have been better if previous Ministers &mdash; in fairness, I do not want to get to grips with the present Minister who is doing something about the matter &mdash; had applied themselves to dealing with the fraud in Irish Shipping which resulted in it being liquidated and the decisions taken in the company during the late seventies and early eighties.  It is not proper to suggest that people who have waited ten years for their money might submit fraudulent claims.</P>

Because of the lapse of time, people other than former employees of Irish Shipping might try something on, so to speak, and this provision is aimed at deterring such activity.  Fraudulent claims would take up an inordinate amount of administrative time and delay the processing of genuine claims by people whom we are all anxious should be paid as soon as possible.</P>

The Committee Stage debate has been particularly interesting and informative and I sincerely hope that the Minister of State, who addressed our concerns in so far as he was able to, will put forward our fears about sections 3 and 4 to the Minister.  We are anxious to ensure that the Bill is implemented as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>We are rectifying a problem which began in 1984.  The payment of compensation to the former employees of Irish Shipping is long overdue.

      <P>I join with Deputies Bradford and Clohessy in paying tribute to the Minister on the introduction of this long overdue legislation.  The liquidation of Irish Shipping is one of the great scandals in the history of this State and it is very regrettable that ten years later nobody has been brought to book for it. In recent years there has been a reluctances, particularly on the part of some sections of the public press, to carry out investigative work into the matter because of threats of legal action, etc.  I hope that with the completion of this chapter the story of Irish Shipping can be written in full, that those who were responsible for the scandalous liquidation of this company will be brought to book and that lessons can be learned for the future.  Over those ten years it would have been easy for the plight of its former employees to have been forgotten.  Great credit is due to the former employees themselves, their families and the committee which represented them throughout those ten years who kept the issue alive, very often by visiting this House at Question Time, by participating in pickets, by writing to the Minister and Members of the House, by initiating legal action and so on.  The fact that this Bill is about to be passed and at long last former employees are about to receive <Col N="1534" /> payments long overdue to them is, in large measure, a tribute to their tenacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes in effect to replace the Racing Board and Racecourses Acts, 1945 and 1975, and put in place a new comprehensive legislative framework for the horseracing industry in Ireland. Before I deal with the Bill itself, its various provisions and the circumstances that gave rise to the need for it, I would like to say a little on the significance of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a long and well-established tradition in Ireland in breeding throughbred horses for racing or export.  While in more recent times we have seen the development of some large studs, the breeding of thoroughbreds, in the main continues to be a farm-based activity where farmers keep two or three brood mares in a mixed enterprise system. about 7,000 thoroughbred foals are registered annually.  We are recognised worldwide for the skills that we have shown in horse breeding and as a result we have achieved an international reputation for producing quality horses.  Our <Col N="1535" /> horseracing industry is also held in high esteem, internationally.  The organisation and structure of our racing industry are already at a stage of development which surpass many of our counterparts abroad.  This provides a firm base for continued development.</P>
    <P>This is not however to say that we do not have difficulties in the industry and that some change is not required.  Every economic sector needs to take stock of itself on a regular basis, to examine its structure and the means by which it can best equip itself for the future in order to achieve its objectives.  A review of the overall organisational structure of the horseracing industry is appropriate, given its importance to our economy. There are about 25,000 people employed either directly or indirectly in the horseracing and breeding sectors.</P>
    <P>Latest figures for output of the horse industry indicate an annual value of over £60 million.  Exports are valued at about £50 million annually and there are encouraging signs of new buyers in the market.  If the existing marketing promotions are continued and enhanced the overall position can be greatly improved. Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is doing a great job in promoting Irish thoroughbreds. We have recognised this by increasing the budgetary provision for this body in 1994.</P>
    <P>Racing is a popular sport.  The race meetings which take place at 26 racecourses around the country, and which are attended by over one million people, from an integral part of life in Ireland. These events also make a valuable contribution to our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The level of betting at horseracing in Ireland is substantial.  Levies on betting at racecourses generate between £3 million and £4 million annually which goes back into the industry.  The interest in racing here and the traditionally successful participation of Irish horses in many foreign races result in a high level of off-course betting.  Such betting is not confined to horseracing events.  Nevertheless the racing industry, and the interest it generates, is the major influence in achieving <Col N="1536" /> an annual turnover in off-course bets of £350 million with an annual yield of about £35 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Despite its size and relative strength, this industry has not escaped the recession which has hit the sector worldwide in recent years.  The position of the race horse owner has become particularly critical.  The costs associated with keeping a horse in training have increased more rapidly than prize-money.  In turn this has caused problems for some trainers who are finding it increasingly difficult to retain their patrons or to find new ones.  On-course betting turnover which generates the main sources of income for the Racing Board has been in decline in recent years.  For example, bookmaker on-course betting turnover fell from £104 million in 1990 to just over £70 million last year with a resultant decline in levy income from £5.2 million in 1990 to just over £3.5 million in 1993. As a consequence, the level of funds available to the industry as a whole has been contracting and there have been insufficient moneys available for development of racecourse facilities and prize money.  This is most unfortunate at a time when horse racing has to compete with an ever growing list of alternative leisure activities.</P>
    <P>Unless the facilities available at racecourses are continually improved, there is a danger that the industry could get caught in a downward spiral of falling attendances, lower levels of betting and consequent reductions in income accruing to the Racing Board, with little or no money available for capital development.</P>
    <P>The position would have been much worse but for the action taken by the Government to introduce a grant-in-aid for the Racing Board in 1989.  As a result, the board has obtained over £13 million from the Exchequer in the four years from 1990 to 1993.  Of this figure £7.5 million was used to supplement prize money at the lower levels and about £4 million to develop racecourse amenities. The balance was allocated to promotion and advertising of the sport, marketing of horses and the provision of infrastructural services.  These measures have <Col N="1537" /> brought about a significant degree of improvement.  Most people in the industry would agree that, with an improved organisational structure and greater resources, the horseracing industry has considerable potential for growth leading to increased income for the economy generally and, in particular, to additional employment in the sector.  The racing industry is a labour-intensive one, its expansion being directly reflected in higher employment.</P>
    <P>The problems of the industry can be traced to shortage of funds and the lack of a coherent approach to its development. Having two separate bodies with, to some degree, overlapping responsibilities certainly does not help to bring cohesion into the industry.  That is not to be critical of either body.  The governing bodies &mdash; the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee &mdash; have done very valuable work in administering Irish racing for over two centuries.  Their guardianship of the rules of racing and of its integrity is recognised domestically and internationally as being first class. The Racing Board, for its part, has, since its establishment in 1945, been an excellent focus for the financing and development of the industry.  All of those who accepted appointment to the Racing Board and the members of the governing bodies served in a voluntary capacity.  All are entitled to our thanks.</P>
    <P>None of that, however, takes away from the fact that, in present circumstances, the absence of a single body to provide the focus for direction and funding in the industry is a serious impediment to its development.  That is why we are now proposing in this legislation the establishment of a new horseracing authority to provide that focus for the future.</P>
    <P>The new Bill, as well as proposing a new organisational structure, will provide a comprehensive legislative framework for the industry.  We are providing in this legislation for the development of the industry well into the next century.</P>
    <P>Our guiding principle in all of this &mdash; and our only motivation &mdash; is to put in place arrangements and legislation that <Col N="1538" /> will assist the industry to realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>In framing these proposals we were conscious of three considerations in particular. Firstly, that the new Authority would be a representative one, covering the main sectors in the industry and in a position to give clear direction to the industry.  Thus, contrary to some media views, what we are putting in place is not just a new Racing Board, it is a new Authority.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in the new arrangements we proposed to preserve the strengths of the present.  In particular, we were very conscious of the need to provide for the independence of the governing bodies as the institution responsible for the rules of racing and the integrity services and that the efficient administration provided by the Registry Office would continue to be available to the industry.  The governing bodies have administered Irish racing now for over 200 years and we are deeply indebted to them for their unstinted service to the industry.  Without their contribution racing could not have developed.  The two bodies have carried out their functions professionally and regulated racing with impartiality.  The governing bodies have not confined their involvement in the sector to the provision of services and the implementation of rules.  At critical times for the industry they have invested funds, which they earned outside their formal role in the sector, back into the industry for the benefit of all.  Irish racing certainly would not have flourished except for the major contributions of the governing bodies in the past 200 years.</P>
    <P>In restructuring the industry it would indeed be very foolish for any Minister to seek to erode seriously the position of the governing bodies.  What I have proposed in this Bill is to have written into legislation the functions of the bodies.  Section 39 of the Bill provides for their continued regulation of horseracing, the making and enforcement of the rules of racing and the provision of the integrity services.  They will be referred to jointly as the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The Racing Regulatory Body will also have three places on the new Authority as of right under the provisions of the schedule to the Bill and it is, of course, possible that other members of the Authority representing other interests will also be members of the Turf Club or National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in Part 3 of the Bill giving the Racing Regulatory Body the statutory right to make charges for its services and guaranteeing to that body the cost of its integrity services. Contrary to some media comment, the position of the governing bodies, far from being undermined, is in fact being strengthened by the new legislation.  The third consideration is to strengthen the financial base of the industry.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the financial problems which have faced the industry in modern times.  It was to help to meet these problems that the Government provided over £13 million to the industry through the Racing Board in the past four years.  This is very tangible recognition of the importance the Government attaches to the industry.  In line with the agreement on the establishment of the new Authority the Government decided to increase its contribution this year by over 100 per cent, that is doubling the amount. As a result I have been able to provide in the 1994 Vote for my Department close on £7 million for the industry.  This amount, which is at least equal to the tax revenue from off course betting on Irish racing, represents major support for the racing industry.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to maintain this support in the future, which should facilitate the continued improvement of prize money, the development of badly needed facilities on racecourses and the promotion of Irish racing and the Irish horse at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of facing up to the current financial needs of the industry cannot, of course, all be placed on Government grants.  The industry itself must do more in this regard.  A particular responsibility will rest on the new Authority to see that attendances increase, <Col N="1540" /> revenue from betting maximised and sponsorship encouraged.  The new legislation opens up greater opportunities to increase the overall level of betting turnover and levy revenue than were available to the Racing Board.  I hope these opportunities will be grasped in a way that will see revenue from this source greatly increased to the benefit of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Bill allows the Authority to apply a levy on all bets placed at a racecourse on horse races or any other events taking place elsewhere.  Heretofore these were regarded as off-course bets and were liable to a 10 per cent off-course betting tax.  The Finance Act will be amended to remove the 10 per cent tax on such bets but the Authority will be required to apply a rate of levy on those bets equivalent to the rate of tax applying to similar bets placed on the high street &mdash; a 10 per cent levy.  The result will be that the revenue from levies on all bets placed at a racecourse will go the Authority for the benefit of horseracing. While the amount of betting at racecourses on off-course events at present is estimated to be quite small there will be under the new legislation an incentive for the new Authority to develop this source of income.</P>
    <P>Section 63 provides for an amendment to the Totalisator Act, 1929.  There is a provision in that Act which obliges any person operating a tote service to provide facilities for bookmakers to carry on their business at the same location.  While this may be reasonable when a tote is being operated at a racecourse it would not be practicable if the tote were extended to operate from offices on the high street or if tote facilities were to be made available at individual bookmakers' offices through some arrangement with those bookmakers.</P>
    <P>The Authority will be able to apply to the Minister for Finance for a new tote licence based on different conditions which would allow for such developments and the intention is to facilitate the new Authority in this regard.  This would have the potential for a significant improvement in revenue from tote profits.  The <Col N="1541" /> amendment to the Totalisator Act, 1929, will remove the requirement to provide facilities for bookmakers where a tote is operated except at racecourses where the requirement will remain.</P>
    <P>Section 12 empowers the Authority to make charges in respect of the carrying out of any of its functions or the provision of any services.  Under section 43 the Authority may require the Racing Regulatory Body to collect fees, levies or charges on behalf of the Authority.  This is a new and flexible possible source of funding.  Charges could be set or amended or removed without the need to put elaborate arrangements in place.  It would in particular allow the Authority a greater possibility of ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of the burden of the industry's costs, especially in regard to a part of the cost of racing services, and this is essentially the purpose behind this section.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for a range of new controls in key areas.  Section 26 requires that the Authority must approve the amount and form of prize money offered in respect of all races.  This is not unreasonable given that the Authority will be making a significant contribution to the prize money fund and will, in effect, be the guarantor of that fund.</P>
    <P>The allocation of fixtures and the setting of programmes are critical to the proper and effective running of the industry and have, of course, clear financial implications.  These are not the only considerations involved here but it would be difficult to see how an Authority with overall responsibility for the industry would not also have the ultimate responsibility for the fixtures list.  We are, therefore, providing that responsibility will indeed rest on the Authority but that it will be exercised through a fixtures committee constituted on similar lines to the committee that currently performs this function and which will operate on the basis of terms of reference laid down by the Authority.</P>
    <P>In view of the important position of the governing bodies in this area and in particular the implications which are involved in regard to the provision of <Col N="1542" /> integrity services, the Racing Regulatory Body will have a major role in the decisions on fixtures and programmes.</P>
    <P>Section 33 proposes to control starting price returns.  All who are familiar with the racing scene appreciate the significance of getting starting prices that are broadly acceptable to all sections of the racing industry and ensuring the maintenance of integrity in this respect. Starting prices are used extensively by off-course bookmakers in setting the odds at which bets are paid.  This section sets down a procedure by which we will maintain a situation, of having only one starting price returned in respect of any particular race and where those involved in setting the starting price would be approved by the Authority.  This is not intended to interfere with arrangements whereby racecourses benefit from the revenue generated by starting price contracts but simply to ensure that this essential element in the running of racing is adequately controlled.</P>
    <P>Section 53 deals with the regulation by the Authority of bookmakers on racecourses. The lifeblood of racing is the betting that takes place.  In order to make racing attractive it is not sufficient simply to have quality racing at venues with good ancillary services.  The betting facilities must also be good.  One of the initiatives which is provided for under section 53 is the possible introduction of betting offices at racecourses.  I realise that there are those who believe strongly that this would not be a positive move.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the full range of betting services could be provided by an extension or development of the current system of on-course bookmaking at pitches. It may prove to be the case that in the long-term a combination of pitches and betting offices would be the best method of providing the service that the punter wants.  In the final analysis this is something which will have to be decided by the Authority.  This Bill allows the greatest possible flexibility in that regard but provides that in making regulations under this section the Authority may take into account agreements reached between the racecourses and bookmakers. <Col N="1543" /> In that context I will be asking the Authority to decide on this issue at an early date.</P>
    <P>In future racecourses will be required to be authorised by the Authority.  Previously the Racing Board had no legal function in this regard.  The new Authority must be in a position to ensure, as far as practicable, that all racecourses provide appropriate facilities and services to carry on the business of horseracing and accommodate the race-going public in a safe and hospitable environment. New racecourses in particular should not be approved unless their facilities are of a proper standard.  The provisions of section 59 will, I believe, satisfy this requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 61 deals with broadcasting and filming rights.  It allows the Authority some say in the transmission or relaying of any broadcast of a race fixture and this is necessary in my view in order to ensure that such broadcasting is always done in a way which is in the best interest of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the House's attention to two or three other provisions which in due course could prove to be significant.  Section 35 would allow a subsidiary of the Authority to apply for a bookmakers licence.  Under section 36, however, it would need the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance before it could establish such a subsidiary.  The operation of bookmaker offices by a subsidiary of the Authority could prove to be the vehicle by which a new range of betting services could be introduced.  It could also be a revenue booster for the Authority.  However, the relevant provisions in the Bill are enabling ones and the whole area would require some detailed research and analysis before any ministerial consent, as provided for, could be given.  I would also draw attention to the fact that joint ventures between subsidiaries of the Authority and other companies are provided for in section 36 and this could lead to some beneficial partnerships between the State and industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> Part IX deals with the amendment of the licensing Acts.  The area of liquor licences for racecourses has been cumbersome and restrictive up to now. Sunday racing has added to these problems as occasional licences are not allowed for Sundays.  Greyhound racing has had its own special regime appropriate to its own needs since 1962.  The changes proposed here for horseracing are similar to those that applied to greyhound racing over that time.  If it is to retain its customer support, racing must be in a position to provide a comprehensive entertainment and leisure service. It is not surprising that we have to make special exemptions from Acts which, in fact, date back to 1833.</P>
    <P>The provisions for State boards in relation to a code of ethics for the Authority and its staff and for ministerial control on pay, superannuation and borrowing are included in Part II.  The dissolution of the Racing Board and the transfer of all its assets, liabilities and staff are provided for in Part X.</P>
    <P>Some people have asked why we did not simply amend the 1945 and 1975 Acts.  By explaining, in as brief a form as possible, the changes this Bill is providing for I have answered that question.  By attempting to carry through so many basic changes by way of amendment to legislation which is almost 50 years old would have created a complicated and, in my view, inadequate legislative framework.</P>
    <P>Matters relating to the composition of the Authority are dealt with in the Schedule.  What is being proposed here is a State body.  In this way the sectoral interests involved in the industry can be brought together and given the Authority necessary to control and manage the industry.  The industry needs a sound framework, a suitable environment and some working capital and these are the ingredients provided by the State.  The framework is not only the legislation, it also comprises the composition of the Authority.  It is essential that a satisfactory balance is achieved which gives fair representation to all the interests involved in the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> I have spoken earlier about the important role played in this country by the Turf Club and National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  I am proposing to allot two places on the Authority to stewards of the Turf Club and one place to a steward of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. I will, in filling the remaining places, endeavour to achieve reasonable geographical balance, a gender balance and a general balance of the main interests involved.</P>
    <P>For seven further places I am proposing a system of nominated panels from which we will choose the appointees.  Organisations which are well known in the industry will nominate a panel of at least three persons to represent their interests.  The racecourses, because of their pivotal role in the sector, will get two places.  Breeders, owners, trainers, bookmakers and employees will each have one representative.</P>
    <P>The State is making a major contribution to the financing of the racing industry and, as I said, it will continue to be a major contributor in the years to come.  The Exchequer grant and levy revenue, which can be collected only because it is provided for in legislation, now account for about 60 per cent of the funding of Irish racing.  In other words, the taxpayer is funding Irish racing to the tune of almost two-thirds.  In these circumstances it is reasonable &mdash; indeed essential, that a number of the members be selected and appointed by the Minister. I propose that four out of the 14 be appointed in this way.  They will, of course, be people involved in and-or interested in the industry but not necessarily representative of any one sector.</P>

      <P>One at least must be representative of horseracing in Northern Ireland.  Ours is a 32 county industry and it is crucial that the composition of the Authority reflects that fact.  Indeed, I will be asking the Authority to have particular regard to how the potential of <Col N="1546" /> the industry in Northern Ireland can be fully exploited.</P>
      <P>This will be a 14 person Authority. The legislation provides that the Minister appoints the chairman from the 14 appointed members and that he or she will have a five year term of office.  The ordinary members &mdash; other than the stewards, whose periods on the Authority will be coterminous with their period of office in the governing bodies &mdash; will remain for three years and will then be replaced on a rotational basis over the following two years.  This will allow for continuity as well as gradual change.</P>
      <P>The Authority will, of course, appoint its own chief executive and other staff, decide on its organisational structure and its headquarters.  We will not be interfering in these areas in any way except to provide in the Bill that all existing employees of the Racing Board will be offered employment in the Authority or in one of its subsidiaries on similar terms to those that they currently enjoy.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that as much as possible of this personnel and organisational work can be done while the Bill is being processed in the Oireachtas, I intend to establish the Authority on an interim basis at an early date.</P>
      <P>That is what I wish to say about the background to the Bill and its contents. Before concluding I should say that I intend to introduce some technical amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The main amendments I have in mind will cover three areas.  Under section 39 I intend to delete subsection (d) which deals with the way in which Irish horseracing is represented at international events.  This area has been, and can be, well covered without the need for legislative provision and I do not, therefore, propose to make such provision. I propose to allocate the function of licensing of racecourses to the Racing Regulatory Body under this section. They currently perform this function under the rules of racing and this should be recognised in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 41 I propose to amend the text to clarify the position in relation to the use of Revenue from funds collected <Col N="1547" /> by the Racing Regulatory Body. What we originally provided in the Bill was perhaps insufficiently precise.  In the amendment we will provide that revenue from funds held by the Racing Regulatory Body on establishment day on behalf of owners and others licensed by the Racing Regulatory Body under the rules of racing and from all funds obtained in the future from its control activities, including implementing the rules and providing the integrity services, must be taken into account in determining its charges.  This will, of course be a transparent exercise.  We are not seeking to interfere in the use of funds held by the governing bodies as a private club or which will be earned by them in the future from activities other than those covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing an amendment to section 44 to require the Racing Regulatory Body to inform the Authority of changes in the rules of racing only rather than to consult with it before they could actually make these changes.  The consultation was intended to be just that and did not suggest that the Authority could veto such changes.  However, I am glad to clarify this by a revised text.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I acknowledge that this is in the main a representational body. To that extent and in, of course, other important ways, it is different from the Racing Board.  This should add to its influence and Authority.  It is important that it acts in a cohesive way in the best interests of racing.  The members of the Authority, despite their mainly sectoral background, must see themselves, and act, as a board of directors for Irish racing.  Membership extends to all the principal interests in the industry.  The calibre of people appointed will underline the importance we attach to the Authority's work.  All will be people deeply involved in, or extremely knowledgeable of, Irish racing.  All will be committed supporters of its development. Bringing them together to constitute the Authority gives them a unique opportunity to oversee the running of the industry and to provide for its maximum <Col N="1548" /> development, but they can do this only if they act in a cohesive and unified way.  A great responsibility rests on them but I am satisfied that they will fully discharge it.</P>
    <P>Irish racing has always been fortunate in the quality of those who have come forward voluntarily to run its affairs.  This is true of the members of the governing bodies down through the years, and, in particular, its stewards.  It is equally true of those who have served on the Racing Board since 1945.  They have worked diligently and successfully to develop our industry and a great debt of gratitude is due to them all.</P>
    <P>The momentum for structural change in the industry came from these men and women in the industry who recognised that the lack of unified body exacerbated the problems facing them.  As a result, the directors of the Racing Board and the stewards set up a joint working party under the chairmanship of Dr. Paddy Moriarty to identify the key areas to be addressed and outlines a possible new structure.  The very valuable work by this group formed a basis from which an industry committee, established by me under the chairmanship of Michael Dowling, Secretary of my Department, worked to produce agreement on what was in effect a draft Bill to establish the new structure.  The Bill now before us is largely the result of the agreement reached in that committee.  While the Bill was being formally drafted, I set up an interim committee, composed of representatives of the governing bodies, the Racing Board and the Association of Irish Racecourses under the chairmanship of Denis Brosnan to recommend organisational structures and financial arrangements which will help the Authority to get off the ground quickly and commence its invaluable work without delay.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, on occasions there were disagreements in these groups but they worked conscientiously to overcome these and, in the and, the whole process concluded with broad consensus which is reflected in the Bill.  This work was invaluable and I thank the chairman &mdash;<Col N="1549" /> Paddy Moriarty, Michael Dowling and Denis Brosnan &mdash; and all the members of the groups for their unstinted efforts in signposting the way forward.  The quality of all those involved and the time and effort they were prepared to put into this work are typical of the industry.  I have no doubt that we will have a similar experience with those who agree to serve on the new Authority.</P>
    <P>To reiterate briefly, the purpose of this Bill is to: establish an overall authority to manage, promote and develop Irish racing; put in place an updated and comprehensive legal framework for the industry; and give legal recognition to the work of the governing bodies in regard to the rules and integrity of racing.  In association with the new legislation, the Government has greatly increased the level of its financial support to the industry and that support will be maintained. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been described as a blueprint for radical change in the industry.  The new Horseracing Authority will take control from the Racing Board; the role of the governing bodies &mdash; the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee &mdash; will be to implement the rules of racing and provides services.  Someone said recently that this Bill is gelding the Turf Club.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that the Minister proposes to make a number of amendments which should be of help in meeting some of the objections raised and with which we will deal in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Authority has been structured &mdash; extending the Government's appetite for political cronyism &mdash; to control and regulate racing to such an extent that the description of the Bill as nationalising racing fits comfortably.  The Bill funks the real issue, that of funding.  There is no reference to the consumer, the racegoer and punter.  The Minister has held a carrot of almost £7 million out to a cash starved industry in case any of its individual components dare to criticise what he is trying to do.  This adds up to blackmail; <Col N="1550" /> it is being implied that if they rock the boat they will get nothing.  There is no vision or new ideas.  The key recommendations of the Killanin commission have been ignored.  There is grave disquiet throughout the industry about the Bill, which is hopelessly flawed.</P>
    <P>It would be reasonable to assume from what I said that I see little right with the Bill but I concede that there is little room for argument about the need to reform the structure, organisation and financing of the industry which contributes up to 1 per cent of GDP and employs up to 30,000 people directly and in many linked industries.  It is a flagship industry with a superb international reputation and is respected in every corner of the world. Our racecourses are the shop windows for our breeders, trainers and jockeys.</P>
    <P>A board was set up under the 1945 Act to foster racing and breeding.  Those who acted on that board did an excellent job without receiving any remuneration. Criticism was expressed about the role it played &mdash; its sins of omission rather than commission &mdash; it was not seen to be active in leading the industry towards the next century.</P>
    <P>The Minister barely mentioned the evolution of this Bill but it is an interesting story from which much can be learned.  The Bill is the pup of three committees. The Minister referred to the Moriarty committee.  I have failed to discover what that committee recommended but I take the Minister's word that it did report.  This was superseded by the Dowling committee which did excellent work and I have its report in front of me.  As the Minister mentioned, it produced a draft Bill which received the broad support of the different components of the industry.  It received far greater support than this Bill.</P>
    <P>We need to analyse what happened between the time the Dowling committee produced its draft Bill and when this legislation went to print.  If the Minister is insisting that this Bill is the product of the industry he can be transparent with us and tell us how it evolved and who recommended the changes in the draft Bill produced by the Dowling committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Neither were they recommended by the interim committee chaired by Denis Brosnan.  I await the Minister's explanation.</P>
    <P>It appears that those who could not get their way under the Dowling committee by fair means have done so under the Brosnan interim committee, although that committee did not overtly recommend any change.  This is not an industry Bill and the Minister should not portray it as such.  The Minister's intentions were good.  He started by having the racing industry propose its own reform and modernisation.  However, the Bill has been undemocratically hijacked by a select few and, with respect, the Minister appears to be the patsy in all of this.</P>
    <P>The Dowling committee recommended that there be 13 members on the new Authority.  There are to be 14 members.  We await an explanation as to why the Minister increased the number from 13 to 14.  Was it to ensure an extra political seat?  He can be frank with me. I know how the system works and we exchange views on this quite regularly. Was it to ensure an extra political seat to keep the Coalition balance happy?  Did the Minister have to look after his partners in Government?  In a way I would prefer if he could tell me that that is why it happened.  Though people outside this House do not like that kind of political cronyism, we know it is going on and that the Coalition Government are past masters at it, and we would at least understand the reason for the increase.  Was it, perhaps, to protect the chairperson and ensure that the majority on the board supported his views?  I do not know; I am repeating what is being said outside this House and in the industry.  If we cannot be frank and honest in dealing with this major industry, we do it no justice.  Why did the Minister increase the membership of the board from 13 to 14?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>And give the chairman two votes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the effect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> We await the Minister's explanation.  He has always been fair and frank with us and I trust he will be so in replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There is also a view that a serious effort is being made in this Bill to do down all who have been involved in the governing of racing, but particularly the Turf Club. I may as well say it &mdash; I have been direct about other things that have been said outside this House &mdash; the Turf Club has had its quota of stuffed shirts.  Let us call a spade a spade.  There are those in the Turf Club whose accents grate on the nerves of some.  Perhaps many of them represent a different time and a different world, but let us, and particularly the Minister, not be driven by prejudice or paranoia when it comes to legislation. The members of the Turf Club have done an excellent job in an honorary capacity for over 200 years.  Their collective wisdom, experience, love and understanding of horses and horseracing will not be met anywhere else.  I can assure the Minister that whoever is on the Authority when he finishes fixing the nominations, political and otherwise, it will be hard to match the collective wisdom of the people who have served the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee for all those years.  Let us not allow prejudices to get in our way.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club too recognises the need to modernise the racing industry.  It must also look to its own internal structures, change its own systems, become more democratic and more transparent. Changes there must be, but not decimation. Much dirt and ashes are being raked over, and I urge the Minister not to allow this Bill, with his name on the back of it, to be used to settle old scores. The Minister knows what I am talking about; I do not have to spell it out.</P>
    <P>Let us look to the Bill.  I will concentrate on the areas of most controversy now and we can deal with the other detailed areas on Committee Stage.  The Schedule indicates the composition of the Irish Horseracing Authority.  I have already referred to the change that occurred between the Dowling committee report and the publishing of the <Col N="1553" /> Bill, even though it was never recommended by the Brosnan committee which superseded the Dowling committee.  Will the Minister explain how and why that happened?  When they set up their non-statutory body in the UK, which I believe is a great success, they did not try to nationalise horseracing.  We are following the French &mdash; they are such a good example of how to run things.  Will the Minister explain, why, in the UK, the industry can accept the nominated individual from each of the sectors of the industry to their board while he does not have the trust in the individual sectors of the racing industry here to accept their nominees?</P>
    <P>I do not know what it is the Minister does not trust.  Is he afraid that they will also be members of the Turf Club.  Is he afraid they will all be male, that there will not be a woman among them, or is he afraid that they will all be female? Why can the Minister not trust the individual sectors who have regulated their component parts to the best of their ability?</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill that I am unhappy about.  I feel the Minister is being pushed and shoved and that undemocratic things are happening in the background.  However, when it comes down to it, one of the few points I will be sticking on is the issue of the Minister's refusal to accept the nominations of the component parts of the industry, whether it is the breeders, the trainers or whoever. It would be a most effective authority if the Minister could trust the individual sectors to propose their own people for the seats on this authority.  I invite the Minister to explain this nonsense of inviting a panel of at least three names so that the Minister can decide which of the three, four in the the case of breeders, will be selected to serve on this authority &mdash; I wonder who will be looking over his shoulder as he does it.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister has said over the years about the knowledge and wisdom of people in the industry and the contribution made by the industry over the years is true, why should he feel that he is a better position to decide who should <Col N="1554" /> represent the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders on the new authority?  Surely they should decide who represents them.  If that representative of the breeders or of any other component part of the industry does a bad job, that representative can be moved sideways very quickly by the relevant body when the time comes to replace him.  I urge the Minister to look at this point because if he wants the tag of political cronyism to destroy this new authority before it gets off the ground, he is going the right way about it.  He has increased the number of political appointments.  It is hoped that he will be able to explain the logic behind that, but let him not extend political control to the nominees of the component parts of the industry as well as to the four that he is taking to himself under this Bill.  I hope the Minister understands the damage he will do to the industry if he politicises the authority to that extent.  We will talk about the authority again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other huge criticism is that the Minister funked it in regard to funding. Column inches have been written since the Bill appeared in print about section 27, which has been referred to in the media as clause 27.  I can understand where the Minister is coming from in terms of the Parliamentary language used in section 27 and the sort of waffle that is involved in putting an enabling process in any Bill to allow moneys to be spent on the industry if that is the intention of the Minister of the day.  Much time and effort and a great deal of wisdom has gone into funding racing in Ireland over the years.  There have been several committees, particularly the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Breeding Industry under Lord Killanin, which published a report in July 1986. One of the key recommendations of that committee is as follows:</P>
    <P>One of our main recommendations is that one-fifth of the taxes raised from off-course betting should be channelled back into the Irish racing industry. Ireland is the only one of the major racing countries where racing does not <Col N="1555" /> benefit from the proceeds of betting off-course.</P>
    <P>This is all the more serious given that we do not know whether a future Government will be favourably disposed towards Irish racing &mdash; we cannot read too far down the line politically &mdash; and that we will be one of the few countries that does not fund its racing industry from a levy on off-course betting.  I think I know why the Minister funked it on this one, but it would be unfair to say it.  If he wants to make a name for himself as a major reformer of the racing industry here he should decide that funding will be provided from a levy on off-course betting, one-fifth of which would generate approximately £7 million this year. That is close to the figure the Minister promised the industry.  He should put a mechanism in place that will guarantee the industry annual funding without having to resort to the budget or the Finance Bill every year.  If off-course betting is reduced because the punter is not satisfied, or if there is a recession or downfall in the industry, the amount of money going into the industry will be reduced.  It would be up to the industry and those organising racing to ensure that value is given to the punter to guarantee buoyancy in the take from off-course betting tax.</P>
    <P>We cannot be right and every other country wrong in this regard.  All other countries have moved towards a levy on off-course betting to fund racing. However, despite the collective wisdom of the industry here, who claim this is the right way to proceed and a commission of inquiry which examined all the options, the Minister will not go down that road.  The lack of vision in this Bill is underlined by the fact that the Minister refused to make that critical move in terms of funding the industry although that is what the industry wants.  The Minister talked about the Bill being industry driven.  Who in the industry does not support a percentage of the off-course betting tax being provided on an annual basis to fund the industry?</P>
    <P>The crucial problem in the industry is <Col N="1556" /> a lack of funding.  As a result of the reduction in on-course betting, the lack of funding going back into the system for the maintenance of our racecourses, prize money and so on is causing great difficulties.  The industry is in danger of spiralling downwards unless something is done to stop the freefall.  Why did the Minister funk it?  Why will he not, even at this stage, consider an amendment?  I ask him not to let the mandarins in the Department of Finance dictate to him. We are the politicians, they have a job to do and so have we.  The legislation in respect of the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited, which passed through the House this morning, is an indication of politicians doing something even though the mandarins in the Department of Finance do not want it.  There are precedents for this.  We, as elected members of Parliament, and the Minister, as a member of the Government, should govern.  He should show his strength on this issue rather than allow the permanent government dictate.  It has a job to do and I respect that.  It is doing what it believes it should do, but I ask the Minister to play the politician in this case and in doing so he will do what is right for the Irish horseracing industry.</P>
    <P>Given his commitment to the industry and his wisdom and knowledge, Lord Killanin's views on this Bill deserve to put on the record of the House.  An article in <i>The Irish Field</i> of 16 April describes section 27 as spineless with no firm commitment to the financing of the industry. I accept that article was drafted by officials of the Department of Finance who would not allow the Minister have his way.  However, that is cold comfort for those who want successful reform of the industry.  In regard to the Bill, Lord Killanin stated:</P>
    <P>It is to me inconceivable that anyone can think that one of Ireland's great natural industries of the highest international repute can plan its economic future on such a weak premise.</P>
    <P>The premise to which he referred was section 27.  He went on to indicate that the Bill is &ldquo;hopelessly flawed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Will the Minister examine section 27 before Committee Stage?  He should be his own man in this regard and do what the industry wants.  If this is an industry-driven Bill, the Minister should amend it in a way that is crucial to its success, which involves funding the industry from a percentage of the off-course betting levy.  Out of a total of £350 million and with a tax-take of £35 million, 20 per cent of the levy on off-course betting would amount to approximately £7 million.  The Minister should put this formula in place so that we will not have to come back here to debate the matter.</P>
    <P>There are a few other questions to which I did not find answers in the Bill. When the new Authority takes over and the regulatory authority is gelded, making it relatively ineffective, who will be responsible for licensing and trainers? I do not see reference to that in the Bill. That area needs further clarification.  As the Minister is nationalising and regulating all other aspects of the industry, he might as well tell us what he has in mind for this section so that we will not meet a surprise down the road.</P>
    <P>I am curious as to how the Northern Ireland racing interests will respond to this Bill.  They respected the authority and direction of our Turf Club which was a voluntary and private organisation, but I am not sure what their position will be now with a State authority here assuming it can direct the two race courses in the North as to their fixtures, prize money, charges to bookmakers for their pitches, changes in SP and so on.  I am not sure if the members of the racing industry in the North, with whom we have always enjoyed an excellent relationship under the present structure, will accept the new structure.  There are sensitivities in that regard which need to be spelt out.  I would appreciate if the Minister would tell the House the negotiations that have taken place in this regard and the commitments he has received from the Northern Ireland racing interests that they are agreeable to take direction from the new Authority so that this will not cause difficulties in the future.  It would be regrettable if the excellent relationship that <Col N="1558" /> exists between the two regions was jeopardised in any way, which could happen because of a lack of consultation or sensitivity towards the position of racing interests in the North.  Perhaps we could head off any difficulties which might arise in that regard.</P>
    <P>The detail of the Bill will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  There is a lack of direct consumer representation &mdash;racegoers and punters&mdash;on the Authority. The Racing Club of Ireland is the only body which represents their interests.  I accept that it may not represent the interests of all racegoers and punters, but it has done excellent work for a number of years.  The Minister assured them in a vague manner in a reply to a Parliamentary Question that they will be looked after.  Will he explain how he intends to look after their interests on the new Authority?</P>
    <P>While a Fianna Fáil racegoer may be one of the four, that will not be accepted as representing the interests of consumers. Will the Minister move the issue one step away from political cronyism and accept the independent nomination of the Racing Club of Ireland as representing the interests of the consumer in this area?  Without the consumer being satisfied with racing, the ancillary services, the punting facilities on race courses and so on, racing will not improve here.  Most legislation nowadays is driven by the desire to satisfy consumers.  There is little effort in this Bill to satisfy the consumer &mdash; the racegoer and punter. Will the Minister accept the nomination of a representative of the Racing Club of Ireland on this new Authority?</P>
    <P>The industry employs 30,000, others would say it employs 40,000 when account is taken of indirect services related to it.  The industry provides 20,000 full-time jobs and probably as many part-time jobs making a total of 40,000.  It is comprised of breeders, owners, trainers and their respective staffs, racecourse staff including those employed in catering and ancillary services, on course and off-course bookmakers, staff who operate the tote, racecard printers, sales personnel at <Col N="1559" /> Goffs and Tatterstalls and around the country.  It also includes vets, farriers, jockeys, not forgetting the unsung heroes and heroines who ride out every day in all weathers which is separate from their racecourse duties, saddlers, feed merchants, manufacturers of racing colours and those involved in structural services and capital investment on racecourses, stable yards and stud farms.  The list of interested people in this legislation is endless, because their present and future depend on the Minister getting matters right.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister said, the row raging throughout the industry has bonded it as never before.  It has managed to bond an industry whose component parts have always had a natural suspicion of one another.  That is an incredible achievement.  I urge the Minister to revert to the Dowling proposals for the legislation to allow direct election by the component bodies to the new Authority, not a political selection from a panel of at least three as required by the Minister. He should ensure the future of this great industry by putting in place a funding mechanism to link funding of our racing industry to off-course betting.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage.  I dislike an awful lot in the Bill, but I will not oppose it because I recognise the need for modernisation in respect of the financing, structures and organisation of racing.  Those who want to see it succeed, expand and to continue as a flagship industry want the Minister to get this right.  There will be many difficulties on Committee Stage if some problems cannot be resolved.  I have great faith in the Minister listening to the concerns of the Opposition.  He has shown he will be prepared to amend the Bill by way of his proposed amendments, but I am sure he will be prepared to go a little further to ensure it will be one of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill as it is an important one, but I do not welcome it.  I have serious reservations about it. <Col N="1560" /> Unlike Deputy Doyle, who also has reservations. I am disposed to oppose it because its approach is fundamentally wrong.  Unless the Minister satisfies me in his reply I propose to vote against it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given the impression that the country is cheering the introduction of the Bill and that those interested in the industry are delighted. The contrary is the case, most people are opposed to it and many are horrified by it.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in the racing industry and the closely related breeding industry were recognised in the mid 1980s when the then Government set up a commission under Lord Killanin.  The Killanin report is generally regarded by most who have considered it as worthy and worthwhile.  It was set up around 1982 and the report was produced several years later &mdash; with good reason because great care was taken with it and extensive studies were made of successful arrangements in other countries.  For that reason what I say about the Bill or any consideration of it by this House should be prefaced by noting what Lord Killanin said.  He is as well qualified as anyone to comment on it.  He has no personal axe to grind, knows more about the industry than anyone else and is better informed as to what is needed.  He is &mdash; whether we like it or not and I am sure some do not &mdash; the most successful Irish sporting administrator this century by virtue of the office he held internationally for such a long time.</P>
      <P>A letter by Lord Killanin published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 19 March 1994 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir, &mdash; Unfortunately those responsible for drafting the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill 1994 have patently failed to study or understand the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horsebreeding Industry &mdash; the so-called Killanin Commission. I would like it known that I disagree totally with the content and direction of this proposed Bill.  It has been produced too rapidly, without enough thought given to detail and too little discussion with those deeply <Col N="1561" /> involved in the two industries&mdash;racing and breeding.</P>
    <P>It is a hopelessly flawed document. How is it possible that in all its 42 pages there is not one mention of the &ldquo;off-track&rdquo; betting industry?  Without a marriage to the betting outlets in the main streets, racing in Ireland will continue its downward trajectory.</P>
    <P>The real breakpoint comes in clause 27.</P>
    <P>He quotes the section and continues:</P>
    <P>It is to me inconceivable that anyone can think that one of Ireland's great natural industries, of the highest international repute, can plan its economic future on such a weak premise.</P>
    <P>The Killanin Commission was criticised by some for progressing too slowly &mdash; I would criticise the authors of this Green Paper [I assume he means the Bill] as moving too fast and too carelessly.  I would urge them to think again, for if this Bill is passed into law in its present form, irreparable damage will have been done to the thoroughbred industry. &mdash;</P>
    <P>Yours, etc.,</P>

    <P>I agree with Lord Killanin.  On reading the Bill one is struck that whereas the Racing Board of 1945 was a semi-State body and exercised certain controls, the proposed Irish horse racing Authority will be all-enveloping.  The proposed Authority will not be the &ldquo;Racing Board Mark 2&rdquo; as some commentators have referred to it, it will be the &ldquo;Racing Board to the Power of 2&rdquo;.  Its powers will be more widespread, enveloping and extensive. On reading the Bill one will see how often the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; are used, such as &ldquo;the Minister must approve of this&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister appoints that&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Minister must be satisfied about this&rdquo;.  The Minister is involved in every aspect of the Bill and included in nearly every section.  He seems to want to have his finger on everything that happens. <Col N="1562" /> The proposed Authority will be a State board in the ultimate sense and is not just nationalisation in the sense of ownership, it is nationalisation in the sense of an activity which of its nature should be controlled by those who participate in it.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the outcome of the inquiry by the London Stock Exchange authorities in relation to the sale of Greencore shares in 1993; if there will be any explanation as to which events were detrimental to the Stock Exchange; and the replies he has received to correspondence seeking further information on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a very brief resumé of the events that gave rise to the Stock Exchange investigation into the circumstances surrounding the placing by Davy Stockbrokers of 25.4 million Greencore shares on my behalf.</P>
      <P>When the sale of the State's residual shareholding in Greencore to ADM fell through in late April 1994 it was decided that the shares should be disposed of by way of a placing with institutions.  Davy Stockbrokers undertook to place the shares on Friday 30 April 1993 for a fee of £175,000, and on the advice of Davy's, Warburg's of London were retained as a backstop arrangement to take up to ten million shares, if the need arose, for a fee of £550,000.  This sum represented 2 per cent of the value of the ten million share and would compare with standard underwriting fees for this type of transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Davy's advised my Department sometime after noon on 30 April that an announcement could be made that the <Col N="1563" /> placing was successful on the basis that more than 17.5 million shares had been placed with institutions and that the arrangement with Warburg's was there as a failsafe.  Both I and the company issued statements to the effect that the placing was successful.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday evening, 4 May Davy's indicated to my Department that certain technical difficulties had arisen with the placing.  On Wednesday, 5 May I was informed that Davy's had taken a decision on Friday, 30 April that it was inappropriate for Warburg's to be seen to hold a large number of shares and placed the shares instead with companies connected with Davy's.  They also disclosed that they had an agreement with Warburg's to share the downside risk on a 50-50 basis.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 6 May my Department received a copy of the Davy summary of events prepared for the Stock Exchange which confirmed the fee sharing arrangement and which also disclosed that as Davy's did not wish to place a major holding of Greencore shares with Warburg's, the agreement with Warburg's had been revised to reflect their reduced participation in the placing.  Under the revised agreement the fee payable to Warburg's was reduced to £100,000.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 7 May Davy's contacted all purchasers of the shares and placed all but 9.6 million which were taken up, by prior agreement, by the Investment Bank of Ireland.  As a result I disposed of my entire shareholding at the agreed price of £2.75 per share and the proceeds of the sale were lodged with the Exchequer on the date originally agreed.  The fees of £725,000 were waived.</P>
    <P>As a result of the failed placing I asked the Attorney General to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the placing and to report to me on any apparent breaches of the law arising from the facts established.  Because of the nature of the inquiry and the role of the Attorney General as the chief law officer of the State the report is privileged.  The report cannot and will not, therefore, be published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> Nevertheless, in the interest of keeping this House informed, as I have done throughout this issue, I can confirm that in general terms it arrived at the same conclusions as the Stock Exchange report to which I will refer later.  The report concluded that there was no evidence of a breach of the criminal law on the basis of the information available to the Attorney General.  The report also concluded that the State had suffered no loss as a result of the unsatisfactory placing of 30 April. In the circumstances, as the State did not sustain a financial loss from the placing I am advised that legal proceedings are not warranted.</P>
    <P>The London Stock Exchange announced on 16 March that disciplinary proceedings concerning the placing of the Irish Government shares in Greencore by Davy's had been concluded.  A press statement in the following terms was agreed by Davy's and the Stock Exchange:</P>
    <P>The London Stock Exchange announces that disciplinary proceedings concerning the placing of the Irish Government shares in Greencore by J &amp; E Davy Stockbrokers have been concluded.</P>
    <P>The Disciplinary Committee of the Exchange has found that Davy's conduct was, in some respects, detrimental to have interests of the Stock Exchange, and Davy Stockbrokers have been reprimanded and fined £150,000.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to me I have no reason to disagree with the finding of the disciplinary committee of the exchange.</P>
    <P>Under the rules of the exchange no further statement can be made by that body.  However, I, as Minister for Finance, felt that I required additional information on the disciplinary process.  I needed this additional information because it may have implications for the Stock Exchange Bill which is now nearing completion and also because it may be relevant to the engagement of Davy's on Government work on future occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> I wrote to Davy Stockbrokers on 21 March asking them to disclose the grounds on which they were found to have acted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the Stock Exchange and to specify the charges made against them. I have received on a confidential basis a response from Davy's which indicated that the charge related to non-disclosures of arrangements with Warburg's and the provision of misleading information to the effect that the placing of shares had been completed.</P>
    <P>Specifically the issues that Davy's were asked to answer fell into three parts.  Part one dealt with the non-disclosure to the Department of Finance of the original fee splitting arrangements and the revised splitting arrangement with Warburg.  Part two related to the announcements that the placing had been completed made shortly after mid-day on the day of the placing by the Greencore press release and by the press release issued by the Minister for Finance which the Stock Exchange alleged were misleading based on the information given by Davy's.  This part also related to statements made to Davy's to two of their clients shortly after mid-day on the day of the placing, also the effect that the placing was complete. Part three related to the failure of Davy's to correct the public announcements and the statements made to two clients.  I repeat that the information which I have received from Davy's was provided on a confidential basis and, accordingly, I do not propose to publish or to elaborate further on the contents of its letter.</P>
    <P>The disciplinary committee concluded that it was apparent to it from the evidence given at the hearing that the events giving rise to the charges were not a deliberate and pre-determined course of action by Davy's but a result of the desire to complete the transaction efficiently early in the morning.  I do not, therefore, see the need for any further action on my part.  I consider the matter closed.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the matter is closed with regard to the Greencore placing but it may have some implications for the Stock Exchange Bill that will be introduced shortly.  I accept that, as the rules of the <Col N="1566" /> exchange stand at the moment, I do not have the right to demand information, but I do not believe that any institution should be able to keep vital information from the Irish public.  I will look into the Stock Exchange Bill, currently being drafted, to see that this situation will not arise in future.  There is, clearly, a need to take account of the public policy requirement of Stock Exchange investigations. There is also a need, however, to maintain a judicious balance between the publication of investigations and the public interest on the one hand the efficient operation of the market and commercial confidentiality on the other.</P>
    <P>It is entirely proper that I should reflect on the constraints that the existing rules of the International Stock Exchange had on the matter of disclosure regarding this rule breach, but any desire for a higher level of disclosure under the new rules cannot change the validity of the existing rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Davy Stockbrokers was fined £150,000, a little more than a parking fine.  We have been told that its conduct in this matter was detrimental to the interests of the Stock Exchange.  What did Davy's do that was detrimental to the Stock Exchange and that incurred the fine?  What did it do wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined that information in my reply.  There were three matters put by the International Stock Exchange to Davy's: the non-disclosure to the Department of Finance of the original fee splitting arrangement and the revised splitting arrangement with Warburgh's; the announcements that placing had been completed, made shortly after midday, when that was not the case; and they did not correct the public announcements.  These were the issues for which Davy's had to answer and on which the fine was based.  It was not found to be totally at fault on all the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the sale of taxpayers' interests <Col N="1567" /> was that Davy Stockbrokers, who advised the Minister on the sale and conducted the sale, ended up buying seven million shares?  In future in any privatisation will the Minister ensure that there are separate Government advisers to brokers selling shares and that the brokers cannot buy some of the stock? That is the very minimum required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point.  The way we dealt with the tranche of the Irish Life shares would certainly be good practice in future dealings.  I agree with Deputy Yates' second point that when the Government appoints a firm of stockbrokers to deal in the affairs of the public, they should not sell shares to themselves. I did not think that would happen in this case and I am sure this will be a stipulation for all future cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates would probably agree that Davy's has suffered far more than the fine of £150,000.  It is important for us as legislators to ensure the the Stock Exchange legislation, which dates back to 1799, is brought into a modern Act where we will have transparency.  That is another annoying aspect of all of this but Davy's has paid its price.  The matter is now closed and we can proceed with the Stock Exchange legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that under the new legislation the reports and findings of all disciplinary inquiries will be published so that we will never again be unaware what happened.  One has to write to the offender to find out.  It is totally unacceptable that under the London Stock Exchange rules the findings are not published in the case of a reprimand such as this.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that under future legislation, the reports or findings of any disciplinary cases or inquiries of this nature will be published in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into too much detail, the answer to be Deputy's question is yes.  The position is very <Col N="1568" /> unsatisfactory and all I can say is that in 1799 the London Stock Exchange knew how to protect itself and it is our job to ensure that in future the taxpayers are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 8, 10, 14 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are underway currently with the European Commission with a <Col N="1569" /> view to agreeing the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.  The discussions are proceeding satisfactorily and we have reached agreement with the Commission on the substantive issues. The actual detailed drafting of the Community Support Framework and the process of approving it at community level could take up to two months.</P>
    <P>There is no question of publishing a revised National Development Plan.  The national authorities decide their development strategy and on the basis of this put forward their proposals for expenditure in the structural area, including the use of the Structural Funds and domestic resources, in the development plan.  The plan is then discussed with the European Commission and on foot of those discussions the Community Support Framework is agreed.  Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the operational programmes are approved. These set out in more detail the objectives and measures for each of the main sectors.  The programmes are the legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.</P>
    <P>As was already explained to the Dáil, the Irish side in negotiations has made it clear that the National Development Plan represents a set of strategies and priorities carefully chosen by the Government and that we would want to see the basic shape of the plan reflected in the Community Support Framework.  It was for this reason that the Government decided that the total expenditure provisions in the plan should be adjusted on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis to take account of the shortfall in EU aid.  I do not intend to get involved in commenting on the details of the discussions or on the arrangements for meetings with Commission officials. This would be neither helpful nor appropriate. I can say, however, that the agreement on the substantive points reached with the Commission means that the CSF will reflect the broad shape of the plan and that all the key elements will be included and I am happy with the success of the negotiations.  The Community Support <Col N="1570" /> Framework when agreed will be published.</P>
    <P>I assume that the reference to ESRI in the questions refers to the chapter of the ESRI's &ldquo;Economic Perspective for the Medium Term&rdquo; dealing with the National Development Plan.  Since the plan was published a wide range of views have been expressed on the plan by economists and others in the various conferences, newspaper articles, etc., on the subject. The ESRI report draws on work undertaken for the European Commission and its conclusions, for example, its strong emphasis on the importance of human resources, provided a valuable input into the discussions between Commission and Irish officials.  Others of its recommendations will be considered in the detailed work on programmes and project selection.  Its views have been discussed at official level but there are no plans for a meeting at ministerial level to discuss the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the reason it will take two months to publish what is now agreed with the Commission is that it will safely bring the Government beyond 9 June, the day of the European and local elections, before the bad news emerges?  I regret the vague nature of the Minister's reply.  If £800 million is cut off a plan, money that the Government thought was available, it must mean some substantial adjustments to the plan.  The Minister referred to <i>pro-rata</i> adjustments.  Where precisely will the axe fall?  Will it fall on Tallaght Hospital, the light rail system for Dublin, the human resources project or the turf burning electricity station? Will the Minister come clean, given all the past failings on this issue, and say where the axe will fall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The news from Brussels is very good.  The negotiations have gone extremely well and the priorities which we have set out in the National Plan will be reflected in the CSF as published. We are not anxious to delay the publication of the CSF because it is very good news for Irish people.  A substantial <Col N="1571" /> investment programme will be undertaken with EU funding, Exchequer funding and with funding from the private sector and State companies.  This investment programme will total over £19 billion. Deputy Yates will appreciate however, that one or two minor technical details remain to be ironed out and the Commission's processes involve the CSF being agreed by the other countries and finally translated into all the languages. We understand that process will take approximately two months.</P>
      <P>The adjustments that the Government has made will be made up, hopefully, at the mid-term review on a pro-rata basis. The shape of the priorities we have set between investment in direct job creation, in productive infrastructure and in the education, training and skills of our people, and in targeting unemployment black spots will be reflected in the CSF as published.  I am pleased that our negotiations have been so successful and I look forward to the publication of the CSF.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could put the question more simply to the Minister of State.  Unless she is to do an exercise in the miracle of the loaves and fishes, it is simply not possible to make £7.2 stretch to £8 billion.  Will she outline where the shortfall of funding will arise or will it be the case, as the Taoiseach inferred yesterday in the House, that the taxpayers' will have to make up the shortfall, which is equivalent to restoring the I per cent income levy, to pay for this Government's vanity?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if an investment makes sense from the point of view of the European taxpayer and if it provides an economic return, it also makes economic sense for us to invest in those projects.  We have made <i>pro-rata</i> adjustments at this stage.  Some of the projects will take a little longer to achieve but if they make economic sense today they will continue to make economic sense after 1999.  We have also asked Government Departments and all agencies &mdash; a point underlined in the ESRI report &mdash; to exercise the greatest possible care in project evaluation and selection to ensure we obtain the best possible value for public money and to ensure that each ECU and each pound of taxpayers' money that we spend goes as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should look on this as free money because it will pass our way but once.  It is important that maximum benefit be derived from this expenditure.  The money should be spent in such a way as to contribute to our long term economic growth and job performance.  The Department of Finance is revising the guidelines on public expenditure evaluation and project selection to ensure we <Col N="1573" /> get maximum value for the money.  We will also look on a yearly basis at additional moneys we can use to top up what we get from Brussels.  We were able to do that this year.  If the projects make economic sense to the European taxpayer they will do so at home.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my press statement which accompanied the release of the Exchequer returns, the development of the public finances over the first quarter of this year has been quite satisfactory. However, I do not propose to revise the underlying budget arithmetic in the light of the first quarter's returns, nor do I see any prospect that the current budget deficit of £262 million, .9 per cent of GNP, which was projected in the 1994 budget will be eliminated.</P>

    <P>The principal factor underpinning the strong first-quarter returns was the performance of tax revenue.  Here the yield was boosted by once-off amnesty proceeds and also benefited by comparison with the slack yields over the first quarter <Col N="1574" /> of last year, when tax inflows were depressed by the effects of the currency crisis on interest rates and consumer confidence. In addition, the negative impact of such factors as the elimination of the income levy and the year-on-year decline in DIRT yields will not be fully reflected until the final quarter's returns.  It follows that the tax margin recorded over the first quarter will move back towards the budget target as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that the budget-day projection of expenditure did not reflect certain outgoings which were subsequently established in the <i>Revised Estimates Volume</i> published at the end of March.  The major adjustments are associated with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> comprising the £85 million gross cost of the public service pay agreement, and the £10 million additional spending on headage payments to be made this year.  I am looking to the extra tax buoyancy that will accrue directly from these extra expenditures together with the prudent tax forecast recorded in the budget to broadly counterbalance the additional outgoings.</P>

      <P>The information given in response to Deputy Gregory's question on 13 April referred to the amount of income tax paid by the PAYE sector in 1993 and the amount paid by the farming community in the same year.  It was pointed out in the reply that the amounts paid by each sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and farming sectors.  It was also noted that the amount attributed to the PAYE sector included the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers.</P>
      <P>Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers. The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits as well as special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging.  As with all self-employed taxpayers, farmers are obliged to make annual returns of income and pay the appropriate tax by the due dates.  Returns by farmers are subject to audit in the same manner as other self-assessed taxpayers and I am satisfied that the audit procedures in place are adequate to the task of auditing tax returns from the relevant sectors.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that farmers' compliance levels are comparable to those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>

Would the <Col N="1576" /> Minister agree these figures indicate that not only are the PAYE sector paying their own fair share but the share of every other sector, in particular big farmers? Is this fair or equitable?  What will the Minister do about it?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised some fair questions.  Farmers are assessed for tax on farm profits, actual income, in exactly the same way as other self-employed <Col N="1579" /> persons.  The normal self-employed allowances and reliefs apply to farmers and there is a set-off against farming profits.  The stock relief given to farmers has been reduced in recent years. The self-assessment system which applies to all self-employed taxpayers applies to the income from farming profits.  Farmers are obliged to make their annual returns in the same way as other self-employed persons.  Returns of income made by farmers are subject to audit in the same way as other returns.  Since the introduction of the special audit system, which has been extended for 1994, random audits have not been carried out to the same extent as previously.  Approximately 28,000 audits and less than 3,000 detailed audits have been carried out.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair not to make it clear that the total number of farmers on the Revenue Commissioner records for 1992-93, the last year for which figures are available, was approximately 87,000. This was made up of 54,000 full-time farmers, 15,000 trader-farmers and 18,000 low income farmers.  The 18,000 low income farmers are assessed approximately every three years; by and large they are left alone as they have no taxable income.  The projected number of farmers liable to tax in the period 1993-94 is 28,000.  As Deputy Gregory correctly stated, the difference between the average amounts paid by the PAYE sector and other self-employed people was approximately £200, with a big gap between them and farmers.</P>
      <P>On the question of payments from the EU, all farmers receiving payment have to use their RSI number.  This applies to most, but not all payments&mdash;some further adjustments have to be made. Most of those payments will be taken into account in assessing tax this year. Questions still arise about what happens when all the money has been received from the EU, and this matter still has to be dealt with.  By and large most of the payments will be taken into account for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been trying to increase the number of audits carried out, to extend <Col N="1580" /> the self-assessment system and employ more staff to deal with evasion in whatever quarter.  Apart from the PAYE sector, which has a clean sheet in terms of tax, there is some element of evasion in all sectors.  People who try to evade the system will be pursued under the laws which apply to the self-employed sector generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the burden of taxation must be spread more evenly over all sectors, particularly the farming sector?  Is he aware that the Governor of the Central Bank singled out farmers for not paying their fair share of tax?  Does the Minister accept that the average PAYE worker is paying five or six times as much as the average member of the farming community and that his efforts to rectify this disparity are continuing to fail?  What steps will he take to ensure that this inequity is eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The average payments during the last year for which figures are available are: PAYE workers, £3,903; farmers, £754 and other self-employed persons, £3,664.  I am not going to single out any one sector; it would not be fair to do this.  When the Revenue Commissioners were given additional powers a few years ago very few people supported this move.  However, I have to exclude Deputy Rabbitte from that statement. I am trying to ensure that the system operates more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I reformed the corporation tax system and employed more people to ensure that the system worked properly. The only way to ensure compliance in the self-assessment system is to impose a stringent audit procedure.  It is unfair to generalise and say that if the system is not catching people then everyone is a dodger.  The system is designed to catch people.  If people do not earn the income then they do not pay the tax.  Unless I receive evidence to the contrary, I can only assume that the system is working. The level of compliance among the self-employed is increasing all the time&mdash;the legislation in this area is tough&mdash;and we <Col N="1581" /> have to ensure that it is increased further in the coming years.  I am not prepared to single out any one group and accuse them of anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, as the Minister has said, one cannot generalise. Nonetheless, I pose a general question to him while accepting that he has improved the anti-evasion and enforcement mechanisms in recent years.  Does the Minister not agree that there would appear to be something wrong with the self-assessment system if the owners of the land still contribute no more than an infinitesimal £52 million out of the total income tax yield?  Would he not acknowledge that, from the point of view of the PAYE worker, whether in rural or urban Ireland, there is something wrong there? There are, of course, farmers who do not have an income that would warrant making any significant contribution, but there are farmers on very substantial incomes and to think that, at the end of the day, we will get no more in tax from them than from the unemployed and sick means there is something wrong as far as the urban PAYE worker is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one would have to add in the figure of £33 million, or whatever that would reflect in modern terms, so probably the yield would be approximately £100 million on current figures from the farming community.  As Minister for Finance, I have an obligation to ensure that we get additional revenue to pay for services and allow reduced borrowing.  I believe the self-assessment system and audit procedures are working. Wherever there is non-compliance, it is through the people working in the field on individual cases we can increase the yield.  I cannot say there is not more money to be had from every sector under existing laws.  I am sure there is.  The Revenue Commissioners must be allowed to do their job, with Members of this House supporting them in their task. It would appear that every time they attempt this task, there are more negative howls from this House, which is a disappointment to people trying to do their <Col N="1582" /> job and ensure that we are compliant. While 84,000 farmers were assessed, 28,000 only had to pay under the current law.  What they pay in taxes amounts to approximately £100 million.</P>

      <P>Under the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Act, 1990 Fóir Teoranta was wound up on 2 April 1991.  Its assets and certain of its liabilities were transferred to ICC Bank plc, then the Industrial Credit Corporation plc.</P>
      <P>The balance sheet thus transferred to ICC Bank plc included loans amounting to £11.103 million and investments amounting to £1,086 million, both figures net of provisions.</P>
      <P>In the period from 2 April 1991 to 28 February 1994, the latest date for which figures are available, ICC Bank has collected £7.707 million by way of realisation of loans and investments, interest payments, divident receipts, and recovery of bad debts.</P>
      <P>At 28 February 1994, total loans and investments on the Fóir Teoranta balance sheet amounted to £5.317 million and £0.424 million respectively.  These figures are net of provisions and are subject to audit.</P>

How much of the outstanding £5 million is provided for in bad debts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points arise there. <Col N="1583" /> When Fóir Teoranta was wound up in April 1991 its assets and some of its liabilities were transfered to ICC.  At that stage the State, through the Minister for Finance, took over the liabilities by way of loan, when £75 million was written off the balance sheet.  Since then ICC has managed the portfolio very well and receive a small fee.  I do not believe they have written off anything since.  For example, in their unaudited figures at 28 February last the gross provision was £17.395 million; they had provision for £11.654 million, so that the net figure now is £5.741 million.  Most of that are comprised of loans and investments. Almost £2 million represents interest, dividends and recovery of bad debts, so it is all included in that figure.  I have been looking at the balance sheet in the past few days because it was the end of their accounting period.  I noted that the figure is shrinking fast and contains one major loan only, representing an accumulation of smaller ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that £75 million had been written off which seems to be an extraordinarily large amount of money.  I was not aware of that figure. Has there been any investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts or anyone else to ascertain whether people simply waltzed away with money?  For example, if some company were to approach the IDA, get £75 million and walk out within ten years, they would have some claim on that money.  Does the Minister know how many firms benefited from that write-off, or can he give any additional information on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the debate at the time which, needless to say, was controversial. I do not know the number but I am sure there were a great many.  That was the reason Fóir Teoranta was wound up.  It would be my hope that nobody would ever go down that road again because, as long as the State plays the tune, the perception is that there is no problem in people handing out money. That is what happened.  In fairness to the <Col N="1584" /> people involved, I should say they tried but they were subject to political pressure and commercial examinations were not always undertaken or were not as detailed as they should have been.  That is why we ended up with £75 million being written off at that time.  It should act as a very good lesson for not going down that road again.</P>

      <P>It is news to me as well that £75 million was written off.  I remember the Bill going through the House but cannot quite recall all the detail.  Is it not the case that the IDA took over existing investments for Fóir Teoranta and loans they had given out?  I thought the assurance the House was given at the time was that the new body would be responsible, that there would not be any moneys lost as a result.  There might be bad debts in the normal course of events, but I did not know that loans were written off merely because Fóir Teoranta no longer existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not new information but rather information the House should remember for the future whenever Members might call for the restoration of such institutions.  There was a total of £75 million by way of liabilities in respect of advances made to Fóir Teoranta by the Minister for Finance which were simultaneously written off.  ICC wanted to take over a balance sheet they could handle and they have done so very well.  It was the reason the Government of the day wound up Fóir Teoranta and, if I recall correctly the House agreed to the provisions of the Bill for that reason.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to claims made by the president of the tax officials branch of IMPACT (details supplied) that tax audits of 1,700 self-employed people returned on average an additional £22,000; if these figures are true; the total number of self-employed who are subjected to an audit each year; the plans, if any, he has to increase the number of such audits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy are not representative of the overall yield from the Revenue audit and investigation programmes in 1992.  They ignore cases where the tax returns were accepted, as submitted, with no additional tax liability arising.  In addition, the overall yield is distorted by a number of very large settlements in the period.</P>
      <P>The total number of audits, covering both the self-employed and companies, completed under the self assessment audit programme for the calendar year 1993 &mdash; the latest period for which figures are available &mdash; was 2,537 yielding an average of £7,765 per case.  This compares with audit figures of 770,1,496 and 2,482 cases for the three preceding years, 1990, 1991 and 1992.</P>
      <P>Self assessment audits are only one element of the total Revenue audit programme which also includes PAYE employers, VAT, relevant contracts tax and investigation branch audits.  Taking account of these additional programmes the total revenue audit programme for 1993 involved 24,000 cases, yielding an average of £4,250 per case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the various Revenue audit programmes, cases are selected for audit and investigation following a detailed screening of the returns as filed.  The selection procedures are based on certain perceived defects in the tax return and supporting accounts and/or by reference to information arising from external and other sources.  The method of selection does, however, include a small proportion picked at random.  This is considered necessary to further encourage compliance.  Because of this inherent bias in the selection process, the results from <Col N="1586" /> cases audited or investigated cannot, therefore, be regarded as indicative of the overall level of compliance among the taxpaying community at large.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Revenue Commissioners are conscious of the need for an active audit programme in the context of self assessment.  The level of audits is kept under constant review to ensure compliance and to deter tax evasion. An indication of the commitment of the Government and the Revenue Commissioners to this end is the increase in the numbers of officers allocated to the various audit, investigative and compliance programmes from 212 in 1988 to a present level of some 600.</P>
    <P>The number of cases impacted will vary from year to year depending on the issues involved and the types of cases forming the focus of the programmes in any particular year.  Overall I consider the present audit/investigation programmes to be operating satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the figures are distorted by virtue of the fact that there were some large settlements but, as I understand it, the question relates to 1992.  Is the Minister saying that the figure on average&mdash;I accept averages can be misleading&mdash;of £22,000 yielded as a result of the audits, is inaccurate?  Is it not extraordinary that the new average figure for 1993 of £7,765, secured from self employed persons as a result of the audits, is still twice the average of that paid by the self employed?  Can he give us any indication of the percentage of cases selected at random?  Whether one takes my version or the Minister's version it seems to produce either twice what they are admitting they owe in tax or, if one takes the figure of £22,000 &mdash; the figure produced by the president of the tax officials union&mdash;it is six times what they are paying on average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the figure of £22,000 is wrong is that it ignores cases where the tax returns were accepted as submitted, with no additional tax liability arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that within the figure of 1,700 self employed people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get the headlines at the conference the president of the tax officials union ignored those cases where there were no returns in order to raise the average figure but that is not correct.  The detailed audit under the self assessment audit programme yields on average £7,765 per case.  The audit programme has been in operation for four years.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are 600 people working under the programme. Last year I promised that the number of officers would be increased substantially.  My view is that it is better to have officials out investigating cases than sitting in offices.  The self assessment audits are only one dimension of the total revenue compliance programme.  It also includes the large number of other inspections, visits to premises, VAT checks and so on.  Under the provisions of the self assessment audit programme inspectors have a period of six years to audit a return and any understatement of liability is subject to interest and penalty charges.  With 600 officials working in this area &mdash; a few years ago we had only 100 &mdash; we will see a huge improvement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall the self assessment system here was based on the US and Canadian systems.  As well as focusing on areas where, for one reason or another, Revenue suspect are worth investigating, it is good to take a random selection.  Of the 24,000 cases some few hundred would have been selected at random.  The intention is to use the method of random selection because it indicates to everybody that the system is fair and that there is no witch-hunt.  The self assessment audit is a generous scheme which allows people to be honest. People have to accept the detailed analysis and scrutiny carried out by Revenue when they follow up a particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in what the Minister said about the president of the tax officials union at the annual conference seeking a headline.  It is a hell of a headline if one examines it <Col N="1588" /> in global terms.  Will the Minister agree that the total yield from the spot checks was £107 million, a huge amount from 1,700 people?  The Minister said the average figure is misleading because it does not take into account those who made declarations where no further sums were due.  What proportion of those 1,700 people made such declarations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If one takes a certain period and the amount of money raised one cannot distort the calculations.  If the calculation is done on the basis that the president would want it, he would have arrived at £7,765 rather than £22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, do the sums quickly?  All one has to do is divide 1,700 into £107 million.  The answer will be the average figure no matter what way it is dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware how the other calculation was carried out.  A few large cases in 1992, and new legislation which permitted officers to follow up particular cases, resulted in higher figures.  The total number of audits yielded an average of £7,765 per case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the first stage of the audit process, officers proceed to a detailed audit and may decide to pick on 1992-93.  Recently I asked an inspector of taxes to clarify the basis on which people are selected for audit and I got no information. Are there guidelines in relation to selection for audit?  Do third party returns indicate that someone has a compliance problem?  Are particular sectors of business selected or is it a case of investigating a person who is now driving a better car than would seem affordable from their income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is the random audit.  Sometimes Revenue decide on a sector for a particular year and then move on to another sector.  If in their scanning of 30,000 cases they note that an area is out of line on the basis <Col N="1589" /> of the percentages and guidelines it is highlighted.  Unfortunately there are not sufficient officers to go around checking the size of cars and so on.</P>

      <Quest>in respect of the out-turn for 1993 and the projections for 1994, the total value of Government current expenditure in respect of each of these years; the increase in value in money and percentage terms from one year to the next; the relevant or estimated rate of inflation in respect of the periods; and in relation to the total tax receipts and, within that, income tax receipts for the out-turn for the fiscal year 1993 and the estimates for such receipts for 1994, the amount that each of these receipts will have increased in money and percentage terms over the previous year.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking current expenditure as the total of Central Fund Services plus the Revised Estimates Volume provision for Net Non-Capital Supply Services, the outturn for 1993 was £10,501 million and the provision for 1994 is £11,159 million &mdash; an increase of £658 million, or 6.3 per cent.  That calculation, however, includes current supply services allocations of £192 million which are specifically related to the tax amnesty.  If these allocations are excluded, the 1994 provision falls to £10,967 million &mdash; a year-on-year increase of £466 million, or 4.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The rate of increase in the consumer price index in 1993 was 1.5 per cent.  My Department's projection of the CPI for 1994 remains at 2.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing for the increased tax revenues directly associated with the £85 million <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; related adjustment in public service pay&mdash;which was established subsequent to the budget &mdash; total Exchequer tax revenues in 1994, including the £230 million amnesty provision in the budget estimate, are projected to increase by £735 million or 7.6 per cent.  Excluding the amnesty proceeds, overall taxes are <Col N="1590" /> projected to increase by £517 million or 5.3 per cent, of which income tax accounts for £85 million &mdash; a year-on-year increase of 2.3 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister tried to freeze the figure of the Central Fund account, that the reduction in debt servicing costs is beneficial and that he would like to exclude the amnesty tax take but is he aware that it is accepted by macro economists that since 1990 spending in real terms has increased by one-quarter? In that context does he believe that this Government will be able to achieve the ESRI forecasts of boom and that if we are to enjoy its fruits we must get public expenditure down from 50 per cent of GNP to 35 per cent of GNP and reduce direct taxes on income from 23 per cent to 15 per cent of GNP.  If we are to enjoy the prosperity of which the Minister speaks does he intend to follow it through by changing his policy on the growth of public spending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates knows that the ESRI also allows for modest growth in services.</P>
      <P>Practically all the increase in public service spending in 1994 relates to pay and social services and £451 million of the net spending of £557 million will be spent in this area.  That is where the difficulty arises.  In most countries of the Community with the recession and zero or minus growth in the economy during a three year period, the cost of social services, and in our case, the cost of social welfare&mdash;I define social services as social welfare, education and health &mdash; has increased.  In one year an additional 30,000 joined the dole queues and money must be provided for them.  The shortfall in the finance of the health services caused a great deal of rancour in the House and we provided additional resources for them.  The other Departments have contained their spending. Any increase in public expenditure is of concern to the Minister for Finance and I am doing all I can about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe we can totally commit ourselves to following tight fiscal policies <Col N="1591" /> regardless of what is happening in Europe.  We certainly will keep finances as tight as we can.  If the Deputy looks at the statistics for the 1994 projected EBR and the budget deficit across the Community, he will see that we are second lowest after Luxembourg.  Our projected figure of 2.8 per cent compares favourably with the figures for most other countries, in Portugal it is 6.5 per cent; in the United Kingdom it is 6.3; and the European Union average is 5.7.  We do not want to become a one item agenda Government with controls on public expenditure squeezing the life out of the services.  We need to watch public expenditure and we have kept a far tighter rein on public expenditure than our partners.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if pay increases under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> were lower but they are less than in most other European countries.  The projected rate of inflation for this year is 2.5 per cent and next year the increases in pay will be far lower.  Pay levels and numbers in the public service have to be kept under control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates will agree that he and I are probably the only people who believe in this.  During the two day debate on the Finance Bill demands were made for an increase of £970 million in public expenditure and there was not a suggestion from anyone, including the Deputy, as to where we might cut back even though I continued to invite Members to make suggestions.</P>

      <Quest>in respect of withholding tax, if he will list all of the accountable persons, that is Government Departments, local authorities and other such persons who will be obliged to collect withholding tax after the passage of the 1994 Finance Bill; the professions or services liable to pay such tax; the annual cash flow benefit to the State of the existence of this tax; the year of payment of tax, whether current or preceding, in respect of self-assessment; the necessity for tax clearance certificates in respect of dealing with State agencies; and the changes, if any, that have been made to the relevant tax legislation since withholding tax was first introduced.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1987 specified those bodies which were to be treated as &ldquo;accountable persons&rdquo;.  The list of accountable persons was updated in 1988 to include certain other bodies including the VHI and &ldquo;other authorised insurers&rdquo; and in 1992 further additions were made.  The current list of accountable persons is set out in the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1992, this list is now being updated as specified in section 10 of this year's Finance Bill.  The total number of accountable bodies is in excess of 600 and, therefore, it is not feasible for me to name each one at this stage.  I have arranged with the Revenue Commissioners to supply the Deputy with the current list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The professions and services liable to the tax are covered by the definition in section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1987. They include: services of a medical, dental, pharmaceutical, optical, aural or veterinary nature; services of an architectural, engineering, quantity surveying or surveying nature, and related services; services of accountancy, auditing or finance and services of financial, economic, marketing, advertising or other consultancies; <Col N="1593" /> services of a solicitor or barrister and other legal services; geological services, and training services provided on behalf of FAS.</P>
    <P>As well as those specifically included in the definition, the term &ldquo;professional services&rdquo; is intended to embrace professional services in the generally accepted sense of that expression.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer yield from the tax in 1993 was £69.3 million.  This is a net figure after allowing for direct and interim refunds.</P>
    <P>Withholding tax at the rate of 27 per cent is deducted by the accountable person at the time the payment is made. In the case of self-employed individuals this tax is then available for credit or offset against the taxpayer's final liability in the following year.</P>
    <P>The legislation introducing withholding tax was enacted in 1987.  The following changes have been made since then:</P>
    <P>In 1988 the withholding tax system was extended to cover payments made by medical insurers in respect of certain medical expenses payable under a contract of insurance.  Eolas, the Nuclear Energy Board, CERT and a voluntary public or joint board hospital in receipt of grant aid from the Department of Health were added to the list of accountable persons.  The legislation was also amended to take account of the takeover by FÁS of all the functions of AnCO.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the legislation was amended as a result of the changeover to the current year basis of taxation for self-employed persons.  Prior to 1990 such persons paid tax on the basis of their earnings in the previous year.  Withholding tax deducted was held on account to be set against the actual tax liabilities which came due the following year.  When the self-employed moved to a current year basis in 1990, the Government decided that there would be no change in the withholding tax &mdash; the credit continued to be available in the following year.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the legislation was amended to include semi-State bodies and their subsidiaries in the list of accountable persons.</P>
    <P>Persons who are awarded public sector <Col N="1594" /> contracts or apply for State grants in excess of £5,000 are obliged to present a current tax clearance certificate to the contracting or grant paying authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister also get letters from doctors in the GMS scheme who have cashflow difficulties because they have spent a great deal of money developing their surgeries?  I note that the Minister introduced alleviating measures in last year's Finance Act and this year's Finance Bill for residential property and probate taxes.  Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied it is a hardship case will he consider amending the Finance Bill to try to ensure that there is a modicum of understanding for those whose net tax liability would not warrant withholding tax being deducted at source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992 the IMO and others raised this issue with me on behalf of doctors.  We have tried to reach an understanding with them and others who are affected by this problem.  Withholding tax is deductible from gross payments made by an accountable person from any expense payment even if these are invoiced separately.  As the Deputy mentioned, there is no allowance for expenditure incurred by the professional person in providing the service.  This is a major issue for doctors, solicitors and others who claim that these expenses account for a large proportion of their turnover.</P>
      <P>To lessen the impact we have made provision for the payment of an interim refund where the amount of withholding tax deducted exceeds the tax liability in the previous accounting period.  This is an important point and should not be overlooked.  It appears from letters I have received that some people are not aware of this.  In calculating the interim refund the Revenue Commissioners retain an amount equal to the liability and repay the excess.  Tax retained for credit later against tax liability is determined by reference to taxable income and not gross amounts to taxable payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the position was not as bad when self-employed persons <Col N="1595" /> paid tax on a previous year basis.  They now pay on a current year basis and that appears to create a difficulty.  Before I make any legislative changes I would like to see how this system operates because, as Deputy Yates acknowledged, a large sum of money is involved.  If we could resolve any difficulties under the interim refund scheme we would not have to make any changes.  If this does not work I will address the matter.  I accept that this deduction of 27 per cent from income can give rise to a cashflow problem.</P>
    <P>To respond to the Deputy's second point, the turnaround in payments for doctors is a matter of days.  This issue is dealt with in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Quest>the number of PAYE taxpayers and self-employed with incomes in excess of £25,000 for the latest year for which figures are available; if his attention has been drawn to the speech made by an Assistant Secretary of the Revenue Commissioners to the Foundation for Fiscal Studies on 5 November 1993 in which he stated that certain persons earning up to £150,000 per year can use a range of reliefs and incentives to avoid paying any tax whatsoever; his views on whether this is equitable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that some 44,000 self-employed taxpayers, including proprietary directors, will have gross incomes in excess of £25,000 in the 1993-1994 income tax year, representing over 20 per cent of the total of such taxpayers. The estimated number of PAYE taxpayers, excluding proprietary directors, at the same income levels is 107,000, or 11 per cent of the total of such PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example quoted by the Deputy about persons earning up to £150,000 per year was described in the paper presented at the Foundation for Fiscal Studies as an exceptional situation involving a taxpayer <Col N="1596" /> disposing of all of his-her income in tax-relievable investments.  In the Revenue's experience there are, very few cases in this income range where the interaction of tax reliefs and incentives lead to the payment of relatively low taxes.</P>
    <P>The thrust of tax reform policy in recent years has been to broaden the tax base by the curtailment of allowances and reliefs so as to make possible improvements in mainstream income tax.  This policy has been remarkably successful. The rates of tax now range from 27 per cent to 48 per cent by comparision with 35 per cent to 58 per cent in 1987; the standard band has been widened by 74 per cent over this period and there have been significant improvements for those on lower incomes.  However, a number of tightly focused reliefs remain in the tax system.  The conditions which attach to these ensure that the beneficiaries must fulfil rigorous conditions in order to avail of the reliefs.  Individuals are fully entitled to avail of reliefs to the extent that they fulfil the necessary conditions.</P>
    <P>Any large scale take up of tax reliefs or incentives for investment is constrained by the fact that, despite the tax savings, such investments do not guarantee the security of the capital.  Tax relief under the BES requires that the investments be held for at least five years before being disposed of.  In the case of some of the reliefs for the designated areas, the investments must be held for either ten or 13 years to prevent a clawback of the relief.</P>
    <P>Decisions by individuals to invest in designated areas, BES type schemes or in their own businesses within the terms of the appropriate legislation are simply helping to fulfil the economic objectives of the legislation giving rise to the incentives, many of which are directly related to employment creation or employment support.</P>
    <P>The paper presented at the Foundation for Fiscal Studies made it clear that the Revenue Commissioners carefully monitor any abuse or manipulation of tax reliefs and incentives for the purpose of tax avoidance rather than for the bona <Col N="1597" /> fide purposes for which they were intended, that is, economic development, including especially job creation and support.  Moreover, the paper pointed out the inroads being made by Revenue audit and compliance programmes in recent years into the black economy and tax evasion.  Increased resources are now being devoted by the Revenue Commissioners to this whole area and they have considerable enforcement powers which can be used to good effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not odd that there are only 44,000 persons in the self-employed category who earn £25,000 or more?  One would have thought from the reaction to the recent changes in residential property tax that the figure was a great deal higher.  Is it not unusual, having regard to the fact that this category emcompasses the entire range of professions, including lawyers and accountants, that they are so poorly paid?</P>

      <P>In the presentation of the Finance Bill, the Minister claimed with some accuracy that he has been shutting off shelters used to conceal income. Is it not the case that many of these shelters still exist, that the paper to which I referred was delivered at the Foundation for Fiscal Studies by the Assistant Secretary of the Revenue Commissioners and that he was not saying that the example I quoted is exceptional?  If I recall correctly, he said that the Revenue Commissioners are engaged in a constant battle of wits with the high earners in the self-employed category to ensure income is not concealed.  Is the Minister aware that Mr. Moriarty explained in a table <Col N="1598" /> how somebody earning £150,000 could contrive to pay no tax?  He suggested that a person could devote £2,000 to a covenant, £100,000 to designated areas relief, £6,000 to a business expansion scheme, £20,000 to a retirement annuity, £2,000 to a personal allowance, £10,000 to interest paid on an investment in a company and £10,000 to interest paid on an investment in a holiday home leaving no tax liability.</P>

      <P>If such an individual exists I am not sure what he is living on, because if he invests it all, there is no immediate return.  If he invests in the BES and the designated areas scheme he will have to wait for the return.  Deputy Rabbitte's question relates to the issue of people playing the system.  We spoke earlier about the measures being taken to pursue tax evaders.  It is more difficult to tackle tax avoidance.  A few weeks ago there were invitations on my desk to launch books, and there have been numerous conferences since, to explain how to interact them.  In recent years we have been closing off such opportunities without waiting for the next Finance Bill. We are closing off another loophole in <Col N="1599" /> this Bill relating to the &ldquo;balloon lease&rdquo;, an extraordinary one which I look forward to explaining on Committee stage, but frightfully expensive and cleverly constructed during the course of the past year.  Then there is the interaction of the Temple Bar designated status with designated status generally and crossing that with what was the ten year scheme of capital allowances for hotels which is now a seven year scheme.  If the three are crossed one gets an extraordinary result. We are closing that off this year.  It certainly taxes the minds of the officials of both the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to try to keep up with these.</P>

      <P>Not to be negative, I suppose it is better that people are playing with their money here rather than taking it elsewhere; we have to try to keep ahead of them.  We have abolished many reliefs and any that were closed off two years ago have not been opened up again.  The reliefs are for the 106 or so small businesses and various business reliefs which are important.  The only reliefs left are those for the horse breeding industry, the covenants for education and three or four others.  Members seem to think that such reliefs do not cost anything. For every £1 million spent on tax reliefs it costs the taxpayer £480,000 which the Minister for Finance is prevented from using to bring down mainstream tax.  The fewer reliefs there are the more we can put back into reducing mainstream tax by widening the tax bands, etc.  Reliefs should only be allowed to remain if they have economic and job creation potential.  If they do not meet those criteria they should be abolished.</P>

      <P>In the past two years there have been cases where people left Ireland and we failed to get the capital gains tax.  The CAT on those going out is not a major issue because under the law the dual abode scheme which has been abolished in other countries still operates here.  I propose to move in the direction that other countries have taken because at present an Irish person who leaves must stay in a hotel if he or she returns.  There is no legislation governing this but on the basis of case law Irish nationals working abroad are treated in an inferior way to Irish people working at home.  They therefore arrange to be paid through an Isle of Man account and this creates a ducks and drakes syndrome which is unnecessary.  If we can attract Irish people or non-nationals who are not domiciled abroad, and are more understanding of CAT things would be better. The present system is antiquated and drives people out, forces Irish people working abroad to save their money outside the country, and makes it difficult for people who wish to return to do so. Most of our successful businesses operate in this grey area.  That is undesirable.  I hope to have proposals on this ready for Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill has been long awaited, it is a great disappointment to me and to many people who are involved in and who have the interest of horseracing and its associated and downstream activities at heart.  The Bill purports to repeal the Racing Board Act, 1945 but, in effect, it re-enacts it giving many more powers to the racing board.  It makes that board, under its new title of the Irish Horseracing Authority, the totally dominant feature in the control and in the organisation of Irish horseracing. It is inappropriate that a sport such as this should be nationalised.  The degree of State and political control envisaged in the Bill will strangle, stultify <Col N="1660" /> and have a detrimental effect on this sport.</P>
      <P>I repudiate the Minister's description of the Racing Board as a success.  In recent years, particularly, its record has been abysmal.  In any country, running a State-owned monopoly totalisator is regarded as a licence to print money. In this country, on the other hand, the Racing Board succeeds in losing money on the tote, a considerable achievement. The latest accounts available are for the year ended 31 December 1992 and while separate figures are not given for the tote &mdash; the published accounts are very inadequate, presumably for the purpose of concealing reality &mdash; nonetheless it is possible to extrapolate the position from the figures published.  It is worth noting that although the accounts for the Racing Board for 1992 were finalised and signed by the directors on 23 April 1993, they were published only last week, approximately 12 months later.  We still do not have accounts for 1993, but the figures quoted by the Minister this morning indicate that the abysmal position shown in the 1992 accounts deteriorated even further in 1993.  This is further borne out by the fact that the Minister had to come to the Dáil last December for an emergency Vote of £1 million to fund some of the losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures shown in the Racing Board accounts for 1992 indicate a loss on the tote of £1,214,104, which has to be made up by Government grants funded by the taxpayer.  Why a body that is so exceptionally unsuccessful as this is retained in place and given further and more extensive powers of control mystifies me.  At least twice in his speech the Minister boasts about the State grant.  He stated, &ldquo;The State is making a major contribution to the financing of the racing industry and, as I have said earlier, it will continue to be a major contributor in the years to come&rdquo;.  The Minister seems to take pleasure from the fact that he doles out sums of money each year to the racing industry.  If this Bill is passed he will appoint 14 people to the Authority and he and his Department will be involved in all kinds of detailed matters relating <Col N="1661" /> to racing.  My fundamental disagreement with him and the Government on this Bill relates to the fact that we are having more and more State control and interference in the regulation of an industry whose members would be well able to regulate themselves, as they do in many other countries, if they were left alone by the Government.</P>
    <P>There would not be a need for Government grants to racing if a racing structure was set up that allowed the Authority to generate its own income.  Classic examples of this can be seen in Australia and Hong Kong where the prize money is enormous, but where racing authorities are entitled to a percentage of the off-course betting revenue, are allowed to act independently and plan for the future, confident that they have a guaranteed income which they can increase if they are successful in expanding the industry. I am sure all Members are aware of the extraordinary case in recent months of the six-year-old gelding that travelled 12,000 miles into a different hemisphere, a totally opposite season, remained there a few days and won the big race for which the prize money was equivalent to IR£900,000.  The quality of the racing and the horses in Australia must not be outstanding if an Irish six-year-old gelding can win against all the odds in such circumstances.  Nonetheless, the racing industry there is enormous.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I attended a race meeting in Sha Tin in Hong Kong.  My hosts apologised for the fact that it was such a small meeting and said I must not find it as exciting as I should.  They explained that because a big meeting was scheduled to take place in two or three days' time, the card was not very interesting and the crowd was small.  A total of 50,000 people attended that meeting.  The stand is 200 feet high and four furlongs long, and it was almost full, but the card was very dull.  Every race was a handicap.  Because of the poor quality of horses as a result of the climate they have no option, for betting purposes, but to run most races as handicaps.  Yet they can generate enormous interest and give out huge prize money because they are allowed control <Col N="1662" /> and run meetings for the benefit of the racing industry.  In contrast, the Minister wants the industry here to come to him, cap in hand, every year, begging for funds from the taxpayer who should not be liable to fund the industry, which is well capable of being self-supporting if it were left alone and the dead hand of the bureaucratic State removed from it.</P>
    <P>Other than the reference to on-course levies, there is no reference in the Bill to revenue for the Authority.  If the Authority is established in that form, racing will be dependent on the annual whim of the Minister.  If, in the future, we have a Minister who is antagonistic towards racing or we have a Labour Minister, what will happen?</P>
    <P>The anxiety of the Minister to be the dominant factor and to interfere in every way possible is not confined to financial considerations, although his exercise of financial power gives him great control. In case he was not satisfied with that, he goes on to spell out in the Schedule to the Bill how he will appoint the majority of the members of the Authority.  He goes through the charade of suggesting they will be nominated by particular organisations, but that will not be the case.  The organisations will have to send him a list of three nominees from which in each case he will pick one and we can be sure the person selected in each case will be the most politically acceptable.  It is a matter of great regret that something as important as the racing industry should be subjected to this kind of political payola.</P>
    <P>It is already known in the industry that certain types of power brokers who hover on the periphery are boasting that they will be appointed to the Authority.  Even after the appointment of the members of the Authority paragraphs 4 and 12 of the Schedule give the Minister the right to fire any of them at any time without reason.  It is monstrous that the Minister should be empowered to dismiss without notice or reason the senior steward of the Turf Club or any other steward appointed.  The manner in which the Turf Club has been treated under the Bill is not good enough.  The obvious problems <Col N="1663" /> in Irish racing and the decline in betting and revenue are not the fault of the Turf Club.  Whatever its perceived shortcomings no one can dispute that it has run Irish racing for more than 200 years with honesty and integrity.  Now that it is pushed aside &mdash; irrespective of what the Minister may say &mdash; Irish racing and the respect which exists for it abroad must decline.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making a belated attempt to undo some of the wrongs and retract some of the insults he has inflicted on the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee by way of his proposed amendments.  However, minimum amendments will not cure the inherent and basic defects in the Bill. It is objectionable that the Turf Club's activities should be confined to what happens at a particular race meeting on a particular day.  Under the terms of the Bill, it appears that trainers and jockeys in future will be licensed not by the Turf Club but by the Authority.  That arises not because the Bill says so specifically but because it says that any power not given to the Turf Club or to the regulatory bodies will be exercised by the Authority.  It is deplorable that people should be licensed in future and that many aspects of racing should be regulated by those whose primary interest, unfortunately in some cases, will be party political.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 44 that the Turf Club could not make or amend any rules of racing without consulting the Authority is indicative of the Minister's approach.  The fact that he is now prepared to change this is, in some respects, only a detail.  Unfortunately, his underlying hostility to the regulatory bodies is indicated by that provision and others of that kind.</P>
    <P>We are now proposing to extend the powers of an existing semi-State body and to virtually take over the powers of a private regulatory association which has existed successfully, with some honour and dignity, for over 200 years.  That form of nationalisation is particulary questionable. In principle, I am against most <Col N="1664" /> forms of nationalisation and would resort to them only in an emergency.  The manner in which this measure is being implemented at a time when there is deregulation everywhere in the world, is especially regrettable.  We should recall the position in respect of the State's involvement in sport and in industry of this type.  In 1958 the greyhound racing industry was partly nationalised through Bord na gCon.  The original intention was that the tracks would remain in private ownership, but that did not happen and they are virtually all owned by the board. Bord na gCon has run greyhound racing for 36 years, but it has not been successful. It is regrettable, but a fact of life, that greyhound racing is in a weaker position today than at any time during those 36 years or before the establishment of the board.  This Bill proposes the creation of a macro Bord na gCon in respect of an industry which is more important than greyhound racing, ten to 15 times larger and has major international ramifications while the greyhound racing industry has limited overseas activities.  We should consider if this proposal is wiser and the proper way to proceed.  The position in Britain has improved in recent years although there are major difficulties there.  The British Government does not want to become involved, but it seems our Government cannot have enough involvement.  There is a huge difference in the attitude and approach of both Governments to the industry and in the most successful countries, even though they do not have the natural resources we enjoy in countries, such as Hong Kong which hardly has enough space for a racecourse, and Australia, where although the climate is not favourable, the industry is hugely successful.</P>
    <P>Having read the Bill and listened to the Minister there are two sections about which I am not clear and he should clarify them further in his reply.  I question the need for the section that deals with the proposal to give the Authority, acting through a wholly owned subsidiary, a bookmaking licence to enable it to engage in bookmaking.  What is the point <Col N="1665" /> of that?  There is no shortage of bookmakers who are reasonably innovative and can cater for most tastes and pockets. Why should the State become involved in bookmaking?</P>
    <P>Another section states that the Authority or a subsidiary can be given a new totalisator licence under the 1929 Act and seems to suggest that the licence can be used in places other than racecourses. The Minister explained if the licence was used in other places the Authority would be relieved of its obligation to provide accommodation for bookmakers which exists under the 1929 Act.  That suggests totalisator offices or shops will be located away from the racecourses, but it is not clear from the section.  Such a proposal would be welcome because the strength of the industry in Australia derives from the number of outlets usually in post offices, on that continent.  It has the advantage of three time zones and racing takes place over a long period each day. It is possible to place a bet in any town or village in Australia through a computer system and I do not see why such a system could not be provided here as it would be an admirable one.  The Minister seems reticent about spelling out the position. A totalisator system will have to be provided and I do not see why the Authority should become involved in bookmaking. However, it would be advantageous if it opened totalisator shops, outlets or terminals.  The tote in England has been successful in that regard.  The Minister should stand back, establish a group to deal with this and leave it alone.  They should be given the powers and not restricted as they are under section 27 and obliged to come to him every year cap in hand.  They should be given an entitlement to a percentage of off-course revenue such as 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent.  They would know their position, responsibility should rest with them and they should be allowed get on with the job.  If they can increase the revenue by encouraging more off-course betting on Irish racing &mdash; on which there is not much &mdash; it would be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>The figures the Minister quoted this morning in respect of on-course betting <Col N="1666" /> are frightening.  Bookmaker betting is declining at the rate of £10 million a year, a startling trend.  If this continues we will have to pack up altogether.  The overall amount spent on gambling is increasing all the time.  One has only to look at the national lottery to realise that is so.  That lottery has an effect on racing, which is a great pity.  It should be spelled out in the Bill that racing should have a definite percentage share of revenue.  Its percentage in respect of on course levies is spelled out in the Bill.  Equally why is its percentage in respect of off course revenue not spelled out?</P>
    <P>From listening to the Minister's speech I get the impression that he welcomes, as do many Ministers, the fact that a decision must be made every year as to whether £5 million, £6 million or £7 million will be provided in this area.  They believe they should receive a medal if they provide a greater sum than that allocated by the previous Minister.  This Minister is mature enough to realise that such an approach is wrong.  The way to approach this matter is to set a fixed percentage of identifiable revenue from off course racing.  This should extend not only to revenue from betting on racing but to revenue from betting generally. The position may have been complicated by the national lottery, and it is very unfair to charitable lotteries, but we can do nothing about that.  Some percentage &mdash; 2.5 per cent seems reasonable &mdash; should be set down and thereafter the matter left up to the industry.</P>
    <P>A great many things can be done with racecourses.  A different approach should be taken to their utilisation.  One change that was needed is the small change in the Bill about liquor licensing, but there are many more things that can be done and they should be included in the Bill. There should be a general attitude of giving freedom to whatever new Authority is set up.  In particular we should not downgrade and grind into the ground the regulatory Authority that has existed since the middle of the 18th century and which did Irish racing proud.  While sometimes people may complain it was a stick in the mud, it could never be <Col N="1667" /> described as dishonest or dishonourable. The function to sell racing in recent years was very much more a function of the Racing Board than of the Turf Club.  It is wrong to seek to do away with a body that has stood us well and to introduce through the Bill an element into the control of racing, a nod and wink activity, that we have too much of in Ireland. Racing was able to stay above that approach when other activities could not do so and that position should remain.</P>
    <P>If the Bill passes Second Stage, the Minister should consider this matter before Committee Stage.  Minor amendments of the kind he mentioned this morning, while welcome, do not go to the root of the problem.  A more fundamental rethink is necessary.  While the Minister said that consultation took place, with three committees being set up, the only effective consultation was with the Turf Club and the Racecourse Owners' Association.  A person such as Lord Killanin who has dealt with this matter in great detail and knows this area so well should be brought in and asked to change the thrust, not the detail, of the Bill so that we get it right.  In his letter which I quoted earlier he said this is a great natural industry of Ireland.  We always complain that we import foreign investment and foreign technology, but this is an industry that has existed since time immemorial, in which we have all the natural advantages, and we should not throw it away.  We should get matters right, even if it takes another three or four months.  Unhappily, the Bill before us does not get it right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seven years since publication of the report of the Commission on Enquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Breeding Industry, which was chaired by Lord Killanin.  This Bill has been a long time in gestation.  It took Lord Killanin four years to reach a conclusion on his report and therefore the preamble to this Bill has taken approximately 11 years.  For that reason it is surprising the Bill has the hallmarks of a rushed job.  The Minister mentioned a <Col N="1668" /> couple of amendments he will be bringing forward.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to refer to is the question of securing the financial basis for Irish horseracing.  There was no proper consultation with interests other than those already firmly entrenched in the industry, and that is of concern.  The most disappointing feature of the Bill is that it lacks an understanding of how to develop a market-led industry that is able to thrive in an era of multiple choice entertainment and sport.  The competition is getting very tough and the changing tastes of the populace generally are not to be under-estimated.</P>
      <P>A new racing board Authority is being established under the Bill and I have no problem with that.  It will have representatives of the Turf Club, the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, racecourse owners, horse breeders, trainers, bookmakers, employees and, last but not least, the four ministerial or political appointees.  That is a laudable proposal but it is also very revealing about the thinking of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The obvious omission from the Bill is the key player without whom horseracing would not exist, the racegoer, the punter, the consumer, the customer. Why is that element of the equation excluded formally from the Bill?  I know the Minister made commitments in this area, but there is no mention in the Bill of this key player.</P>
      <P>We talk about being modern in our approach to developing opportunities in Ireland.  We are exhorted to become self-reliant and market-led &mdash; that is the magic word used by everybody nowadays. If we are to become self-reliant and market-led we will have to know something about the market.  We need to know what the consumer wants, but we will never know that unless we give a central position to the consumer.  There is an organisation made up of consumers who could easily put forward a representative for this new Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister produced a Bill that is the product of the old-fashioned mindset when he should have presented a new <Col N="1669" /> initiative that matches the demands of today's world.  If this is the thinking on the horseracing Bill, I dread to think what the Bill to establish An Bord Bia will be like.  Will the consumer be sidelined in that case also?  Is a Department that is so dominated by the interests of producers capable of taking the new direction needed?</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new racing Authority is welcome.  I do not share the concerns of other speakers about the Minister nationalising the industry, but for Irish horseracing to maximise potential the industry must be placed on a sound financial footing.  It should reflect to a greater extent the attitudes and interests of the consumers.  There is no doubt Irish racing is the weaker branch of the bloodstock industry and racecourse facilities must be rationalised and upgraded.  Prize money allocations must be increased for middle quality races.</P>
    <P>To consider horseracing as we would any industrial sector means posing the basic question, how do we organise ourselves in such a way as to sustain top class internationally competitive performance in an area of such good potential? Nobody doubts that that potential exists but we must modernise and rationalise. The Turf Club and the INHS have run racing for more than 200 years in Ireland. Nobody doubts their integrity and honesty but the approach is antiquated.</P>
    <P>The example that speaks for itself is the fact that it is only in the past few years that the Turf Club published its accounts.  Nobody questions its honesty and integrity but questions must be asked about its success, particularly when it enjoyed a virtual monopoly in this area. Sentiment has no place in a modern industry that is of such enormous importance to us.  That is not in any way to denigrate the role, the honesty or the integrity of the Turf Club but we must be realistic and look forward.</P>
    <P>The Irish thoroughbred industry is a substantial indigenous enterprise.  It employs many thousands of people directly and many more thousands in part-time and indirect supplier businesses. Many of these jobs are in remote <Col N="1670" /> areas where alternative enterprises are unlikely to be available.  It is an important industry and it must be managed in a competent and progressive manner.</P>
    <P>Both the racing and breeding sectors of the industry have experienced deteriorating fortunes in the years since the Killanin report and any progress made over the past 20 years will be jeopardised unless the slide is reversed.  What we are talking about is how to move forward. There is a great tradition here of following horseracing and we have more racecourses per head than Britain but the problem is that there are not enough followers of the racing game to go around all the racecourses.  Attendances have been falling and, meanwhile, the age profile attending meetings is going up.  Many of the small rural race tracks are in need of major development if they are ever to attract business again.</P>
    <P>The horse industry has tremendous potential for growth and there is a need for an Authority of the type proposed.  It has been sought for a long time and similar moves, with or without input from Government, have taken place in Britain and elsewhere.  I am concerned, however, about the role of the Minister regarding this Authority.  Much lip service is paid in the Bill to development and representation but the Minister will continue to have enormous discretion and the lack of independence of the Authority from the Minister may well prove to be its achilles heel.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill to the confidentiality of members of the Authority. It is important that the principle of confidentiality is applied sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, it will simply become a gag on members of the Authority.  Communication has been absent in many areas of the horseracing industry and it is time we opened up channels of communication rather than closing them down.</P>
    <P>I realise it has been hard to extract information from the Racing Board, for example.  If a member of the public, or indeed a member of a relevant organisation tried to determine from the Racing <Col N="1671" /> Board how it spent its money in detail, they often could not obtain an answer. Any details of breakdown of money spent, allocations for racecourses, etc., or the purpose for which money was spent was hard if not impossible to obtain.  That must change; that is not the way to encourage business, development or interest in the whole area of horseracing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to allow on-course betting offices but I wonder if that will happen.  A successful betting office was opened in Leopardstown but it was stymied.  I note the Minister will leave it to the Authority to deal with such matter but I wonder will this be allowed to happen or will it be prevented.</P>
    <P>The key question is how to place the racing industry on a better financial footing. Some of the income generated from off-course betting should be reinvested in the industry.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have such a system and it is unfortunate that there is no indication from the Government that it is considering this.  I presume the Department of Finance is holding the reins on this but that augurs poorly for an Authority such as is proposed and it should be challenged in order to set it on the right financial footing.  We all welcome extra money for the Racing Board &mdash; nobody would complain about that &mdash; but that is not the issue.  The issue is the way encouragement can be given to the Authority to develop and modernise the horse racing industry.  It must become more attractive, otherwise it will continue to shrink.</P>
    <P>I repeat the point made by other Deputies and by Lord Killanin in his recent letter.  It is significant that someone in his position who has spent so much time producing his report should write to a paper and make these statements.  I am not too long a Member but I cannot remember a similar situation where there was such an outright clash between an expert who held such a senior role in this area and the Minister.  He said that this Bill was &ldquo;hopelessly flawed&rdquo;.  That is a very serious comment.  He wonders how <Col N="1672" /> it is possible that in all its 42 pages there is not one mention of the off-track betting industry.  He said that without a marriage to the betting outlets in the main streets, racing in Ireland will continue its downward trajectory.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister wants to encourage the racing industry in Ireland to continue its downward trajectory but will he ensure in this Bill that matters will improve or is he simply working on a cosmetic level?  That fear is certainly being expressed about this Bill.  The amount of money from betting that goes to the Exchequer is ten times what is given in grants to the Racing Board.  It is a lucrative business and in the past five years the percentage of off-course betting has increased by approximately 40 per cent, while on-course betting has decreased by approximately 28 per cent. That is the direction in which it is moving and it has serious implications for horse racing generally.</P>
    <P>Lord Killanin and the Commission on Taxation recommended that off-course betting duty should be reduced below the UK rate.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.  The last time there was a reduction, there was actually a greater revenue return to the Government but the key issue is not reducing the overall rate but that a percentage of off-course betting revenue should go towards boosting the resources of the racing authorities.  Racecourses should receive a portion of the on-course betting turnover.  This all acts as an incentive to improve performance and betting turnover and to create facilities in tune with the market and what the customer wants.</P>
    <P>The question of promoting racing as a tourist attraction has been raised in a number of reports.  I understand the role of the board is included in the whole question of promotion.  For example thousands of Irish punters attend Cheltenham every year and, according to media reports, they provide the entertainment, the atmosphere and the craic. It is time for us to return the compliment and organise a similar event to Cheltenham <Col N="1673" /> to specifically attract British punters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no harm in attracting more punters.  I am talking about literally returning the compliment to Cheltenham.  It would be a good way of encouraging the overseas movement and we all know that racegoers will do anything to get to a meeting when they are really hooked on the sport.</P>
      <P>Just as we are prepared to attend meetings overseas we should organise an event which would draw the international community here.  In order to know the product we need to listen to the punter.  The Bill does not do that and it is flawed in that respect.  It demonstrates a thinking that the consumer will not be central to any development, be it the horse or food industry.  If we do not initiate a change, the industry will be run for the benefit of the producer to the detriment of the consumer.  Breeders, owners, trainers, bookmakers and employees will have members of the authority from their representative bodies but the punter will not. I hope the Minister will accept amendments to change that.</P>
      <P>The Minister is on record as saying that he will appoint a person to represent the interests of racegoers and punters from his four discretionary nominees who &ldquo;shall be chosen by the Minister after consultation with such persons as he sees appropriate who are engaged in horseracing or the promotion or development of the horseracing industry....&rdquo;  We all know what that means.  It would be more sensible if the Minister had one representative of consumers.  It would not shift the balance within the authority.  We saw what one memeber of the expert body looking at the food industry was able to do when Mr. Fergal Quinn produced his minority report and set the debate on a realistic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which is not directly related to the Bill but about which I am concerned is the training of young people in the horse industry.  A number of bodies <Col N="1674" /> now offer courses in equine studies.  We all know about the centre for equine studies at Limerick University but there are other courses available.  There are no proper training guidelines.  Many courses are run by the vocational education committees in conjunction with private stables. The courses are structured so that students may spend one and a half to two days each week on study in the relevant college and the rest of the time is spent at the riding school.  A certain amount of work is undertaken by trainees in return for the cost of such time as they spend in training or instruction.  The amount of time spent labouring must be proportionate to the value or cost of training or instruction and be appropriate to the capability of the young people involved.</P>
    <P>Many schools are responsible and I have no quibble with them but some are not and exact more labour from their trainees than is justified.  In one case an additional 35 to 40 hours per week labouring is demanded.  This is worth far more than the £650 for the whole year's course.  I am concerned at the physical effect on the young trainees and the extent of their exploitation.  I could not find any Department or agency responsible for regulating this aspect of the industry.  The trainees are not workers and do not have EU directives and legislation to protect them.  They are not students because of the work they do. The European Union do not appear to have any regulations or legislation relating to the matter.  This loophole needs to be closed.  The Department of Education do not see that have a direct role to play. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has a responsibility to ensure that an industry which historically has such a poor record in industrial relations improves its standards and protects young trainees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>With no disrespect to the <Col N="1675" /> Minister of State I am disappointed that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is not present. He took the debate in the Seanad last night and I realise he may have other pressures but I would have preferred him to hear what I have to say on the matter.</P>
      <P>The slaughter of the Bosnian Muslims goes on relentlessly.  The horrific bombardment of the town of Gorazde with the resultant hundreds of deaths and injuries and the complete destruction of almost all the infrastructure is further proof that the Bosnian Serbs are thumbing their noses at the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The horror of it all is that the Serbs continue to go through the charade of diplomatic talks while continuing their obscene warlike activities.  When will the international community say loudly and clearly to the Serbs that they must stop this war or they will not continue to talk? Both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have rightly said they will not sit down at a negotiating table with members of Sinn Féin as long as they do not declare a complete withdrawal of support for the violence of the IRA.  The IRA will not be part of any negotiations until they have a complete cessation of violence. Yet at international level we seem to find it possible for people to sit down, in our name, and talk with the Serbs who, behind our backs, keep killing and destroying thousands of lives and property.</P>
      <P>For the last three years the world has watched a slow motion genocide take place in the territory of former Yugoslavia. This is a country where many Irish people enjoyed summer holidays.  Some people returned two or three times to enjoy Yugoslavia.  As the people watch what is unfolding in Gorazde they will say they do not want this done in their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world has said over and over again that it does not wish to see a replay of the horrors of the Second World War under Hitler.  We vowed this would never happen again.  Yet if we look at the statistics of what has happened in former Yugoslavia over the last three years, <Col N="1676" /> 500,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives and many thousands have been so injured that life will never hold any meaning for them.  Some 3.4 million people are refugees and 80 per cent of property and infrastructure &mdash; water, electricity and sewerage facilities &mdash; has been destroyed.  In the town of Gorazde people have been without water and electricity for close on two years and, almost as if it were a black comedy, these places are known as safe havens.  The world has witnessed in Tuzla, Mostar, Sarajevo and Srebrenica &mdash; the so-called safe havens &mdash; the same macabre battle and people being corralled into these safe havens where they become sitting targets for the Serbs.  We cannot allow this to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>The concept of safe havens was heralded by EU Ministers, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs took credit in replying to questions from me and other Deputies for suggesting the idea of safe havens.  He and other EU Ministers must now share culpability for these safe havens not being properly protected by the UN.  There is no point in passing resolutions at the UN to create safe havens and provide facilities for the safeguarding of UN troops and the people there, if such havens are not protected by the UN.  My blood ran cold when I heard General Rose, Commander of the UN in Bosnia, say that the UN is being used blatantly by the Serbs in this war.  That was after the general had been in the former Yugoslavia for only a short time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister immediately arrange further meetings of the EU Council of Ministers?  If possible the first meeting should be held tomorrow.  The tragedy of this conflict was brought home to us today by Dr. Mary McLaughlin's heartbreaking account of events in the former Yugoslavia. She said:</P>
    <P>By now, all of us are chronically frightened, and it breaks into acute anxiety several times each day.  The Serbs get especially violent frenzies each day between 4 and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>It is now 4.55 p.m. and one can only <Col N="1677" /> assume that the Serbs are attacking in the same frenzied way the bunker in which the Irish doctor is hiding.  We do not know when it will end unless the world tells the Serbs to stop this war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I welcome the opportunity to reply to this debate on the recent and ongoing tragic events in and around Gorazde.  I fully share the concerns expressed by Deputy Owen about these events.</P>
      <P>I know all Deputies share the Government's horror and revulsion at the situation in Gorazde.  As Deputy Owen said, it has been highlighted vividly by the reports from Dr. McLaughlin.  We commend her courage and that of Mr. O'Dwyer, the other Irish member of the UNHCR team in Gorazde.  Their reports have graphically exposed the recent outrages at Gorazde which have shocked the international community.</P>
      <P>The unrelenting assault by the Bosnian Serbs on this small town, where some 65,000 people have gathered for protection, is an affront to human dignity.  It has left more than 400 people dead and more than 1,000 seriously injured.  It is a further flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, examples of which we witnessed all too frequently in Bosnia for more than two years.</P>
      <P>Given that many thousands of displaced persons had taken refuge in Gorazde and five other mostly Muslim towns, these were designated as safe areas by the Security Council in May 1993.  Deputies will recall that this step was advocated by the Irish Government at that time. Clearly it did not prove possible to achieve all of the UN's objectives in the designated safe areas, due to the inflexible attitude of the Bosnian Serbs and their continuing military actions.  Events in Gorazde have highlighted this dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind, however, that Sarajevo is at last free from attack. While the situation at a number of other designated safe areas remains critical, the UN has, unlike in Gorazde, now been able to deploy in considerable strength <Col N="1678" /> in these towns.  This has been a major factor in enabling UNPROFOR to work towards achieving its objectives.</P>
    <P>In Gorazde the United Nations made repeated attempts to secure the agreement of the Bosnian Serbs to an effective ceasefire and to stop their advance into the enclave.  Undertakings to do so were repeatedly violated.  In light of the shelling of Gorazde, which jeopardised the lives of UN personnel there, as well as inflicting high casualities on the town's population, close air support was provided by NATO forces at the request of the Secretary-General on 10 and 11 April.  As Deputies are aware, the use of air-power at safe areas under the authority of the United Nations was provided for in Resolution 836 adopted by the Security Council in June 1993.</P>
    <P>In advance of the action by NATO forces, clear and unambiguous warnings were repeatedly given to the Bosnian Serbs to cease their onslaught.  Decisions to use force, including air-power, to achieve the very specific objectives of Security Council resolutions raise difficult and complex questions.  The Secretary-General's decision to authorise close air support in defence of UN personnel was taken after giving due weight to all the factors involved.  Bosnian Serb commanders who defied the appeals and warnings of the international community bear the responsibility for the action taken.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that the Bosnian Serbs have continued their actions against Gorazde, inflicting high casualties on its population and threatening the lives of UN personnel who, courageously, remained in the town.  Their actions also represent a substantial setback to the peace process, in which much progress had been made recently towards an overall settlement in former Yugoslavia.  The fighting between Bosnian Croats and Muslims in Central Bosnia &mdash; the major conflict area for more than nine months &mdash; has been brought to an end.  Both parties have agreed to establish a Croat-Muslim Federation in Bosnia.  A ceasefire in Croatia, was agreed last month and forces are withdrawing from the confrontation lines.</P>
    <P>The recent events at Gorazde have <Col N="1679" /> given rise to questions in some quarters as to whether the UN should continue to be engaged in Bosnia.  It is clear that the UN has not been able to achieve all of its objectives, but it would be the ultimate tragedy if, following events at Gorazde, despair should precipitate a withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force.  However difficult and frustrating the process may be, the presence of the UN in Bosnia is vital to create the climate for negotiations and to provide desperately needed aid, not least in Gorazde, whose inhabitants are threatened by an appalling humanitarian crisis.</P>
    <P>The EU has been frequently criticised for its inability to end the conflict in Bosnia.  However, it should be emphasised that the EU, which co-chairs the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, is fully engaged in the search for peace.  EU member states are contributing some 15,000 personnel to UNPROFOR.  A valuable contribution is also being made to a peaceful settlement by the 200 EU monitors in the EU monitor mission.  Some 65 per cent of the total cost of the humanitarian operation in former Yugoslavia has been provided by the EU and its member states.  The EU has also agreed in principle to administer the town of Mostar for a two year period.  This is a major contribution to the rapproachement between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims.</P>
    <P>In its policy on former Yugoslavia, the Government has pursued three essential aims: to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia on the basis of the European Union's peace plan; to prevent the spread of the conflict, and to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue its efforts to promote these essential objectives through its participation in the International Conference on former Yugoslavia, its participation in UNPROFOR and in the EU Monitor Mission. We are also providing help for the victims of the conflict and support the work of the International Tribunal which has been established to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes.  We will continue our <Col N="1680" /> support for the vigorous implementation of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>With our European Union partners the Government is fully engaged in the search for an overall settlement in Bosnia.  Our aim is a comprehensive and durable peace for that country and the region.  What has been achieved in recent weeks must not be lost.  A ceasefire at Gorazde is now essential.  This should be built on and extended throughout Bosnia.</P>
    <P>European Union Foreign Ministers, in Luxembourg on 18 April, demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the withdrawal of Bosnia Serbs from the vicinity of Gorazde, and the lifting of all obstructions which have been placed in UNPROFOR's path.  Ministers also called for an intensive and co-ordinated effort by the international community, involving the European Union, the United Nations, United States and Russia, to relaunch the negotiations on the basis of the European Union plan of action which has been accepted by all the parties.  President Yeltsin has proposed a Summit meeting between Russia, the United States and the European Union. Our Government has welcomed this initiative.</P>
    <P>All civilised people must be outraged at the recent and ongoing events at Gorazde but it is important to bear in mind that a lasting settlement cannot be imposed on Bosnia.  The Bosnian Serbs, in particular, must return to the negotiating table to arrive at a solution through negotiation.</P>
    <P>It should also be recalled that, while the Security Council has authorised the use of force in certain circumstances, the mandate for UNPROFOR in Bosnia is of an essentially humanitarian nature &mdash; to facilitate the distribution of aid and to promote a political settlement.</P>
    <P>A ceasefire at Gorazde was negotiated early on Tuesday morning.  This provided for the deployment of some 100 UNPROFOR troops to the left bank of the Drina river.  In addition, United Nations military observers are to be deployed throughout the town and a medical team given access to Gorazde.  It was hoped that these arrangements would facilitate <Col N="1681" /> the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance and the immediate evacuation of the wounded.  However, the Serb shelling against Gorazde continued yesterday, when a hospital was shelled and more than 40 people were killed, mocking the commitments undertaken by the Bosnian Serbs earlier that day.  It is utterly contemptible that the Bosnian Serbs should categorise the hospital as a military target.  No possible justification, no military logic, can be cited in support of the shelling of Gorazde yesterday.  The information available to us from the UNHCR suggests that the pattern of fire and the nature of the ordnance can have been dictated only by the objective of killing and maiming people in their homes.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it was not possible to deploy the UNPROFOR personnel yesterday.  An effective ceasefire and the immediate deployment of United Nations troops is essential in Gorazde and the Government is fully suppotive of the ongoing UN efforts to bring this about.</P>
    <P>If access for humanitarian aid deliveries and clearances for evacuation of the injured and innocent victims of this conflict can be agreed, Ireland will contribute to the UNHCR's effort to bring relief to the people of Gorazde.  International agencies are aware of the willingness to respond to requests for medical evacuations.  We will remain in close contact with them on the humanitarian situation and on the medical needs of the victims of the conflict.</P>
    <P>The latest information available to me is that, following contact between the United Nations and the Bosnian Serbs overnight, a convoy of UNPROFOR troops, with 41 medical personnel and a field hospital, left Sarajevo en route for Gorazde at 1.30 this morning. I understand that it is now half-way to Gorazde. It will need to overcome many obstacles at Bosnian Serb checkpoints before arriving in that town where, we understand, shelling has continued and, perhaps, intensified today.</P>
    <P>In our approach to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the Irish Government has always favoured dialogue and negotiation.  However, as we have seen <Col N="1682" /> in Sarajevo, the threat or use of force is sometimes necessary to achieve our humanitarian and political objectives.  In the case of Gorazde, the international communtiy cannot leave its besieged citizens defenceless.  We hope that the negotiations can be successful.  However, if they do not succeed, the most serious consideration will have to be given to the request from the United Nations Secretary-General to NATO to authorise air strikes, at the request of the United Nations against artillery, mortar positions or tanks in or around Gorazde and other safe areas which are determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets within those areas.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I mentioned Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. O'Dwyer.  I know members fully share the Government's preoccupations regarding the safety of these two Irish citizens who are trapped in Gorazde. Their small UNHCR team has been doing outstanding work in the most appalling conditions.  Deputies will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has directly requested the intervention of the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Karadzic, to guarantee safe passage for the evacuation of these aid workers from Gorazde.  The Tánaiste has also requested President Milosevic's intervention on this matter.  We are liaising closely with the UNHCR regarding the safety of our aid workers.  Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, is also working strenuously to this end.</P>
    <P>My latest information is that Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Dwyer are managing to exist in the most perilous and desperate conditions.  I earnestly hope that the effective ceasefire, which the United Nations is working strenuously to put in place, will permit UNHCR staff to reach Gorazde and those who wish to leave to do so in safety.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Members will agree that these two Irish citizens deserve our highest commendation and support for their efforts on behalf of the victims of war in Gorazde.</P>

      <P>While the general circumstances of this very sad case have been mentioned I want merely to fill in the details.</P>
      <P>This case involved a constituent of mine from north east Dublin who has been incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison for almost a fortnight now, having been handed down a sentence of three months' imprisonment at the District Court on foot of a committal order sought by a well known Henry Street store for a very small debt owed on a store card account. Those are the basic circumstances surrounding the case.</P>
      <P>Since first hearing of the case late this day week I have endeavoured in every way to bring the matter back to the district justice in question at various sittings of his District Court to have it resolved. The woman concerned has quite clearly indicated she would be prepared to make some arrangements with the store in question to discharge the debt.  So far I have been unsuccessful in my efforts. Obviously, I am aware that other avenues are open to me and indeed to her legal representatives, perhaps through the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I first attempted to raise the matter yesterday by way of a Private Notice Question which was ruled out of order and I do so again today in an effort to make some progress in this astonishing case.  The store in question is Arnotts of Henry Street.  It is astonishing that a company which &mdash; as part of its basic business &mdash; encourages customers to open <Col N="1684" /> store card accounts does not have in place some type of safety net whereby customers who get into difficulties are given the opportunity of a personal meeting with representatives of the store to make some arrangements to discharge their liabilities.  It is also astonishing that Arnotts would go to the extent of seeking a committal order for imprisonment and see that imprisonment effected at District Court level.  It was an outrageous, untenable course of action.  I accept the conventions which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle read out but, having sought legal opinion from different people in the Government parties, everybody still considers this was an astonishing sentence in view of the apparent circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is well versed in legal matters and was a distinguished teacher of law at one of the universities.  Is it not time we examined the whole matter of the education of the legal profession?  In regard to sentencing policy we appear to have two systems of justice; one for the poor and one for the wealthy.  I suggest that a representative of the poorer part of the community has suffered the kind of punishment which is often meted out to that section of the community whereas the wealthy can afford to seek legal assistance.</P>
    <P>In view of the recent controversy has the Minister given thought to examining the whole system of education of our split legal profession of barristers and solicitors?  Are the Judiciary totally aware of social and other conditions and in a position to evaluate cases in the area of civil debt?</P>

My constituent is locked up with other prisoners, many of whom are guilty of serious crimes.

      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns which motivated the Deputy in raising this matter on the Adjournment. Nobody may be committed to prison merely for non-payment of debt. In fact a person may be committed to prison only for failure to comply with a court order to make payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay.  Only those with the capacity to make payment may be committed.</P>
      <P>Given that a determination has been made by the court that this person has a lawful debt which she is refusing to pay though capable of doing so.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to intervene in the matter.</P>
      <P>While debtors occupy only a small fraction of prison spaces at any time the view is taken in some quarters that it is wrong in principle for such people to be sent to prison.  However, many debtors pay only when the prospect of detention looms. The question must be asked whether the absence of imprisonment as a final resort would mean that many more creditors, including those in less than affluent circumstances, would be simply left to carry their debts.</P>
      <P>My Department has, striven earnestly behind the scenes to resolve this matter to the satisfaction of both parties &mdash; debtor and creditor.  The Probation and Welfare Service has acted on the Minister's behalf in this regard.  Unfortunately it has not been possible to make any progress with the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that even if the Minister <Col N="1686" /> were to invoke her powers in law and, having conferred with the trial judge, were to order the release of the debtor, the debtor could still be recommitted to prison next week in the event that she continued to refuse to obey the court order that she pay the debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of the State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, for coming into the House to listen to the problem.  The matter I wish to draw to your attention concerns a severely handicapped epileptic boy who lives with his parents in Castleblayney.  He has attended St. Enda's school in Monaghan for the past nine years, travelling each day in the bus that takes children to another school in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>In the first week of 1993 his mother was informed by the bus driver that her son would no longer be accommodated in the above arrangement for his journey home.  She had not received notification from any other source regarding the change of transport.  The bus driver stated that the boy would be taken to school as usual but would not be taken home until 4 p.m.  This child finishes school at 2.45 p.m. On the first day of the new arrangement he arrived home at 5.10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was taken from his school in Monaghan to the bus station and remained there until the bus took him home at 4.20 p.m.  On one occasion the boy was taken two miles beyond his home before a new driver discovered the mistake. This service was discontinued and again his parents were not informed.  He was then put on a different bus to take him to Castleblayney.  First, he had to wait one and a half hours at Monaghan bus station and if his father had not been in Castleblayney to meet him he would have had to wait in a pub.  During his period at the bus stop he was unsupervised.  One can imagine his mother's trauma thinking of what could happen to this epileptic boy.  Due to all the chopping and changing the boy's health has been seriously affected.  He gets physically sick most <Col N="1687" /> mornings before school wondering how he will get home.  His doctor has confirmed this in writing.</P>
    <P>The boy is on medication for epilepsy. It is almost impossible to administer tablets to him because of his illness which, in turn, results in more problems. While it is serious for the child I fear for the sanity of his mother.  His father travels to Monaghan to collect him most days.</P>
    <P>I have asked questions of the Minister for Education and I had a reply in March to the effect that she hopes to have something sorted out soon.  I have been in constant contact with the Minister's office who put me in contact with the Office of the Minister of State.  So far we have not got a satisfactory reply.  I hope this young boy and his family can be given the relief they deserve.  We must cherish the children of the State equally.  This boy is seriously handicapped, his parents are doing their best to look after him and the least we can do is facilitate them in every way possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this matter. He has been in constant touch with the Department on it.  I have been actively engaged in seeking a solution which will meet the special needs of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pupil in question is 16 years of age and suffers from mild mental handicap, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  He has attended St. Enda's special school in Monaghan since 1984.  Until the current school year, he travelled to school each day on an ordinary bus service that brought children from Castleblayney to schools in Monaghan.  Following a general review of school transport arrangements prior to the current school year, it was decided by Bus Éireann to revise the bus service from Castleblayney to Monaghan.  This consequence of their <Col N="1688" /> revision was that the evening pick-up time for up to 60 other pupils was improved by 20 minutes.  However, as Seán was the only pupil from St. Enda's availing of the service, it was no longer considered feasible to provide him with a home set-down point.  His morning transport arrangements were not affected by this development.</P>
    <P>Under the revised afternoon arrangement, Seán was collected from school and brought to the bus depot in Monaghan where he travelled on the three o'clock scheduled service to Dublin.  The student would then be set down at the bus stop in Castleblayney, approximately three miles from his home, where his father would collect him.  In November 1993, this scheduled service was cancelled by Bus Éireann.  Seán is now brought to the Monaghan bus depot at three o'clock to wait for the 4.10 p.m. scheduled service to Dundalk which passes by his home.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the school transport needs of pupils with disabilities and I accept that Seán's present situation is unsatisfactory, both for him and for his parents who are very concerned for their son's welfare.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has been investigating a range of options which would alleviate this problem.  The Deputy will appreciate that this process could take some time to complete in view of the need to bear in mind the possible negative impact of new arrangements on the circumstances of other pupils.  Taking all factors into account, my Department considers that the most suitable solution would be to provide a taxi to collect Seán in the evening from the school bus set-down point in Castleshane and bring him home.  Appropriate arrangements in this regard are now being made.</P>
    <P>I know the Deputy who has made great efforts and all others concerned will be very happy with the satisfactory outcome of the case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 April 1994.</P>

      <P>As separate accounts are not kept in <Col N="1602" /> respect of sales of maps for CAP reform proposals it is not possible to give an exact figure for extra revenue in the Ordnance Survey.  However, it is estimated that additional revenue in the order of £3.5 million was received by the Ordnance Survey office.</P>
      <P>Receipts by way of Land Registry fees are not appropriated in aid of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds Vote but are remitted to the Exchequer as extra-Exchequer receipts.  The total fee receipts in 1993 were £12.708 million and the total estimated receipts for 1994 are £12.6 million.  No breakdown of the Land Registry fees, distinguishing between receipts for the different items of service provided, appears in the Estimates or in the Finance Accounts.  The Land Registry cannot with any certainty identify which applications to it are seeking copy file plan maps for purposes of area-aid applications or which are for other purposes. The best estimate is that 30,000 applications in 1993 were in respect of maps for the area-aid applications and 30,000 to 35,000 of 1994 applications will be to obtain maps to accompany such applications.  On the basis of the foregoing estimated figures, the estimated fee receipts would be £270,000 in 1993 and £325,000 in 1994.</P>

      <P>In this year's Finance Bill I am introducing a new urban renewal scheme which will commence on 1 August next. The scheme will contain accelerated capital allowances for industrial buildings, and include generous incentives for the development of refurbished residential accommodation.  The scope of the scheme will cover a broader area than heretofore.  While the coverage will be reduced in the 5 county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford to about one quarter of the size of the areas currently designated therein, the existing designations in the provincial towns will be continued and small areas in 12 additional towns will also be designated.</P>
      <P>The new scheme, with its focus on residential and industrial development will stimulate growth and employment in our designated cities and towns.  While it is accepted that there are many areas throughout the country which could benefit from some form of additional incentive for development, in order to be effective however, the number of areas where incentives apply must be limited. To spread incentives over too broad an area would lead to additional Exchequer cost and dissipate the intended effect of the new urban renewal scheme.  Also some areas could be in danger of being developed on a solely tax driven basis rather than in response to commercial factors which could be very damaging. The new urban renewal scheme is due to terminate at end-July 1997 at which point the position will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 31, 36, 42 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The question of dormant account is difficult and raises complex legal issues in regard to constitutional and property rights.  For instance, Article 43 of the Constitution provides for the right to property, and the protection of that right. There is also the question of identifying legal ownership or entitlement to the funds involved.  These and other issues are under discussion with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to any consideration of the issues is the need to identify the amount of money involved.  At this point I am not in a position to give any estimation of the amounts that might be in question.  Obviously, one factor here would be the time threshold for definition of a dormant account and there are a variety of opinions about this.  I have recently asked the financial institutions to furnish aggregate statistics which will provide a basis for estimating amounts.  I am satisfied that this information can be provided without breaching in any way the confidentiality obligations of the institutions. I am hopeful that the information can be obtained promptly.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 1 February 1994.  As I made clear in that answer the objective of Government policy in relation to a third force in banking is to increase competition in the banking sector while protecting &mdash; and enhancing to the extent possible &mdash; the development role which the State banks can play in fostering industry, especially small and medium sized industry.  Proposals to give effect to this policy have not yet come before Government.  The Government will consider the matter when I am in a position to present firm proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The Deputy will be aware from my reply on 1 February and my reply to a related question on 12 October last that I and my Department have been engaged in extensive consultations with relevant parties and in a comprehensive survey of the options available to give effect to the Programme commitment to the creation of a third force in banking.  Considerable progress has been made in clarifying and teasing out the steps that will have to be taken in order to achieve the desired objective.  This preparatory work is continuing.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in this question are many and complex.  Any decision has implications not just for the institutions immediately involved but also for the wider financial system.  I am therefore determined to take the necessary time to fully explore all the options and only when I have done that will I be in a position to put firm proposals to Government.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of recent media statements in relation to the problem of overgrazing in certain areas and the difficulties this is causing for certain habitats.  Protecting threatened species and their habitats is a major part of the implementation of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the EU Birds &amp; Habitat Directives.  This work is carried out mainly by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current and future initiatives include: general protection under the planning laws, assessment of developments in areas of scientific interest, drawing up <Col N="1611" /> managmeent agreements with landowners for vulnerable sites, or acquiring them outright, designating special protection areas and natural heritage areas. The NHA scheme in particular will provide for the designation of 1.25 million acres of land as areas where protection of habitats and wildlife will be actively encouraged.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the rural environment protection scheme, which will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, participating farmers will be paid a premium for carrying out a range of measures on their farms, including the retention of wildlife habitats.  Additional aid will be available under REPS for practices such as avoiding degradation of land, including commonage and hill areas, as a result of overgrazing.</P>

      <P>The rate of VAT on newspaper in Ireland is the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.  Newspapers became subject to that rate in the 1993 budget when, as part of a general realignment of the VAT rating system, the 10 per cent rate, which had applied to newspapers since 1985, was abolished.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to reduce the rate of VAT on newspapers.  I am aware, of course, of the difficulties facing Irish newspapers, particularly in terms of competition from newspapers published abroad, but I would point out that all newspapers sold in this country attract the same rate of VAT, regardless of where they are published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware of the competition for advertising revenue from other media, but, in that connection, I would refer to the concession in last year's Finance Act <Col N="1612" /> which extended the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the advertising revenue of newspapers.  This initiative is, in my view, of far greater potential benefit to the industry in Ireland than a VAT rate concession.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit has been reckonable as income for tax purposes from 6 April, 1994.  It has, however, been decided that, in recognition of their special circumstances, workers who on 5 April, 1994 were participating in a systematic short-time working arrangement, recognised by the Department of Social Welfare, will be exempted from the new tax arrangements.  This exemption will apply in respect of unemployment Benefit payments received in relation to systematic short-time working for the duration of such an individual's current unemployment benefit claim or to the end of the present tax year &mdash; 5 April, 1995 &mdash; whichever is the earlier.  As I indicated in my press statement of 11 April, 1994, and my Second Stage Dáil speech on the Finance Bill on Tuesday, I will be bringing forward a Committee Stage Finance Bill amendment to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Department of Social Welfare that on 5 April, 1994 there were approximately 7,000 workers who are classified as being on systematic short-time working.  All these workers <Col N="1613" /> are in receipt of unemployment benefit and will qualify for the exemption.  The reduction in tax yield arising from this measure is estimated at £1 million in 1994 and £1 million to £2 million in a full year.</P>

      <Quest>in respect of the removal of mushroom cultivation from the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, the number of producers who are affected by this measure; the size of the tax base affected; and the estimate of the amount of extra taxation likely to be paid.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I an informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent statistics available relate to companies with accounting periods ended between 1 April, 1991 and 31 March, 1992.  For that period, approximately 70 companies engaged in mushroom cultivation and availing of the 10 per cent rate made corporation tax returns.  These companies had net taxable profits of almost £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures would indicate that some 13 per cent of mushroom producers are incorporated.  This means that the vast bulk of mushroom producers will not be directly affected by the change in corporation <Col N="1614" /> tax treatment at all as they are taxed under income tax rather than corporation tax.  In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the House that this estimate of 13 per cent of producers who are incorporated is based on an analysis of the latest records of the Revenue Commissioners. An earlier figure of &ldquo;less than 5 per cent&rdquo; of producers being incorporated quoted in the House during an Adjournment Debate on this matter on 30 March was based on a much more tentative estimate from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The somewhat higher figure for the number of incorporated mushroom producers does not, however, alter the basic fact that the vast majority of producers will not be directly affected by the change in tax treatment.</P>
    <P>As regards estimating the amount of extra taxation likely to be paid, as a result of the change in the tax treatment of mushroom cultivation, it is not possible to give an accurate assessment of this for a number of reasons.  In the first instance, the Deputy will be aware that the Finance Bill as published applies the higher 40 per cent rate of tax to income earned in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June 1994.  This allows affected companies the flexibility to commence an accounting period on 31 May 1994 such that the higher tax rate will not apply in practice until the accounting period beginning on 31 May 1995.  Assuming that all the major mushroom companies and the incorporated growers avail of this flexibility afforded by the legislation as regards arrangement of their accounting periods, it will be the net taxable profits arising in the period 31 May, 1995 to 30 May 1996 that will determine the amount of corporation tax payable under the new tax regime for mushrooms.  It is clearly not possible to predict what that level of net taxable profits will be in advance. Secondly, the major mushroom companies will be sheltered from the worst affects of the change in the tax treatment of mushrooms by the fact that production of compost will now be eligible for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax in its own right as a manufactured product.  In the <Col N="1615" /> absence of detailed knowledge of the structure of the activities of the major mushroom companies, it is not possible to estimate the impact of this on any future tax take.  Finally, it is not possible to say what, if any behavioural changes might take place among incorporated growers, such as reverting to sole trader status, as a result of the tax change.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully committed to regional development in Ireland.  The <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> which sets out the country's main development priorities over the next five years reflects this commitment.</P>
      <P>In preparing this plan, the Government were determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted would promote balanced regional development. Each of the sub-Regional Review Committees prepared a detailed submission setting out its recommendations concerning a development strategy and the priority measures to implement that strategy for its sub-region.  In the plan, the Government have responded to these submissions in so far as they are consistent with the overall national objectives of maximising sustainable growth and employment within the constraints of the EU and national resources available.</P>
      <P>The plan places a major emphasis on local development.  It recognises the role which local initiatives can play both as a catalyst for local economic development and enterprise and in measures aimed at targeting long term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government committed itself to the development of a Regional Authority structure in Ireland. This was given effect by the Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993 which established the Regional Authorities with effect from 1 January 1994. The primary role of the Regional Authorities is to promote co-ordination of the provision of public services at regional level.  The Government were conscious of the need to ensure that arrangements for sub-regional review of EU Structural and Cohesion Fund expenditure were <Col N="1618" /> consistent with developments in local Government and administrative reform. In this context, the Government decided that the remit of the Regional Authorities should include responsibility for reviewing and advising on the implementation of measures under the National Development Plan at sub-regional level.</P>
    <P>The Regional Authorities have now assumed the responsibilities with regard to EU matters formerly discharged by the sub-Regional Review Committees mentioned above.  For this purpose, each Regional Authority will be assisted by a broadly-based Operational Committee made up of locally elected representatives and officials, social partner organisations, appropriate State agencies, representatives of Government Departments and representatives of the community-voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>In establishing the Regional Authorities, the Government decided to rationalise the sub-regional boundaries so as to improve the planning and co-ordination of public services at local level.  The Government also directed that all public sector agencies should, as far as is practicable, adopt these boundaries for reviewing implementation of the plan at sub-regional level.  This should facilitate a better flow of information to the Regional Authorities and their Committees and enhance their capacity to advise the authorities responsible for implementation of measures under the Community Support Framework.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) was set up by the Revenue Commissioners with the advent of the Single Market in view of the increased role which Ireland is now required to play in protecting our own coastline as well as that of the European <Col N="1619" /> Union, in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.  The CNDT, comprising over seventy staff, consists of Intelligence Units, Operational Units, Maritime Units and Sniffer-dog Units, which are strategically based at locations throughout the country.  All units are mobile and are based at locations covering the entire coastline.  They employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance. These specialist officials supplement the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties. Furthermore, I would remind Deputies that since the abolition of systematic checks at internal Union frontiers on 1 January 1993 I have been pressing the case at European Union level for the provision of further assistance which will enhance and improve our capability in combating drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied with the present deployment of Customs and Excise resources and that every effort is being made to maximise and avail of the most up-to-date resources available to combat drug smuggling.</P>

      <P>With regard to cost, the expenditure on the decentralisation programme falls into two broad categories: (1) direct costs of the new accommodation and (2) expenditure on furniture, fittings, computerisation and equipment and on staff and training.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that the new office accommodation should be constructed by private developers under lease purchase arrangements where payments are made by the State on an annual basis.  These costs are borne by the Office of Public Works and the total annual payments made to date on all completed accommodation is £13.3 million.  (In addition the Office of Public Works expended some £50,000 on the acquisation of a site in Cavan).</P>

That information is not available in my Department, except in the case of Revenue.

      <P>The basic aim of the tax clearance procedures is to ensure that persons or groups benefiting from public contracts, in receipt of significant assistance from public funds, or being issued with State licences which allow them to conduct a business for profit, have discharged their tax liabilities.  They must first produce evidence that their tax affairs are in order.  This evidence normally comes in the form of a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Tax clearance procedures have been in operation for public contracts and grants since June 1986 and March 1988 respectively. In 1992, I announced that tax clearance would be extended to a broad range of licences concentrating initially on licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The scope of the tax clearance procedures as a means of ensuring that tax obligations are complied with is kept under active review.  I have no plans to extend tax clearance to public appointments, including those mentioned in the question.</P>

In addition to this initial charge, liable trusts are also required to pay 1 per cent per annum thereafter.</P>
      <P>The number of discretionary trusts expected to come within the charge to Discretionary Trust Tax (both initial and annual) in 1994 is 350.  For a trust to become liable to Discretionary Trust Tax it is necessary that the disponer be deceased, and that all principal objects be 21 years or over.  There are a number of specific exemptions provided in section 108 of the Finance Act, 1984 (for example, trusts created for charitable purposes, and trusts created by pension schemes).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises, from making Unemployment Benefit reckonable as income for tax purposes, essentially depends on the level of other income that recipients of Unemployment Benefit or recipients' spouses have in the same tax year.  If, in an individual <Col N="1624" /> case, there is no other income in addition to the Unemployment Benefit the income tax exemption limits will generally ensure that there is no tax to pay. Consequently, as detailed information on the total incomes of Unemployment Benefit recipients is not available, it is not possible to indicate the precise number of people who will pay additional tax under this measure.  Such a number would of course also depend on the actual number of people receiving Unemployment Benefit in a year.  All that can be said is that the number could be of the order of 90,000 to 100,000 but such an estimate is highly tentative.  I would like to point out, however, that many of these people would, in any event, have been liable for tax without Unemployment Benefit being reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>The yield that is estimated will arise from this measure is £18 million in 1994 and £30 million in a full year.</P>

In these circumstances, even if the information requested were available to him &mdash; which it would not be &mdash; the chief special collector could not disclose the amount of payments made to him deriving from a particular source.</P>
      <P>In the case of the general amnesty, the bulk of tax payments received were for tax liabilities already on record but no information is available as to what extent funds were repatriated from overseas to discharge them.  I am not, therefore, in a position to supply the information requested by the Deputy.  I can, however, inform the House that while some of the payments received under both amnesties are still being processed, it can now be estimated with confidence that the total amount of tax paid under the two amnesties was about £259 million, of which some £12 million was paid in 1993.  The total amount remitted under the 15 per cent incentive amnesty is estimated to be £183.5 million in respect of declared amounts of income and gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Associated payments of value added tax amounting to about £15 million were also made to the chief special collector.

The balance of the amnesty payments &mdash; nearly £61 million &mdash; related to the general amnesty.</P>

      <P>Information in the precise form sought by the Deputy in relation to the earnings of Government sector employees is not readily available in my Department.  Such particulars are obtained by my Department from the various sectors of the public service from time to time, as required.  I have asked that the most recent figures are furnished at this stage, and I will be happy to provide them directly to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the OECD figure quoted by the Deputy is obtained by dividing the Excherquer pay bill by the average numbers employed in the year in <Col N="1628" /> question.  That bill covers non-capital supply expenditure on pay in the Civil Service, the Permanent Defence Force, Garda, national and secondary school services together with estimates of amounts included for pay in grants to all health service agencies, non-commercial State bodies, vocational education committees and third level education institutions. In the latter cases, the amounts granted do not necessarily cover the full payroll cost in the services concerned, the balance being made up by own resources and other receipts.  The pay of local authority staff is not included in the Exchequer pay bill by accounting convention.</P>
    <P>The average thus obtained provides a crude indicator of the average <i>per capita</i> cost to the Exchequer of employing public servants which does not correspond to their average pay or earnings. There are a number of technical factors, for instance, the timing and treatment of offsetting receipts, the number of paydays in the calendar year in question or variations in the pay-non-pay classifiction of expenditure from time to time, which may distort the evaluation of the Exchequer pay bill from year to year.  For these reasons, the averages used by the OECD must be treated with caution.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost of the changes to the residential property tax in 1994 is £2.25 million.  The expected yield from residential property tax in 1994 is, therefore, £11.75 million.  This figure does not take account of once-off cash flow loss as a result of the new phased payment facility.  The amount of this cash flow loss is entirely dependent upon the number of taxpayers who choose to avail of the facility.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to this House over a year ago, the arrangements agreed by Government for the staffing of the political offices of Ministers and Ministers of State provide that each Minister of State may appoint the following staff: a special adviser; a personal assistant and a personal secretary.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State assigned to the Office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and to my Department has currently in employment only a personal secretary and a personal assistant and had not until recently selected a special adviser &mdash; as she has been entitled to do at any time since her appointment. She has, however, recently decided to engage a personal adviser and a person has been selected for appointment to that post.  My understanding is that the appointment will not take effect before June next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it important to place on the record of the House certain features which this appointment shares with the generality of outside appointments to the private offices of Ministers and Ministers of State.  First, the salary payable is salary prior to employment in such position plus an allowance of 10 per cent subject to specific maximum amounts.  That maximum, in the case of a special adviser to a Minister of State, is £32,461 and the remuneration proposed for the selected appointee falls below that figure.  Second, all advisers appointed by Ministers and Ministers of State are to be employed under contracts which provide that their term of office is limited to the period during which the office holder by whom they are appointed or selected retains his or her post in the Department or office to which the adviser is assigned.  Third, <Col N="1630" /> there is not, and has never been, any proposal or intention that the person in question would be employed as an adviser to the Minister of State or otherwise paid out of public funds during the period of the current election campaign for the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>Any major structural changes to the organisation and development of ACC Bank and ICC Bank would be a matter for Government consideration in the context of the options available for giving effect to the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97,</i> in relation to the banking sector. The future role for Trustee Savings Bank would also be considered by Government at the same time, but I should point out that decisions in relation to that bank are a matter for its trustees.</P>
      <P>ACC Bank, ICC Bank and Trustee Savings Bank are three vibrant and profitable organisations, all pursuing lines of development appropriate to their present structure and business.  In accordance with the normal relationship between Ministers and bodies under their aegis, I do not intervene in day to day management decisions concerning the operation of these banks.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> The conclusions further stated that, for the four Cohesion Fund member states, the figures set out will permit a doubling of commitments under Objective 1 and the Cohesion Fund between 1992 and 1999.  They specified that &ldquo;for the four Cohesion Fund member states this means about 85becu over the period 1993-1999.&rdquo; The conclusions further specified that, in the allocation of the funds, &ldquo;full account should be taken, as now, of national prosperity, regional prosperity, population of the regions, and the relative severity of structural problems, including the level of unemployment and, for the appropriate objectives, the needs of rural development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In application of the conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council, the Commission must make an indicative financial allocation to member states, using the above procedures and on the basis of objective criteria.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following schedule which shows for the commercial semi-State companies the overall level of debt and of debt guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities of the Minister for Finance in relation to the borrowings of semi-State companies and financial institutions are set out in the legislation dealing with the relevant bodies.  The standard provision is that the consent of the relevant Minister and of the Minister for Finance is required for all borrowings of such bodies.  In addition, legislation <Col N="1636" /> usually permits the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the relevant Minister, to guarantee tranches of borrowings.</P>
    <P>A table of borrowings guaranteed by the Minister for Finance is published annually in the Finance Accounts which is laid before the House.  Details of borrowing by individual semi-State companies are incorporated in their annual report and accounts which are also laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The question of the level of borrowing of individual State bodies is primarily a matter for the boards of the bodies concerned having regard to their financial position and for the relevant Minister within the context of the statutory controls applicable to such borrowings.</P>
    <P>The relevant Minister of course will obtain from the bodies concerned all the information he requires in regard to its operations, results, and financial position when it is considering requests for approval to borrow.</P>

      <P>The standard VAT rate, currently 21 per cent here, applies to trade tools generally under the terms of the EU Rates Directive, which governs the VAT treatment of goods and services in the Single Market.  I have no scope under the Directive to apply a reduced rate to such items.</P>
      <P>I should point out that tradesmen who are registerd for VAT purposes are able to recover in full the tax borne on the purchase of tools and other business inputs.  At present, tradesmen in the services sector are obliged to register if their annual turnover exceeds £15,000, but they can opt to do so even if they do not exceed the registration threshold: as registered persons, they are then entitled to recover their input VAT, but they must, of course, also charge the tax on the supplies they make.  There is no provision under EU law which would permit me to introduce measures to allow unregistered tradesmen to recover VAT charged on their business inputs: such a course of action would clearly contravene the EU VAT requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of an annual income tax allowance, I am happy to inform the Deputy that employees may already claim a deduction in respect of expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of their duties of employment.  In addition, certain trades and professions are currently being granted a flat rate deduction in respect of expenses incurred in the <Col N="1639" /> performance of their duties.  The amount of the flat-rate varies from trade to trade depending on the circumstances.  Finally, individuals engaged in a trade or profession on their own behalf may claim a deduction in respect of expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the course of the trade or profession.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, is the national limb-fitting centre in this country and I understand that in 1993, 506 artificial limbs were fitted.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the review group on physical and sensory disability later this year.  One of the issues being addressed by the review group is the establishment of a national database on physical disability which will facilitate the planning and development of services for people with disabilities.</P>
