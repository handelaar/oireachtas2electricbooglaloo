    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the three-day ceasefire in terms of the limited respite from human suffering it offered. We regarded it as a small step in the right direction, which may have had some symbolic importance.  We likewise shared the heartfelt hope of the overwhelming number of Irish people, North and South that a meaningful extension to the ceasefire would have ensued.  I empathise with the widespread sense of disappointment, that what would have been seen as a gesture of real commitment to a durable peace did not as yet take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Joint Declaration was agreed by the British Prime Minister and myself, there has existed a strong public expectation and fervent hope that the ensuing internal debate in the Republican movement would lead to a decision on a complete cessation of violence.  Such a development would immediately open the way to the next stage of the peace process as set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Declaration, where all concerned <Col N="4" /> would participate solely on the basis of the respect accorded by the exclusively democratic nature of their electoral mandates.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the support of the Opposition parties for the Joint Declaration, and hopes that they will continue a constructive approach towards the development of the peace process.  In this regard, I am happy to meet with the party leaders and to consider carefully any points put forward in the context of sustaining the momentum for peace.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on previous occasions, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is intended to bring the peace process to the next step consequent on a permanent cessation of violence. This stage has not yet been reached.</P>
    <P>I wish to make absolutely clear that, for both Governments, a permanent cessation of violence remains the goal, so that all parties can be present at the negotiating table.  There is no justification whatsoever for continued violence.  None of us can guarantee that the present relatively favourable conditions for peace will continue indefinitely.  It seems that the process of deliberation must surely be all but complete at this stage.  An early decision on peace is required so as to facilitate full participation by the Republican movement in the search for new agreed relationships between the two traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding the St. Patrick's Day message issued by the US House of Representatives <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Irish Affairs, their support for the Joint Declaration as a foundation for a lasting and equitable solution is welcome.  The statement also refers to clarification and negotiation. I have just set out the policy position in these areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress once again the single-minded determination of both Governments that no party or organisation will be allowed veto political progress. We will not permit the momentum towards this end to be slowed down. Work on a possible framework document for new talks is continuing, progress is being made and this work will proceed <Col N="5" /> with intensity.  The Prime Minister and I remain in frequent contact to review and discuss developments in this and other areas.  Our efforts are significantly augmented by the regular meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and by the workings of the Secretariat. There is understandable impatience and disappointment with the very limited and inadequate response of the Republican movement so far to this unprecedented opportunity for peace.  I would like to assure the House that both Governments will continue in our efforts to develop the peace process, and are also pursuing, as a matter of urgency, the earliest possible resumption of the three-strand talks in the context of the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I agree that what we have had so far is a token ceasefire.  Does the Taoiseach see any reasonable prospect in the foreseeable future that the virtually unanimous view of the people of the island of Ireland will be accepted and that the IRA killing and bombing will be ended?  On the peace process, does the Taoiseach believe that Sinn Féin is capable of delivering a ceasefire?  On the talks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two other points.  We would all like to see the constitutional parties on this island talking.  Does the Taoiseach see any prospect of the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland engaging in such discussions in the run up to the European elections? On the discussions between the two Governments, in the absence of talks between the constitutional parties or parallel with them, can a case be made for the two Governments to engage in detailed discussions, not merely on a framework document, so that they will be in a position to present agreed options to the parties later in the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's latter question, the liaison committee is continuing to look at the prospects for institutional and other structures which might be put forward for discussion in the three stranded talks process so as to make co-operation between North and South a reality.  The Deputy's question as to whether the IRA had the capacity to deliver on a peace process would have to be directed to the IRA &mdash; I do not have any additional knowledge which would enable me to comment on this issue. However, I believe a real opportunity for peace exists.  Despite the setbacks, disappointments and the logjams which have been put in the way of peace, I still believe peace is attainable.  What was the Deputy's first question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the talks within the parties, particularly the Unionist parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that like me, the Deputy is a political realist who recognises that at the time of an election the possibility of some of the parties saying they would come back to the negotiating table after the elections is very limited.  That is my assessment of the political realities up there and we will have to wait until after the elections.  I hope I am wrong in this &mdash; and I would like to think that I am wrong &mdash; but I am merely expressing a realistic political view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly before the Downing Street Declaration the Taoiseach expressed the judgment that there could be peace before Christmas, last year.  Will the Taoiseach say what has changed to lead him to revise his judgment in that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had to correct the record in this regard on numerous occasions.  This was in response to the second question asked at the press conference in Downing Street on the day the Joint Declaration was issued.  I want to again put it on record &mdash; if the Deputy looks at the record he will see I said <Col N="7" /> this on a number of occasions &mdash; that I believed the first steps towards peace would be achievable by Christmas, which they were.  The signing of the Joint Declaration was the first step along the road towards the achievement of peace, and that is still the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline what he believes are the remaining steps on the road to peace?  Will he say if any of those steps need to be taken by the Government or if they all have to be taken by the IRA?  On the possible framework document for renewed talks referred to by him, will the Taoiseach say if this will be a joint document between both Governments or a document prepared and published by one Government? Will he take the initiative to get talks going between constitutional politicians, not on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed but on the more sensible basis that something must be agreed soon because not everything can be agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's aspiration that something will be agreed as early as possible.  However, I have no intention of moving away from the ground rules of the three stranded talks process when they resume, that is, no preconditions are to be laid down by anybody and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  Those rules were agreed by the two Governments and I have no intention of deviating from them &mdash; they are a solid basis on which to go forward.</P>
      <P>The two Governments are continuing to work together through the liaison committee. I think Deputy Bruton, and everyone else, would agree that a document produced by either Government which was not supported by the other would not go very far in the process.  The two Governments are working together through the liaison committee on a framework document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked the steps taken by the Government since the Joint Declaration. We have given very extensive <Col N="8" /> clarification and explanations of the text of the Downing Street Joint Declaration and what it means.  We have also taken up every argument put forward by Sinn Féin against the declaration so as to ensure that no stone is left unturned. The British Government took a different view of the requests for clarification and explanations.  We all have to recognise the deep and yawning gap of distrust which exists between Sinn Féin and the British Government about what either side says.  This has arisen from past experiences and centuries' old conflict. This gap will have to be bridged at some stage.  On a number of occasions I have asked the aspects of the declaration which require clarification &mdash; I have listened to the repeated requests for clarification, read the newspapers and heard the statements &mdash; but I have not been told what they are.  If I knew the aspects which required clarification I might be in a position to make some objective judgment of the assistance we could give in this area.  However, in the absence of this information I cannot go any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to meet with the Opposition leaders and for acknowledging that we have played a constructive role.  I think I speak for my colleagues in all the Opposition parties when I say we intend to continue to play a constructive role in this matter.  In response to my question the Taoiseach said that the work underway to advance the peace process involved work on the framework document for talks.  He went on to acknowledge that there was little likelihood of inter-party talks in the immediate future. Will the Taoiseach agree that it would be better to proceed with the establishment of the forum in the short term?  Has Sinn Féin expressed any reservations about paragraph 5 of the declaration in which the Irish Government acknowledges that there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So many statements <Col N="9" /> have been made on this matter that it would be foolish, without having all of them in front of me, to make a definitive comment on any of them.  On the question of the talks process, I was expressing what I believe is a realistic political view about the forthcoming elections in Northern Ireland.  If the talks process can be started before these elections we would certainly support and assist any such move.  I am merely saying that we all know of the competition between the two Unionist parties in the North and it would be unrealistic to expect either one of them to expose their flanks in an election. I do not think they will do this but if they do so be it.</P>
      <P>I recognise the constructive role played by the Opposition parties in supporting the Downing Street Declaration and their continued support for it.  We all want to achieve the same result at the end of the day, that is, peace.</P>
      <P>On the question of the institutional and other structures which might be appropriate for the talks process, much work is being, and will continue to be, done in this area.  Consequently, I do not accept the view that nothing is happening behind the scenes or that we are waiting for somebody else to make decisions for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Taoiseach about the possibility of talks, but why can the forum not be established now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Much work is being done on the forum.  As I previously said in the House, I will not establish the forum without full consultation with all party leaders.  The structure of the forum can be the subject of our talks.  My office will be in touch with the various party leaders to see how soon we can have that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of clarification for Sinn Féin and the IRA, will the Taoiseach agree that their demands for clarification are simply a euphemism for them wishing to have direct meetings with the British Government and the commencement of negotiations on the content of the Joint Declaration and that this would be entirely unacceptable to the British and Irish Governments?  Equally it is an attempt to establish its right to use violence in pursuit of its aims in that it wants to do this before agreeing to end its campaign of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To seek renegotiation of the Downing Street Joint Declaration is not acceptable to either Government. I said that on a number of occasions and the British Government have also said it. I recall a statement by Sinn Féin which said it was not looking for a meeting with the British Government for renegotiation but for clarification or explanation or whatever one may wish to call it.  The question the Deputy asks on renegotiation of the document simply does not arise in the eyes of either Government and will not change our position on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the forthcoming talks with the Taoiseach who said in referring to them that he would consider carefully any points put forward by the Opposition.  We will have points to put forward but can I take it that the Taoiseach will be putting forward proposals <Col N="11" /> or ideas also for discussion with us or will it be simply a one way street?  I hope that will not be the case.</P>
      <P>Do I discern from the Taoiseach's reply a sense of pessimism about the possibility of all-party talks starting before the European elections because of the reluctance of some parties?  Also, looking ahead, the marching season follows immediately after that and, therefore, it is possible that little or nothing might happen in terms of talks before September or October? Will the Taoiseach agree that would be most undesirable?  Will he agree also that some special initiative is needed quickly by himself and the British Prime Minister to engage people in constructive talks so that there will not be a political vacuum of a kind that could be extremely dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No political vacuum exists as far as I and the British Prime Minister are concerned.  We are in close contact on a very frequent basis in relation to monitoring what is happening, keeping ourselves updated and, indeed, discussing the future positions of both Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of restarting the talks process, the Deputy should not take it that I am pessimistic; I am simply giving what I believe is a political assessment of the situation in the North regarding the resumption of talks.  I do not accept that we cannot have talks during the marching season.  There were talks during the marching season when the talks process last took place and they were carried on right up to the time that the parties agreed to break for the month of August.  I do not regard that as an obstacle; I am simply saying that politically and realistically speaking when one considers the different parties in the North, I am quite certain the SDLP and the Alliance Party would be ready to join the talks process.  There is the difficulty, however, of the two Unionist parties who have totally different positions in relation to the Downing Street joint Declaration and, indeed, to many other aspects.  I am only expressing a realistic political view. <Col N="12" /> We will not be found wanting in our efforts to try to start the talks process and both Government have made it quite clear to all the parties that that is our position and that we are continuing to work with each other to produce a document that can be the subject matter of those talks when they are ready to resume.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that Sinn Féin's problem with the declaration seems to be that there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until the majority there wish it to happen?  Given that this is accepted by the Irish Government in paragraph 5 of the declaration, has Sinn Féin expressed any reservations either directly to the Taoiseach in the correspondence or through intermediaries on that paragraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never comment on any information given to me confidentially by anybody, by way of intermediary or otherwise, nor do I believe it would be helpful to the talks process. We have made advances, despite what people think, in relation to Sinn Féin's position now compared to what it has been, in that it has renounced coercion as an instrument to bring about its own political objectives in this regard.  That is a major step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to any change without the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland is part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I have made it clear time and again that that is an international obligation on the Irish Government and there can be no going away from it.  Nobody should be under any illusions as to the Government's position on this and what it has been from the very beginning, right through the whole process leading up to the peace declaration and since.  Our lines are clearly defined for everyone to see and I am not being pessimistic in relation to this.  I believe the three day ceasefire was a badly read situation, I believe it was a mistake.  Those who thought that they would get a meaningful response to a 72 <Col N="13" /> hour ceasefire were only fooling themselves and I believe the message has gone loud and clear back to the Republican movement that a serious assessment of the situation and a decision is now awaited by everyone concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says that Sinn Féin-IRA will not be allowed to exercise a veto on political progress and, at the same time, that he does not believe it is possible to make progress unless Sinn Féin is around the table with the rest of the parties who have a role to play in finding a solution with regard to Northern Ireland.  How then does he propose to overcome this problem of logic?  Will he not accept that the four months' indulgence of Sinn Féin and the IRA should now come to an end, that we must see, having lifted every stone that we have been urged to lift, looked at it meticulously and having sought some glimmer of hope in relation to Sinn Féin and the IRA, that they are now incapable of bringing about a ceasefire on their own terms and that we must move on?  Will he accept that the only way of proving to them that they cannot continue is for us to move on?  In that context will the Taoiseach indicate to the House, when he talks about discussions between the Irish and British Governments on a possible framework document, what that document is and what it is intended to achieve?  Is it a framework for talks, or a framework for the government of Northern Ireland?  To what precise framework is he referring?</P>

      <P>Every week here I have to make corrections to what Deputy De Rossa tries to say or interpret from what I have said.  First, both Governments are determined that no political party will have a veto on political progress, and that includes every party.  Second, I do not know what the Deputy means when he refers to turning logic on its head or that it is not logical to say this or that.  Of course the two Governments can and will go ahead without Sinn Féin when we and all the other parties are ready to come to the table, let there be no doubt about <Col N="14" /> that.  What I have said consistently, and I am not changing my view now, is that I believe there is a far better chance of progress and the attainment of an ultimate accommodation between the two traditions in this country if we can do it in a peaceful environment.  If Deputy De Rossa is asking me to desist from the course of action in which I have been engaged, I have no intention of doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two brief points, the first in relation to the discussions between the two Governments. I am glad that such discussions are taking place in regard to a framework document for future talks.  I encourage the Taoiseach to bring that even further and try to get the British Government to agree that not only should there be a framework document but that there should be agreed options so that later in the year the two Governments might be in a position, as Seamus Mallon said recently, to &ldquo;write the script&rdquo; for presentation to the parties on this island.  Will the Taoiseach clarify one other point in relation to Sinn Féin?  What is the Government's basic requirement of Sinn Féin to make it acceptable to the democratic process and in the first instance to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation? Does it have to accept the Downing Street Joint Declaration in toto&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition for joining the talks process, the democratic process and the political process is the cessation of violence.  It follows from that that Sinn Féin do not have to accept the <Col N="15" /> Downing Street Joint Declaration word for word.  If there are some words, a phrase or a line in it with which they disagree, the prerequisite for joining the talks process remains a cessation of violence. The Downing Street Joint Declaration is a set of principles that will guide the talks process, hopefully leading to an ultimate settlement.  If somebody does not agree with a line, a word or whatever, they can join that process on the basis of a cessation of violence and argue their position within the talks process. That is very clear.  We need a cessation of violence not on one side only but on both sides.  While we all appreciate that there has been a reduction in loss of life, in these circumstances there should not be the loss of even one more life. That is our view and we will continue to hold that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share the lingering hope that the IRA will see sense and call off their campaign of violence, would the Taoiseach agree that there is now required an emphasis on an alternative way forward?  Will he agree that the basis on which we will move forward will be the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Joint Declaration, and that the two Governments should make it clear that, while they will do everything in their power to make progress, with the co-operation of all of the Northern Ireland political parties, ultimately a time will come when the two Governments will have to consider going over the heads of those parties directly to the people, using the most democratic instrument available to them, the plebiscite or a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We may well arrive at that position, but it is more desirable that we get the parties around the table to join the talks process.  We all know what was the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the main Unionist party was left out of that process.  It may well have been that that was the direction the then Government had to take at that time &mdash; I am not saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in <Col N="16" /> relation to it &mdash; but it would be more desirable that we move in the direction I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Implicit in the overall talks between the two Governments about putting a document together, whatever shape or form that document may take ultimately, is the principle that there will be no change in the Anglo-Irish Agreement unless we reach an agreement that transcends it.  There will be no renegotiation of the principles laid down in the Downing Street Joint Declaration. The way forward is quite clear.  I am firmly of the view that, no matter what direction different parties take in relation to the problems in Northern Ireland, ultimately the set of principles laid down in the Downing Street Joint Declaration will form the basis of the talks process which hopefully will lead to an ultimate settlement and an accommodation between the two communities.  That is what I genuinely believe.</P>
      <P>When one looks at paragraph 4 of the Downing Street Joint Declaration one realises that it is becoming ever clearer to people on the ground that there is no need, not even the slightest justification, for the continuance of violence in pursuit of legitimate aims when one observes the declarations made by a British Government which have never been made before.  It may take some time for that message finally to get through to people who have lived in a world of violence for 25 years, who perhaps have not the same appreciation of the outside world as we have. Whatever the period of time involved, I believe it will dawn on people that it is futile to continue violence to achieve their political aims when it can be done in a peaceful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97 provides that An Chomhairle Ealaíon will be asked to operate on a coordinated three-year plan for funding of the arts.  Such a procedure of long term planning will enable greater co-ordination between capital and current expenditure and also between local and national initiatives and priorities.  Following my direction, An Chomhairle is at present preparing a three-year plan, the central thrust of which will be towards regional development.  I have asked An Chomhairle to report back to me later this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the current policy of An Chomhairle Ealaíon with regard to access and participation in the arts in the regions operates on two levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle supports, encourages <Col N="18" /> and otherwise advocates the involvement of local authorities in provision for the arts at local level.  An Chomhairle provides direct financial support towards the employment of specialist arts officers with 19 local authorities throughout the country and 50 per cent of the salary of these officers is paid for by an Chomhairle. In addition to the salary subvention An Chomhairle may also provide grant-aid towards projects identified by the local authorities as worthy of support.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle also supports a range of interventions at local level in the form of touring events relating to music, visual arts and drama.  Such events are directed towards arts centres which have been established jointly with local authorities. There are currently 14 of these centres. An Chomhairle also provides grant-aid for the employment of artists in schools and communities and other residencies. These schemes I believe have been highly successful.  Such artists work closely with their host organisations or communities, to encourage active participation in art expression and creativity.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in reply to a parliamentary question on 4 November 1993, I indicated that I support the policies of An Chomhairle Ealaíon in relation to youth arts and arts in the community.  I particularly welcomed the joint report of An Chomhairle and the National Youth Council entitled &ldquo;Making Youth Arts Work&rdquo; and also the earlier ACE report &ldquo;Art and the Ordinary&rdquo;. The positive and generous principles and sentiments contained in reports such as these will inform my thinking and prompt my initiatives over the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in a reply to a parliamentary question on 23 February 1994, I indicated that the Structural Funds at my disposal under the National Development Plan 1994-99 will enable me to undertake a major investment in the national cultural institutions and to support new arts and cultural infrastructure activities.  I am already on record as saying that I intend to ensure a balance of investment <Col N="19" /> between the capital city and the regions. However, until discussions with the European Commission on the National Development Plan have been completed. I am not in a position to say to what extent such initiatives can be funded from Structural Funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>While the thrust of my question is about participation in and access to the arts in the regions, I accept that it is somewhat broader than that. Would the Minister comment specifically on the disbursement of funding by the Arts Council which at present allocates approximately 70 per cent of its budget to the Dublin region, particularly since the Programme for Government enunciated an aspiration that each local authority appoint an arts officer?  The Minister has indicated that to date only 19 local authorities have embarked on that course of action.  Would he accept that the imbalance of Arts Council funding along with local authorities' reluctance to appoint arts officers &mdash; because of the failure of the Minister's Department or that of the Department of the Environment to make specific additional funds available for that purpose &mdash; means that these factors cumulatively conspire to deny access to the arts to a large section of the population, particularly in the regions?  Can the Minister comment on the fact that the Green Paper on Education made absolutely no reference to the role of the arts in the education system?  Does he not agree that the education system offers an essential avenue that has to be exploited if we are to have increased participation and access to the arts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the serious questions the Deputy has put by way of supplementaries and I will be as brief as I can.  In relation to provision for the arts there can be no doubt by any fair minded person that provision has been significantly increased in the current year.  When I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council &mdash; was in <Col N="20" /> receipt of £10 million.  A few months later that figure was increased to £11.5 million. Before the end of that year it was increased to £12.25 million and in the budget an additional £1 million was provided for, bringing the total to £13.25 million.  In that 16 month period then there was an increase in funding to the Arts Council of over 32 per cent.  Many people will see that as a very significant increase.</P>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy are reasonable.  I am sure he will agree that if I were to interfere in the Arts Council's decision making process I would be accused, and correctly so, of breaking the necessary distance between the Minister and the statutory bodies for which he has responsibility.  The Arts Council, like RTE, operates at a statutory distance from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way the Minister will keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Arts Council take decisions for themselves.  That is a principle which I have called &mdash; when I have had an opportunity to do so &mdash; autonomy with responsibility.  We should use the additional Structural Funding that will be available to us to redress a number of areas such as where there is little arts activity and in which there is a disproportionate expenditure on infrastructure. I have assured the Deputy that in addressing the issue of expenditure of Structural Funds, I will have regard to the matter of regional balance.  I want to assure him, too, that in the movement from a Green Paper on Education to a White Paper on Education I have taken the opportunity to communicate my ideas to my colleague, the Minister for Education and to emphasise the importance of creativity in the arts.  Nineteen arts officers have been appointed by local authorities and co-funded by the Arts Council.  It is in the interest of local authorities who are serious about filling the gaps in the area of the arts to proceed with the appointment of arts officers. Surely if an arts officer is appointed &mdash;<Col N="21" /> and the Government has suggested this &mdash; and if an arts development plan is in place one is in the best possible position to take advantage of any additional funding that may be made available and to use it for the benefit of the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of arts officers and the co-funding available from the Arts Council is it the Minister's intention or the intention of his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to make specific allocations available to local authorities?  An unfortunate hallmark of Governments is that they tend to impose additional duties on local authorities without providing any additional finance. To labour the budget of the Arts Council with the cost of providing an arts officer would, in many respects, be unfair to them.  Because this is a specific Government initiative as outlined in the Programme for Government finance should be specifically provided for such personnel. I am sure the Government and the Minister recognise that since money invested in the arts gives a handsome return this would be money well spent. Will the Minister request his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to make those funds available to local authorities where there is a dearth of artistic activity on access to the arts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that there will be areas of worthwhile co-operation between my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and myself in relation to making provision for the arts in different local authority areas.  The experience of local authorities differs widely since it became possible for them in the first half of the seventies, about 1974, to make provision for the arts.  Local authorities vary widely in the way they use their own capacity to fund the arts.  Many have been forward looking and have taken initiatives which in turn have been matched with finance from the Arts Council.  The demand from the public for cultural activity and for participation in the arts has often outstripped that of many local authorities, some of which do not <Col N="22" /> include, as normal and central provision for cultural activities and the arts.  The best preparations for the spending of Structural Fund moneys are those made at home.  This is an opportunity for local authorities to be well prepared to take advantage of additional funding.</P>

In addition £139 million was to have been spent by his Department on cultural tourism &mdash; £100 million of that would have been spent by the Office of Public Works with the balance being spent on various projects.

      <P>It is not a matter of the axe being applied to these projects. Talks on the national plan between the Government and the Commission have not concluded.  There will be discussions between my Department and other Departments on certain aspects of the operational programme and further discussions will then be held within my Department.  I have used the opportunity to prioritise a number of projects and particularly their likely outturn in relation to job creation.  Initially the figure quoted for cultural institutions and agencies was £44 million; films, £16 million; waterways, £25 million; national parks and nature reserves, £14 million; Údarás na Gaeltachta, £77 million; local authority support for cultural projects, £27 million; Gaeltacht marine works, £8 million; and national monuments and historic properties, £29 million, giving a total of £240 million for the general area for which I have responsibility.  Those who will benefit from this very significant expenditure will be more interested in the £220 million which will be spent rather than any downward adjustment of £20 million.  The figure may not be adjusted by that amount as I may be able to make other arrangements.  It is not correct to talk about any project being axed or abandoned at this stage but rather to say that the funding is being reorganised.</P>

The £240 million represents a contribution across several different operational programmes which could be combined in different ways.  I will be delighted to give the Deputy further details when the exercise has been completed.  Meanwhile I would ask him to encourage the public to be positive about the expenditure of more than £220 million rather than wasting energy finding where a hypothetical cut of £20 million might be located.</P>

The discussions have not been completed and the ordering of Office of Public Works projects will form part of the priority exercise in which I am engaged.  I am looking at different options, for example, adjusting timescales.  That is the responsible way to deal with the matter rather than spread misery around the country.</P>

      <P>I of course, share the Deputy's concern that the intrinsic value of our heritage should not be compromised. My policy is for the preservation of our diverse and unique heritage for current and future generations of our people on this island, and for the provision of suitable public access and information.</P>
      <P>Of course, our heritage also plays an important role as a tourist attraction.  I believe that the richness of our heritage can be shared with visitors to this country without any such compromise occurring, through careful and sensitive management of public access and information.</P>
      <P>This has been my policy since I was appointed Minister with responsibility for heritage policy, and I will continue to be vigilant in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is not so much this Minister's commitment to the intrinsic value of our heritage that worries me but rather that of the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I would refer him to an incident which occurred in Céide Fields.  It sums up the tension which exists between the Office of Public Works and his Department which has responsibility for interpretative centres. The resident archaeologist resigned because of the appointment of a person to promote potential earnings rather than one who had an appreciation of the archaeological importance of the site. Does the Minister intend to bring the heritage section of the Office of Public Works within his remit?  Does he consider that his Department is rendered useless in terms of policing its aspirations, given that they have responsibility for policy but not for its implementation?  That rests with the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>Legislation to place the Heritage Council on a statutory basis is with the parliamentary draftsperson. There is a heritage policy unit in my Department and the Deputy may have been in contact with them.  It is specifically laid down that future policy in relation to heritage is my responsibility. That is why I am strengthening the institutional infrastructure by putting the Heritage Council on a statutory basis, and why I have a heritage policy unit within my Department.  It would be very wrong to stray into the area of the appointment of one individual or another, even if I had direct responsibility for the employment of individuals within an agency.  I value, and have been at pains to strengthen in legislation, the philosophy of autonomy with responsibility and the statutory distance which these bodies and agencies have from me so that they can act responsibly.  At the same time, my assurance to this House is the accountability which the statute gives.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the written policy of the National Museum not to lend works of archaeological interest to interpretative or other centres unless these centres employ trained archaeologists?  Does he think this is the correct policy in a developing situation?  If he does, I accept that.  If he thinks otherwise, what steps does he intend to take to have that policy changed?  Is the Minister concerned that if this policy pertains and the Office of Public Works refuses to respond, some of our interpretative centres will be little more than ice-cream parlours in ten years' time because they will not have the trained staff that would enable them to have the kind of stock that adds to their appeal, to preserve such items of interest and present them to the viewing public, natives or tourists?</P>

      <P>I do not mind answering. I know the Deputy's interest is genuine and I am anxious to be of assistance. As to the possible use of Collins Barracks as a new location for the museum, I have established an advisory group to advise on the best short term strategy for museums and for the needs of the museum.  That body will be addressing a number of things.  To answer the Deputy's specific question, what the museum considers when deciding to lend an artefact are issues of security, conservation and safe movement of the object in question.  These criteria are laid down by professionals within the museum and I respect them.  To address the needs of interpretative centres, as the Deputy suggested, one must try to raise their standards so that they can meet the requirements of conservation, security and safety and make it possible for there to be a proper set of artefacts available.  It is certainly a consideration and deserves attention.</P>

      <P>Future heritage policy will be, as much as I can make it, an integration of two quite interesting tendencies. One is that heritage belongs to all of us and should be built into the regular education of children and people who live locally who, if they know and are proud of their heritage and can tell their own story, are more interesting to visit. The other is that if, after that, what becomes available by way of artefact and the description of it is attractive as an economic resource for tourism, that is an additional benefit.  These two needs must be integrated and I would certainly be <Col N="29" /> interested in trying to pursue future heritage policy with such intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the lifting of the broadcasting ban has made no contribution to the advancement of the peace process?  On the contrary, it has given a huge advantage to spokespersons for violence, murder and mayhem and, cannot, therefore, be seen to be in the national interest.  Is he further concerned about the amount of time being given to spokespersons from Sinn Féin in the last ten weeks?  Finally, is he concerned that RTE is now accepting spokespersons who are not elected members?  Will the Minister accept that RTE would not do that for constitutional politicians?  If, for example, the Minister wanted a county councillor from his own party to act as a spokesperson on an issue, RTE would seek a Dáil Deputy.  Despite that, as late as last week a gentleman called Doherty, a non-elected person, acted as a spokesperson for Sinn Féin.  Is <Col N="30" /> it the Minister's intention to speak to RTE on this matter and seek at least to have these matters corrected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat what I have said on a number of occasions in the House since I began answering Dáil questions on the subject of the order under section 31.  My review of this matter was always from the perspective of the right to information.  I never saw any recommendation I made to Government in terms of reward or punishment. From the time the Attorney General answered questions on behalf of the Government on Article 19 in relation to the right to information.  I saw this as an issue of the right to information, of censorship of news and current affairs, of broadcasting practice, of the public's right to know.  I did not say at any stage that I was locating my proposal to Government in terms of reward or punishment for reaction to initiatives later or sooner.  What Deputy Quill has asked represents a certain confusion.  Under the Broadcasting Acts the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting is required to take certain responsibilities. Also enshrined in the Broadcasting Acts &mdash; and in the latest amendment which I introduced last year &mdash; are further distances in relation to reports that have come to this House rather than to the Minister.  The position is simply that the Minister does not interfere.  I made my recommendation to the Government on the basis that the public had a right to know, that the RTE Authority had the right to be an authority, that journalists could be journalists and that the public would exercise their judgment.  I also believed that beyond the order under section 31, section 18 (1) (a) of the Broadcasting Act was sufficient, if people are unhappy with its operation they can make a complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Deputy Quill's question on whether I propose to initiate an inquiry with RTE about the interviewing of a named individual, I am happy that the recommendation I made to Government was correct.  I am happy that it respects <Col N="31" /> the integrity of the public's right to know and the practice of broadcasters.  I am also happy that procedures have been put in place under section 18 (1) (a) and that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is in existence.  If individuals are aggrieved there are ample mechanisms for them to act on.</P>

      <P>I supported the decision to remove the ban under section 31 as it was the correct one.  It has revealed Sinn Féin as the simplistic, antidemocratic grouping that it is.  Do the Minister and the Department have any role in monitoring the operation of the guidelines in place both by RTE and the Independent Radio and Television Commission as regards the protection of the security of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation places responsibility for the guidelines which the Deputy was interested in, in the case of RTE, on the Authority.  In the case of the independent sector under the 1988 legislation the guidelines are clearly the responsibility of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Independent Radio and Television Commission report to me, under the 1988 legislation, and RTE, under the 1960 legislation which has been revised on a number of occasions.  I review the operation of the guidelines.  I am happy that the provisions of the legislation in each case are adequate.  When this matter was raised by way of motion in Private Members' time last February I said at column 234, Volume 438 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also make it clear that I do not see myself as some kind of watchdog vetting every news and current <Col N="32" /> affairs programme to search out possible abuses of these new freedoms.  The RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission have been established by Acts of the Oireachtas as the custodians of the airways on behalf of the nation.  They have been given statutory responsibilities and duties and are autonomous in these areas.  They, in their wisdom, have drawn up guidelines on the operation of the relevant legislative provisions. It is the responsibility of both organisations to monitor and ensure adherence to their guidelines.  It will also be their responsibility to amend or revise them if they consider it necessary to do so in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission is charged with the investigation of complaints of alleged breaches of the legislation and it is important to stress this point &mdash; the commission will investigate alleged breaches of legislation rather than guidelines.  The kernel of the matter is that, in a democracy, the Government should not have to intervene in the detail of broadcast programmes, particularly news and current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>That is still my opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's point that he is not a watchdog, as the Minister who opened the trap door, from the point of view of seeking a balance in broadcasting, is he concerned that a party with 5 per cent electoral support can sometimes command between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of air time in television interviews, news and current affairs programmes?  This was illustrated in a survey carried recently by a Sunday newspaper.  This does not represent fair or balanced broadcasting from the point of view of highlighting the views held by the majority of people.  Does the Minister have any role in ensuring that this disproportionate coverage is brought to an end?</P>

As a Member who is interested in bringing to an end the appalling events in Northern Ireland, a longer sustained interest and critical view of events in Northern Ireland is now possible because of the changes brought about as a result of the recommendation I made to the Government.  It was not an easy discussion; I remember it being debated in the House and I accept the sincerity of those who offered views but on reflection I am convinced it was the correct recommendation to make to the Government.</P>

If so, I suggest he is living in cloud cuckoo land.  Will the Minister indicate whether the Cabinet has considered to date the implications, in the current environment, of the ban under section 31 remaining removed?  Does the Minister believe that the ordinary people of this country will regard it as acceptable in the run up to the European elections that at 9.25 p.m. we will have a soft focus party political broadcast by Sinn Féin perhaps immediately following a report in the 9 o'clock news on the latest atrocity committed by the IRA in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>I would like to have an opportunity to reply to his question, even to my constituency colleague.  The decision on the renewal or non-renewal of the order under section 31 was recommended to the Government on the basis of criteria I described, the right to information, what should an order under broadcasting legislation seek to do and what effect it has in practice.  I do not believe there is a whit of evidence that suggests that my recommendation to Government to end the ban under section 31 has increased either violence or support for violence.  I very much resent those who quite clearly know better but have sought to blur the suggestion. Deputy Shatter has suggested that one of the effects of my recommendation to Government would be to sell soft-focus violence.  To attribute such a motivation when he knows well the background to the change in the order is outrageous.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's intention of not wishing to interfere with the detail of broadcasting on RTE but I remind him that he retains, under the broadcasting Act, the power to oblige RTE to broadcast anything the Government wishes to have broadcast which is very much a power to intervene in the detail of broadcasting.  Is the Minister, who said he is satisfied with the lifting of the ban, monitoring the operation of the guidelines by the Independent Radio and Television Commission and RTE, and if not how does he come to the conclusion that the lifting of the ban is satisfactory?  If the Minister is not monitoring the operation of these guidelines, as he is obliged to do in order to ensure that the law is complied with, how can he proceed to ensure that the guidelines are operating in a way that protects the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy De Rossa for his approach to this matter.  I know he was supportive of my recommendation on the non-renewal of the order under section 31 and I appreciate that.  Effectively, under section 18 (1) <Col N="37" /> (a) of the broadcasting legislation, the guidelines are the work of the Authority and the Authority's autonomy is crucially dependent on it having the right to compose such guidelines.  It would obviously be a matter beyond RTE's competence if there were clear breaches of section 18 and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission could deal with them and there are other mechanisms by which people could raise this issue.  If I felt there was a regular breach of a section of the broadcasting legislation it would certainly be my concern as the Minister with overall responsibility for broadcasting.  It is very important to understand that everything for which one has responsibility is governed by statute and in the case of RTE the autonomy of the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission has to be respected.  It is managed by a review of the operation of the statute rather than by interference and that is the difference between it and other regimes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept, as Deputy Bradford put it so succinctly, that he is the person who opened the traps and that it was on his considered judgment the Government made the decision not to renew the ban under section 31 of the broadcasting Act?  He is seen by the citizens as having some responsibility for the operation of broadcasting following the lifting of that ban and, whatever about the niceties of the procedure he outlined to the House, the procedures that apply to nomal law abiding citizens and not seen to apply to spokespersons for terrorist organisations. The Minister must take from this debate that he has some responsibility for the future operation of broadcasting in the absence of the ban.  He must take some interest in monitoring broadcasting in the absence of the ban.  He must take some interest in monitoring broadcasting in the absence of the ban because it is being said up and down the country that an undue amount of time is being given to spokespersons for Sinn Féin since the ban was lifted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the order was in place Members had the option to table a motion calling for it to be extended. They decided not to do that.  I decided to review the matter over a year in the light of the criteria I mentioned and to come to a conclusion.  I did that and I made a recommendation.  I absolutely reject the suggestion that it was in any sense incitement or whatever.  I stress that under section 18 it is an offence to invite people to commit a crime, not to speak of an invitation to commit terrorism.  Many of those who have sought to whip up needless fears on this matter have, in fact, chosen to ignore that there are proscribed organisations and that it would be an offence to invite persons to commit a crime.  Extending beyond that under other legislation it is a crime to incite people to commit acts of hatred and so on.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil sa chúnamh de £3.50 a íocann an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta ach cuid den teacht isteach a bhíonn le fáil ag mná tí na Gaeltachta. Mar is eol don Teach agus don Teachta McGinley, íocann tuismitheoirí na ndaltaí taí táillí le húdaráis na gcoláistí, agus íocann na coláistí costais lóistín leis na mná tí as na táillí sin.  Mar sin de, níl sé ceart a rá gurb é seo an t-aon teacht isteach atá ag na mná tí, mar tá teacht isteach eile acu ó údaráis na gcoláistí as na táillí a íocann na tuismitheoirí leis na coláistí.  Go dtí an bhliain 1990 bhí £3.10 á íoc in aghaidh an lae ó 1986 leis na mná tí.  Is mise a d'ardaigh é seo go dtí £3.50 ó £3.10.  Ar ndóigh, ní hionann sin agus a rá nach bhfuil i gceist ach ardú ag teacht ó sholáthar mo Roinnse.  Sa bhliain 1990 d'fhreastáil 18,725 dalta ar na coláistí, ach tá sé sin ardaithe anois go dtí 23,110, ardú de tuairim is 25 faoin gcéad thar an tréimhse sin agus i mbliana arís tá súil agam go mbeidh ardú i líon na ndaltaí a bheidh ag freastal ar na coláistí Ghaeilge. Tá ardú sa soláthar laistigh den Roinn. Ach, ar ndóigh, beidh mé féin agus an tAire ag plé na ceiste seo i mbliana agus <Col N="40" /> beimid sásta an cheist seo a chíoradh nuair a bheidh meastacháin na bliana 1995 á bplé.</P>

Tá tithe á gceannach agus á gcur in oiriúint agus costais mhóra ar na mná tí. Nuair a chuimhnítear go bhfaigheann gach aicme eile den phobal, an earnáil phoiblí, an earnáil phríobháideach, daoine ag brath ar íocaíochtaí ón Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh, ardú bliantúil &mdash; fiú amháin Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí is bocht an rud go bhfuil mná tí ag fáil an liúntas céanna ó 1990 i leith.  Má thuigim an tAire Stáit i gceart níl sé ar intinn aon ardú a thabhairt i mbliana ach an oiread. An bhféadfadh sé a insint cá mhéad a chosnódh sé ardú de 50 pingin sa lá a thabhairt do na mná tí, nó an bhfuil an t-eolas sin aige.</P>

Caithfidh sé aontú liom go bhfuil an costas an-ard faoi láthair ar na tuismitheoirí a gcuid páistí a chur chun na Gaeltachta de dheasca na gcostas atá ann agus tá sé dochreidte nach mbeadh an Rialtas sásta fiú amháin an 50 pingin d'ardú atá á iarraidh ag an Teacht McGinley a thabhairt.  Creidim féin go mba chóir go mbeadh punt nó níos mó de mhéadú ann.  Is beag an tsuim airgid atá i gceist mura bhfuil ach 20,000 dalta ag freastal ar an nGaeltacht faoi láthair. An aontódh an tAire go mba chóir go mbeadh polasaí aige na figiúirí a ardú go dtí 100,000 páiste chun a chur ar a gcumas <Col N="41" /> freastal ar an nGaeltacht sa samhradh chun a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus a fheabhsú i dtimpeallacht thaitneamhach, rud a bheadh lena leas ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Is iontach an tairbhe a bhaineann na páistí seo as freastal ar na coláistí Ghaeilge agus cuidíonn sé le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an chultúir go mbeadh líofact Ghaeilge ag na bpáistí tar éis mí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht ag freastal a choláiste samhraidh.  Ní aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire, a chuireann in iúl go bhfuil sé sásta le líon na ndaltaí.  Ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó daltaí i gceist ach tá an costas róard, go háirithe má théann beirt nó triúr ón aon chlann amháin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an Stát sásta i bhfad níos mó cabhrach airgid a thabhairt, in ionad bheith chomh suarach sin faoi arduithe.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Mar a dúirt mé, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, tá méadú suntasach tagtha ar an uimhir.  Sa bhliain 1980 chuaigh 16,868 go dtí an Ghaeltacht; anuraidh, bhí an uimhir chomh hard le 23,110 &mdash; sin ardú de 40 faoin gcéad thar an tréimhse sin agus tá a fhios ag an Teachta agus an Teach go raibh am ann, ag deireadh na n-ochtóidí, nuair a bhí uasteorainn leis an líon daltaí.  Sin an riail a bhí ann ag an am sin agus bhí mé féin, agus is dócha an dá Theachta eile a labhair anseo glan i gcoinne sin.  Má tá éileamh fá choinne áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht ba mhaith liomsa amach anseo go mbeadh suas le 100,000 dalta ag iarraidh freastal ar na coláistí sin.  Ní dóigh go gcuirfeadh ardú de 50 pingin i gcóir gach dalta go mór le líon na ndaltaí.  Níl uasteorainn ar bith ansin, mar is féidir le 25,000 nó 30,000 dalta breise freastal ar na coláistí samhraidh agus maidir le soláthar na Roinne, beidh an Rialtas, an tAire agus an Roinn sásta an t-airgead breise a chur ar fáil.  Go hachomair, aontaím leis an Teachta Molloy, cé chomh tábhachtach is atá na coláistí seo ó thaobh chúrsaí geilleagair na Gaeltachta agus cé chomh fíorthábhachtach is atá siad maidir leis na mná tí. Is cinnte go bhfuil a fhios seo ag an Techta Molloy os rud é go raibh sé ina bhall den Rialtas nuair a bhí fadhbanna a bhain le <Col N="42" /> teacht isteach na mná tí faoi chaibidil go háirithe i gcás na Roinne Leasa Shóisialaigh, nuair a cuireadh reachtaíocht tríd an Dáil nach gcuirfí an t-ioncam ó na coláistí samhraidh san áireamh.  B'shin céim ar aghaidh agus ghabh deacrachtaí lei ach aontaím freisin go bhfuil sé tábhachtach daltaí óga seo a chur chun na Gaeltachta, an áit is fearr, is cinnte, chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus iad sáite sa aíocht Ghaelach.  Ach beimid sásta amharc ar an cheist seo agus gcuirfear cás mhná tí na Gaeltachta san áireamh nuair a bheidh meastacháin na bliana 1995 á bplé.</P>

Mura bhfuil post an-mhaith ag na tuismitheoirí tá sé an-deacair íoc as na costais sin.  Tá an fhadhb sin ann agus níor fhreagair an tAire an cheist sin ar chor ar bith.  An aontaíonn sé gur fadhb é sin agus go bhféadfaí suas le 100,000 dalta bheith ag freastal ar na coláistí samhraidh seo dá mbeadh na tuismitheoirí in ann íoc as seo.

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Ní ghlacaim leis gur constaic é sin.  Cuir i gcás go dtabharfaí ardú de 50 pingin, sin £10 le haghaidh gach dalta in aghaidh na bliana.  Fiú amháin nuair nach raibh ardú ar bith ann, cuir i gcás idir an bhliain 1988 agus 1989, bhí laghdú ann an t-am sin i líon na ndaltaí ó 16,868 go dtí 16,538, ach ina dhiaidh sin nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis an uasteorainn agus leis an riail, riail nár aontaigh mé leis, b'éigean do na coláistí cloí leis na huimhreacha a leagadh síos an bhliain roimhe sin, ach tháinig ardú suntasach ina dhiaidh sin, 40 faoin gcéad ó 1988 go dtí 1993.  Ní aontaím leis an Teachta gur constaic é sin, dá gcuirfí ardú suntasach ar fáil go mbeadh suas le 100,000 dalta ag iarraidh dul chun na Gaeltachta.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta McGinley i dtosach, ní hé seo an <Col N="43" /> t-aon teacht isteach atá ag na mná tí.  Bhí an Teachta McGinley ag déanamh cáis do na mná tí agus bhí an Teachta Molloy ag déanamh cáis do na coláistí sa Ghaeltacht.

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 19 agus 22 le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that I have already put in place an integrated package of policy measures to promote the Irish film and television production industry, including the re-establishment <Col N="44" /> of Bord Scannán na hÉireann; the enactment of broadcasting legislation to link RTE commissionings with the independent production sector; the establishment of a new television service, Telefís na Gaeilge; significant additional tax incentives; continued support by An Chomhairle Ealaíon for film organisations and film and video awards; support from Údarás na Gaeltachta for the establishment of audiovisual production companies in the Gaeltacht; participation in the EU MEDIA Programme; and funding by the Government towards EURIMAGES, the Council of Europe's film fund.</P>
    <P>Given this integrated package of policy initiatives, the Deputies can rest assured that I remain open to pursue further initiatives to remove any remaining obstacles to the full development of a vibrant and sustainable film and television production industry in this country.  To this end, I have established a new committee, named STATCOM, comprising senior officials of the State agencies dealing with the industry and my own Department.  STATCOM has identified a number of issues requiring possible further attention by the State sector, including the unmet training requirements of the industry; the need or otherwise for a national film commission to promote Ireland as a location for facilities in the State; banking facilities and film distribution structures.  STATCOM is the forum which will advise me over time as to whether new initiatives are required to address the range and level of technical facilities available to the industry and I will give careful consideration, to any proposals particularly those made by the committee on this subject.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to inform the House that the Finance Bill, 1994, published yesterday contains a new provision aimed at indigenous low budget film projects.  It adopts the current £1,050,000 limit under section 35 legislation and for a one year trial period will enable companies to make a share investment of up to £350,000 in one or more films and to dispose of such shares after 12 months. <Col N="45" /> That is a major concession as hitherto companies had to invest the full amount of £1,050,000 before exiting after 12 months.  That measure was somewhat discriminatory against low budget Irish films because investors had to make an investment for a three year period.  The new regime of films such as &ldquo;Broken Harvest&rdquo; made by the O'Callaghans, Cathal Black's &ldquo;Korea&rdquo;, and Ed Guiney's &ldquo;Ailsa&rdquo; will benefit.  The new measure will significantly assist the native film industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the enormous contribution made by the Minister since he took up office to the development of the Irish film industry.  I compliment the industry for the manner in which it responded to the increased investment.  I congratulate Irish film entries recently nominated for awards which brought great credit to this country. Will the Minister agree there is a need to improve technical facilities in the industry because, recently, a film commenced here could not be completed because of a lack of technical facilities and had to be completed in Pinewood Studios in England?  Recently, the eminent film critic, Barry Norman, when speaking about provisions for the industry pointed to the lack of technical facilities here.  Will the Minister address this matter with the same urgency as he addressed other aspects of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that during the last 12 months more feature films were completed in Ireland than in neighbouring Britain.  I appreciate the Deputy recognises that great advances have been made.  STATCOM will advise on funding and the promotion of Ireland as a film making location and investigate distribution and training areas.  In STATCOM, two people employed by FÁS are studying the requirements of film audio-visual and other agencies are examining training requirements.  The remark about the lack of technical facilities and capacity, particularly in the post-production phase, would not have come to light if films were not awaiting completion. <Col N="46" /> Ardmore, our principal facility, is an important location and is fully booked for May, June and July this year. That should not pre-empt examining that facility and other facilities to see if they can be expanded.  I see no difficulty in responding to this matter as quickly as I have to other initiatives.  With the establishment of STATCOM the mechanism is in place to identify areas of need and different agencies are involved in the areas of training, finance, distribution and location promotion.  I will not hesitate to act on any suggestions for improvements.  I am pleased that an announcement yesterday by my colleague the Minister for Finance in respect of the forthcoming Finance Bill will primarily benefit Irish producers.  Producers of films such as &ldquo;Broken Harvest&rdquo; will qualify.  Up to three companies will be able to co-ordinate finances and lower budget films from our indigenous film sector will be assisted by that welcome initiative.  I thank my colleagues in Government for the support it has given to the film industry.</P>

    <P>I have recently established an interim board for the National Museum with the specific task of advising me on the future direction of the National Museum, including, as a first priority, the Collins Barracks project.</P>
    <P>Separately, an inter-departmental group, comprising officials from my Department, the National Museum, the Departments of Finance, Defence and Tourism and Trade and the Office of Public Works are meeting to determine the best way to progress the project.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance indicated that £10 million would be allocated from Exchequer sources to facilitate this project.  In addition it is expected that further significant moneys can also be made available from Structural Funds.  The interim board has two tasks.  Its first priority is to provide me with a detailed evaluation of the proposals of the inter-departmental group, together with any recommendation the board may wish to put forward.  In addition, I have asked the interim board to provide me with an assessment of the impact of these proposals on the current administrative structures of the museum and running costs, including additional staffing, security, maintenance, etc.  On the assumption that the £10 million allocated in this year's budget should be spent by the end of the year, I have asked the interim board for its views on the most cost effective use of this money.</P>
    <P>With regard to its second task, which relates to the future direction of the museum generally, the interim board is aware of my commitment to remedying the present imbalance between Dublin and the regions with regard to archaeological collections of national importance. It is also aware of my intention to bring forward legislative proposals to <Col N="48" /> establish an autonomous board for the museum.  With these aspects in mind, I have asked the interim board to advise me on how the National Museum might achieve its full potential as the primary repository of our artistic and cultural heritage and to prepare a five year strategic plan addressing in particular: the housing of appropriate elements of the museum's collections, including the National Folklife Collection at venues outside Dublin, having regard to the Collins Barracks development; staff numbers and structures necessary for the museum, and a comprehensive strategy for identifying and securing non-Exchequer sources of funding so as to achieve a reasonable balance between direct Exchequer funding and other sources of funding.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for the names of members of the interim board to be circulated in the form of a tabular statement.</P>
    <P>Statement.</P>
    <P>The membership of the Interim Board of the National Museum is as follows:</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's response that, apart from the visitors' board of the National Museum who advises him on the museum, work is well advanced on putting on a statutory footing a board for the National Museum, there is also an inter-departmental group dealing with this matter? The Minister has also seen fit in recent weeks to appoint an interim board to further advise him on the future of the National Museum and the Collins Barracks project.  Does the Minister accept that to have four groups advising him on the future of the National Museum appears to most observers to be excessive? One of the biggest problems of the National Museum in recent years is that it has been starved of finance.  We would be well advised to expedite work on the development of Collins Barracks rather than appointing additional quangos and groups on the project.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the spirit of the Deputy's supplementary question.  The Boards of Visitors is a structure put in place for a purpose and it has a particular role in the National Museum.  It is my intention to put the museums on a modern basis to enable their directors and boards of management to run the institutions to the end of this century and into the next.  We need to advance the Collins Barracks project and we should not wait until legislation has been passed.  I would have thought that the establishment of an interim board of professionals who will report not only on the specific task of the Collins Barracks project, on which it will report within a month, which even by the private business sector would be a good example, but also on the other issues I have listed, on which it will report within three months, is a wise and prudent way of spending the public's money.  There has been a marvellous public response to this significant change in provision for the museum, which is our major repository, our major cultural institution.</P>

      <P>Like other Members of the House, I was deeply shocked by the terrible events in Rwanda in recent days and profoundly saddened by the largescale loss of life.  Our information is that there was a total of eight Irish citizens in Rwanda when the violence broke out on 7 April.  Six of them were in the capital, Kigali, and two missionaries were in outlying areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Ireland does not have a diplomatic or consular mission in Rwanda, we immediately contacted the Governments of two of our EU partners, Belgium and <Col N="51" /> France, and asked them to make every effort to evacuate our citizens with their own.  Both Governments readily acceded to our request and I take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for their helpful and co-operative approach. Thanks to the assistance of the two Governments concerned, six of the eight Irish people have now been evacuated: three yesterday &mdash; two to Nairobi, Kenya, one to Goma, Zaire &mdash; and three to Paris this morning.</P>
    <P>Of the two remaining Irish citizens I understand that one, who wished to remain in Kigali in a voluntary capacity as long as possible to help with the evacuation arrangements, is being evacuated later today.  The last remaining Irish person is a nun who is a member of a Belgian religious order in Mushiushiro, some distance from Kigali.  It has not been possible for us to contact her direct but the Belgian authorities are seeking to do so; we will remain in very close contact with the Belgian authorities to try to get the fullest information about this person and to ensure her safety.</P>

In addition to the efforts made on behalf of Irish citizens in Rwanda, what steps has the Irish Government taken to raise at European Union and United Nations level the question of the massacres in that country?  Is there a proposal from Ireland or elsewhere to give a peace-keeping force a mandate to deal with the problem there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the concern of our European Union partners about the massacre and difficulties in Rwanda in recent days and we will raise the matter with our European Union colleagues.  There are no proposals before the Government at present on a peace-keeping force, but as in all cases, any request from the United Nations will be assessed on a case by case basis.  Such a request has not been <Col N="52" /> received to date, if it is it will get urgent attention.</P>

Is the Department of Foreign Affairs considering suggestions about ways in which volunteer or missionary workers who may wish to work in African countries can have information on the safety of those countries?

In his earlier reply he said no request had yet been received by the Irish Government for a peace-keeping force or for participation in a peace-keeping force.  I understand there are 2,000 UN troops in Rwanda at present but that their mandate is to monitor the implementation of the accords agreed last August between the rebels and the then legitimate Government of Rwanda.  Does the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs intend to have raised at the United Nations the question of whether the troops already in Rwanda can be given a mandate to intervene to stop the massacre currently <Col N="53" /> taking place?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the five questions together.</P>
      <P>The dispute at Irish Rail arises from the rejection by the two unions concerned, SIPTU and the NBRU, of proposals on pay and productivity.  The issues involved were discussed by the parties over a period of 16 months.  The final proposals were worked out in intensive discussions held over a three week period from 7 to 27 February under the chairmanship of a senior industrial relations officer of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals involve redundancies, redeployment and changes in work practices. Among the changes proposed are one-person operation of trains, the introduction of new ticket issuing machines and a limit on the allowances paid to drivers.  In return for the changes, a package was offered which includes rises of £4.85 per week and 3 per cent.  Other specific payments on offer include a bonus of 20.5 per cent to drivers for one <Col N="55" /> person operation of freight and passenger services.</P>
    <P>The proposals were put by the unions to members, without recommendation, and were rejected following a ballot. Management commenced implementation of the proposals with effect from 5 April.  A number of workers who were rostered for training on the new systems refused to participate and were suspended. As a result of a ballot in favour of strike action, the unions served strike notice to take effect from Saturday 16 April.</P>
    <P>Deputies have legitimately asked what can be done to avert the threatened strike and ensuing disruption to the travelling public and the wider business community. I want to take this opportunity to inform the House of the Government's concern that rail services will be in jeopardy from next Saturday.  However, contingency plans are being put in place by Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, has assured me that his Department is in close contact with Irish Rail to ensure that, in the event of interruptions to rail services, the company will make every effort to arrange for alternative services for its customers.  Continued normal operations by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann should, of course, greatly assist in reducing disruption and inconvenience to the travelling public arising from any stoppage of rail services.</P>
    <P>I share with Deputies on all sides of the House the disappointment that normal and sensible industrial relations practices and procedures have not yet led to a resolution of this dispute.  It is unfortunate to say the least that the lengthy and intensive efforts of the Labour Relations Commission have not yet borne fruit.</P>
    <P>Some of the questions to which I am now replying call for my intervention or that of the Labour Relations Commission. As I stated previously in this House and elsewhere, I am loath to intervene in individual disputes.  Ministerial intervention, by its very nature, takes <Col N="56" /> responsibility from the parties involved to reach their own settlements, which they must ultimately and inevitably reach themselves.  Intervention also raises expectations &mdash; those of the public and of business and of the parties in dispute. In this instance, I am obliged to say that the responsibility for their actions rests with the parties, management of Irish Rail and the two unions.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment, either in my reply or on supplementaries, on the specifics of this dispute.  However, the full range of the State's industrial relations support mechanisms remain available to assist the parties in reaching a resolution and avoiding strike action.  The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are monitoring the situation closely.  Management and trade unions at Irish Rail are fully aware that it is open to them to refer the matter to the commission again, or indeed to the court, if they have any further proposals which could avert the strike.</P>
    <P>I ask the parties to give the most careful consideration to the consequences of the proposed strike.  This dispute is one which will ultimately be settled by the parties themselves, with or without third party assistance.  I therefore, urge both sides to explore, as a matter of extreme urgency, ways and means of reopening meaningful dialogue without the necessity of a damaging strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister has said he will not comment on the specifics of the dispute.  I also note that his position in Opposition in assisting me in calling for ministerial intervention seems to have changed.  Accepting those parameters for my supplementary, I put it to the Minister that, regardless of the history of this dispute, the perception of the unions now is that the management of Iarnród Éireann is seeking to impose a wide range of changes on the workforce. What is the Minister's response to the <Col N="57" /> unions' perception that the Labour Relations Commission is not offering to intervene in this dispute, that, whatever its historical contribution, it is standing back at the behest and instruction of the Government, that this hard line by the management will be fully supported by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the Labour Relations Commission intervenes, it is the position of the unions that if the suspensions are lifted, the all-out strike due to commence on Saturday morning can be avoided?  All that is required is for the Minister to call on the Labour Relations Commission to intervene. That will be met by a positive response from the two main unions concerned.</P>

      <P>The Labour Relations Commission is acting under no such instructions as indicated by the Deputy. It has not been told to stand back.  It is available and it has been involved, as the Deputy well knows, over a long time in this dispute.  It is available should either the unions or management seek its assistance. I have made every effort to ensure that it will remain available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, if I or the Minister for Transport, Energy <Col N="58" /> and Communications, were to give an instruction to the Labour Relations Commission to intervene and call both sides back to the table, there would not be an unreasonable expectation that something additional to what was negotiated could be available to either side.  That would be a misleading impression to convey and, therefore, after 16 months of considerable and detailed negotiation both sides are well aware of the constraints and the parameters within which they have to operate.  Any such intervention at this stage could and would be misleading and misinterpreted and would not bring about an ultimate resolution of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in February the two parties were close to an agreement and that there is now a huge gulf between them?  A total of 60,000 Dubliners use the DART system every day, 20,000 use the mainline service and 17,000 tonnes of freight is transported by the rail system each day. Must the public endure the pain while the two sides come to their senses?  Is the Minister saying to the House that he is going to sit on his hands while that goes on?  Why did the Government abandon the code of practice, published by his predecessors, which was to prevent such disputes disrupting essential services only a few months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the second question posed by the Deputy, the Government has not abandoned the code of practice.  It remains my earnest desire that it be accepted by both sides and as it is a code of practice its value will only become a reality if it is accepted by both sides.  I bitterly regret that it has not yet been so accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the public suffering if there is a disruption of these services while negotiations continue, the public <Col N="59" /> does not need to suffer.  There is no reason both sides cannot recommence negotiations and I am ready to facilitate the resumption of them on the clear understanding that no expectations should be falsely raised by any action that might be taken by me, the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to contingency plans in the event of this strike taking place.  I regret there is no contingency plan to prevent it taking place.  A strike at this time would be a disaster for the workforce, the company and the public.  If the company agreed to voluntarily lift the suspensions, it would represent a major development and the unions could agree to lift the strike notice.  The people directly involved in the negotiations, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, could intervene and resolve this dispute. That is what they are being paid to do and it is up to us to ensure that that happens before this strike which could have disastrous consequences takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in this respect and I want to assure him of the Government's support for the modernisation of the national rail service. Indeed, no previous Government has been so prepared to commit scarce public resources of taxpayers' money to improve the Irish rail system.  Also there is the need to modernise work practices and adapt to new technologies.  That has been the subject of 16 months of negotiation and discussion.  I regret that what appeared to have been arrived at in February has not been either recommended by the unions or accepted by the workers involved.  I urge both sides to resume their discussions to see if they can get back to where they were in February without bringing about a strike in order to achieve that.  They were able to carry on negotiations over the 16 month period without recourse to industrial action.  I do not believe industrial action is necessary <Col N="60" /> to find a solution to the modernisation of Irish railways that will lead in turn to the massive investment of public moneys in that company.</P>

What will happen next week if 60,000 extra cars pour into this city and what will happen to the 17,000 tonnes of freight per day, including mineral ore and cement, which are important employment creating materials?  What are the details of the contingency plans that will protect us in four days time if the strike goes ahead?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has asked that question because I hope it will help to focus the minds of the parties who are central to this dispute.  The freight section of Iarnród Éireann is not free of competition and it is in danger of losing its customers to other modes of transport if it is unable to provide a reliable service. I suggest, therefore, that it is very much in the interests of the workers in Iarnród Éireann to ensure they maintain their customer base and improve the service to it.  They should do so while, at the same time, negotiating whatever changes have to take place.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill before the Easter recess I had explained the reason I was deleting subsections (4) and (5), the effect of which would be to leave the law as it stood.  I further explained that difficulties had arisen in the past. The requirement of the medical bureau to send a copy of the certificate to the person who provided the specimen gave rise to those difficulties.  While it is not a statutory requirement, the bureau by <Col N="178" /> registered post, issues all results of analysis. If a certificate issued in this way fails to be delivered, it is returned to the local post office for a few days in case it is called for and, if not collected, is returned to the bureau.  From the bureau it is then sent to the Garda Síochána for delivery by hand.  Up to 10 per cent of all certificates issued by registered post fail to be delivered.  For example, in 1991 when a total of 7,806 specimens were received, approximately 830 envelopes were returned to the bureau as being undelivered by registered post.  The bureau maintain that in most of these cases the reason is that the individuals concerned, knowing the contents of the letter, simply refuse to sign for or accept delivery.</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsections (4) and (5) were originally to overcome this difficulty and to do away with the procedure where undelivered certificates are subsequently delivered by hand by the Garda.  These subsections were intended to provide that proof of postage of the copy of the certificate to the person from whom the specimen was taken would be sufficient compliance with the requirement in subsection (3).  Legal advice however, indicated that the new subsections would not be advisable because they seem to confer a new requirement on the bureau to prove delivery and as a result could create a new problem for the bureau.  We are allowing the existing law to stand and deleting the subsections which were originally intended to deal with a problem, which arising from recent court decisions are no longer necessary.</P>

      <P>It makes an ass of the law when technicalities, such as those outlined by the Minister, could mean that somebody who has committed a serious offence could not be brought before the courts.  For that reason I support the measures he intends to put in place to ensure that those who should face the court will do so.  I sincerely hope, as a result of the deletion of these two subsections, abuses will not continue.  The Minister should examine ways and means of introducing a direct delivery service from the bureau for which people would <Col N="179" /> pay.  Unfortunately, because of long delays in our postal system many of us await mail which does not arrive for many days.  I do not know how registered post is affected.  On issues such as this we should not interfere in any way or make it easier for people to avoid prosecution.  For that reason I do not oppose the Minister's suggestion, but it is unfortunate that a loophole may remain.  If that is the case some other method of delivery of the results of a specimen should be considered so as to avoid any possible contention in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that approximately 10 per cent of certificates posted were returned as not being received.  He is now deleting the provision he had proposed in that regard and intends maintaining the existing situation. However, he has not clarified what proof will be necessary of receipt of the certificate.  The Minister may have given a full explanation in the Seanad but he has not done so here.  Many people in the legal profession were noted for their expertise in dealing with the drink driving provisions of the Road Traffic Act and made a good living out of it.  This Bill will not be long on the Statute Book before they pore over it seeking new loopholes to benefit their guilty clients.  I would be reassured if the Minister gave a fuller explanation as to what procedures will apply if these subsections are dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation on the bureau is to forward a copy of the certificate to the person who provided the specimen.  The practice is to send that by registered post.  The obligation is simply to forward the copy and the High Court has held this does not confer an absolute obligation on the bureau to ensure it is received.  A provision seeking that proof of postage is deemed to be proof of delivery is unnecessary.  I accept the Deputy's point that legislation in regard to road traffic law has been found to be defective <Col N="180" /> on very flimsy grounds.  We have tried to close off every loophole in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In May a High Court decision influenced my final thinking on the matter.  It required the bureau to forward the copy. It is not necessary in law for the bureau to prove in all cases that the specimen has been delivered but in the normal legal process the defendant has the right to seek and receive that copy in court if he has not already received it.  In the earlier provisions we set out to use a new measure of proof and we are now satisfied on the basis of current law and High court decisions that it is safer to leave the law as it presently stands.  It is precisely because of the point made by Deputy Barrett that I do not want to insert a provision in this Bill which may contain the possibility of opening up a loophole.</P>

      <P>Section 21: In page 18, between lines 18 and 19, the following subsection inserted:</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Section 22: In page 18, lines 23 to 26 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the person to pay to the court a contribution towards the costs and expenses incurred by the Bureau in the performance of its functions not exceeding&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 22 which provides for payments to be made by persons convicted of drink driving offences.  The section in the Bill as passed by the Dáil provided for payments of costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offences.  This amendment limits the requirement to a contribution towards the expenses of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  During the Seanad debate a number of concerns were expressed in relation to this section.  One of the fears expressed was that the costs of prosecutions generally could be levied against a convicted person and that excessive costs could be involved.  I stressed that my only concern was to recoup the cost associated with running the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The Seanad agreed to the amendment which provides that where a person is convicted, the court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for not so doing, order the person to pay a contribution towards the costs of the bureau subject to a maximum to be prescribed. The amount of the contribution will be a matter for the court to decide.</P>
    <P>It was always my intention to relate this to the costs of the medical bureau but perhaps the language used in the original design of the Bill left open to doubt the possibility that the court could, in certain circumstances, consider other elements of costs and we are now limiting it to costs associated with the medical bureau.  The allocation in my Department for the medical bureau is £500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the average cost of carrying out a test on a specimen?  The amount of money should be indicated in the legislation.  The amendment states the person should pay to the court a contribution towards the costs and <Col N="182" /> expenses.  That could vary from one court to the next and questions could be asked, such as, the basis on which costs are decided.  If the cost of a test is £50 presumably the only other costs involved would be postage or transport.  A figure should be inserted into the legislation which could be altered with the rate of inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The court waive the payment in certain circumstances.  A maximum amount will be set by regualtion but there will be no minimum. Without prescribing it in law, I should indicate to the House that it will range somewhere between £60 and £80 on average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the court having discretion in this kind of instance. Everyone should have to pay the contribution if that is what is set down in law.  I do not object to it being paid by instalment.  If it is assumed a person has means they will have to pay whereas another person with a sob story would not have to pay and I object to that. The provision should apply to everyone. People do not drive unless they can afford to do so and the court should not be given discretion in this area.  There should be provision for payment by instalment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us share the view that we would like a degree of uniformity in the application of the law but it is quite refreshing at this stage of the debate to get some support for what might be called mandatory thinking in terms of obliging the court to do certain things.  The Deputy will appreciate that I came under fire regarding a number of provisions where I sought to make it mandatory on the courts to operate this law in a particular way.  In the circumstances we are as well to leave it to the discretion of the court and prescribe the maximum amount in regulations.  I have listened to many arguments in both Houses asking me to leave matters to the courts in all cases; perhaps my views have been swayed over the past ten months because I have conceded a number of <Col N="183" /> amendments giving back discretion to the courts but in this instance only a few Acts prescribe for payments of this kind against offenders.  Perhaps as we start the process of the offender paying a contribution towards the damage he or she has done we should at least leave it more to the discretion of the courts having set a maximum but no minimum and the provision whereby in special circumstances the payment should not be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the courts should have discretion in deciding the amount but I sympathise with the point made by Deputy Barrett that there is often great frustration when a person is convicted of a serious offence and the fine imposed by the court does not seem to fit the crime.  In this section the Minister intends to set a maximum figure and the judge will have discretion to require the convicted person to pay expenses up to the maximum.  The section states that the maximum shall stand prescribed.  In what section is the amount prescribed? What criteria does the Minister apply in deciding the amount to prescribe and will the matter be reviewed annually?</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No.13:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Section 26: In page 20, line 29, &ldquo;Where&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;Subject to subsection (5) (b) of this section, where&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments being discussed together proposes a number of changes to the provisions governing consequential, or mandatory disqualification orders to give a certain level of discretion to the courts in applying the provisions.</P>
    <P>While a large number of amendments are being discussed together, there are only three main changes contained in amendments Nos. 14, 20 and 24.  The remainder of the amendments are consequential changes, some of a very minor nature.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendments is as follows: where the court is satisfied that special reasons or circumstances exist in individual cases, the court will have power: (a) under amendment No. 14, to decide in the case of any offence, that the requirement to pass a driving test before a licence is returned will not apply; (b) under amendment No. 20, to decide in the case of drink driving offences that a shorter period of disqualification may be imposed on a first offence but not less than one year which is the existing minimum period; (c) under amendment No. 24 in the case of first offences of dangerous driving and uninsured driving, to decide to apply no disqualification or to apply a shorter period.</P>
    <P>I believe these amendments cater fully for any special or mitigating circumstances that may arise in individual cases.</P>
    <P>The principle of consequential disqualification is that the courts must, on conviction of specified offences, impose a period of disqualification from holding a driving licence.  This principle has been an important feature of road traffic legislation for many years and is a very effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>A number of reservations about these provisions has been expressed during the debate in both Houses.  It has been suggested in some quarters that the whole concept should be deleted.  My position on that is abundantly clear.  Mandatory <Col N="185" /> disqualification is not a new concept and I am not prepared to dilute the existing law.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that some of the longer periods of disqualification proposed &mdash; and the application of the principle to first offences of dangerous driving and uninsured driving &mdash; may be excessive; or that there could be cases of technical offences or other special circumstances in individual cases which would not warrant disqualification.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that longer disqualification periods are warranted for drink driving offences; for dangerous driving causing death or injury; and for hit and run offences where death or injury is caused.  I am saisfied also that the principle should apply to dangerous driving and uninsured driving &mdash; both of which are serious offences.</P>
    <P>I accept that special circumstances can arise in individual cases and, accordingly, the amendments propose to give the courts discretion to cater for such special cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with these provisions &mdash; and the very stringent regulations for drink driving &mdash; but it is extraordinary that the court will have discretion not to disqualify somebody who drives a motor vehicle without insurance.  I can understand that disputes may arise on dangerous driving and whether there are mitigating circumstances, for example where somebody is rushing to a hospital, but one is either insured or not, it is black and white.  Too much tolerance is shown to people driving without insurance.  Uninsured drivers cause a great deal of damage to property and injure people. I am aware that the Motor Insurance Bureau covers personal injury claims in cases where somebody has been injured by an uninsured driver but the insurance companies levy the premium on everybody and do not pay it themselves.  The cost of motor insurance for young people is crucifying and some are tempted to drive without insurance.  The higher the cost of insurance the greater the temptation to drive without it.  I do not accept <Col N="186" /> that we should send out a message that driving without insurance is acceptable in certain circumstances.  A person driving without insurance may not cause an accident but too many people blatantly ignore the law.  It is as serious to drive a car without insurance as to drive a car having taken two pints of Smithwicks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed by the Deputy and condemn, in the strongest possible terms, those who drive cars without insurance.  The figure stands at between 6 per cent and 8 per cent.  The overall value of vehicle insurance premia is approximately £500 million per year and the value of claims is in the same bracket.  People who pay insurance must meet the liabilities incurred by those who drive without it. These new provisions should be of help to the Garda and the security forces in securing prosecutions.  For the first time they will have extra powers to deal with uninsured drivers and in certain circumstances will be able to confiscate the car until the insurance is paid.</P>
      <P>In cases involving dangerous driving, hit and run involving death or serious injury and drunken driving there will be no deviation from what is provided for in the Bill.  It was put to me in the Seanad that in special circumstances the court should have discretion.  Some eminent members of the Judiciary have also argued that this should be the case.  The Deputy may take it that mandatory disqualification will be the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>While Members on all sides of the House support that view the amendment which the Minister accepted in the Seanad is reasonable.  The judge is the only person who will hear all the facts in any case.  The courts, therefore, should have discretion and the Minister provides for this in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the great scandals of our time that so many people drive motor vehicles without insurance.  The costs, which run into many millions of pounds, have to be met by law abiding drivers in terms of higher insurance premia and compensation payments.  Premia in this <Col N="187" /> country are substantially higher than in other European Union countries due to the large number of people who drive without insurance.</P>
    <P>When a road traffic Bill was being discussed in the House some years ago I proposed that each vehicle owner should be required to display his insurance certificate on the windscreen with his motor tax disc.  I am pleased that that amendment was accepted and that insurance companies now issue insurance certificates on which the date is clearly visible in large print to members of the Garda Síochána and traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>Travelling to the Dáil from my western constituency I am amazed that so few checks are carried out to establish whether drivers have their vehicles insured and have paid their motor tax.  If the figures are as high as the Minister said, there is little point in tightening the legislation and giving the courts new powers if guilty people will never be brought before them.  I have never understood the reason we tolerated this scandal given that the motorist is penalised heavily.  The cost of motor tax and insurance is exceptionally high and, with other motoring expenses, accounts for an enormous proportion of the ordinary working man's income.  The car is not the luxury it may have been deemed to be 30 to 40 years ago, it is a necessity.  One could not survive without a car in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to inform his colleague that this point was raised during the debate.  It is easy to stand up in this House and ask the Garda to be more active but, given the huge sums of money involved and the financial penalty imposed on law abiding motorists, it is a scandal that we tolerate such a high level of uninsured drivers.  Does the Minister have any figures for the percentage of uninsured drivers to other European Union countries?  Do they tolerate such a high level of uninsured drivers?</P>
    <P>My last appeal resulted in insurance certificates being displayed on the windscreens of motor cars.  I am confident that I will receive a similar response on this <Col N="188" /> occasion and that there will be a crackdown on uninsured drivers.  As we are all aware, certain members in our communities pride themselves on the fact that they do not pay insurance.  Why are they allowed to get away with it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between us on this issue; the number of uninsured drivers is unacceptable.  It would be unfair to give the impression that the Garda is not making a great effort to secure prosecutions.  The number stands at approximately 25,000 per year.  It is almost a culture in some areas and we have to combat it by giving the legislation more teeth so that the Garda will have additional powers in terms of penalties to secure prosecutions and that there will be effective deterrents.</P>
      <P>Earlier Deputy Barrett drew a comparison between a person who consumes an enormous volume of alcoholic drink and a person who takes a couple of drinks and suggested that the same penalty will be applied in all cases.  This is not true; it will be a matter for the courts to decide what fine should be imposed, whether a term of imprisonment should be imposed or whether the number of years should be extended from the point of view of mandatory disqualification.  It is open to the court to decide on the level of fines, on whether or not to imprison, or extend the length of mandatory disqualification. We looked hard at the question of graduating penalties which seemed attractive. However, on the basis of legal advice on the possibility of opening up legal challenge in an area that is proving to be a minefield, I did not go in that direction but accepted the legal advice as being basically sound.  I will convey the views of the House to the Minister for Justice and everything possible will be done to combat non-insured driving which is at an unacceptably high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I gave the wrong impression, I wish to take ten seconds to correct something.  I was making a comparison between a person who drives without insurance and somebody who is <Col N="189" /> convicted of being above the limit as a result of drinking, perhaps, two pints of Smithwicks.  In the latter case the court has no discretion as to whether that person should lose his licence &mdash; the minimum disqualification period is one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The court has a discretion in regard to the length of time of the disqualification from driving.  It can decide whether it is to be for one or two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but a person so convicted must lose his licence whereas in the case of somebody driving without insurance the court does have discretion in regard to disqualification.  I find that difficult to understand.  We should not be sending out a signal that a person who is slightly over the limit will lose his licence while, at the same time, a person who drives without insurance may not necessarily lose his licence.  Driving without insurance is as serious an offence as driving a car while barely over the intoxicated liquor limit.</P>

      <P>Section 33: In page 26, line 16, &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;National Roads Authority&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>These amendments were agreed by the Seanad in view of the enactment of the Roads Act, 1993 and the establishment of the National Roads Authority.  The effect of the amendment is that the local authorities would seek the consent of the NRA instead of the Minister in relation to speed limits and traffic calming measures affecting national roads and motorways.  In view of the general role of the NRA, provided for by the Roads Act, 1993, it is appropriate that these functions should be vested in the authority rather than in the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to be contrary but I do not agree that the Seanad should have passed this amendment.  The legislation provides that the making of speed limits will be a reserved function of elected members and that is the way it should be.  Elected members are answerable to the people and will have to answer if they make a wrong decision.  The making of speed limits should, therefore, be a reserved function.  As these are national roads and the Minister wants to have a common policy on speed limits on them it is reasonable that he should confirm the making of an order relating to speed limits.  However, I do not agree with having an appointed body which is not answerable to anybody revoking a decision made by the elected members of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was unwise of the Minister to forego the power he had which would normally be a rubber stamp job, in that local authorities could not introduce different speed limits in respect of national roads. That power should have been left with the Minister.  It is not that the elected <Col N="194" /> members should have power but that the people should have power.  The people should be able to ask me or the Minister why we are adopting certain measures, and we should be answerable to them. The roads authority will be in power when the Minister and I and other members have gone, and its members are not answerable to anybody.  I do not accept that that should be the case.  The Minister was wrong to have had that amendment approved by the Seanad and I ask him not to proceed with it.</P>

      <P>This Bill has had a long sojourn in both Houses, over ten months and about 183 amendments were debated of which I accepted more than 70.  In spite of differences of opinion on many occasions the debate was conducted in a fair and realistic way.  There may have been occasions when I felt I was wrongly done by, but there will never be a Minister for the Environment who will not, on occasion, feel that way.  In this instance I took the step of giving more power to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I want local authorities to make decisions relating to traffic management, speed limits etc. without the need for ministerial consent.  Why should I decide for Sligo, Letterkenny and so on?  The measure was well received by Deputies on all sides of the House.  When it comes to the national primary and secondary roads, which are under the control of the National Roads Authority, it is only sensible that the power on the uniform application of speed limits should rest with it.  Deputy Barrett's point is out of date by approximately two years.  If he had been in that position two years ago he could have stopped me from establishing the National Roads Authority, the control would have remained with the Department of the Environment and the Minister would still have all those powers.  However, the conventional wisdom was to establish the National Roads Authority and it is working well. <Col N="195" /> I am delighted with its progress.  As it will be funding the implementation of these provisions it is only natural it should be consulted.  We agreed on most other matters but we will agree to disagree on this one.</P>

      <P>I must correct the Minister. I am not complaining about the National Roads Authority making decisions in regard to the construction and so on of national primary routes. This amendment proposes that a county council or corporation of a county borough may not make by-laws under this section in regard to national roads or motorways without the prior consent of the National Roads Authority.  Previously, that consent had to come from the Minister.  I support the concept of devolving power to local authorities in regard to the making of by-laws.  This is a reserved function of the elected members, yet they have to get the prior consent of the National Roads Authority. The legislation should state &ldquo;without the prior consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  It should be from elected representative to elected representative.</P>

      <P>I thank the present and past Front Bench spokespersons for their support for the provisions of this Bill which was fully debated in both Houses. It was published in June 1993 and since then has been debated for a total of 47 hours in 11 days &mdash; in the Dáil and Seanad.  No time limits or guillotines applied to any Stage of the Bill.  On Committee and Report Stages a total of 183 amendments were discussed and 74 were agreed.  Many of these amendments were tabled to deal with concerns raised by Opposition Deputies and Senators.  I hope the distilled wisdom of Members from both sides of the House has produced an effective road traffic law instrument to deal with the carnage and many other problems on our roads.  I hope the provisions which give more powers to local authorities will work well.  I am <Col N="200" /> grateful for the support, interest and commitment of Deputies on all sides of the House, but especially that of the Front Bench spokespersons who have had to do a great deal of work in this regard.  I have expert facilities in terms of the staff of my Department who have worked tirelessly since the Bill was introduced. They worked late into the night on many occasions to deal with amendments.

There was much debate, argument and difference of opinion, which is typical when dealing with this type of legislation.  It is difficult to strike an acceptable balance for the middle ground in society.  The Bill imposes fairly stringent provisions on members of the public who drink and drive.</P>
      <P>I hope people will realise the new regulations are in the common interest.  If people are being asked not to drive having consumed alcohol we have an obligation, as legislators, to ensure other modes of transport are available.  People should be able to enjoy life and not have to drive home having consumed alcohol. Taxis and other forms of public transport should also be available at a cheap rate and people encouraged to use them.  In rural areas transport is often not available to meet the demand.  We do not wish to be killjoys but public transport or private car services should be provided cheaply to make the new regulations effective.</P>

      <P>The Bill is extensive and updates many aspects of road traffic legislation. Its main feature is the stringent new regulations governing drink driving laws.  When the Bill is enacted it is important that its regulations be scientifically and professionally monitored to ensure its intent is achieved.  It will have a dramatic effect on those who relax over a few drinks with friends at home in a public house or an hotel.  There is a need for strict legislation in this area to save lives.  We must at all times seek to ensure there is a relationship between legislation introduced and its objective which is to save lives.  We must not be seen as killjoys by enacting legislation that may be seen to be too rigid and not achieving its desired objective.  All Deputies support the legislation and hope it will have the desired objective.  This legislation should not be put on the stocks and forgotten. The Bill when enacted should be monitored by the Minister's Department in close contact with the Garda and the courts to ensure its provisions are implemented.  I wish to be associated with the remarks made by the Minister and Deputy Barrett in relation to the work done by the spokespersons of the various parties on this matter, including Deputy Keogh, the spokesperson for my party.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on his work in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (3) (0), line 16, after &ldquo;29&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the reference to sections 99 and 100 was a reference to section 31&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to rectify minor omissions from the text of section 2.  The Bill applies to referenda many of the provisions of Dáil electoral law contained in the Electoral Act, 1992. The approach adopted is to spell out all the necessary modifications of the 1992 Act so that the provisions in questions can apply directly and exactly to the referendum. The modifications are effected by section 2 (3) and comprise just over three pages.</P>
      <P>Following circulation of the Bill two minor oversights came to light.  The first is in paragraph (0) on page 7 which modifies section 101 of the 1992 Act.  That section describes the procedures for voting in a polling station and contains references to a number of other sections of the 1992 Act, including sections 99 and 100.  These two sections are not, in fact, applied to referenda.  The subject matter to which they relate &mdash; authorisation to vote at an alternative polling station &mdash; is dealt with in section 31 of this Bill.  Section 101 of the 1992 Act, as applied to referenda therefore, should be further modified by substituting a reference to section 31 for the reference to sections 99 and 100 of the 1992 Act.  Amendment No. 1 proposes to effect this further modification.</P>
      <P>The second amendment arises also in page 7 at paragraph (p) which sets out modifications to section 103 of the 1992 Act as it applies to referenda.  Section 103 contains the procedure for assisting electors with disabilities.  Section 103 (7) states that the presiding officer may read out in full from the ballot paper &ldquo;the particulars stated in respect of each candidate&rdquo;. There are, of course, no candidates at a referendum and amendment No. 2 proposes to substitute &ldquo;the proposal stated therein&rdquo; for &ldquo;the particulars stated in respect of each candidate&rdquo;.  It is a technical amendment only.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the section be tightened up by substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives the Minister an option in respect of inserting an explanatory title on the ballot paper but such an explanatory title should be inserted on ballot papers in all referenda.  We have only to refer to the November 1992 referenda to realise the confusion caused on that occasion when three separate referenda were held. These related to amendments 12, 13 and 14 of the Constitution.  Amendment No. 14 was on a white ballot paper under the heading, &ldquo;The Right to Life.&rdquo;  That <Col N="204" /> amendment, which was supported by the Government at the time, was defeated by almost three to one, while the other two amendments were carried by majorities of almost two to one.  Those who campaigned in those referenda will know that people with completely different views both campaigned and voted in the same manner.  That was because the objective of the proposed amendments was not clearly spelled out and people were not clear as to what it was hoped to achieve.  In future referenda the Minister should be obliged to insert a clear definition on the ballot papers.  Consequently, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be substituted by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> There is no need to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection 24 (4) provides that at a referendum the Minister may, by order, provide for the entry at the top of a ballot paper of a heading to indicate the proposal to which the referendum relates.  Under the provision, as drafted, the Minister will have discretion whether to provide for such a heading on referendum ballot papers.  The Minister's order will require prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to place a requirement on the Minister to provide for such a heading on ballot papers in the case of every referendum, regardless of the circumstances.  The sole purpose of having headings is to help electors distinguish between the different ballot papers where two or more referenda are held on the same day.  It is simply a distinguishing mark and is not in any sense designed to inform electors about the subject matter or help them make up their mind.  The matter, therefore, arises only where there are two or more papers. Where there is only one paper, clearly it must relate to the one and only proposal being voted on.  There would, therefore, be no need for a distinguishing feature and such a feature would do nothing to help electors.  I suggest that Deputy McCormack withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole purpose of this Bill is to regularise the citizenship righs of persons who made valid applications to have details of their births abroad entered in a foreign births entry book at an embassy or consulate abroad or in the Foreign Births <Col N="206" /> Register, at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, in the transitional six month period, ending on 31 December 1986, provided for in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, but who, through no fault of their own, were not registered by 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not propose any substantive changes in our citizenship laws. Its scope is limited.  It will apply only to approximately 4,000 applicants who are seeking Irish citizenship by virtue of descent from an Irish born person and who applied for registration prior to 31 December 1986 but who were not registered by that date.</P>
    <P>It is nevertheless an important Bill for those people affected by it.  Many Deputies will have received representations from some of the people concerned.  I believe that there is a consensus on both sides of the House that legislation should be enacted to deal with this issue.  I can fully appreciate the sense of injustice that these applicants must have felt when they discovered that their applications had not been processed in time and I am confident that this Bill will resolve their problems.</P>
    <P>Every person born in Ireland is automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  A person born outside the State to an Irish born parent is also automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  However, where the parent through whom a person born outside Ireland derives citizenship was also born outside Ireland then entitlement to Irish citizenship is dependent on the registration of that person's birth under section 27 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Section 27 of the 1956 Act provides for the registration of such births in a foreign births entry book kept in every Irish Embassy and Consulate abroad and in a Foreign Births Register kept in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The law on citizenship by descent is perhaps more easily understandable if we deal with a concrete example.  If a woman born in Ireland emigrates for example, to the United States she retains her Irish citizenship.  Any children born to her in the United States are automatically <Col N="207" /> entitled to Irish citizenship. However, the rights to Irish citizenship of her grandchildren depend on their births being registered and her great-grandchildren are entitled to Irish citizenship only if the births of the parents, that is the grandchildren of the original Irish emigrant, were registered before the great-grandchildren's births.</P>
    <P>Grandchildren, that is third generation Irish, and any further descendants of an Irish emigrant acquire citizenship rights only by virtue of being descended from an Irish born person if their births are registered.  Provided the births of the grandchildren and all subsequent descendants are registered under the 1956 Act then the right to Irish citizenship may be maintained indefinitely through the generations.  However, if the birth of a grandchild or any subsequent descendant is not registered then the link is broken and subsequent generations will have no right to Irish citizenship by descent.</P>
    <P>It must also be kept in mind that a third or subsequent generation applicant has to show that at least one parent was an Irish citizen on the date of birth of the applicant.  It can be appreciated, therefore, that the date the parent acquired Irish citizenship is critical in determining whether or not his or her child has a right to acquire Irish citizenship by descent.</P>
    <P>In the period 1956-86 this generally would not have posed any great difficulty for an applicant as citizenship deriving from registration was backdated to the date of birth or the coming into force of the 1956 Act, whichever was the later.  If the applicant's parent had not registered under section 27 prior to the birth of the applicant, the parent could always register after the birth of the applicant and the citizenship of the parent would apply retrospectively so that the parent would be deemed to have been an Irish citizen at the date of the birth of the applicant.  The applicant would, therefore, have been born to an Irish citizen and would be entitled to Irish citizenship which could be obtained by registration under section 27 of the 1956 Act in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> The law was changed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, which was drawn up in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and which provided that the citizenship of a person who, after the passing of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, is registered under section 27 shall commence only as and from the date of such registration.  This did away with the retrospective aspect of citizenship and gave much greater significance to the actual date of registration.  Now if a person's citizenship depends on registration, then his or her children lose their entitlement to acquire Irish citizenship by descent if they are born before that person registers.</P>
    <P>Before I continue I consider it appropriate to give some indication of the background to the changes introduced by the 1986 Act.  To understand the situation we must go back to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935.  Under section 2 (2) of the 1935 Act the birth of a person born outside the State to an Irish citizen also born outside the State had to be registered within two years of the birth or else that person lost the right to be a &ldquo;natural-born citizen of Saorstat Éireann&rdquo;.  The law was changed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  The requirement to register a birth within a set period of time was not maintained but it was apparently the intention that a person would only acquire citizenship on and from the date of registration of the birth.  However, in 1966 legal advice was provided to the effect that, for the purposes of derivation of citizenship under section 6 (2) of the 1956 Act, registration of the birth under section 27, as required by section 7 (2) of the 1956 Act, relates back to that person's birth or to the passing of the 1956 Act, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was taken in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, to restore the situation to that originally intended, that is, citizenship would not be backdated.  As I have explained, the introduction of the 1986 Act meant that a person who in future registers under section 27 of the 1956 Act only acquires <Col N="209" /> Irish citizenship from the date of registration. As a result children born to such a person prior to registration do not have a right to acquire citizenship by descent as their parent would not have been an Irish citizen at the date of their birth.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act was passed on 1 July 1986 but it included a transitional provision in section 8 which states that, &ldquo;for the period of 6 months commencing on the passing of this Act, any person who but for this Act could become an Irish citizen may continue to do so&rdquo;.  This six month period ended on 31 December 1986. During this six month period the number of applicants for registration received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Embassies and Consulates abroad reached unprecedented levels.  This was particularly so in the case of the Consulate General at New York in the USA, and the Consulate at Johannesburg in South Africa.  Emergency measures were taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs to deal with this wave of applications, including employing more staff and sanctioning overtime.  The result was that over 4,200 applications were processed in 1986.  By comparison 925 were processed in 1983, 1,270 in 1984 and 1,650 in 1985.  Of approximately 10,000 further applications received but not attended to by the end of 1986 approximately 6,000 were from third generation applicants, that is, they had a grandparent born in Ireland.  They generally had no children and, therefore, were not adversely affected by the deadline.  These applicants were registered in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>However, 3,773 valid applications were received in 1986 from third and fourth generation applicants which it was not possible to register in the time available. The majority of these outstanding applicants are from South Africa, 2,010, and the United States, 1,341, with smaller numbers from New Zealand and Canada.  When the Department of Foreign Affairs realised that the backlog of applications could not all be dealt with by the deadline of 31 December 1986 legal advice was sought.  That legal advice was to the effect that applicants could not <Col N="210" /> benefit from the more favourable regime provided for in the transitional provision of the 1986 Act unless the applications were actually registered before 31 December 1986.  The right to register many fourth generation applicants was dependent on registration of their parents being effected before 31 December 1986.  This is the category of applicants most affected by the failure to register by 31 December 1986.  It soon became evident that legislation was desirable to resolve the difficulties in the case of such applications and work on the processing of such applications was suspended on 1 January 1987.  The purpose of this legislation is to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill which comprises three sections.  Section 1 provides for definitions, section 3 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction and section 2 is the operative section.  I propose to concentrate on section 2.  The heading of the section is &ldquo;Registration of births outside Ireland&rdquo; and, as I have explained, this Bill is only concerned with applications for registration made during the transitional six month period provided for in the 1986 Act but which were not registered by the end of the six month period on 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) deals with two different circumstances.  Section 2 (1) (a) deals with the outstanding 3,773 applications for registration which were made during the transitional period but which have never been registered.  It specifically provides that all such valid applications may now be registered.  This provision is necessary to cover those fourth generation applicants who but for this Bill would not be eligible to be registered. There were many family applications by parents who were third generation Irish and their children who would be fourth generation.  The right of the fourth generation applicants to registration was directly dependent on their parents being registered prior to 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) deals with persons who applied for registration during the transitional six month period but who were registered after 31 December 1986. <Col N="211" /> It allows such persons to apply for re-registration if they so wish.  Most of these persons are unlikely to apply for re-registration as there is no particular benefit for them.  However, I understand that in a small number of cases where there were family applications by parents and their children, the parents on learning that they had not been registered by 31 December 1986 and that their existing children were, therefore, not eligible for registration insisted on their own registration proceeding.  The result was that the parents were registered but the children could not be registered because the citizenship of their parents was not backdated. I can well understand the concern of such parents who decided to proceed with registration to ensure that any future children they might have would be entitled to Irish citizenship even if it meant that their existing children might lose out.  Section 2 (1) (b) means such parents can remedy the situation by applying for re-registration so that the applications made during the transitional period for the registration of their existing children can then be processed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) provides that any person registered or re-registered by virtue of section 2 (1) shall be deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986.  In effect, that will allow every person who made a valid application for registration during the transitional period but who was not registered by 31 December 1986 to be put in the same position that they would have been in if they had been registered during the transitional period.  In particular, it will allow the registration of the outstanding 3,773 applications to be completed.</P>
    <P>Section (2) refers to 1 July 1986 as the date on which the relevant applications will be deemed to have been registered. The transitional period commenced on 1 July 1986 and ended on 31 December 1986.  A date during that period had to be chosen for the purposes of the section and it was decided to choose the date which would be most favourable to applicants, that is the earliest date possible which is 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> This leads me on to subsection (3) of section 2.  As we are providing that valid applications made during the transitional period but not registered by 31 December 1986 shall, under the Bill, be deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986, it seems only consistent that applications actually registered during the transitional period should not be treated any less favourably.  Subsection (3) provides, therefore, that such applications shall also be deemed to be registered on 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>In practice this should be of no significance. The only possible circumstance in which the date of registration during the transitional period would be of importance would be if, for example, a woman applied for registration during the transitional period but, after submitting her application and before it was registered, she then gave birth to a child and did not have an opportunity to submit a further application for the registration of that child before 31 December 1986.  As far as I am aware no such case exists but to avoid any possibility of a grievance, the Bill provides that all relevant applications are deemed to have been registered on 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear from the outset this Bill has one purpose and one purpose only, that is to resolve the position of persons who made valid applications for registration during the transitional period 1 July 1986 to 31 December 1986 and who were not registered by 31 December 1986 through no fault of their own.  The Bill does that and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say a few words about a related issue &mdash; legislation to provide a statutory framework for refugee and asylum seekers.  Over the past few months I promised this legislation in the House.  I will be keeping this promise.  The Government recently approved a draft scheme of a Bill to deal with this important area of human rights for a disadvantaged body of people in the international community.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being drafted at the moment and my aim is to have it published and through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  In advance of the Bill <Col N="213" /> being approved by the Government.  I am constrained by what I can say about it at this stage.  I can say, however, that the recommendations which have been published of the interdepartmental committee set up to examine this area form the core of my legislative proposals to deal with refugees and asylum seekers.  I am confident that when these provisions are enacted into law in the next few months our system for processing refugees and asylum seekers will be open, impartial, humane and will allay the fears of those who have expressed concerns about the present non-statutory system.</P>
    <P>I do not want any Member to leave this House today with the mistaken impression that by bringing forward this Bill to deal with the outstanding applications arising out of the 1986 Act I have put the issue of refugees and asylum on the back burner.  That is most definitely not the case.  I expect to be back here with major reforming legislation in a matter of weeks which will ensure that our international obligations are maintained to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>It is little short of disgraceful that the <Col N="214" /> thousands of people in many countries who applied for Irish citizenship as far back as October and November of 1986 found that their applications have been left in limbo until 1994.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Before the expiry of the statutory deadline at the end of December 1986, thousands of legitimate applications plus fees were lodged with our overseas diplomatic and consular missions but these have never been processed nor, indeed, have the fees been refunded.  I understand that over 4,000 applications are outstanding from people who live mainly in the United States or in South Africa.  The Minister has given more up-to-date figures since I prepared these notes but they are not greatly at variance.</P>
      <P>It is not difficult to envisage how much correspondence the failure of the Irish Government to deal with these applications has generated over the past seven years.  Think of the total waste of time of civil servants both in our diplomatic and consular offices abroad and in the Department of Foreign Affairs in fending off inquiries from those thousands of people as to why their applications have not been processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that meetings have been held with Ministers and that some time ago an approach was made to the Taoiseach and yet we must wait until now for this type of legislation to appear.  As far back as October 1988 the Consul General in New York was telling people that preliminary work on the necessary Bill to amend the 1986 Act was well under way to facilitate those who had lodged applications within the specified time limit. The Consul General further pointed out, as regards the fees that had been paid, that while those remain lodged in the account of the Consul General of Ireland, applications would remain under active <Col N="215" /> consideration pending the implementation of further legislation.  This money has been held for the past seven years, yet no efforts were made to solve this relatively simple problem.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, was passed there was a feeling that our citizenship would be extended to as broad a range of people as possible but it was mainly aimed at giving the great-grandchildren of our emigrants to the United States, mainly in The Famine years, and in the years following The Famine, an opportunity to regain the citizenship their ancestors had prior to emigration.</P>
    <P>It is strange, having regard to the manner in which we have pursued the United States in relation to visas for Irish citizens, that we take this extraordinary lackadaisical approach to the problems of American descendants of Irish citizens who wish to regain Irish citizenship by virtue of the good graces of the Irish Government extended in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956. This type of bureaucracy does not help our case in that regard.  Our lackadaisical approach in dealing with applicants from the United States who wish to obtain Irish citizenship has not helped our case in seeking the waiver of the United States visitor's visa requirement for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the moves made by Senator Edward Kennedy, Chairman of the US Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Matters and of Congressman Frank McCluskey who has now introduced a Bill to seek the removal of this visitor's visa scheme.  We must do everything in our power to mobilise the full Irish network of political and diplomatic support at home and abroad to ensure that the US visitor's visa scheme is changed.</P>
    <P>San Marino and Lichtenstein have closer relationships with the United States than has the Republic of Ireland. To any Irish American the answer is obvious, yet nationals of both of those countries do not have a visitor's visa requirement to enter the United States. <Col N="216" /> The Republic of Ireland &mdash; but not Northern Ireland &mdash; Portugal and Greece are the only three European Union states which still have a United States visitor's visa requirement.  It is very difficult to understand the reason for the continuance of this requirement.  The representative of the United States Government resident in Ireland always has been given special consideration. Two treaties &mdash; the Economic Co-operation Agreement between Ireland and the United States of 1948 and the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Agreement between Ireland and the United States of 1950 set out the special relationship between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the attitude of the current United States Ambassador here, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith, who replied to me on 7 January last following representations I had made to her before Christmas.  She has assured me that the matter of how Ireland can be included in the visa waiver programme is one with which she has been seized since her arrival here.  She has also assured me that the State Department is in active consultation with the United States Congress on this matter.  Furthermore, the Ambassador has informed me that it is not the Administration that sets United States immigration policy but the US Congress.  I am convinced that Ambassador Kennedy Smith is doing everything within her power, as is her brother, to expand the visa waiver programme to include Ireland.  Senator Edward Kennedy has written to the US Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, proposing that countries that have made progress towards reaching the 2 per cent refusal rate requirement be given the benefit of the doubt and be granted visa waiver authority for at least a trial period of three years.  Ireland's refusal rate for the United States fiscal year 1993 was 4.3 per cent.  There is strong support for change from Ambassador Kennedy Smith, Senator Edward Kennedy, Congressman McCloskey and many other leading United States politicians and diplomats.</P>
    <P>It is time for us here collectively to give <Col N="217" /> a final heave so that this change can be effected without further delay.  It would help our case were we to adopt a generous attitude to US applications for Irish nationality and citizenship under the provisions of this Bill, were we to ensure that those United States visitors who work and live here were given particularly friendly consideration whenever they call to the Garda Aliens Office which they are required to do from time to time. There is an opportunity for greater co-operation between both Governments. At no time has it been more possible to abolish the visitor's visa requirement to the United States.  We should do everything possible to effect that change now.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting this Bill.  I have placed my criticisms and reservations about the delay on the record.  This Bill is necessary for the reasons set out by the Minister.  Since this question of nationality and citizenship is before the House I would suggest that we examine the overall question of the relationship between our ancestors in the United States and those who remained at home.  There are many people in the United States very proud to hold Irish and United States passports, the value of an Irish passport being that it gives right of travel throughout the European Union, a very valuable document to possess.  Nonetheless we have been very remiss in not mobilising the vast American-Irish population in support of our case in seeking the removal of this nonsense visa requirement. I cannot understand how it ever developed.  A former eminent editor of one newspaper suggested recently that it might well have been related to our neutrality in the Second World War.  I do not know the reason but I do know it does not apply in the case of Switzerland, New Zealand, Lichtenstein, San Marino or Northern Ireland, yet none of those countries has given the United Staes as many Presidents as has this country, something of the order of 12 if I recall correctly.</P>
    <P>It is remiss of us not to use that contact to ensure the abolition of this visa requirement.  It is absurd that nationals of all of those countries I have mentioned, <Col N="218" /> including Northern Ireland and Great Britain, can come and go to the United States without a visitor's visa requirement. Some people might say it is because we have such a serious unemployment problem; there is an even greater unemployment problem in Spain yet there is no such requirement of their nationals.  There are very few countries worldwide that locate the United States Ambasador in the same park as their President, a singular act of great friendship and I have referred to the 1950 Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Agreement between Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to note that Ambassador Kennedy Smith has made genuine great efforts, as I am sure did her predecessor in this regard.  We collectively in this House should back up those efforts so that if the Congressman McCloskey Bill is not passed at least the measures proposed by Senator Kennedy &mdash; which will affect not merely the Republic of Ireland but Portugal and Greece &mdash; will be passed in the United States so that this overall penalty on Irish people travelling to the United States can be abolished and have our nationals visiting the United States treated in the same manner as are United States nationals visiting the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be facilitating the easy passage of this Bill.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell's comments about bureaucracy would be endorsed by everybody who has had any involvement with agents of the State when it comes to any issue about alien status, a matter frequently mentioned in this House. When such representations were made to me I experienced the greatest difficulty dealing with those inquiries.  I came up against a wall of bureaucracy, secrecy, sometimes xenophobia.  When somebody wants to enter this State they may come <Col N="219" /> up against a wall of non-co-operation at State level.  It would be my hope that such difficulties and delays would be minimised within the term of office of the present Minister and that there would be a more sympathetic attitude adopted by the Department in their meetings with the general public and public representatives.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that most of the applications submitted emanate from the United States and South Africa.  The forthcoming elections in South Africa may have prompted people there with family connections in this country to seek Irish citizenship.  Since they may have been prompted by a fear that turmoil in South Africa could result in a mass exodus from that country, we may receive greater numbers of applications from people in South Africa who might wish to leave the new state there.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to compare the Minister's remark about the refugee Bill since, with the very serious position obtaining in Bosnia Herzegovina, undoubtedly we will receive a greater number of applications for refugee status.  Therefore, I was pleased to hear the Minister give a firm commitment that a Bill will be introduced within the next couple of weeks to redress the position here which, to our shame, has been left in abeyance far too long.</P>
    <P>There was disappointment on this side of the House that a more generous response was not given to Deputy Shatter's Private Members' Bill.  Deputy Shatter is an expert in that field.  I recall there were crowds in the Gallery.  On that issue there was widespread support from civil rights groups for that Bill.  I am delighted the Minister is taking on board the need for that legislation and look forward to debating it in the House.</P>
    <P>When we debated the Private Members' Bill it was obvious from research carried out by Deputies that very few applications for refugee status in Ireland are made and that the structures are not in place to facilitate such applications.  We have a shameful record in our dealings generally with <Col N="220" /> refugees.  I am sorry to say that refugees seeking asylum from countries such as Iran and non-white countries have had a very difficult time here.  When we debated the Bill in the House I was disappointed to hear some Deputies on the other side make what I would consider xenophobic remarks and indicate that if we improved our structures and administrative systems for the processing of refugee applications we might have a flood of such people coming into the country.  This was seen to be a bad thing. I dispute that.  There is a very small number of applications for refugee status.</P>
    <P>In general those who come to our shores seeking refugee status are miserable and abject people.  In the past they have been badly treated; they were bundled by the Garda into cars at Shannon Airport and bundled back onto planes.  They had no rights and often were put into prison for long periods.  My colleague, Deputy Harney, tried to help a genuine refugee who spent 11 months in Mountjoy in terrible conditions.  I understand that eventually he was freed by the courts.  It was shameful that we got involved in that type of oppression against people seeking refugee status.</P>
    <P>We have Bosnian refugees here who, I believe, are happy and settled.  I look forward to more of their relations being granted refugee status if they so wish, given the terrible situation that exists in Bosnia.  The conflict there will create hundreds of thousands of refugees towards whom the international community, and this State in particular, should adopt a compassionate and welcoming role as a member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we are facilitating citizenship for the children of fourth generation Irish people who went to the United States or South Africa.  It is anomalous that we should do that without giving voting rights to our citizens who have gone to the United States in the past five or ten years.  All of us have family members living abroad who would <Col N="221" /> be delighted to have a vote in our elections. In the context of citizenship I urge the Minister to raise with her Cabinet colleagues this serious issue which is gaining public support in the United States.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with a very able and lucid young lawyer, a member of a group of young Irish emigrants in New York and the campaign to give them the right to vote and have a say in what goes on in Ireland is gathering momentum.  That is their constitutional right.  There are constitutional problems involved as well as practical problems as to whether a voting lobby in the United States could influence the outcome of a general election in various constituencies.  It would be interesting to see how that would work out and it would be worthwhile for the Government to examine the issue.  My party supports the idea of emigrants having voting rights.  Almost every door I knocked at while canvassing in Dublin South had five names on the voting register when there were only three people living there; the two talented and well educated young people had gone to work in the United States and were doing well but their parents say they want to vote in Ireland although they may not come back because there is no work here for them. The unanimous wish was that our young educated and patriotic young people wished to have a say and to be involved. I hope the Minister will consider that.  I welcome this legislation.  There is nothing controversial in it and I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Jim Kirby for any comments which may be misunderstood.  I am sure my predecessors would agree that if you want to get legislation on the Statute Book you must be ruthless within the Department, and particularly the law division, in setting out your priorities.  Every Minister has different priorities.  In the last 14 months ten pieces of legislation have been either published and enacted or published and are in the process of being enacted so I do not think there has been any delay.  In the middle of many other important priorities.  I am glad it was possible to bring this legislation forward. While it may not seem very significant outside this House, it has a tremendous importance for the 3,773 people who are immediately affected.</P>
      <P>It is not for me to comment on another Administration's rules and regulations in relation to emigrants but as somebody who represents a constituency from which comes a high percentage of Irish emigrants in the United States, I would have the same concerns as Deputy Mitchell regarding our being the only EU country which has these requirements.</P>
      <P>I thank the US Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith, who has taken a personal interest in this issue and is pushing it very strongly with the active support of the friends from Ireland who are working on Capitol Hill.  I would like to be associated with the words of thanks for the work they are doing and we look forward to a resolution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Refugees and Asylum Bill, I am glad both Deputies are as eager as I to see that legislation enacted.  When I became Minister for Justice most of the complaints I received from Members through parliamentary questions, Matters on the Adjourment, letters, etc., were in relation to refugees and asylum. At that time I undertook to examine that division of the Department because much blame, unnecessarily and wrongly, was put on civil servants who were working in difficult circumstances in that division. We have made a number of substantial changes in that division which are to the benefit of the public and the staff who <Col N="223" /> work in that division.  I thank them for doing what is a difficult and thankless job.  I hope to introduce that Bill in the next few weeks.  I am glad to hear it will get a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of votes for emigrants. I have more constituents living in Boston than any other Member of this House, other than my colleagues in the constituency.  I visit Boston every year.  It would suit me very well, electorally, if they all had votes.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, it could have a huge impact on certain constituencies and I am all for that because it would have a positive impact on mine.

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I thank Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Independent Deputies for the responsible and fair approach they adopted to the Bill.  It is important, particularly in the context of the huge Government majority which causes concern not just to Opposition Deputies but in the country generally because of the manner in which the Government has used its majority and sought to collapse this Bill on the last occasion.  I am pleased there is such unity of purpose among the Opposition parties <Col N="224" /> and it is important that that would continue.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats put forward this Bill in order to give legal recognition to the unpaid work of women in the main, and in some cases, men, in the home.  It is an honest attempt by us to recognise the non-financial contributions which many women in particular make to the home as homemakers and child rearers.  The rejection of the Bill by the Government shows it is not really committed to equality, despite the words in the Programme for Government, or to giving statutory recognition to the aspirations in the Constitution as far as women are concerned.  The Government's treatment of the Bill raises serious questions about its capacity to handle the divorce referendum.  How could it dismiss out of hand a Bill that was welcomed by the Council for the Status of Women and several other organisations?  The council described it as &ldquo;a laudable attempt to give statutory recognition to the unpaid work of women in the home.&rdquo;  They went on to say &ldquo;any attempt to recognise in law the contribution made by women in the home through their unpaid work must be welcome.  It is crucial, in our view, that this issue be dealt with before the Government's proposed referendum on divorce later this year&rdquo;.  Despite those words from the council, which is the umbrella organisation for over 100 organisations, we all know what the Government sought to do; I am the third speaker from my party and the fifth Opposition speaker to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>The delay in the allocation of £750,000 which the Minister for Finance told us about on budget day to marriage counselling services is also regrettable.  I have been approached on behalf of the Marriage Counselling Service &mdash; a body which is not affiliated to the Catholic Church.  That organisation is in jeopardy because of the failure of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make a grant available to it out of that £750,000. I appeal to him to make the allocation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, speak on radio this morning <Col N="225" /> about the Government's commitment to the family.  This is the Year of the Family and if an allocation is not made to an organisation which is trying so hard under very difficult circumstances to help those whose marriages are in difficulty it raises serious questions about the Government's judgment and its handling of the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the divorce referendum diverted but I must question the ethics of allocating taxpayers' money to one side of an argument in the context of the referendum.  I appeal to the Minister to give this serious consideration, as I have tried to do since I was approached by interested people.  I am not saying public money should be allocated to a particular church but there will be organisations campaigning on both sides and all the public money should not necessarily be spent by the Government.  Given the issue and the sensitivities involved, we and the Government must deal with the allocation of resources in a sensible, sensitive and realistic way.  I would hate to think issues relating to the allocation of resources for a campaign would grab the headlines, get all the attention and divert interest from the main issue, which is recognising in law those whose marriages have broken down and allowing them to remarry if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the matters raised by the Tánaiste in a fair, honest and reasonable fashion but I must express how disappointed not only I but my party were at what he had to say &mdash; not just his out of hand dismissal of the Bill but the manner in which he chose to deal with the issue involved, his criticism of my party, his description of the Bill as an amateur effort written on the back of an envelope and his questioning of whether we were playing politics with the divorce issue.  I have assured the Minister for Equality and Law Reform privately, and will do so publicly, that as far as the divorce issue is concerned, he will receive nothing but the fullest co-operation from my party.  We co-operated fully on the last occasion with the then Coalition Government, in contrast to the main Opposition party at the time, and campaigned <Col N="226" /> as vigorously as we could within our available resources.  We had just established our party and had four Deputies; nonetheless we worked as hard as we could to ensure the success of the referendum.  We helped the Government of the day and it would be my intention to do so on this occasion.  This issue is far too important for party politics.</P>
    <P>I regret the tone of the Tánaiste's remarks and it is a pity that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform was not present on that occasion because he has complimented me and my party on our co-operative approach to this issue.  The Tánaiste suggested there were serious defects in the Bill.  I have assessed each of his criticisms carefully and have concluded they are wrong and without foundation in fact or law.  Taking the first point he made he said:</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the Bill, as it stands would conflict with the test laid down by the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill regarding disproportionate interference with the rights of families to make decisions having regard to Article 41 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This is a groundless criticism.  The Bill cannot amount to disproportionate interference since all it allows is for a spouse, in the last analysis, to agree before a court that as a matter of equity, the non-financial contribution to the family home gives rise to an entitlement to beneficial ownership therein.  Not only was this described as a desirable objective by the Chief Justice in the case of L &amp; L but in the judgment delivered in the recent Matrimonial Home Bill case, the Supreme Court said:</P>
    <P>The court accepts, as it has indicated, the advantages of encouraging by any appropriate means joint ownership in family homes as being conducive to the dignity, reassurance and independence of each of the spouses and to the partnership concept of marriage which is fundamental to it.  It is not, however, satisfied that the potentially <Col N="227" /> indiscriminate alteration of what may be joint decisions validly made within the authority of the family concerning the question of the ownership of the family home could reasonably be justified even by such an important aspect as the common good.</P>
    <P>It is clear from all the available dicta of the Supreme Court on the issue that the court considers that legislation to permit a spouse to establish a right in equity to a share in the family home is not merely desirable or constitutional but clearly a value which the Constitution encourages and welcomes.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste went on to say:</P>
    <P>Before any interest can be established, an expensive court action would be necessary under the provisions of the Bill.  The interest would take time to establish and, in a situation where one is talking mainly about contributions which are not monetary in nature, the precise share in the home to which a spouse is likely to be entitled may well be uncertain.</P>
    <P>In this criticism the Tánaiste ignores present day legal realities.  It is equally true of financial contributions giving rise to an equitable share because, unless agreed, the interest can be established only by &ldquo;an expensive court action&rdquo;, to quote the Tánaiste.  This is no reason to discriminate between financial and non-financial contributions.  Moreover, since the Government has abandoned the idea of conferring a specific defined share on spouses as of right, by legislation a formula which reflects the contribution made by the spouse who stays at home, the homemaker, will necessarily be general in its terms and flexible in its nature. Such uncertainty is inevitable unless a rigid formula can be applied by statute. This is not a reason that a right should not be created.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said also that the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the Government's family law Bills contain provisions in respect of property adjustment orders but, as is <Col N="228" /> obvious from these measures, one is talking only about situations where a marriage has broken down.  There are many circumstances in which a spouse could wish to establish an equity based on non-financial contributions to the family home other than cases of marriage breakdown. One such case is that of succession rights.  In such a case, a spouse might wish to establish a share in the family home which was held in her husband's name before asserting her statutory right to a legal share in the remainder of her spouse's estate.  Moreover there will be other cases where a spouse will wish to establish her equitable right in the family home to defeat competing claims, possibly by other members of the family who have made cash contributions to the family home, or to defeat subsequent claims by persons claiming equitable rights in the family home such as third parties not related to the spouse.  In all these cases, the present law is wholly inadequate and makes no provision for the protection of the interest of the wife who stays at home.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's statement that &ldquo;this Bill would only be of relevance where the spouses could not agree on such ownership&rdquo; is incorrect.  A spouse might have died, a spouse might be disabled due to mental illness or whatever or there might be a dispute between one of the spouses and a third party.  To suggest that any action to establish such a right would impair the relationship between the spouses in such cases is completely misconceived. Likewise, when examined the Tánaiste's criticism of section 4 falls apart completely.  He distinguishes between a house which was purchased by a mortgage paid out of the earnings of one of the spouses during the marriage and a house which was given by way of gift or inheritance to one of the spouses either before or during the marriage.  This is the precise distinction which the Supreme Court drew in rejecting the Matrimonial Home Bill.  The Progressive Democrats Bill makes such a distinction in order to avoid the unconstitutionality which threw the Government's Bill into the constitutional wastepaper basket.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> The Tánaiste also claimed that section 4 bristles with anomalies.  When we look to what these anomalies might be we find that he considers it to be an anomaly that a right in equity might exist in relation to a home on which repayments were made but might not exist in respect of a home which one of the spouses had always owned outright.  It is somewhat surprising that he cannot see that this distinction is of fundamental importance in ensuring the constitutionality of this measure, having regard to the Matrimonial Home Bill.  He criticised section 4 because it was vague.  The section is not vague but is of a general and flexible application.</P>
    <P>One of the more hollow criticisms offered by the Tánaiste is that section 4 would allow the court to make any number of subsequent orders.  That applies equally to financial contributions as there is nothing finite about the number of orders that the court could make under section 12 of the 1957 Act in respect of financial contributions.  There is no good reason to cap the number of applications that could be made in respect of non-financial contributions in circumstances where there is no such cap on financial contributions.  The idea that a spouse would return regularly to the court to get a top up is entirely foolish. The Tánaiste must know that equivalent rights in respect of financial contributions have never given rise to topping up litigation. People are not as foolish as he apparently takes them to be.  He also criticised the Bill because it &ldquo;placed a premium on marriages of a particular duration&rdquo;.  In the context of non-financial contributions, nothing could be more sensible than to distinguish between a marriage of one week's duration and one of 20 years duration in determining whether an equitable share in the family home should exist as a result of a non-financial contribution.  Is he seriously saying that a marriage of one week and the non-financial contribution of one week is equivalent to the non-financial contribution of 20, 25 or 30 years?  It is hard to see that he was acting in good faith in framing this criticism.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also attacked the proposal <Col N="230" /> to cap non-financial contributions at 50 per cent and pointed out that there is no such cap on financial contributions. If the courts are to be given jurisdiction to create an equitable interest to reflect the non-financial contributions of spouses who stay at home it is surely more desirable that there should be some upper limit on such interests.  Otherwise, the spouse making financial contributions might argue that the effect of the Bill was to deprive him or her of the benefit of his or her financial contributions.  If the Tánaiste believes that a 50 per cent cap is unreasonable in this context, will he suggest the percentage he finds acceptable?</P>
    <P>Claims that the creation of a right to establish equitable ownership based on non-financial contributions could give rise to conveyancing problems are hollow.  A similar jurisdiction in respect of financial contributions has not complicated conveyancing matters, but on the Tánaiste's arguments it has an equal potential to do so.  Coupled with the obligation to obtain a spouse's consent under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the provisions of the Progressive Democrats' Bill would not complicate conveyancing in the slightest.  There is no basis for believing that the right to establish equitable ownership in respect of non-financial contributions is any more complex from a conveyancing point of view than a similar right in respect of financial contributions.  A moment's reflection might have led the Tánaiste to see how empty was that criticism.</P>
    <P>Moreover, his reference to the proposal in the Government's Family Law Bill to repeal and re-enact in extended form, section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, is irrelevant.  If one measure becomes law before the other, the appropriate amendment can be made in either.  The entitlements of children of deceased spouses to recover moneys in respect of non-financial contributions by the child's parents could be dealt with either by leaving the provisions of this Bill as they are and allowing non-financial contributions to be dealt with in the same way as financial contributions, or alternatively, <Col N="231" /> by providing that the provisions relating to non-financial contributions could only be actionable as the personal suit of the spouse affected.  Either of the adjustments could easily be made if the Government's Family Law Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also criticised the Bill on the basis that the term &ldquo;non-financial contribution&rdquo; was not adequately defined.  If he felt that the Bill would be improved by such a definition we would be glad to consider any such proposed definition.  On reflection he might well consider that it is best not to attempt to define the term &ldquo;non-financial contribution&rdquo; as it is virtually impossible to lay down a formula in law which would be both just and effective.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Tánaiste we have carefully considered each and every one of his criticisms.  They are all without substance and were not seriously offered.  If anything was written on the back of an envelope, as he suggested, it was his series of criticisms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We can appreciate, because the Government complained that it had inadequate notice of the Bill, that it did not have time to elaborate its criticism, but it is abundantly clear that every criticism offered by the Tánaiste is hollow, specious and insubstantial when examined. I would have expected, given the commitment in the Programme for Government to accept Bills of a non-contentious nature and the request of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to my party colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, who was involved in drafting this Bill that, at least, the Government would have given it a Second Reading and allowed it go to Committee.  That would have shown that the Government was at least interested in teasing out the issues.  I regret that a great deal of notice was not given, but my party was faced with the choice of abandoning the possibility of having a Bill such as this and taking the road of the divorce referendum or taking the opportunity now. We get an opportunity to put forward such a Bill only once every six parliamentary <Col N="232" /> weeks when there are motions or every ten weeks when there are not. We would not have had an opportunity before the Dáil adjourns for the elections to put this measure again.  I regret that there was not more time.</P>
    <P>Given the resources at the disposal of the Government the lack of time was not a good enough reason for the Tánaiste, the Labour Party and the Government to adopt such an attitude.  Unless they rethink their attitude to this proposal there is a serious danger that the upcoming divorce referendum will be roundly defeated.  Many women and the organisations that represent them, which have been in contact with me, have expressed alarm at the attitude adopted by the Government to this measure.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Keogh, drew a contrast between the attitude adopted by the Minister for Justice who is due to speak next and that adopted by the Tánaiste.  I have always found the Minister for Justice to be both reasonable and fair; she will always accept good amendments from the Opposition and does not make an issue out of this.  I admire her for that.  It may be due to the fact that she is not paranoid about her own legislation and does not insist that she is always right.  That is the approach we must adopt to legislation of this kind which is sensitive, urgent and important.  It is legislation that all of us should like to see on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has shown itself quite prepared to support Private Members' Bills when it is satisfied that the proposals are in the public interest and will achieve social good.  I regret that this Bill does not sufficiently meet those criteria and, as the House will be already aware, the Government is opposing this measure.  In fairness to the proposers of the Bill and to the general public there is an obligation to explain why the Government is adopting this stance on this occasion and I hope my contribution will succeed in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members of this House were disappointed that the Government's proposals <Col N="233" /> to provide for automatic joint ownership of the family home were found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision went to the heart of what was being proposed and it was simply not an option to seek to adjust the provisions of that Bill to try to render it constitutional.  That being said, the Government has made it clear that we will examine carefully the situation in the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgment and if workable proposals emerge for legislative change in this area we will have no hesitation in bringing them forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate what this Bill attempts to do, the reality is that it is hard to see it having any widespread practical advantage.  To suggest that it goes a long way to achieving what the Government's proposals in this area attempted to achieve would be wide of the mark. There is a world of difference between providing for automatic joint ownership of the family home and, instead, providing for a procedure whereby people can involve themselves in what might prove to be expensive and corrosive litigation to establish their respective shares in the family home.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to pre-empt the Government's consideration of what might be possible in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision I suspect that workable proposals will lie primarily in taking steps to encourage joint ownership through social policies and that the solution which this Bill proposes, leaving aside inherent difficulties which may arise with the detail of it, is in reality no solution at all to what we are seeking to address.  It is unfortunate that some supporters of this Bill have within and outside the House made claims about what the Bill would achieve which do not stand up to examination.  It is unfortunate also that some appear to have misunderstood the reason the Government cannot support or accept this measure.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about it.  This measure, despite the good intention of the proposers, is not something which will secure practical benefit for the vast majority of dependent spouses.  If it was of real benefit, <Col N="234" /> I and my colleagues in Government would adopt a different approach to it. Our opposition is grounded in reason, not on any desire to deprive dependent spouses of valuable rights &mdash; to do so would be perverse.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted wrongly that the Bill for the first time proposes to have the non-financial contributions of a spouse to the family home recognised.  This overlooks the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which specifically oblige the courts when deciding on financial and property arrangements in the case of separation, to have regard to the contributions which each of the spouses has made or is likely in the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family, including any contribution by looking after the home and caring for the family.  In other words, in separation cases where the court has to decide on what to do with the family home it must have specific regard to the contribution made by a spouse who stays at home looking after the home and, where relevant, caring for the children.</P>
    <P>What this Bill seeks to do is to allow the court to take into account the value of such contributions where judicial separation is not being sought.  Is it realistic to suggest that proceedings for such a declaration are likely to be initiated in practice on any significant scale other than in circumstances where the marriage has in fact broken down?  Is it likely that in circumstances where a couple dispute the ownership of the family home and one of them resorts to the courts to have the question established that matters will rest at that and that neither what led to the action being initiated nor its progress through the courts will have any further implications for the marriage?</P>
    <P>The reality is that, while we would all accept that joint ownership of the family home is socially desirable in the context of its giving recognition to the nature of marriage as a partnership, in practice the need to resolve a dispute between spouses as to the respective shares in the family home in terms of the protection of the interest of both spouses generally arises only where the marriage breaks <Col N="235" /> down.  The law already caters for that situation and that is being built upon in the Family Law Bill which is currently before this House.</P>
    <P>I intend no disservice or discourtesy to the drafters of this Bill when I say that it must be a matter of regret to all those who genuinely wish to see the difficult problems where marriages break down addressed that the debate on this measure has been used by some to cast doubt on the genuineness of the Government's intentions in relation to a divorce referendum.  To suggest that this Bill has any relevance to the situations where marriages break down is wrong and it is particularly unfortunate when those who proclaim strongly their wish for divorce to be introduced proceed, however inadvertently, to confuse the public debate by seeking to make a connection between this Bill and divorce.  The Government has already made it clear that before putting the issue of divorce before the people in a referendum we must have a modern and effective corpus of family law and the Family Law Bill at present before the House is a measure of that determination.</P>
    <P>Given the very limited scope &mdash; albeit understandable &mdash; of this Bill &mdash; the enactment of such a measure would carry with it the danger of being used by those who oppose the introduction of divorce as a distraction from the real issues which must be addressed in the debate and that they would concentrate on its limited nature in an attempt to minimise the protection which the law provides where marriages break down.  To make that point is not in any way intended to detract from the genuineness of the concerns which many people have about the introduction of divorce &mdash; concerns which are being addressed as best we can through a wide range of initiatives in relation to marriage and the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>As well as action in the legislative field further initiatives have been taken in areas such as the provision of civil legal aid and mediation services.</P>
    <P>In response to the points raised by <Col N="236" /> Deputy Harney, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has assured me that his Department has been in touch with the agencies and groups who provide mediation services. Moneys have been allocated for the expansion of these services.  As soon as all the proposals have been submitted to the Minister and his officials he will make the allocations.  We hope that these will be made quickly, in relation to my specific area of responsibility the House will be aware that the Law Reform Commission recently published a discussion document on family courts and I look forward to receiving their final report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government White Paper on Marital Breakdown recognised that, while the vast majority of people in Ireland who get married go on to live together in life-long unions, there is also the unfortunate reality that a minority &mdash; and by all accounts an increasing one &mdash; of those who marry have their hopes and expectations of a permanent union dashed through the breakdown of their marriages.  It was in the context of addressing that reality that the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to put the question of divorce before the people in a referendum. Lest there be even a scintilla of doubt about it, I am happy to use this occasion to make it clear that the Government will bring forward its proposals in this matter without delay in the light of the progress of the various related matters under way.  The Government will spare no effort to explain fully to the people at the time why the measure it proposes should be supported by the people.</P>
    <P>The progress of that debate will not be assisted in any way by a failure to recognise that the question of appropriate responses to marital breakdown is one on which people have strongly held and often opposing views and I am hopeful that it will prove possible for all of us on all sides of this House to adopt a constructive approach in an effort to minimise needless divisiveness in the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> In this regard it is only right to refer to my experience of the generally constructive approach which has been taken by Members on all sides to the array of legislative measures which I have been able to introduce since I became Minister for Justice.  It is in this context that I regret it did not prove possible on this occasion to accept the Private Members' Bill which was put forward but I hope it will be recognised that this did not arise from any knee-jerk reaction on the part of the Government but from a genuine belief on our part that the balance of the public good did not lie with the acceptance of such a measure at this time.</P>
    <P>To return to the detail of the Bill, I would be concerned that, even in the very limited cases where it might be resorted to, it may not be fully effective in what it sets out to achieve and, in particular, whether it contains sufficient guidance for the courts in its concluding on the respective shares of the family home.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned too about any possible implications such an approach might have in terms of the subsequent division of property if the court, having decided the matter outside the context of separation proceedings, was subsequently called upon to do so in separation proceedings.  The share which would be decided on in separation proceedings for non-owning spouses would in many cases be greater than that in proceedings under the Bill and I wonder if there would be a danger in practice that the legal profession would think it best to advise their clients that there may be a danger that the outcome of proceedings for a declaration might in some way operate in practice to prejudice their position in subsequent separation proceedings. I know that that certainty would not be the intention of the proposers of the Bill but when looking at the Bill this point struck me.  I would put it no stronger than saying if a measure along the lines of the Bill were to be proceeded with in future it is something which might need to be closely examined.</P>
    <P>I make these points not to be per-nickety <Col N="238" /> about someone else's legislative efforts but simply to raise issues which would call for further examination.  I assure the House that in considering what options might be open to it in this area the Government will have regard to any constructive points made during this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Durkan.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute tonight.  After the initial shock of the Supreme Court decision to rule unconstitutional the Matrimonial Home Bill I felt that, even within the terms of the Supreme Court judgment, there was room to revisit the principle of joint ownership of the matrimonial home.  The Supreme Court was right to reject this Bill because, as framed, it was too expansive.  It sought, in a mandatory way, to impose joint tenancy on all sorts of couples regardless of any arrangements they had come to between themselves and was a disproportionate intervention into the consititutional right and moral authority of the family.  The decision was surprising legally but not totally unpredictable.</P>
      <P>From the day the decision was announced I urged on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that there was still room to revisit the principle in question and, in some more focused manner, to go back to the principle that was endorsed by all sides of the House when debating the Matrimonial Home Bill, and recommended 20 years ago by the First Commission on the Status of Women and supported by the women's movement since then, that marriage is a partnership and that joint ownership of the family home is a recognition of that partnership with particular reference to the non-financial contributions of the spouse who does not work outside the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not believe that, after a short think about it, the Government decided to do nothing about the Supreme Court decision, that it was running away from a principle it had promoted, taking the bottom line of the Supreme Court decision and not the spirit of it which clearly recognised the validity and goodness <Col N="239" /> of the principle but decided that the terms of the Matrimonial Home Bill were too mandatory.  The Minister said he would give careful consideration to revisiting the principle.  However, I do not think we have the time any more.  We have had 20 years of sympathetic and considerate analysis of this issue.  Women are sick and tired of leisurely consideration by Ministers of issues of women's rights and the lethargy of Ministers in progessing women's rights issues, and this issue is long in the tooth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh's Bill was presented as a modest proposal.  It is not all that modest.  It is short and to the point and addresses what we wanted to address in the Matrimonial Home Bill which was that the court decided in the case of L <i>v</i> L that it was not prepared to uphold the principle of extending an equitable right in the family home to the spouse who had not contributed financially to the property. This Bill focuses on that fault in the law and tries to reverse the decision in the case of L <i>v</i> L.  In that case it was stated it was a desirable objective.  The unanimous view of the Supreme Court was that it was a desirable objective that was worth pursuing but that it was not something the court would be properly placed to do and that it was a matter for the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas addressed the matter but got it wrong, and it is shameful for the Government to run away from that principle at the first obstacle.</P>
    <P>We were horrified by the reaction of the Tánaiste to our proposal coming from a Labour Minister who in the past had quite a good reputation on women's rights.  For many years the Labour Party was strong in vocalising issues of interest to women activists.  I was, therefore, doubly horrified that the Tánaiste could show no political grace in the face of a worthy Bill which has been supported outside this House by women's groups. The points made by the Tánaiste showed ignorance of the law and lack of maturity in dealing with an Opposition party.  It was a knee-jerk reaction.</P>
    <P>Although Minister Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="240" /> repeated the same wrong law, she did it with good grace.  I have discussed this matter with constitutional lawyers and with judges who were disappointed with the Supreme Court judgment.  Many of them had suggested to me that at least the decision in the case of L <i>v</i> L could be reversed and some presumption of joint ownership injected into our law in stable marriages, the term the Minister for Equality and Law Reform used in his remarks on our Bill.  I said at the time that it was disappointing that the Government was running away from this principle.  It is disingenuous and dishonest to say that it was never very important and would not affect the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>I note the Tánaiste also said that the Government did not propose to accept the Bill because &ldquo;it would have no practical effect on the law in this area which already contains comprehensive provisions for distribution of ownership of family property between spouses based on non-financial considerations such as working in the home&rdquo;.  Why then was the Matrimonial Home Bill produced and put through this House with such great aplomb?  It is disingenuous to deny in a revisionist way a principle which this Government promoted and all Members of the House supported.  A problem still exists.  Apart from the usual economic dependence and resultant depression, women working in the home still do not have an automatic right to, or even a presumption of, joint ownership in the bricks and mortar within which they toil.  If men were doing the housework and were the primary carers of children for even one generation we would not be here discussing the issue of joint ownership of the family home.  For generations women have carried out that work and many of them now also work outside the home.  Those of us who go out to work have to pay somebody to fill our role in the home and are aware of the expense involved.  Home-makers are the primary carers of children and the elderly, they are the housekeepers, the cleaners, the gardeners and those who pick up all the toys.  It is back-breaking work and women do not complain sufficiently. <Col N="241" /> If men were doing that work we would not be here talking about giving sympathetic consideration to the principle of joint ownership of the family home.  Women have not shouted loud enough and, regrettably, have not had adequate support from men in the conflict and duality of their lives over the years.</P>
    <P>Women's work is not getting easier. For some women the opportunity to be a home-maker is a great privilege as many women have to continue working &mdash; if they are lucky enough to have work &mdash; in order to pay a mortgage.  Others give up work outside the home to care for their children and it is regrettable that they should feel disadvantaged because they do not contribute to the family home.  They believe they do not have a stake in the partnership.  In general, women marry around child bearing age and frequently compromise their working careers by giving up work outside the home to care for their children.</P>
    <P>This matter relates to the economic dependence of women and anyone who listens to the phone-in programmes on radio will be familiar with the stories of depressed women working in the home who believe they do not have economic independence or status.  Much of this relates not only to the belief that they do not have a stake in the family home, but also the belief that they are second class citizens.  A great deal of work needs to be done in the area of equality.  There are so many proposals in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which need to be implemented that the Minister will have to pass some on to his successor.  Will the Minister examine some of those proposals?  This is a simple issue which could change the status of women working in the home.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the comments of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in regard to the Judicial Separation Act.  The making of property adjustment orders under that legislation refers only to marital breakdown whereas this Bill provides that, if a husband dies, a wife can apply to increase her share in the estate.  Under her succession rights <Col N="242" /> she would be entitled to either one-third or one-half of the estate, but it would be great if before that subdivision took place she was entitled to joint ownership in the family home.  Women who work in the home do not earn any money and work like dogs day after day taking care of everybody but themselves.  In many cases they are isolated while their husbands go out to work, live independent lives and have money to spend.  Mean husbands are very common and women married to such men do not even have the psychological feeling of owning half the family home.</P>
    <P>We should not be obsessed with marriage breakdown.  Even in stable marriages it would be great for women to know that even though they are working hard they at least own half the house. They do not have that security at present and it seriously affects their confidence, an issue which has not been taken on board by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that none of the female Members of the Labour Part contributed to this debate.  They have not been to the fore on equality issues and have not contributed to many debates on such issues.  Perhaps they are mortified, as they should be, if they intend voting against a Bill which has its heart in the right place.  It may not be perfect but we do not have the resources of the Government with its paid legal advisers, the staff of the Department and a plethora of programme managers and advisers.  We carry out all the work ourselves.  It was most ungracious of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to say that this Bill was written on the back of an envelope.  He does not have a right to mention the backs of envelopes when one considers the night of the long fourchette.</P>

      <P>It was probably written on the back of a packet of cigarettes in a bar in Europe.  It is typical of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be tetchy and take personally any criticism directed at the Government.  I note that <Col N="243" /> Fianna Fáil Ministers take criticism very well, they are probably used to it after many years of Opposition criticism.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was ungracious, arrogant and acted like a real boot boy.  It is disappointing that he should take that approach to what is valid and reasonable legislation.  It is certainly better than nothing.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform was quietly considering and being sympathetic to this issue, but that will not get us anywhere.  Time is running out.  We will soon have the summer recess.  Who will put forward this principle?  It will not be dealt with before the divorce referendum. This, together with the constitutional challenge on the Judicial Separation Bill, bodes ill for the success of the entire package.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out the defects of the Family Law Bill which in many respects is sailing on the same rocky and stormy seas as the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I sometimes wonder about the quality of work put into legislation going through the House.  It was dishonest of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to say that these are separate matters.  This Bill is part of the package which contains divorce legislation, the Family Law Bill and so on.  They all relate to sorting out domestic politics within the home and deal with how men and women organise their lives in stable as well as unstable marriages.  We should not be obsessed with the breakdown of marriage. Stable marriages and those coasting along also need support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is commendable that an allocation has been made to mediation and legal aid services.  If divorce is introduced here &mdash; as I hope it will &mdash; there will be a flood of applications to avail of it.  Thousands of people are awaiting the opportunity to reorganise their lives in a civilised way to allow them to sort out the difficulties with which they have had to deal in the legislative limbo because nobody would face up to the divorce issue.  There was great disappointment on the last occasion when the divorce referendum was lost even though there was more optimism <Col N="244" /> and pro-active enthusiasm for the issue at that time.  Much work needs to be done in that area and I look forward to the initiative which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the Government will make to convince our people that the way forward is to allow people to remarry.  I criticised the Family Law Bill and said it does not sufficiently deal with the emotional maintenance of children &mdash; it is steeped in the adversarial style of separation and divorce characteristic of the situation in the United Kingdom.  It is not enthusiastic about promoting joint custody orders and goes along with jaded notions which have failed in the United Kingdom.  It is unimaginative and requires courage and research to study how other jurisdictions have dealt with child custody and maintenance.  We will table amendments to the Family Law Bill in relation to joint custody orders.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate the Progressive Democrats on introducing the Bill.  This is a timely focus on an issue which has faced us for some time and which ultimately must be dealt with. I was disappointed by the Tánaiste's attitude when he accused the Opposition of playing politics with this issue.  The Opposition is always accused of that if it seeks to be progressive or helpful.  They are the whipping boys or whipping girls and blamed when something goes wrong but the Government appeals to the Opposition for assistance if it loses out on £1 billion or £2 billion in Europe or elsewhere, seeks support for Maastricht or on a national issue.  It does not appeal to the Opposition on matters that are part and parcel of the daily operations of the Government as in the case of appointing advisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It rings hollow that the Government should accuse the Opposition <Col N="245" /> of playing politics with an emotive issue requiring a great deal of attention, compassion and effort by everybody.  The Opposition is being progressive and helpful considering that it does not have the research and back-up resources of Government.  This legislation will alert the Government to the fact that the Opposition and the public are concerned about its lethargy and will.  I hope, galvanise it into action.</P>
      <P>The recent soundings in this area seem to indicate that the Government considers itself unpopular.  It may consider that now is not a good time to introduce legislation in this area.  It may have cold feet in this regard and perhaps that is why it criticised the Opposition and suggested it should remain silent and not raise issues with which it promised to deal.  Those issues should be identified as being on the agenda already and the Opposition is entitled to ask when, how and where this issue will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>If divorce is introduced it will not be mandatory but it is required to meet the needs of a changing society.  There is no sense in revisionism.  We must recognise that society is changing and the Government should have courage and give leadership on an issue such as this.  If the Government bungles so be it.  There are many cases of marriage breakdown involving repeated violence.  All Deputies will have dealt with such cases. I have dealt with scores of them.  In 99 per cent of cases women are the victims and it is very difficult to say to a woman in such circumstances that she is married for better or worse and must bear with the situation; that is not a compassionate attitude.  People say that if divorce is introduced it will encourage second and third relationships which will also fail. That argument does not stand up.  If that argument is applied people should not be allowed to marry in the first instance. People are not perfect.  Only one person was perfect and he was crucified.</P>

      <P>We do not have the right to judge people trapped in that situation. There is no point in saying that when divorce was introduced in other countries it led to serious problems &mdash; those problems existed already.  It is not true that because one marriage failed a future marriage will fail.  Many people are involved in second and third relationships here which do not have a legal imprimatur. Those associations are illegal in the eyes of the State.  Naturally, no church encourages divorce and people do their best to make their marriages work.</P>
      <P>In the event of relations breaking down why should we sit in judgment and tell those people who have not been perfect that they have failed and must live with that for the rest of their lives?  I would ask the Minister to take on board this matter.  The necessary measures should be implemented now and should not be put off until tomorrow when it may be too late.</P>
      <P>I was less than impressed with the Tánaiste's remarks on this matter.  All he could do was pour cold water on the proposal brought forward by the Progressive Democrats, which we fully support, and suggest it is playing politics. Will the Government please stop playing politics?  It should deal with an issue it has promised to deal with and stop running away from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important and sensitive subject.  A referendum was held some years ago to try to address the problem of marital breakdown and the Oireachtas has gone to great lengths in setting up committees to deal with the problem.  A White Paper was published by the Government and a specific report was published on the question of matrimonial difficulties.  The speech made by Deputy Durkan is the kind of speech people expect from the Legislature because it reflects the balance that is <Col N="247" /> necessary in dealing with a personal matter between a husband and wife whose marriage is in difficulty.  This is a matter which the Government, with the support of the Opposition parties, which is essential to the success of the referendum, must deal with in a skilful and comprehensive manner before it is put to the people.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members were reassured tonight by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who reconfirmed the Government's commitment to proceed with the referendum.  Both parties in Government are committed to the Programme for Government which was published before our party accepted ministerial responsibility and before the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party accepted its role in this area and many other areas of social legislation.  Individual members of all parties express the views of constituents. The Government's commitment to holding a divorce referendum is set down in the Programme for Government and it intends to meet that commitment.</P>
      <P>Doubts have been expressed by speakers, particularly from the Progressive Democrats Party, about the commitment of the Government, particularly the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Marvyn Taylor, who is listening to this debate.  We should re-emphasise for those who have doubts and concerns in this area the commitment given by the two parties in Government.  Under the heading, &ldquo;Women's Rights&rdquo;, the programme states: &ldquo;In addition to the Equal Status Act, the Minister for Equality will pursue a broad programme of institutional, administrative and legislative reform aimed at enhancing the rights of women&rdquo;.  Progressive Democrats' spokespersons cannot accuse Members of the Labour Party of not availing of every possible opportunity to defend and enhance the rights of women.</P>

      <P>Bills should not be introduced overnight and people should have an opportunity to consider their contents. The Progressive Democrats should not expect the Government to go down on its knees and say that only for it the Government could not legislate in this social area.  That party chose a time to introduce the Bill when it knew the Minister responsible was not available to respond.  The Minister will be available tomorrow night to respond in a manner appropriate to Private Member's legislation. I defend the right of Opposition parties to introduce such legislation. When my party was in Opposition I published Private Members' Bills which were not always accepted.  This Government has accepted relevant Bills, but surely the Progressive Democrats do not expect the <Col N="249" /> Government to accept a Bill that is defective.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government, which the Progressive Democrats have always questioned &mdash; it also questioned the commitment of the Labour Party &mdash; states that in the short term, reform in this area will include necessary changes in Government Departments and functions for which the Minister present will have responsibility, as in the case of equality for women.  The programme states that there will be major family law reform, culminating in a divorce referendum in 1994, modernisation of the law on nullity and so on.  The Government is committed to implementing this programme.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste stated in his speech on this issue:</P>
      <P>The Family Law Bill, 1994 now before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is one of the most extensive pieces of family law legislation to be initiated in recent times.  It has measures aimed at protecting and safeguarding the institution of marriage and it provides substantial powers to the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown in certain cases.  Those powers will in substance be the same as the powers in any divorce legislation and they include wide powers in relation to maintenance, lump sums and property generally, including the family home and pensions.</P>
      <P>That is what the Family Law Bill is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also made changes in the area of tax and social welfare, a matter that has been taken up, and rightly so, by members of the hierarchy. The Hierarchy preach about the importance of marriage and of the role of the family as the basic unit in society.  None of us would deny them the right to do <Col N="250" /> that.  I do not think anyone would suggest that one should not support the concept of the family unit as the basic unit in society.</P>
    <P>The Government has given a commitment to deal with the issues of tax and social welfare, particularly as they relate to marital breakdown.  Councillors and other public representatives are confronted every week with problems about housing and income.  It is extraordinary that in the last referendum on divorce some people whose marriages had broken down did not vote in favour of divorce.  Some women in my constituency whose lives had been ruined by brutality and other problems were reluctant to give their husbands the freedom to ruin other women's lives.  There are many sides to this issue which the Government is approaching in a sensitive manner.  None of us should disregard the impact of marital breakdown on the lives of the people involved and their children.</P>
    <P>The Government will base the divorce referendum on the legal right of a person to have a second chance of happiness. Contrary to what the Hierarchy thinks, this will be a legal, as opposed to a moral, right if the referendum is passed.  The Government has agreed that property transfers between spouses whose marriages are dissolved following divorce or are annulled should be dealt with on the same basis as transfers between spouses. It has also agreed that the necessary changes in social welfare should be made to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced or anulled.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste in his speech, which was seen by many people as offensive, said that there was no similarity between this Bill and the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People are entitled to question his opinion, but the Tánaiste is as entitled as any member of the Progressive Democrats to express his view.  He said that the object of the Matrimonial Home Bill was to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home and contents, unless they already had those rights.  This is why the Supreme Court decided to declare the Matrimonial Home Bill unconstitutional &mdash; it was deemed to unduly interfere in arrangements about the family home already agreed between spouses.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>It would be a mistake, however, to think that the various protections now in place, most notably the Succession Act, 1965, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, have been adversely affected by the decision of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Government is actively examining the ways in which these protections might be strengthened and affirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Equality and Law Reform made a similar statement in the House when he expressed his disappointment at the decision of the <Col N="252" /> Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill.  The Tánaiste continued:</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the Government no longer believes in promoting the concept of equality of ownership rights in the matrimonial home. However, if meaningful reform in this area is to be attained, any legislation must secure a real and tangible interest for a non-owning spouse in the matrimonial home.  If this were not to be the case, any legislation would lack credibility.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste dealt in his speech with the inadequacies of the Progressive Democrats Bill.  He is as entitled to express his view as are the sponsors of the Bill to say this is the best Bill brought before the House.  I do not have any problem with that.</P>

      <P>The legislation necessary for the divorce referendum will require the support of all Members.  It should be remembered that vested interests, legal and otherwise, and others, genuinely believe that the introduction of divorce will in some way disturb the concept of the family unit.  All the necessary legislation will have to be beyond doubt and constitutional so that no questions can be raised about its implications for property, etc.  In the past it was the side issues, so to speak, which gave rise to the problems &mdash; some farmers did not mind that their marriages had broken down but they did not want to give their wives half of the livestock or property; people were not worried about making some legal arrangement as regards their marriage but they were worried about ownership of property, particularly as it related to agricultural property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has introduced some key legislation in the family law area.  Deputy McDowell said he would avail of the opportunity to introduce relevant amendments to the Bill to which I referred.  This would be a welcome extension of democracy.  The other measures introduced by the Government are being debated publicly by the Hierarchy and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to the need for the Government to allocate additional funding to the Free Legal Aid Board and to make clear its reasons for addressing the issue of marital breakdown. The Minister has taken into consideration the situation in rural areas &mdash; there is more to Ireland than Dublin 4 &mdash; where people are trying to survive, many of whom may be sceptical about divorce.  It will not be easy to carry this referendum.  In order to ensure that it is carried, something which I think all members of the Government and Opposition parties want, we must put in place <Col N="254" /> all the necessary legislation.  If it is not in place, and I agree with statements that have been made by the Opposition, the likelihood of losing this referendum is quite possible and we will all then have a responsibility to address the problem of the 60,000, 70,000 or 80,000 broken marriages, the partners of which are living in devastation and outside the law. The children of those marriages, and the children of the new unions, are all suffering and none of them can voice an opinion.  Those of us dealing with the problems caused by marital breakdown are aware of the implications for children and, therefore, must ensure that all aspects of this issue are addressed, property rights, women's rights within the home, the rights of children or the rights of extended families of married couples.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of families are quite happily trying to cope with the every day problems in life and are trying to make a go of their marriages.  That does not, however, allow us the comfort of sitting back and saying &ldquo;I am all right, Jack&rdquo; and forgetting about everybody else.  We all have a responsibility to address the real problem, which is to give an opportunity to people to make another start in life and to find happiness.  That is a basic human right.  The morality of it can be argued and preached about, and I defend that, but we must be conscious of those other rights also.</P>
    <P>One of the women Members of the Labour Party, on a recent radio programme with Deputy Durkan, put her case in this regard and there was no comment made about her views.  I am referring to Deputy Shortall who has a view on this matter and who, through no fault of her own, has had no opportunity to express that view in the House.  There are times when opportunities on the floor of the House may not be available.  That is a possibility which one must accept.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats say that this Bill comes under the area of law reform but the Government is correct when it states that the legislation before us could actually cause more harm than good if implemented.  The Bill is supposed to deal with disputes between spouses in relation to the matrimonial home.  The issue is a complex and difficult one requiring careful study, which the Minister has said he will do in consultation with the Attorney General.  The Government is obliged to heed the advice of the Attorney General whether the Opposition like it or not.  That is the <Col N="257" /> structure of Government and we must ensure as a Government party that no subsequent legal difficulties arise from this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue this evening.  I also thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming into the House to hear what I have to say on this matter which I raised with him last evening.  This matter was brought to my attention by a number of people who live on the northern side of the Border and, indeed, by people living on the southern side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago I had occasion to highlight incidents which had happened in the Crossmaglen area and caused a number of locals grave difficulty.  Those incidents <Col N="260" /> gave an indication of some of the increased security presence with which locals have had to contend.  That was before the horrific attack on the British Army base by terrorists which I condemn unreservedly.  Subsequently that incident was condemned by local councillor, John Fee, who as we all know was later beaten up, albeit in relation to that incident.</P>
    <P>These incidents took place over the past two or three months, that area having been relatively quiet before that. The reason I am making representations about incidents which took place outside my constituency on the other side of the Border is because on Sunday night a considerable number of British Army and RUC personnel descended on Crossmaglen and began to dig in in and around private property.  They took over people's gardens, yards and, in some cases, fields adjacent to the four access roads to Crossmaglen.  In recent days they have been digging in, literally sealing off the town.  They worked throughout last night.  They have erected concrete bollards in such a manner as to stagger all the traffic coming in and out of Crossmaglen.  They also erected concrete pillboxes on each of the roads.  It would appear the intention is to have permanent checkpoints at Crossmaglen, in other words, to completely seal off the town.</P>
    <P>The RUC distributed leaflets to the town's inhabitants the day before yesterday, saying that they would be engaging in this exercise for the next three months, that they were repairing the security installation in Crossmaglen and were sorry for the inconvenience being caused to locals.  In effect Crossmaglen has been turned into a ghost town for the past two days.  Crossmaglen has been given a bad name, but there have been tremendous efforts by locals to regenerate the south Armagh area.  For example, a very active voluntary group, ROSA, in conjunction with the International Fund for Ireland, Co-operation North and a number of other organisations, <Col N="261" /> has been trying to regenerate some economic growth into the area.</P>
    <P>What has happened over the past few days is extremely worrying in that regard. There is a feeling in the area that this is a response to recent incidents, that the security forces are making the people pay for what happened.  This appears to be giving all the wrong signals bearing in mind the efforts the two Governments have been making following the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  There was wholehearted condemnation by locals of the savage attack on Councillor Fee. There was a feeling that perhaps latent support for any terrorism would have vanished following that incident but the exercise instigated by the British Army and the RUC in recent days in effect has jeopardised any goodwill.  The British authorities are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this regard and what they are doing will prove totally counterproductive. It appears they will be erecting not only permanent checkpoints but also permanent look-out towers on all the approach roads to Crossmaglen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to raise this matter with the British authorities.  He may say that he is concerned about it &mdash; I accept that he and the Government are concerned &mdash; but our security forces are mirroring some of the checkpoints on the northern side of the Border in Crossmaglen. That is causing locals difficulty in that, quite apart from diverting Garda resources from other areas in County Louth, to a certain extent it is putting it up to them.  There is some resentment at the manner in which this has taken place. I ask the Tánaiste to raise this matter with the British authorities.  I understand that my counterpart, Mr. Séamus Mallon, has been in contact with the Department and I ask the Tánaiste to take what I said into account.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Dermot Ahern for raising this important matter on the adjournment. <Col N="262" /> Crossmaglen and the surrounding area in south Armagh have suffered greatly from the violence that has affected Northern Ireland over the past 25 years.  More than most areas along the Border, Crossmaglen has been caught in a spiral of paramilitary violence which has been going on for far too long and has cost too many lives.  This is turn has resulted in the deployment of large numbers of the security forces in the area, thus inevitably creating further strains and increasing the dislocation suffered by the local community. It is in this context that there is understandably a great deal of concern among the people of Crossmaglen at the impact locally of the building works on which the British authorities have now embarked.</P>
      <P>I have made known to the British authorities my concern at these developments. I fear that they may serve to heighten tensions and inflame local opinion.  I am aware from contacts which my Department has had with representative figures and with people living in the area how widespread and genuinely felt are the concerns of the local community.  I know, for example, that the local GAA Club in Crossmaglen is understandably concerned about the likely impact on the use of its playing fields, at what would normally be a very busy time for the club.  We have on previous occasions intervened through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat to seek to minimise the disruption caused to the Crossmaglen club, whose premises are adjacent to the base.  It would be regrettable if the situation at the club, which it was hoped had been eased, if not totally resolved, should again become a source of controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it must be acknowledged that the security forces have to take reasonable measures to protect members of the police and the British Army.  The question about which the Deputy, and I know others both inside and outside the House are concerned, is whether in deciding to go ahead with these works <Col N="263" /> sufficient attention was paid to the likely overall effect on the local community. There is a very real concern that the primary beneficiaries of this exercise will be the paramilitaries, who are of course poised to exploit any increase in tension for their own propaganda purposes.  I am concerned that the decision comes at a sensitive time when there may be elements in Northern Ireland who would seek to capitalise on any increase in tensions to further complicate the search for a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>Constitutional politicians like Séamús Mallon, and Crossmaglen councillor John Fee, who was recently beaten up for daring to oppose IRA mortar attacks that endangered the lives of ordinary people in the town, have courageously stood against paramilitary violence over the years.  It is only right that we should listen carefully to what they and others have to say about this development. Séamus Mallon has expressed the view that this operation plays straight into the hands of the IRA.  Many will be inclined to agree with him.  I note that a thoughtful editorial in this morning's edition of the <i>Irish News</i>, while rightly emphasising the importance of ensuring that the lives of members of the security forces were not put at risk, has emphasised the likelihood that measures of this kind are seriously counterproductive, even in purely security terms.  We have made known our views in this regard to the British authorities on many previous occasions and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation in Crossmaglen I can assure the House that I will continue to monitor closely developments in and around the town.  As previously indicated we have taken steps to bring home to the British authorities our concern at the inconvenience, disruption and general worsening of relations between the local community and the security forces which is likely to follow.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government will remain active within the framework of <Col N="264" /> the Anglo-Irish Agreement in emphasising to the British authorities the need to take all possible measures, and to exercise maximum restraint, so as to limit as far as possible the negative impact on the local community.  We will press that any inconvenience should be kept to an absolute minimum, and that the people of Crossmaglen should be allowed to go about their business with the least possible disruption.  Where particular difficulties arise we will be ready to pursue them with the British authorities and to seek whatever remedial action is possible.</P>
    <P>The House will also wish to know that I will be availing of the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to review all matters arising from the present situation in Crossmaglen.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing Deputy Byrne and me to raise this matter this evening.  At a recent seminar in County Wexford there was considerable discussion about new moves on interregional co-operation between Wexford and south-west Wales.  This seminar was sponsored jointly by Wexford County Council, Dyfed County Council, Preseli-Pembrokeshire District Council and South Pembrokeshire District Council. State, semi-State, local authority and many commercial organisations and community groups were represented at the seminar at very senior level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the top of the agenda was a discussion on how to ensure that the south east of Ireland and south west Wales would benefit from EU funding for cross Border initiatives.  INTERREG II is about to come on stream and proposals under this EU funded scheme include provision for the extension of cross border initiatives to maritime borders, including those of Ireland and Wales. The seminar emphasised the necessity to develop the southern corridor crossings. Considerable investment is needed in <Col N="265" /> infrastructure which service Welsh ports and the development of the roads out of these ports which eventually service motorways.  The southern corridor crossings &mdash; the sea routes between Cork and Rosslare and the west Wales ports of Swansea, Fishguard and Pembroke &mdash; are of immeasurable importance to the economy of the south east and of south west Wales.</P>
    <P>However, in spite of their importance being recognised in the national plan, they were not included in the recently published draft of INTERREG II EU proposals.  There is, therefore, a distinct danger that the development of Rosslare, and the ports in south west Wales may fall behind development of other ports here and in Britain.  This would have severe consequences for the development of the infrastructural needs including the road and rail service to the ports.</P>
    <P>A final decision will be announced before the end of May as to what regions and projects will be eligible for EU funding. Those at the seminar were determined that no stone would be left unturned in convincing the EC Commission, the committee of the regions, MEPs and Deputies in this House of the importance of the case for south west Wales and Wexford.  Apart from EU funding, those at the seminar were determined to work together to establish closer links with south west Wales and south east Ireland.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tonight assure us in Wexford that we have the full support of the Government to include the maritime link between Wexford and south west Wales as part of our case for INTERREG II funding?  We want to be sure the Government supports our endeavours to develop this most important area that will be the only land bridge between Ireland and the rest of Europe.  We await the Minister's positive response to our call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle and I raise this matter out of growing concern that Dyfed in Wales and Wexford may <Col N="266" /> not be included in the next round of INTERREG funding.  The fact that only in exceptional cases will maritime boundaries be accepted as proper boundaries underlines the land-locked attitude of Brussels.  It is a pity that EU bureaucracy is not orientated towards the peripheral or coastal regions of the Community.  Wexford and south Wales have links that are at least as meangingful as any links Wexford may have with the west.  Wexford has always looked across the seas for her commerce.  Until modern times oral language of south Wexford was living proof of the European identity of the area.  To exclude Wexford and Dyfed from the scheme would be to make a travesty of its supposed aims.  No two regions in Europe have been so intimately linked for so long.  Many of my neighbours work in Wales and the rich Welsh lilt can be heard in many parts of Ireland, including Wexford.</P>
      <P>INTERREG is supposed to foster economic links between the regions. Specific projects have been suggested by Wexford and Dyfed County Councils and by the Welsh Office.  Chief among these projects are the development of information technologies for small and medium-sized businesses telecottaging and manufactured woollens.  Such projects are tailormade for populations that are largely rural and well educated.  Wexford and Dyfed deserve to be included in the INTERREG scheme.  With Deputy Doyle I ask the Government to pursue Wexford's inclusion in the scheme as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>INTERREG is a Community initiative under the EU Structural Funds.  Its objective is to promote cross-border co-operation and support the economic development of border areas.  During the last Structural Fund round, there was a joint Ireland/Northern Ireland programme under INTERREG.  The eligible areas comprised Counties Cavan, Donegal, <Col N="267" /> Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo in the south and all of Northern Ireland except Belfast.  All of the border areas in the community covered by the first INTERREG initiative were land border areas with the exceptions of Kent/Nord-Pas de Calais and Corsica/Sardinia.</P>
      <P>In June 1993, the European Commission published a consultative document on community initiatives in the new Structural Fund round covering the period 1994-1999.  In that document the Commission said that it would prefer to maintain the general rule that maritime borders do not qualify, while being prepared to examine specific cases, especially where this would be of benefit to Objective I regions, to determine whether genuine cross-border co-operation possibilities exist.</P>
      <P>In putting forward its views on the consultative document, the Government said that access to the Community through the west coast UK ports was of vital strategic importance to Ireland and that a maritime INTERREG programme for Ireland and the UK was considered essential to eliminate infrastructural bottlenecks.  The Government also said that within the context of such a programme other co-operative measures could be covered.</P>
      <P>In February 1994 the Commission produced its proposals for Community initiatives to cover the period 1994-1999. In the case of INTERREG, it proposed that in addition to the maritime border areas covered under the previous initiative, the borders between southern Italy and Greece and between Ireland and North Wales should also be eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft guidelines for the new INTERREG initiative included &mdash; as well as the North/South Border area as before &mdash; Gwynedd in Wales and the east region in Ireland.  The Commission have been using the old planning regions for the purposes of defining NUTS III level regions, so east in that context covers Counties Dublin, Kildare, Meath and <Col N="268" /> Wicklow.  This area corresponds with the Dublin and mid-east regions for the new regional authorities which were established earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals will now be considered by the management committee on Community initiatives comprising representatives of the member states.  They will also be considered by the European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions.  Following this consultation process, the Commission will adopt the final guidelines for initiatives. It is understood that it hopes to do this in June.</P>
    <P>The Irish authorities will press strongly for the extension of the eligible areas under INTERREG to include the southeast, including County Wexford, and the county of Dyfed in Wales.  We have been in touch with the Welsh Office in the United Kingdom and understand they will be taking the same position.  We consider the case for this to be strong having regard to the importance of the transport links between the two regions and to the co-operative linkages that have been built up between local authorities and other groups on each side.  Ultimately, it will be primarily a matter for the Commission to decide on this issue but we will do all we can to secure a favourable outcome.</P>
    <P>Work is already under way between Departments in Ireland and Wales on the preparation of a programme.  I met Sir Wyn Roberts, MP, Minister of State at the Welsh Office, in December for discussions on a joint programme and we are arranging a further meeting in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and I am pleased that the Minister for Justice is dealing with it.  Women have a clearer insight into the damage done to society by the proliferation of video nasties and pornographic material of every kind. <Col N="269" /> Professor Elizabeth Newsom, head of the child development unit of Nottingham University, in a report published last week established a clear and direct link between the tragic murder of Jamie Bolger and the video viewing habits of the children who perpetrated that horrendous murder.  In her report she said, &ldquo;I feel we have a large number of children today who are already totally desensitised by violence&rdquo;.  That means there is a large number of children who, in moral terms, have no conscience and do not know the difference between right and wrong.  That is a shocking indictment of the manner in which children are raised in this generation.  Any further complacency on foot of those findings would leave us all standing condemned.</P>
      <P>I predict the day will come when another report will be brought out identifying a clear and direct connection between the viewing of pornographic material and the rising incidence of rape and related sexual degradation of women and children.  That is a matter for a wider debate.  I am asking that the office of the national censor be given all necessary resources to ensure the law is fully enforced in all elements; that a law be put in place the effect of which would be to exclude all children from the adult section of video shops and libraries; that new and strict controls be put in place at all distribution outlets with severe cash penalties for anyone breaching the controls; that steps be taken to ensure all outlets are licensed and a separate licence is required for each outlet and appropriate taxation measures introduced to put all video nasties beyond the price range of young people.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing the measures the Minister proposes to introduce.  I ask her to ensure that they are carefully monitored. If they fail to have the intended effect, women like me will come back to the House demanding nothing short of a total ban on certain categories of video nasties and pornographic material.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil den Teachta Quill as ucht an cheist seo a ordú ar an Athló trathnóna agus deis a thabhairt domsa a mhíniú go díreach céard atá ag tarlú.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate public concern about video nasties and their potential for inducing and encouraging certain persons to commit crime &mdash; particularly crime against women and children.  I am personally convinced that these awful films can have such effects on vulnerable or perverted minds whatever experts may say about the lack of hard evidence. Sometimes it seems as well to use our common sense.  Personally, I am determined to do all in my power to protect society from video nasties.  The Video Recordings Act, 1989 was enacted with the twin aims of prohibiting trade in so-called video nasties and introducing regulatory controls on the video business, with a particular view to regulating the types of videos which would be available to children and young persons under 18 years.</P>
      <P>With a view to achieving these aims, three levels of control were provided for in the Act.  Two of these &mdash; licensing of dealers and power to prohibit videos regarded as not fit for viewing by the film censor &mdash; are in operation.  The third level of control which will require all new videos coming on the market to be submitted to the censor for certification and classification will be brought into operation by way of regulations which I hope to make very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 require all whole salers and retailers, including renters of videos, to be registered with the film censor's office and to display appropriate licences on their premises.  These have been operating since 1991.  A very important element of this licensing control is the fact that the licences may be forfeited by order of the courts in the event of the holder being convicted of certain offences under the Act.  This can <Col N="271" /> happen now if a licence holder trades in prohibited videos.  In other words, the courts can put the owner of a shop renting or selling video nasties out of business in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Also, since 1991, the film censor has had power under the Act to prohibit by order any video which comes to his attention which he considers, by reference to criteria set out in the Act, to be unfit for viewing &mdash; this covers the so-called video nasties.  To date, the censor has made orders prohibiting 940 videos and orders are in the pipeline in respect of approximately 1,000 more.</P>
    <P>The third level of control provided for in the Act, which will be introduced by regulation, will require all new videos coming on the market to be submitted to the censor for certification as to their suitability for viewing and for classification by reference to the age groups for which they are deemed suitable.  Also, they will provide that the copies of the videos then going on the market must carry official labels indicating that they have been certified by the censor and displaying the age class classification assigned.</P>
    <P>These regulations are being finalised in the Attorney General's Office and I hope to be in a position to make them very shortly.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined are being implemented in close consultation with the video industry which &mdash; and I would like to put this on record &mdash; is largely comprised of responsible and public spirited people who are as anxious as everyone else to see the unacceptable trade in video nasties suppressed.</P>
    <P>Parents too will have to play their part. Shortly, when videos on the shelves begin to carry the censor's age classification, it will be a matter for parents to ensure that their children do not watch videos which are not suitable for their age.  The law cannot follow people into their living rooms.  Parents will have to check the <Col N="272" /> classifications which will be clearly displayed on the videos and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is open to anyone who comes across a video which they think should not be on sale to refer it to the censor's office for examination.  There is no fee or charge for this and I would encourage people with genuine concerns to do so.</P>
    <P>When the Video Recordings Act is fully in operation &mdash; which it will be shortly &mdash; I will be closely monitoring its effectiveness. If it emerges that more needs to be done at the statutory level it will be done.  I am aware that something which is not covered by the Video Recordings Act is mere possession of video nasties as opposed to possession for supply.  I intend to have this matter examined, particularly in relation to videos which portray children in a sexual or violent context for the paedophile market.  This is a particularly obnoxious trade which may require to be addressed specifically. I am having the matter looked at as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important issue but I am disappointed that neither the Minister nor Minister of State is present. However, I realise this is due to constraints of work.  The problem was caused by the attitude of the Minister.  Hopefully she is prepared to reconsider her stance.</P>
      <P>For almost 25 years UCC students have been represented on the governing body of the college by the president of the students union.  Unfortunately this has not been the case since July 1993.  The governing body met several times last year to discuss matters of importance to students who were not represented at those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the tradition for the Minister for Education to appoint the president of the students union to the governing body under the National Universities Act, 1908.  The current president <Col N="273" /> of the UCC students union.  Mr. Fergal Shanahan, has been in constant correspondence with the Minister since his appointment in 1993 seeking clarification as to why he has not been appointed.  Unfortunately he did not get a satisfactory response to his queries.</P>
    <P>When I put down a written question to the Minister on 1 February she informed me that it had been the practice for the president of the students union to be appointed to the governing body as a Government nominee but consideration had to be given to the question of gender balance in relation to such appointees. The Minister's action has left students without representation on the governing body for the first time in 25 years.</P>
    <P>Students at UCC who spend millions of pounds on college fees are being denied a say in how these moneys will be spent by a Minister who said last autumn in the run up to the National Educational Convention that she wished students to have a strong voice in the future of Irish education. In the next month or so the governing body will meet to discuss the fees structure for 1994-95 and the students will not be represented.  The democratic wish of UCC students, male and female, is that they be represented on the governing body by the president of the students union, Mr. Shanahan, but unfortunately the Minister is going against the democratic wishes of the students.  She is doing so on the basis of gender balance but it appears to me to be going overboard to be politically correct. The Minister should listen to the pleas of the students union.  UCC students have democratically elected a president and he is entitled to sit on the governing body. The Minister should get off her high horse and respond to the demand of students to have their president, as was the case heretofore, on the governing body of UCC.</P>
    <P>I do not expect a detailed response from the Minister of State but I hope she will transmit the strong pleas by UCC students that their democratically elected <Col N="274" /> president should be on the board of the UCC governing body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education who cannot be here.  I would like to reply to the points the Deputy made.</P>
      <P>The National University of Ireland and its three constituent colleges at Dublin, Cork and Galway operate under the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and the associated charters.  These charters, <i>inter alia</i>, prescribe the composition of the governing bodies of the colleges and the Minister has no discretionary power in relation to the matter.</P>
      <P>The charter under which University College Cork operates provides for a governing body of 28 members and while there are provisions in the charter whereby the professors of the college elect six members and the graduates of the college elect four members, there is no provision for student representation.</P>
      <P>There is a provision, however, whereby the Government appoints three members and in order to make up for the lack of provision for student representation it has been the practice for the Government since the early seventies to appoint the president of the students union in the college as a Government nominee.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Government is anxious that there should be an appropriate gender balance on the boards or governing authorities of all public bodies.  This creates certain difficulties in bodies where some of the members are elected and others appointed <i>ex-officio</i>.  The charter provides for a governing body of 28 members and the question of an appropriate gender balance inevitably arises.  The governing body consists of 24 males and three females and there is one vacancy. The current president of the students union is also male and his appointment would not contribute to improving the gender balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned, however, <Col N="275" /> regarding the question of student representation and the Deputy will be aware that in the recent regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology legislation there are specific provisions for student representation.  In the newer universities too.  Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, there are provisions for student representation and <Col N="276" /> in the National College of Art and Design.  In this context, therefore, a proposal will be put to Government next week to appoint a student representative to the governing body of University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 April 1994.</P>

        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): Is é an aidhm atá ag mo Roinnse ná go mbeidh áiseanna oiriúnacha calaíochta ar Thoraigh a luaithe is féidir chun freastal ar riachtanais na seirbhíse farantóireachta chuig an oileán agus ar riachtanais phobal an oileáin i gcoitinne.  Chuige sin tá deontas breise lánchostais (anuas ar chúnamh de £43,600 a íocadh cheana i leith suirbhéanna agus staidéir éagsúla) nach rachaidh thar £150,000 ceadaithe agam le cúpla mí anuas chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara suirbhéanna riachtanacha breise, i.e., suirbhé hídreagrafach móide tástáil suímh, a dhéanamh ar an láthair i mbliana.  Tá gá leis an obair sin chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara pleananna agus meastachán costais a ullmhú. Breithneofar an cheist tuilleadh nuair a bheidh na pleananna agus an meastachán costais sin ar fáil.  Tuigim go bhfuil Roinn na Mara tar éis comhairleoir a cheapadh le déanaí chun dul i mbun na suirbhéanna breise.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 25, 26, 44, 47, 52 and 54 on 15 December last in which I indicated my intention to establish a dynamic dialogue with the cultural institutions for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the process of dialogue and consultation is now well under way, but that there are no terms of reference attaching to it.  On 15 February last, I met with the chairperson and directors of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Abbey Theatre.  The meeting provided all concerned with the opportunity to have a full and frank discussion on my proposals.  I indicated to the representatives of the institutions that I looked forward to obtaining their detailed views on my proposals after they had an opportunity to discuss the matter with their full boards, and that I was open to considering any alternative proposals which they might wish to make in the matter.  I hope that the boards concerned will be in a position to let me have their views very soon.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the transmission and licensing aspects of Cablelink's advertising proposals are matters for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  In this regard, in replying to questions on this issue on 9 December 1993, he indicated that, following full consideration of the Cablelink advertising proposals, he had formed the view that there were other options available which need not involve the insertion of advertising by Cablelink and that he had asked Cablelink and other cable and MMDS companies to explore these options with the satellite television companies &mdash; Volume No. 437, Columns 93 to 96 of the Dáil Official Report for that date refers.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications answered a question on the outcome of this approach on 30 March last.</P>
      <P>I fully support the approach taken by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as I believe that the advertising proposals would have had grave repercussions for Irish media generally and broadcasting in particular.</P>

      <P>The Georgian buildings at Nos. 88 and 89 Merrion Square were handed over to the National Gallery by the Office of Public Works on 7 August 1992.  In late 1992-early 1993, one of the buildings, 88 Merrion Square, was competely refurbished to a high standard by the Office of Public Works as office accommodation for the use of gallery staff who had previously been housed in unsuitable offices.  The facade <Col N="65" /> of No. 88 was not altered in any way during this refurbishment project.</P>
      <P>At present the Office of Public Works is refurbishing the basements of Nos. 88 and 89 Merrion Square as premises for the gallery's library.  When complete, the refurbished library will be a well-housed and equipped premises for the specialist collection of art books and archive material which has been gathered by the gallery since its foundation in 1854.</P>
      <P>The upper floors of No. 89 Merrion Square will be refurbished to provide additional office accommodation.  The double fronted facade will, of course, be retained without alteration.</P>

Other items of legislation are in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>On the question of the computerisation of family history records throughout the island of Ireland, the Irish Genealogical Project, I understand that a company, Irish Genealogy Limited &mdash; representative of the local genealogy research centres, the independent genealogists and the public interest &mdash; was incorporated late last year to develop the project as a business enterprise.</P>

      <Col N="66" /> With financial support from the International Fund for Ireland Irish Genealogy Limited had developed strategic proposals and an outline business plan for the next five years and I welcome very much the recent decision of the International Fund for Ireland to provide further financial assistance &mdash; for a two year period &mdash; for the marketing phase of the IGP.</P>
    <P>The Clans of Ireland initiative, which is complementary to the Irish Genealogical Project, has been supported by Bord Fáilte and the National Library.

      <P>I have no need to remind Deputies of my committed support to the need for the recognition and adequate protection of the cultural dimension of the audiovisual sector, including film, in Europe.  As I informed the House on 15 December last, I have always supported the approach that guarantees, for European producers and broadcasters, adequate space for European programming on our television and cinema screens.  I consistently put forward this view in the development of the European Union's negotiating position in relation to the audiovisual sector in the GATT negotiations which were concluded on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the outcome of those negotiations, the European Union has not committed itself to any particular liberalisation measures.  It has, therefore, made no commitments in relation to market access or national treatment and has availed of widespread exemptions from the most-favoured-nation clauses, thus securing most aspects of its audio-visual policy.  It follows that the Union has retained all the room for manoeuvre for the foreseeable future in determining future strategies in the audiovisual sector.  The Green Paper published by the Commission on 7 April on strategy options to strengthen the European programme industry in the context of the audiovisual policy of the European Union, represents the start of the consultation process that will hopefully lead to the launching of major new policy initiatives for the development of the European film and television industry.  In so far as the Irish situation is concerned, I am satisfied that the conclusions of the agreement do not place the Irish audio-visual industry in a less advantageous position than existed before the finalisation of the agreement and I look forward to the industry benefiting from the initiatives <Col N="69" /> that will eventually flow from the publication of the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>I understand from the National Gallery of Ireland that the only private financial bequest available to it is the Shaw Fund which was established in 1950 on the death of George Bernard Shaw.  Shaw bequeated one third of the residuary income of his estate to the National Gallery of Ireland <Col N="70" /> and appointed the British Public Trustee as his sole executor.  The receipts from the Shaw bequest are shown on a table which I will have circulated to the House in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Shaw Fund is available for any purpose which, at their discretion, the Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland see fit as appropriate to advancing the gallery's mission.  From the late 1950s, the board decided to use the Shaw Fund principally for the purchase of pictures for the national collections.  Many important master paintings have entered the collection as a result and in the ten year period since 1983 the gallery purchased works by, among others, Camille Pissarro. US$280,000, Emil Nolde, stg£356,000, Chaim Soutine, IR£87,000, and Thomas Roberts, IR£40,000.</P>

As a first step, I envisage that the existing passport office in Cork will shortly be upgraded to a full issuing office for applicants in the Munster area.  We will then consider the opening of a new office for applicants in the Connacht/Ulster region.  At that stage, we will assess the suitability of various locations, including Galway, for such an office.</P>

      <P>The Government make regular use of the powers given to us under Article 6 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to put forward views and proposals on the role and composition of bodies appointed by the Secretary of State or by Northern Ireland departments, including the three mentioned by the Deputy.  The 1989 Review of the Working of the Anglo-Irish Conference emphasised the importance of the principle that such bodies should be so constituted as to enjoy the widest possible public respect and acceptance.  In the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, the membership of these bodies has special political importance and sensitivity.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine first raised with my Department on 15 February 1993 the shipping accident which occurred on 22 September 1992, some 50 miles off Dunmore East in international waters, between the Irish fishing vessel <i>Orchidee</i> and the French fishing vessel <i>Agena</i>.  The two Departments remain in contact on the issue.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Minister for the Marine appointed a marine surveyor from his Department to carry out an inquiry on the Irish side.  Simultaneously, the French authorities are carrying out a judicial investigation.</P>
      <P>In the course of their investigation, the French authorities requested certain information from the Irish side.  This has now been assembled and will be supplied as requested to the French authorities.</P>
      <P>We, for our part, have also requested the French authorities to supply information to enable the Department of the Marine to complete their inquiry. Because the matter is under judicial investigation in France, it has not been possible so far for the officer conducting the inquiry in Ireland to interview the French crew members.  Consideration is however being given to other procedures through which the relevant information may be obtained for the purposes of the Irish inquiry.</P>

      <P>Article 6 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the role and composition of bodies appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland or by Departments subject to his direction and control.  One such body is the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, which came into being on 29 February 1988 and which replaced the Police Complaints Board, which had operated between 1977 and 1988.</P>
      <P>The efficacy and operational effectiveness of the police complaints system must be viewed also in the light of Article 7 of the Agreement which highlights the objective of improving relations between the security forces and the nationalist community.  One of the means towards this end is the improvement of arrangements for handling complaints.  The creation of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints was a first step towards this end.</P>
      <P>The Government has availed fully of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to put forward views and make relevant proposals in this area.  While it would not be appropriate for me to go into details as regards the specifics of proposals on the composition of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Government will continue to keep the adequacy, effectiveness and structure of the police complaints system, of which the Independent Commission for Police Complaints is a central part, under close and continuing review, with the primary objective of ensuring that the police complaints system can become one which fully enjoys the confidence and trust of the nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>At the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference of 28 January 1994, I discussed with Sir Patrick Mayhew the question of the reform of policing structures in Northern Ireland in the context of the debate on possible changes to these structures which has been initiated by the British Government. While it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail about the subject matter of the discussions at the Conference, I can confirm to the Deputy that the question of the role and composition of the Police Authority is a matter in which I am taking a close and continuing interest within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to this question takes full account of the reality that, ultimately, the nationalist community must be convinced that policing structures in Northern Ireland are open, independent from partisan political control, fully accountable, responsive to the policing needs of all sections of the community and that they give equal esteem to the nationalist identity.  In this regard, I have noted with interest the British Government's recently published discussion document containing proposals for new structures in this area and I look forward to discussing these matters further within the Anglo-Irish Conference framework.</P>

      <P>Maps are still available to farmers at the reduced rates, whether ordered by post or at the Map Sales Office in the Phoenix Park.

      <P>At present a group of 11 officers of Assistant Secretary rank from a number of Departments and Offices are participating in their second year of a two-year M.Sc. programme in public sector management at the School of Business Studies in Trinity College.  The programme is sponsored by my Department and was introduced with the expressed purpose of enhancing and further developing the management and analytical skills of senior civil servants with a view to promoting a more strategically orientated approach to managing the Civil Service.  The two-year M.Sc. programme is part-time and the officers involved continue to attend also to their normal official duties in their respective Departments and Offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In partial fulfilment for the award of the M.Sc., the group is required to complete a major benchmarking, best-practice project as well as individual dissertations in the course of the second year.  The group, in consultation with the programme leaders in Trinity College, selected as their benchmarking, best-practice <Col N="86" /> project a detailed study of the application of strategic management in a public sector context with particular focus on New Zealand and Australia, in both of which major strategic management initiatives were taken in recent years as part of far-reaching, public sector reform programmes.  These countries also have civil services and governments structured along lines similar to ours.  Therefore, the purpose of the visit in question, was to evaluate and discuss at first hand, with those directly responsible, the initiatives and reform programmes implemented in both countries. A series of top-level meetings were held between 21 and 25 March in New Zealand and from 28 to 31 March in Australia, at which there was a full and frank discussion of the many issues involved.</P>
    <P>As the report to be prepared by the group is in partial fulfilment for the award of the M.Sc. degree by Trinity College, it will comply with the normal requirements of university dissertations and would not generally be made available to others.  However, at my request, the group will submit a more succinct report on their findings to my Department.  I intend to use that report internally in the context of the Taoiseach's recent strategic management initiative with a view to studying the relevance of the New Zealand and Australian reform programmes to our situation.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1986, all fishermen were treated as employees by the PAYE and PRSI systems and were thus covered for all benefits including occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>In 1986, a High Court judgment ruled in the case of a particular fishing vessel that the skipper and his crew should not be regarded as employer and employees for PAYE purposes.  However, fishermen continued to be regarded as employees for PRSI purposes until 1992 when the High Court ruled that share-fishermen should be regarded not as employees but as self-employed partners.  As a result of this, they are deemed as Class S for the purposes of insurability under the Social Welfare Acts.  In line with other self-employed workers, this gives them entitlement to long term benefits like pensions, but not to short term payments, or occupational injuries benefits.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the unique position of share fishermen in regard to social insurance arising out of their exclusion from insurance as employees, I made provision in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993 to provide share fishermen with cover for unemployment, illness and treatment benefit.  The new scheme gives share fishermen the option of paying special additional contributions with entitlements to unemployment benefit, disability benefit and treatment benefit. I am reviewing the operation of the new arrangements to see what further changes may be required and what may be possible within the existing legal framework.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is available to employees bringing up families on low earnings.  Extension of the scheme to self-employed families could have significant financial implications and could be considered only in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to helping low income self-employed and farming families.  This involves an extensive range of tax relief measures, locally-based rural development plans and various other strategic initiatives designed to assist households engaged in farming.  In this context, the programme pledges the Government to review the issue of family income supplement. This review will concentrate on the short and longer term policy changes which are necessary to address the problem.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim an unemployment assistance payment.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on their means.  In assessing means account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>

      <P>As part of the Department's strategy of improving its level of service for unemployed persons a new system of payment for people engaged in casual employment is being introduced.

      <P>It is important to note that clients do not suffer a loss of payment in the changeover to the new system.  What in fact occurs is a change in the clients payday from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.  While it is accepted that this means a delay in the payment due during the changeover period, this is a once-off situation associated with the introduction of the new and improved procedures. These procedures are beneficial to the client as they eliminate the need to attend their local Social Welfare office each week to sign-on and be paid.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years of age or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel at off-peak periods for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Those include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by private contractors.  The scope of the free travel scheme has been expanded over the years both in relation to the number of routes covered and the concessions made available to people with disabilities such as the free travel companion pass which I introduced in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> The main purpose of the scheme is to encourage independence, mobility and social integration among elderly and incapacitated people.  At the same time, the scheme provides a measure of financial support for public and private transport services operating during off-peak periods or on marginally economic routes.  The provision of a cash allowance in lieu of the free travel concession would involve a fundamental change in the nature of the scheme.  There are no plans for such a change at the present time.</P>
    <P>Currently, about 440,000 people qualify for free travel at a cost of about £30 million a year.</P>

It is provided for people who are providing elderly or incapaciated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, where one of a married couple is in receipt of carer's allowance by virtue of caring for his or her spouse and the spouse being cared for dies, payment of the carer's allowance ceases with effect from the date of death.

This year the higher rate of £23 is being increased to £25 and in addition is being applied to the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the extension of payment of child benefit for a further year would cost in the region of £8 million annually and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department has participated in three decentralisation projects under the Government's programme.  In 1989, the administration <Col N="93" /> of pensions and related schemes was relocated to the Pensions Services Office in Sligo.  Some 319 posts were transferred at that time.  Additional schemes and functions have been added and there are 383 posts in the Pensions Services Office at present giving an annual boost to the local economy in wages and salaries of approximately £4.5 million.</P>
      <P>In 1990-91, 176 posts were transferred to Letterkenny when the administration of child benefit and treatment benefit was relocated.  This has resulted in an injection into the economy of the area of about £1.9 million annually.</P>
      <P>In 1993-94, the administration of a number of schemes, which included invalidity pensions, family income supplement, maternity benefit, death grants, long term disability benefit and unemployment assistance, disablement benefit and pre-retirement allowance, was relocated to Longford.  To date, 178 posts have been transferred.  It is expected that about 20 extra posts will be transferred in due course.  The local economy will benefit by some £3 million per annum in wages and salaries.</P>
      <P>My Department is scheduled to transfer 25 posts to Waterford under the next phase of the decentralisation programme, work on which is due to get under way in the next two years.</P>
      <P>The three decentralisation projects undertaken by my Department to Sligo, Letterkenny and Longford have all been very successful and the staff who transferred have settled in very well.  The relocation of such a significant number of posts has done much to stem the outflow from these towns and their hinterlands of many of the local population and has brought a much needed £9.4 million annual boost to the economies of the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years of age or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel at off-peak periods for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Those include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Íarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by private contractors.</P>
      <P>In common with all the other free schemes operated by my Department, the free travel scheme is reviewed regularly in the context of introducing improvements as resources permit.  Such reviews include consideration of reciprocal agreements with other administrations. In the case of Northern Ireland, there are significant differences between my Department's scheme and that operated by the responsible authorities in that jurisdiction.  I am having the matter examined further in my Department to ascertain whether an acceptable basis for a recriprocal agreement can be reached.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received correspondence from the residents of Miltown Malbay in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I am concerned that elderly people in Miltown Malbay should feel concerned that they may be victimised by criminals.  The total number of crimes reported in the area for 1992 was 19, and for 1993, 11.  Although the gross figures are obviously quite small, I am sure that what has caused concern is that of the 11 <Col N="96" /> crimes reported in 1993, one related to an attack on the elderly and, of the five crimes reported so far this year, three relate to recent burglaries in the homes of elderly people.  The Garda are satisfied that travelling criminals were involved in these latter incidents and their investigations are continuing.  It is worth making the point that the Garda regard the recent burglaries as isolated incidents but of course the crimes, are being treated nonetheless seriously on that account.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas, that the current manpower at Miltown Malbay is one sergeant and one garda.  A Garda vanette is also assigned to the station and is used to provide mobile patrols in the area which is also patrolled by the Garda car based in Ennistymon.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are taking special measures to ease the concerns of elderly residents in Miltown Malbay.  These measures include visiting them on a regular basis and the distribution of crime prevention leaflets throughout the area.  The Garda also avail of the services of local radio to help in solving crimes and to give advice, particularly to the elderly and people living alone, on the <i>modus operandi</i> of criminals who may be active in the locality.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Divisional Officer has plans to assign an additional garda to Miltown Malbay as soon as possible having regard to the overall demands on the force in the Clare Division.</P>

      <P>As the task force's report makes around 90 recommendations, it is not practicable to list individually all of the recommendations that would place little, if any, cost burden on the State.</P>
      <P>In the main, the task force proposals dealing with the administrative burden on small business, linkage and public procurement, new representative structures for small business as well as the proposals addressed to the banks or other private sector bodies would fall into this category.</P>
      <P>The task force recommendations that would have cost implications for the Exchequer are mainly those dealing with taxation, prompt payment, and new or enhanced information, advisory, training, or other services for small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main tax proposals for which the task force was able to obtain costings were those concerning the extension of the PAYE and PRSI allowances to proprietary directors and their spouses working full-time in a family business, the reintroduction of a modified scheme of dividend relief, and the introduction of a 25 per cent small business rate of corporation tax on profits of up to £80,000 returned by companies with an annual turnover below £3 million.  On the basis of information supplied to the task force by the Department of Finance, the cost to the Exchequer of the tax revenue that would be foregone in the event of the full implementation of these measures would be around £56 million.  The task force proposed, however, that if the cost of extending the PAYE and PRSI allowances were considered unsustainable, these allowances should be abolished and redistributed among employees, proprietary directors, and the self-employed in the form of increased personal allowances. This proposal would be revenue-neutral. The task force also recommended that the introduction of the small business rate of corporation tax should <Col N="102" /> be phased in over three years so as to reduce the immediate cost impact.</P>
    <P>The task force recommendation that public bodies would be statutorily required to pay accounts by the end of the month following the date of issue of an invoice would involve a once-off cash flow loss to the Exchequer.  The Department of Finance was unable to provide an estimate of this loss to the task force. As funds have been made available to tackle the causes of the late payment problem in the health sector, the task force did not think that this once-off cost would be excessive.</P>
    <P>The design and formulation of the business information system recommended by the task force would also have cost implication for the Exchequer.  The task force made a number of recommendations intended to ensure that such a system could be introduced as economically as possible.  It also recommended that the subsequent costs of operating the system should be met from savings in the budgets of other agencies engaged in enterprise support and development.  With the exception of a pilot programme to provide specialised training to clusters of companies that would cost an estimated £200,000, the task force proposed that other additional training programmes should be provided on a break-even basis.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the likely benefit to the economy of the implementation of the task force proposals.  In the task force's view, the long term stimulus to the economy and employment would more than repay the short term cost to the Exchequer.  As it stated in its report, a strong and thriving private sector is the best guarantor of a strong and solvent Exchequer.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the county enterprise boards are not empowered to provide grant assistance where a company opts for a lease rather than the purchase of equipment; and the plans, if any, he has to provide grant aid to be made available pro rata towards repayments on a lease.</Quest>

      <P>Capital grants from the County Enterprise Fund (CEF) are available for the construction and modification of premises, and for the purchase of capital goods and equipment.  Where such grants are made, a lien is taken on the asset in question in order to protect the public funds invested, and to secure the benefit conveyed by the grant on the promoter by reference to a specific performance criterion.  Since this would not be possible in relation to leased assets, I would not favour extending CEF grant assistance to such cases.</P>
      <P>I should mention that county enterprise boards are empowered to consider making employment grants to promoters as an alternative to capital grants in appropriate, qualified cases.  This mechanism could be applicable in the case in question.  Feasibility study grants may also be considered.  Furthermore, the county enterprise officers have the duty of providing advice and guidance to potential entrepreneurs in general, and to small businesses anxious to expand.  I would strongly recommend that all promoters of potential small business projects contact their county enterprise officer, who will be able to advise them as to how best to proceed, and to assess whether and to what extent direct Exchequer assistance for the project may be appropriate.</P>

        <i>Wexford</i>): I am aware of a recent UK report on Diesel Vehicle Emissions and Urban Air Quality.</P>
      <P>Stricter vehicle emission controls, in line with relevant EU Directives, have been implemented in Ireland under the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1992 and the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1993.  These address diesel as well as petrol engined vehicles and <i>inter alia</i> envisage the compulsory fitting of oxidation catalysts to certain diesel vehicles from 1997.</P>
      <P>The sulphur content of diesel has been progressively reduced and further significant reductions will take effect from October 1994 and October 1996.  Vehicle emission controls generally are under continuing review at EU level with a view to minimising impacts on human health and the environment.  A further stage of emission reductions is due to commence from 1996.</P>

      <P>Sub-article 29 (6) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 enables me to declare any State to be a recognised State for the purposes of the Regulations; persons with driving licences issued in any such State may then exchange them for Irish licences without having to pass a driving test in this country.  I have not declared the USA to be a recognised State because I am not satisfied that the driver testing regimes there meet the standards prescribed in the EU Directive on driving licences.  Additionally, in most States of the USA, licences do not distinguish between drivers who passed their driving tests in vehicles with automatic transmission and drivers who qualified in vehicles with manual transmission; this arrangement would also conflict with the requirement of the Directive.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council is responsible for the maintenance of regional and county roads in its area and the cost of such works falls to be financed by the Council from its own resources, supplemented by the grants provided by my Department.  The Council's discretionary maintenance grant amounts to £653,000 in 1994.  In addition, the Council has been allocated £1,074,000 as a supplementary maintenance grant to assist it in carrying out works arising from adverse weather conditions.  I understand that the Council is providing £2,757,000 from its own resources for maintenance work in 1994.  General guidelines on the nature of the works eligible to be financed from maintenance grants, on the importance of optimising the return from the investment involved, and on the considerations to be taken into account when preparing the programme of road works have been conveyed to local authorities. Subject to these guidelines, the authorities have a wide discretion in spending grants.  In particular, it is a matter for them to select the individual roads on which maintenance works are to be carried out.</P>

      <P>The determination of any question as to what, in any particular case, is or is not development or exempted development is, under section 5 (as amended) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a matter for An Bord Pleanála.  I understand that the Board decided recently that the original floor area of a particular dwellinghouse was to be calculated by reference to the floor area of the house at the time it was built.  However, bearing in mind the provisions of section 5, that decision cannot be regarded as a generally applicable precedent.</P>

      <P>The PESCA programme is a Community funding initiative aimed specifically at the fisheries sector.  The programme was launched in February as part of the Community's response to the structural changes in the fishing industry brought about as a consequence of a number of factors, including global fleet reductions, the ongoing instability on the markets and the possible enlargement of the union.  These factors have serious implications for regions which are predominantly or entirely dependent on fisheries to support their local economy.</P>
      <P>The aims of PESCA are to help the fishing industry overcome these difficulties and so to contribute to the socioeconomic survival of regions dependent on fisheries through the development of job-creating measures.  Some ECU250 million has been set aside for PESCA over the period 1994-99.</P>
      <P>The specific elements of the programme have not yet been ironed out but I understand that aid will be available for, <i>inter alia</i>, diversification into other activities such as tourism and measures which help create or maintain employment in such regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the programme will be finalised and published sometime in June this year.  In order to generate interest and encourage the submission of concrete and innovative projects for implementation at local level, the European Commission will give widespread publicity to the initiative and will, in particular, organise a series of information <Col N="121" /> presentations in coastal regions before the summer.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance will be sought during the autumn of 1994.  The Department will consider applications from all interested parties, including those from islands and coastal communities, in the preparation of these applications.</P>

      <P>(b)  that they obtain, complete and forward to my Department the maps required as soon as possible after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of the required maps will lead to delay in processing the area aid applications.  It is in the interest of every <Col N="125" /> farmer, therefore, to forward his-her area aid application together with supporting maps.  Where the maps cannot be submitted with an application, however, the above arrangements will allow acceptance by my Department of the area aid application before 29 April 1994 but the required maps should be submitted as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, when a farmer is given inaccurate information in letter form as happens quite often, he or she is told that it was a computer error, but when a farmer fills a complicated CAP reform application for cattle headage and other grants it is considered by his Department to be a fraudulent application.</Quest>

      <P>Innocent and obvious errors made in good faith by farmers in filling out application forms are not considered by my Department to be fraudulent and farmers are not penalised on foot of them but instead are offered the opportunity to correct them. Likewise, where farmers draw errors to my Department's attention before they are likely to be detected those errors are not used to characterise the applications in which they are made as fraudulent but are then corrected also.  Only where information is given deliberately or negligently on an application in a way which can secure payment of sums not due to the applicant does my Department apply the penalty required by the relevant European Union regulations.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department exercises a proper degreee of understanding of errors made by farmers in completing application forms.  However, my Department cannot disregard applications deliberately completed incorrectly or completed with reckless carelessness in such a way as to attract grants not due to the applicants in question.</P>

      <Quest>the scientific evidence which exists to prove that badgers are the cause of TB amongst cattle in Ireland; the reason licences to snare and shoot are being granted during the breeding season; if he will quantify the success, if any, the practice of eliminating badgers has had in eradicating TB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB and there is a strong body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.  This view was supported by a Royal Irish Academy conference which was held in 1991 and at an international seminar on bovine TB held in London in November 1993.  In addition, a review by the Economic and Social Research Institute published in 1989 concluded that in many parts of the country it may not be possible to control bovine TB without controlling the badger population.</P>
      <P>With regard to control, badgers are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may only be removed under strict licence conditions.  Where my Department is satisfied that there is a probable link between badgers and an outbreak of bovine TB in cattle application is made to the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works for a licence to remove badgers for post-mortem. Applications are considered in the context of an agreed programme of research aimed at determining the role the badger plays in the transmission of bovine TB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of ongoing <Col N="137" /> research projects including quantifying of the number of badgers in the country and the incidence of TB in the badger population as well as examination of the extent to which the removal of badgers influences the level of bovine TB.  A feasibility study has commenced in regard to the development of a vaccine for use in badgers and possibly other species.</P>

      <P>The system of financing EU premia schemes' payments in Ireland (EAGGF Guarantee) is as follows: My Department borrows the money required to cover the payments to be made in any particular month, makes the payments out of these borrowed funds and recoups the amounts paid from the EU after the payments have been made.</P>
      <P>The system of financing EU disadvantaged areas schemes' payments in Ireland (EAGGF Guidance) differs slightly from the foregoing in that recoupment is received on a yearly or twice yearly basis rather than a monthly basis and only 65 per cent of expenditure is recouped &mdash; the other 35 per cent has to be borne by the Irish Exchequer.  Notwithstanding these differences, EU recoupment is received under these schemes also only after the payments have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given this system, the amount recouped to my Department in any year by the EU in respect of these schemes will equal the expenditure made in an earlier period.  In 1993 that amount came to £311.1 million consisting of £247.6 million <Col N="138" /> for livestock premia and £63.6 million for compensatory allowances.</P>

    <P>Of these payments, 74,479 under cattle headage and 11,690 under beef cow headage are in respect of advances only whilst the remainder are in respect of final payments.  Payment of the balances in respect of the cattle headage and beef cow commenced on 18 February and are continuing at present.  Payments under the ewe premium scheme represent first and second instalments which were paid in July 1993 and final instalments which commenced on 30 March 1994.</P>
    <P>Payment of the balances in respect of the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received <Col N="139" /> from him/her in the course of 1993, including those submitted last November, have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. I expect that payment of the final 40 per cent will commence within the next week.  Payment of the extensification premium is expected to commence before the end of April.</P>
    <P>Delays by farmers in responding to queries are the principal factor holding up payments particularly in so far as January-February and June 1993 special beef premium cases are concerned.  The main problems involve invalid tags or the absence of identity cards; failure to submit area aid applications or the submission of incomplete forms are other impediments to payments.  Close to half of the June, 1993 special beef premium applicants were the subject of query by my Department and responses are generally very slow.  I am anxious to facilitate timely payments but farmers who do not respond to necessary inquiries from my Department cannot expect their applications to be cleared.  Payments in respect of the November 1993 special beef premium scheme have now commenced.</P>

      <P>Approximately 42,000 or almost 30 per cent of 1993 area aid applications contained errors which had to be queried.  Indeed, it is my Department's experience that incorrect and incomplete application forms lead to considerable delays in payments under the various headage and premia schemes. In the case of the 1993 special beef premium scheme, for example, a recent analysis showed that up to 40,000 applicants or almost 50 per cent of all applicants had been written to by my Department concerning problems with their applications.  Up to 20,000 reminder letters have issued and in some cases farmers have been written to as many as six times in connection with problems including failure to submit cattle identity cards, failure to supply date of birth and submission of incorrect or invalid tag numbers.</P>

      <P>This patient was placed on the waiting list for cardiac surgery at the Mater Hospital, Dublin in October 1993.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of admissions to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always given priority.  Should the patient concerned feel that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case to the consultant directly.</P>

Of the 14 homes, one has been registered with conditions and three will be registered with conditions in the near future. The applications of the remaining ten homes are being processed.  No nursing home has been refused registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board considers that on average, an application for registration takes ten to 12 weeks to process, because of the need for a detailed inspection of each home, the checking of staff records and <Col N="152" /> confirmation of fire safety.  I am satisfied that the Mid-Western Health Board is carrying out the registration process as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>The latest consultant manpower survey carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal on 1 January 1994 indicates that there are a total of 12 accident and emergency permanent posts in the public health services 1 (8 per cent) of which is filled by a woman.  Of the overall total of permanent consultant posts, 1065, some 172 (16 per cent) are filled by women.</P>
      <P>While this represents some progress in achieving a more equitable male/female ratio in overall consultant appointments, it is apparent that more progress needs to be made in particular specialities if this goal is to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of my Department in securing such progress is in monitoring adherence to equal opportunities legislation in relation to recruitment and selection procedures and in encouraging the professional bodies and employers to ensure <Col N="153" /> that any perceived obstacles to progress are removed.  I am also cognisant of the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in relation to improving the rate of participation of women at senior management level, including consultant level, in the health services.  An advisory committee on women's health which has been established in my Department and the collaborative study group which is examining the distribution of medical manpower in acute hospitals is giving consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Questions Nos. 138 and 139 on 10 March 1994.</P>
      <P>As stated in that reply, in reaching a decision to provide a community college in Castleknock I had regard to the views of the parents which were communicated to me through meetings and correspondence with the local action committee, public representatives and the Church of Ireland community.  The primary concern expressed in these communications was that a non fee-paying school would be provided in Castleknock as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>County Dublin Vocational Education Committee has been informed of the decision and requested to establish a board of management for the new Community College.  As soon as a suitable site is acquired the committee will be given sanction to commence the architectural planning of the new school building.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Conleth's and St. Mary's national school there were 317 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus ten assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>There were 294 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September, 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus nine assistants for the 1994-95 school year. The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 302 pupils in order to retain the post of 10th assistant in 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school may qualify under either of these <Col N="163" /> exceptions, my Department will be happy to examine the position on receipt of projected enrolment details.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the opposition by vocational education committees to the proposal to have third level student support schemes administered by a central agency in view of the fact that the schemes are now being administered effectively and sympathetically at local level and to the fact that at local level the knowledge and expertise of public representatives and school staff can be availed of in appropriate cases, that students and parents find it valuable that they can establish direct contact with appropriate officials in their own local towns at present and that difficulties might be created for them in a centralised system, that many grant applications received by vocational education committees are not fully completed and that the vocational education committees have a positive record in assisting and supporting grant applicants, that this proposal represents a major erosion of the powers of vocational education committees and also serious implications for the jobs of dedicated administrative staff throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I will be meeting representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) shortly to discuss the administration of the 1994-95 and 1995-96 student support schemes.  I would not wish at this stage, therefore, to pre-empt the outcome of any discussions I may have with the Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course anxious to ensure that the expertise of vocational education committee members and staff will continue to be available in the context of the revised arrangements for student support. The arrangements for 1994 will be the same as for previous years and I have <Col N="164" /> already announced that the schemes will issue to vocational education committees and local authorities by 1 May.</P>
    <P>My approach for the future involving the administration of third level student support by a central agency is based on the recommendations of the advisory committee which are aimed at improving the service to students.  The present system is fragmented and very confusing for grant applicants involving as it does three separate schemes administered by over 70 different agencies.</P>

      <P>With regard to housing developments in the Lucan area and their implications for post-primary education I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 259 of 15 February 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department has received applications from the managements of all three post-primary schools in Lucan, most recently from St. Joseph's College, for grant-aid towards the provision of additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>My Department has been assessing the short and long term post-primary needs of the Lucan area and, in the light of that assessment, the likely accommodation requirements of the three post-primary schools.  It is hoped to convey decisions on their applications to the school authorities concerned shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the factors arising at Our Lady of Lourdes national school, Goldenbridge, Inchicore, Dublin 8 and in the circumstances, and notwithstanding falling school numbers if she will approve the retention of the present staffing levels for the school year 1994-1995.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes national school there were 387 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus 12 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of two full-time remedial teachers and two concessionary teachers under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>There were 348 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus 11 assistants for the 1994-95 school year.  The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 367 pupils in order to retain the post of 12th assistant in 1994-95.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school may qualify under either of these exceptions, my Department will be happy to examine the position on receipt of projected enrolment details.</P>

      <P>My Department has received correspondence signed by the teaching staffs of the three post-primary schools in Ballyshannon <Col N="168" /> to the effect that they are concerned at the lack of information afforded to teachers and the community regarding the proposed community school for Ballyshannon.</P>
      <P>In such cases, where a number of post-primary schools are being amalgamated into a single school, my Department communicates, in the first instance, with the owners/trustees of the schools involved. The question of appropriate consultations at local level with teachers and parents would then be a matter for the school authorities.</P>
      <P>In line with my commitment to keep concerned interests informed of the position regarding the Department's school building projects, I recently announced a list of projects which are my Department's priorities in architectural planning and I am glad to state that the project to provide a single community school in Ballyshannon is included in that list.</P>
      <P>My Department is now in correspondence with the owners/trustees of the Ballyshannon schools with a view to ensuring a smooth transition from a multi-school to a single school situation, in line with recommendations in the report on the National Education convention.</P>
