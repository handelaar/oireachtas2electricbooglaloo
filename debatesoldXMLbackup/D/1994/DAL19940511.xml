      <P>I would like to raise two issues.  The first deals with the operation of the House and the treatment by the Government of business being dealt with in the House and in, committees.  This morning a select committee to deal with <Col N="1170" /> the Family Law Bill was called for 11.30 a.m.  The Dáil did not meet this morning to allow Members attend the Arbour Hill ceremonies.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who is responsible for the Family Law Bill, attended the ceremony and went on to a party political function.  As the relevant Minister did not attend the committee, although a Minister of State from a different Department attended in his place, the committee was forced to adjourn as it considered it required the relevant Minister to be present.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> I wish to share my time with Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that is satisfactory.  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record the position of peacekeeping <i>vis-á-vis</i> peace enforcement.  Peacekeeping has been defined by the Secretary General of the United Nations as &ldquo;the deployment of a United Nations presence in the field hitherto with the consent of all the parties concerned, normally involving United Nations military and-or police personnel and frequently civilians as well&rdquo;.  Peacekeeping is a technique that expands the possibilities for the prevention of conflict and the making of peace.  Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter authorises the Security Council to undertake, if necessary, coercive measures, including operations by land, sea and air of the United Nations, in order to maintain and restore international peace and security. It is under this authority that UNOSOM II was established.  The original mandate for the force has been changed and is now more in line with the traditional peacekeeping mandates.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I wish to report to the House on Irish military participation in United Nations missions. This relates not only to Somalia but to worldwide commitments in peacekeeping. As our participation in the second United Nations operation in Somalia &mdash; UNOSOM II &mdash; gave rise to the need for the enactment of that Act, I will deal with that mission first &mdash; it is a mission I know well.  I visited Somalia on four or five occasions.  I was unaccompanied on my first visit to the country as Minister for Foreign Affairs in August 1992.  On that occasion I wanted to bring to world attention the tragic events in Somalia.  In the following months I accompanied the President on a visit to that country.  As Minister for Defence I visited Somalia on two occasions, first, in advance of the Defence Forces participation in this mission and on St. Patrick's Day last I visited Baidoa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> The advance party of the first transport company with UNOSOM II arrived in Somalia on 25 August 1993 together with equipment and stores, and the main body was deploved on 1 September 1993.  The present Irish transport company consists of seven officers, 29 NCOs and 52 privates.  In addition, one officer and one NCO have been serving at UNOSOM II headquarters since 25 November 1993 as a contingent liaison team and, since 12 January 1994, three officers have held staff appointments at force headquarters. Four members of the Garda Síochána are serving with UNOSOM II.</P>
    <P>The Irish transport is based at Baidoa, 150 miles from Mogadishu and the position there at present is generally calm. The first unit settled in very quickly and established very good relations with the local community which is presided over by the Elder system.  The Elders were cooperative and supportive of the United Nations and more specifically, the Irish contingent.  They were also very supportive of all the aid agencies, particularly Concern, GOAL, the Irish Red Cross and Medicine sans Frontier.  I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work done by the Irish aid agencies in Baidoa and in Somalia generally.  They have left a legacy there, particularly in Baidoa where there is an orphanage, a school and basic hospitalisation, barefoot doctor type medical care.</P>
    <P>The principal duty of the Irish contingent has been the provision of essential supplies &mdash; fuel, food and water &mdash; to the military components of UNOSOM II.  It has also assisted in the movement of stores and equipment of units deploying or redeploying in the mission area.  In addition, the Irish unit has provided assistance to the Irish aid agencies, Concern and GOAL as well as other humanitarian agencies.  Responsibility for the Baidoa area was transferred from the French to the Indian contingent towards the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to the French contingent who, under the leadership of General Guidry, were very supportive of the Irish transport company.  I had the <Col N="1176" /> opportunity to speak with and write to the French Minister for Defence, Monsieur Leotard, to express my appreciation of the work done by his troops in the context of our obligations in the Baidoa area.  At present our people are in the gentle, courageous and concerned care of the Indian brigade under Brigadier General Bhagat.  The Indian soldiers are of the very highest professional standard. Our logistics unit, when moving between Baidoa and Mogadishu, is under the courageous and concerned care of this general and his troops and their help is deeply appreciated.  I take the opportunity to express Ireland's appreciation for the work they are doing on our behalf and on behalf of international peace in that unsettled part of the world.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the mandate of UNOSOM II was changed when on 4 February 1994 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a revised mandate for the force, the thrust of which is peacekeeping. The Security Council Resolution also authorised the gradual reduction of UNOSOM II to a force level of up to 22,000 &mdash; the previous mandate required a force of 28,000 personnel. The resolution reaffirmed the objective that UNOSOM II complete its mission by March 1995.</P>
    <P>The revision of the UNOSOM mandate to something more akin to the traditional peacekeeping mandate under which successive Irish contingents have proved their worth will, I am certain, be welcomed by all Members.  I have been keenly conscious that many Deputies have had understandable reservations about the direction in which UN policy appeared to be heading.  I have shared those reservations and I am sure that the House will endorse the very significant modification of policy which has taken place.</P>
    <P>To avoid doubt, I reiterate that Irish troops are not, and have not been, involved in operational peace-enforcement. Their role has been that of a transport logistics unit.  Without the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, however, armed Irish troops exceeding 12 in number could not have <Col N="1177" /> been sent to Somalia in August 1993, nor can they in future be involved in any new mission under Chapter VII of the UN Charter without the specific approval of this House in each case.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive assessment of the situation, including a detailed discussion which I had with the UN UnderSecretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and a positive recommendation by the military authorities, the Government decided on 4 February 1994 to supply a further transport unit to UNOSOM II.  The replacement contingent took up duty on 7 March 1994 and when I visited Somalia a short time later the members of the Second Transport Company were already in full command of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit to UNOSOM, I had a meeting in Nairobi with General Aidid, interim president Ali Mahdi and Ambassador Kouyate, Acting Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General. I also had meetings in Mogadishu with the UNOSOM Force Commander General Aboo and Mr. Abdul Touray, Political Official with UNOSOM.  I raised with all concerned the attack on the UN convoy on 15 March and have already informed the House about the incident.  In brief, there is general agreement that the incident was almost certainly unpremeditated and not related to the political situation in Somalia; as far as can be ascertained it appears that the convoy got caught up in an armed confrontation between rival sub-clans.</P>
    <P>With a view to improving the security of our personnel I arranged that two SISU armoured personnel carriers held by the Defence Forces should be dispatched to our contingent.  These arrived in Baidoa on 9 May.</P>
    <P>The future involvement of Irish troops in Somalia is being reassessed at present in a fundamental way.  By the end of August next, Irish troops will have served in Somalia for a period of 12 months. Ireland is the only West European country with troops there.  The time may have arrived to withdraw in the circumstances and having regard to our many other <Col N="1178" /> overseas commitments.  The final decision in the matter will be one for Government and will have regard to the recommendations of the military authorities. The question will be decided well ahead of the end of the current tour of duty in September next.</P>
    <P>Our largest single overseas commitment is with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &mdash; UNIFIL. The contingent there now consists of a battalion of 574, an element of 47 in UNIFIL Headquarters Camp Command, 13 staff personnel and 12 military police at UNIFIL Headquarters and 17 members of the Force Mobile Reserve &mdash; making a total of 663.  Nine other countries participate in UNIFIL.  The total strength of the force is 5,294.</P>
    <P>Even with the assistance of UNIFIL, the Government of Lebanon has been unable to assert its authority throughout the country.  Some progress in this regard has been made in recent months with the deployment southward of about 300 members of the Lebanese Army.  Lebanese military personnel have a number of positions within the UNIFIL area of operations, one of which is in the Irish area.</P>
    <P>The year 1993 was marked by continued attacks by armed elements on positions held by the <i>de facto</i> forces in or close to the Israeli controlled area and the return of fire from those positions to villages in the Irish area of operations. Following the deaths in the Israeli enclave early in July of a number of Israeli military personnel, the Israeli Defence Forces initiated a bombardment of South Lebanon which lasted from 25 to 31 July and resulted in the deaths of about 130 Lebanese, 15 of which occurred in the UNIFIL area of operations.  The Irish area of operations was subjected to intense shelling and attacks by aircraft and helicopters.  Fortunately, apart from a few cases of a very minor injury and shock. Irish personnel were unharmed by the bombardment.  While the safety of personnel was a top priority, the Irish battalion provided food and shelter for up to 600 local refugees.  They behaved in <Col N="1179" /> the most courageous manner in the circumstances of this outrageous attack.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State visited Cyprus where we have a large Irish contingent.  In addition to the force commander Major-General Michael Minehane, 30 Irish military personnel are currently serving with UNFICYP.  There is a personnel officer in the Field Operations division of UN Headquarters in New York.  The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East is Ireland's most longstanding UN commitment.  At present 17 Irish officers are attached to UNTSO, and are currently based in Israel, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>When the mandate of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America and the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan-Pakistan terminated on 15 March 1990, one officer was retained from each of the ten countries, including Ireland, which had contributed military observers to the mission.  In June 1991, eight Irish officers were deployed for service with UNIKOM, the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, which was established on 9 April 1991 in the aftermath of the Gulf War.  Irish officers have also participated since 1991 in another UN mission set up that year, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO.  I know that area extremely well, having visited the refugee camps on two separate occasions.  Six Irish officers are serving as observers with MINURSO, at the force headquarters in Laayoune.  The total strength of MINURSO, involving 24 other countries is 351.</P>
    <P>The remaining UN mission in which Irish military personnel are involved is UNPROFOR &mdash; the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia. Of the nine officers serving with UNPROFOR, four are based in Bosnia and four in Croatia.  The amount currently outstanding in respect of Irish participation in UN operations is about £13.5 million, most of which relates to involvement in UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> The Government, as evidenced in its recent restatement of the roles of the Defence Forces, remains committed to the principle of military participation in the United Nations operation in the cause of international peace.  Consistent with the safety of our troops, which is an overriding consideration, this commitment will continue to represent a practical and exemplary manifestation of our support for the highest ideals of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I regret having gone through my script so quickly but felt I should conclude to allow Deputy Haughey to make his contribution which I know will add to the general debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for sharing his time with me. The House would probably be far more interested in what the Minister has to say as the person who decides policy in this area.  However, I hope I can add something to the debate.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish troops serving in Somalia.  They have done us proud and, by all accounts, are very well respected by other forces in that country.</P>
      <P>I had reservations &mdash; to which the Minister referred &mdash; about amending the Defence Act.  The change from peacekeeping to peace enforcement caused much debate in this House recently.  The Minister himself has reservations about it but I accept that he is carrying out the wishes of the Government and can have a different private opinion.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on putting Somalia on the world stage.  He visited Somalia four times which clearly demonstrates Ireland's concern in that regard.  I understand that a number of countries have pulled out for different reasons.  I would not like to think our troops would remain there in isolation without cognisance being taken of the general picture and I am glad, therefore, that a review is underway.</P>

    <P>Ireland is a neutral country and our neutrality has been enhanced by the addition of the new members to the European Union.  We are an anti-colonial country and, generally speaking, a non-military <Col N="1181" /> nation.  We promote peace, justice and basic human rights throughout the world through diplomacy and negotiation and we are well respected for the role we play.</P>
    <P>Peace enforcement is a military phenomenon and, again, I welcome the Minister's expression of the view that in Somalia our troops have not, as it turns out, been involved in it.  I suggest Ireland should not get involved in military conflicts; that would be the general view of the majority of people here.  We are not a military nation but we can rely on our missionary work, our voluntary aid relief and our peacekeeping by the UN troops for which we are well respected.  When the Defence (Amendment) Act was brought before the House, I suggested it could be a slippery slope and that Irish troops could become more involved in military activity when the next flashpoint occurred around the world.  I do not, however, believe that is the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the problems in Rwanda where terrible slaughter is taking place.  I understand approximately 20,000 people have been slaughtered and that refugees are fleeing to neighbouring countries.  I welcome the role played by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the rescue of eight Irish citizens.  Our people in Rwanda ministering to the refugees deserve the full support of all the authorities here in their work to bring aid and relief to those unfortunate people. Perhaps there is a role for peacekeeping by Irish troops in Rwanda but that would be a major decision to take.  There is another view that for various reasons peacekeeping forces could be made up of troops from African nations.</P>
    <P>The role of the UN comes under scrutiny at this time.  The editorial in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> states: &ldquo;The UN is riddled by politicking, jobbery, incompetence, even outright corruption&rdquo;. Those are stark words but they highlight the need to review all aspects of the UN. The Cold War is ended and we could have collective security in a real way.  I would welcome a fundamental review of the role of the UN in bringing about the <Col N="1182" /> new world order that we so dearly wish to see.</P>
    <P>A review of Irish foreign policy is needed and that is recognised by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The recently sanctioned military action in Bosnia was a major decision. We are enjoying closer co-operation with the Western European Union and these issues must be addressed in a full national debate.  In 1996 there will be a treaty making conference by the EU and these issues, as well as the consequences of our role in the area of foreign affairs, must be teased out carefully and put to the Irish people.  Ireland is a non-military nation; we have a tremendous role to play with regard to the promotion of peace and justice, basic human rights, the delivery of aid relief and, indeed, highlighting the general global inequality.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for sharing his time.  I am glad we know his views on various issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Minister's report on the peacekeeping duties of our Defence Forces over the past 12 months.  We heard some lofty but sincere and genuine words from the Minister, and from Deputy Haughey, but they remind me of words spoken by the former Fianna Fáil leader, not entirely unknown to Deputy Haughey, in another context when he referred to people being &ldquo;in the party but <Col N="1183" /> not for the party&rdquo;.  In relation to peace enforcement we are officially, as per an Act of the Oireachtas, in the business of peace enforcement but I question whether we are for peace enforcement.  I will return to that later.</P>
      <P>The Minister's report is comprehensive. It outlines the position over the past 12 months and gives us the up-to-date picture in relation to our troops throughout the world.  The fact that we automatically think of Somalia and the peace enforcement rather than the peacekeeping side of the equation is an indication of how we have adjusted to the change in the regulations which allow Ireland to take part in peace enforcement rather than peacekeeping measures.  The Minister was at pains to point out and reiterate that Irish troops are not and have not been involved in operational peace enforcement measures and stated that their role had been that of a transport logistics unit.  That is a valid point but having supported, by an Act of the Oireachtas and as a result of a Dáil debate last year, the idea of peace enforcement, we should not be ashamed to engage in such peace enforcement. Peace enforcement measures can be enacted by the UN and we must not fool ourselves into believing that all the problems in the world will disappear or that somebody else will address those problems for us.  We must play our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important &mdash; and the Minister stated this also &mdash; that a decision is taken soon on the future of Irish troops in Somalia and that that decision is announced well in advance of the September deadline. I hope that we in this House will have an opportunity to debate that decision and the policy options in more detail and that we will not be back here next October or November simply to make statements on the matter.  We all have points of view on this issue; the Minister has heard some of them during Question Time over the past weeks. Those views are valid and I hope the Minister will listen to what we have to say on Somalia and other options for <Col N="1184" /> peace enforcement before he makes his decision during the summer months.</P>
    <P>The deployment of Irish troops on the ground in Somalia can be described as a limited success.  The troops have brought hope to a region where there was little hope.  Their assistance to the aid agencies has been of practical benefit to thousands of people on the ground and the famine problem would not have been relieved to the extent that it has been without the peace enforcement measures of the Irish troops there.  I have certain concerns about what is happening in Somalia.  It is not a perfect situation and it causes one to reflect on the command structure on the ground.  The Minister gave us no indication of his views on that but questions must be asked and answers must be given.  I would like him to address that point when replying because there has been much comment on how the command structure could be improved.</P>
    <P>In addition to giving us the written report of what has taken place over the past 12 months, we should be given also some information about our state of readiness for other such peace enforcement missions if requested by the UN and agreed by the Oireachtas.  There are many trouble spots in the world today; Deputy Haughey referred to some of them.  We hear the complaints of our constituents on a daily basis in relation to Bosnia, Rwanda and many other areas throughout the world.  We would like a magic wand to make those problems disappear but, unfortunately, that will not happen.</P>
    <P>The political question must be addressed by the UN and if a solution is reached peace enforcement measures may be necessary.  Can we wash our hands and say someone else will do the job?  Somalia will not be the only area where Irish troops will be needed.  I hope we will look in a mature fashion at future UN requests for troops to carry out peace enforcement measures.</P>
    <P>As regards neutrality we cannot afford to keep our eyes shut when we see Finland, Sweden and Austria reviewing their options.  Ireland in the new European and world order will have to play its part <Col N="1185" /> and on occasion that may involve peace enforcement.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and hope someone else will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister travelled to Somalia and saw at first hand the difficulties and dangers which the troops would face.  However, this may not always be possible and it is important that we have reports from the chief of staff, the UN commanders in the various regions and from the Department of Foreign Affairs when making decisions on future peace enforcement requests.</P>
    <P>There is a question mark over the Government's commitment to peace enforcement.  The Minister has a view on this and other aspects of defence policy, as have other Members.  How do the arguments made by the Minister equate with his duty to the troops?  Troops are sent at the request of the UN and with the agreement of the Oireachtas.  It is not fair to have troops on missions abroad without full Government support.  I am not trying to make a cheap political point. I recognise the Minister is entitled to his view on peace enforcement versus peacekeeping but it causes difficulty.  It would be preferable if troops on peace enforcement missions, even if they do not have operational roles, had the full support of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are paying a certain amount of lip service to our commitment to UN peace enforcement.  What practical steps are we taking to ensure the present mission is successful?  The necessary procedures must be put in place to ensure the success of future peace enforcement missions. There is no provision in the Estimates for the extra training and equipment which will be required if further peace enforcement measures are requested and agreed by the Oireachtas.  Has this area been examined?  The training and military equipment required for peace enforcement is virtually the same as that required for peacekeeping.  Unfortunately over the last 20 years those killed in action have been on peacekeeping and not peace enforcing duties.  What additions have been or are being made to Army ordnance to ensure the troops have the <Col N="1186" /> equipment, training and facilities necessary? The Minister said extra equipment was provided to the troops as they arrived in Baidoa on 9 May.  Does he consider the extra personnel carriers would have been required at an earlier stage?  The UN blue beret is not a magic shield which deflects the aggressors' bullets, whether the troops are on peacekeeping or peace enforcing missions.  We must ensure that they have the full support of the Minister, the Cabinet and the Oireachtas and have all the facilities and equipment they require.</P>
    <P>My party has no difficulty with the principle of peace enforcement or with our troops playing a more active role in this area.  Hopefully we will have a more resolute, strengthened and efficient UN. Everyone asks about the position in Bosnia and unfortunately they are now talking about Rwanda.  They question the effectiveness of the UN.  To date there have been no answers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach poured scorn on the Fine Gael stance on neutrality, Europe and the Western European Union at the launch of his party's Euro manifesto.  He trotted out the old Fianna Fáil line that they were whiter than white and more neutral than anyone else.  On a recent &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme a Fianna Fáil MEP demanded immediate intervention in Bosnia and Rwanda.  This will not happen by chance.  If we wish to have a say in influencing such decisions we must be involved in the Western European Union.  That is why my party suggested that the observer status we enjoy at the Western European Union, which is supported by the Government, should be extended to full membership, thereby allowing us to influence European developments in establishing a common foreign and security policy.  We cannot simply wash our hands of the problems and hope they will disappear.</P>
    <P>A review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy co-operation provisions of the Maastricht Treaty will be carried out in 1996.  Fine Gael policy on this matter is based on three principles: the democratic control of decision-making, arms control and a reduction in nuclear <Col N="1187" /> proliferation and the specialised contribution of Irish forces to humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping.  We have a marvellous tradition in providing humanitarian assistance and helping to maintain peace in various areas throughout the world, and I hope this will continue.</P>
    <P>On the question of conscription &mdash; the Taoiseach left a question mark over this issue last Monday &mdash; the Fine Gael Party totally opposes the concept of a conscripted European army.  We are trying to highlight the advantages of Ireland adopting a full status within the Western European Union.  We cannot afford to remove ourselves from the central political decisions which will have to be taken at European and UN level during the coming years.  We must have a say in decisions of fundamental importance to Europe and the world.  It is very easy for us to don our neutrality cap, but this will not be enough in future.  We have to be responsible, far-seeing and willing and able to play a full role in this regard. I have strayed from the matter under discussion, but it is important to point out that the difficulties which appear to exist about the peace enforcment role of our Army will be dwarfed by the wider political and defence questions which will arise in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those involved in the UN mission during the past 12 months. They have performed their work in an exemplary fashion and the positive aspects of their endeavours can be seen in the countries in which they served. They have been a credit to themselves, the Army and us and I wish them well in their further duties.  Despite my reservations about some minor aspects of his speech, I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this comprehensive report.  He has an in-depth knowledge of and commitment to this matter, and I look forward to similar debates during the coming months.  I hope we will be given an opportunity to debate the situation in regard to the troops in Somalia in advance of the Minister making his decision on this matter rather than the <Col N="1188" /> Minister simply making a statement after he has made his decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this report which he promised some months ago.  It is important for this House to be acquainted with the activities of our Army personnel overseas.  I am very proud of the military personnel and various aid bodies who have carried out tremendous work on behalf of people in dire distress.  The increasing number of conflicts in various countries will place a demand on our troops for either peacekeeping or peace enforcement duties for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The important role of the Irish forces in United Nations peacekeeping operations in troubled areas throughout the globe has been well documented.  It is a source of pride that our soldiers have performed so well in difficult circumstances. No one should underestimate the important role of the United Nations.  While, from time to time, we may criticise this organisation for alleged faults, we should bear in mind that it has a powerful influence on warring factions and wealthy nations and is in a position to impose moral obligations on countries and their leaders whose differing views often lead to war and destruction.  While we may question its shortcomings we must acknowledge the premier role the UN plays in resolving conflicts and bringing about peace in warring nations.  Without it the world would be a much bleaker place: we would have a world of bloody conflict and confrontation with nations in turmoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, a small nation, makes a significant contribution through the UN in maintaining peace in troubled areas throughout the world.  We cannot forget our involvement in the UN peacekeeping mission in the Congo during the early 1960s.  We were proud to see our forces wear the blue beret of the UN in far flung corners of the world and were determined to play our part on the world stage in the wider struggle for peace in developing countries.  Our involvement in the UN peacekeeping mission in the Congo <Col N="1189" /> is etched into the souls of many Irish people because, for the first time, we became aware that keeping peace cost the lives of our soldiers.  By its nature, soldiering entails death, and we have been strengthened in our determination to play an even greater role in UN operations because many of our soldiers have given their lives in the pursuit of peace.</P>
    <P>We must not ignore the risks involved in peacekeeping.  The Minister correctly stated that legislation governing the role of Irish troops in Somalia refers to neither peacekeeping nor peace enforcement. However, we must not fool ourselves into thinking that our forces in Somalia are not in any danger.  Regardless of the word one uses to describe their role, our troops on UN missions face danger every day. We are all aware of what can happen when the peacekeeping role of troops is changed to peace enforcement.  For example, in Somalia, where armed thugs roamed the streets at will killing and looting without restraint, American troops suffered heavy casualties.  The Irish delegation in Somalia, which included senior civil servants and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, had to be protected by those armed gangs who demanded money for the service.</P>
    <P>The crisis in these countries is caused by a breakdown in law and order, the collapse of legal government structures as a result of internal dispute and the violent overthrow of those in power. There is little hope of a peaceful resolution of such disputes.  We order our troops into these areas as part of a UN mission, which very often is the last hope for many people.  We have seen the heroic efforts made by our troops in Somalia and Sarajevo in not only maintaining peace but in saving the lives of innocent civilians.</P>
    <P>When we debate the role of the UN we often seem to think only in terms of military solutions.  However, many Irish civilian aid workers play a vitally important role in caring for the victims of these conflicts.  For example, Mr. Eddie O'Dwyer from County Limerick who experienced the horror of war in Gorazde eloquently summed up what is happening <Col N="1190" /> in that country.  He said he left behind the makings of a ghetto.  Gorazde, located in a valley along the river Drina, was once a beautiful town.  Many people from the surrounding countryside have been forced to take refuge there, resulting in the area being grossly overpopulated, people living wherever they can in burned out houses and holes in the ground.  These are the words of a man who has seen at first hand the horror of war and conflict and how it hurts a civilian population.  How can we sit in this Chamber and not be moved by such vivid images?  All we need do is imagine such inhuman behaviour perpetrated in towns throughout our countryside.  While we could never imagine such depravity taking place in our country we must bear in mind that many of the world's trouble spots were once peaceful nations seeking only prosperity and security for their citizens.</P>
    <P>The role of the United Nations is of vital importance to countries in conflict. That organisation represents the only hope of peace and restoration of normality.  That is why I support the Government proposal to widen the role of our forces.  However, I wish to sound a note of caution.  Whenever we take decisions on engaging our troops in peace enforcement we must be prepared to live with the consequences.  We cannot ignore the dangers inherent in such United Nations operations.  Within a peace enforcement role our troops will be exposed to even greater danger and will be closer to the lines of conflict.  If our forces are to be given an expanded role within the United Nations they should be made aware of the dangers and be equipped appropriately.</P>
    <P>Today newspaper headlines inform us of the latest atrocities in Rwanda, where up to one quarter of a million people have been killed in a bloody tribal conflict between opposing factions bidding for power.  While our first reaction may be to ignore such savage conflict we cannot turn our backs on such inhuman behaviour. We must openly acknowledge that the United Nations has a role to play in <Col N="1191" /> resolving the underlying causes of tension and strife, even when it takes place in developing countries, because all of our interests are interrelated.  As the world draws ever nearer to a global economy the West will have an even greater interest in a peaceful trading bloc so necessary to economic growth.</P>
    <P>The tensions of the Cold War between the so-called super powers are no more. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth of Independent States, the removal of a major sphere of traditional influence has tipped the balance of equilibrium towards the removal of ideology as a means of division. Instead, economic and industrial influences enter the picture.  The breakup of the former Soviet Union and the disruption of the traditional East-West power struggle for political supremacy have lead to the emergence of the European Union as an influential force in the resolution of conflict.  With the proposed enlargement of the European Union it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some of the Baltic states will join Europe in the future and, to our mutual interest, develop trade and industrial ties.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the future development of the European Union when he addressed the Association of European Journalists last month.  He said it was possible, in certain circumstances, to foresee the European Union reinforcing its political role with a defence policy, as envisaged under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Tánaiste also foresaw the emergence of a new collective security system for Europe as a whole.  At the same time he emphasised that Ireland's policy of military neutrality has served this country well.  These are interesting comments and we should carefully consider his words.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is a capable politician who appears to have his finger on the pulse of a new approach to security within Europe.  There does not appear to be a contradiction in the Tánaiste's views because, if Europe is to have a new collective <Col N="1192" /> security system, it follows that Irish armed forces will have to form part of it.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the European Union will develop its own security policies and may intervene in some flash points whenever its military and-or commercial interests are threatened.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that these issues will be the subject of a comprehensive policy approach in the Government's forthcoming White Paper.  I am sure Members await that new policy document with interest.  It is all very well to have policy documents and strategic plans, but, if we expect our troops to take part in peace enforcement missions we must ensure they are equipped on a par with the best in the world.  Our troops must not be the needy cousins compared with other contingents.  We must ensure they are provided with the resources and equipment necessary to enable them do a difficult job to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>I support the Government on this issue and urge the Minister for Defence to report back to the House at six-monthly intervals, to inform us whenever there are requests by the United Nations for Irish troops to take part in peace enforcement missions.  While acknowledging that there is a certain amount of danger involved in peace enforcement there is national prestige to be gained.  More importantly, the notion that we are part of the European Union will be underlined. As the European Union develops what the Tánaiste has described as a collective security system we must play our full part.  Otherwise we will be left behind, merely regarded as a small, insignificant island on the periphery of Europe.  Surely our history and traditions demand better treatment than to be ignored within the new Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to review the operations of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993 in so far as it relates to the despatch of Irish troops to serve overseas with the United Nations.  However, I am very surprised that no written report was provided by the Minister in advance of this debate.  I <Col N="1193" /> received a telephone call shortly before the debate informing me that a copy of the Minister's speech would be available in the Library and I collected it shortly before the debate began.</P>
      <P>In my experience it is almost unprecedented that a report of such importance should be presented verbally by the Minister. When the Dáil introduced this requirement during the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993 in June last I do not believe anyone envisaged &mdash; perhaps the Minister did, but certainly not anyone on this side of the House &mdash; there would be anything other than a written report presented to the House &mdash; Given its nature it is a report which could have been provided at any time in recent months since it contains nothing of any significance, nothing new which would have necessitated awaiting decisions of one kind or another.  The Act provides that a report be presented to this House as soon as may be after 1 January and also provides that we might vote on it. There is no resolution before the House in relation to this report, so we are not afforded an opportunity to vote on it if we so wish.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this was the kind of procedure envisaged when the Bill was agreed in this House.  It is another symptom of the less than honest way in which the Dáil and public have been treated by the Government in relation to this matter.  The Defence (Amendment) Bill was introduced last year to facilitate the participation of Irish troops in the United Nations operations in Somalia.  I opposed it and my party voted against it, not because we opposed the proposal to send Irish troops to Somalia <i>per se</i> but rather because we opposed sending them to Somalia to participate in a peace enforcement exercise as distinct from a peacekeeping operation, which had been the tradition of our Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Somalia has disappeared from our television screens and newspaper headlines to be replaced by new horrors, such as those being perpetrated in Rwanda, Irish troops remain there and a new contingent was sent out at the beginning of March.  I welcome the fact <Col N="1194" /> that, despite coming under attack on a number of occasions, casualties have been avoided although, given the unstable position in Somalia, it would be a mistake to believe there is no longer an element of danger for Irish troops.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that, while it has not yet been the subject of such public attention, Irish troops continue to serve in the Lebanon and to face dangers, mainly from the Israelis and their Lebanese allies.  Last summer Irish positions came under repeated fire as the Israelis launched a huge bombardment which wrought massive destruction on Southern Lebanon, killed more than 130 people and led to the displacement of tens of thousands more.  We must hope that the historic agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which today has led to the arrival of the first Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, will eventually lead to a settlement of the wider conflict in the region, the ending of UNIFIL's mandate and the permanent withdrawal of the Irish contingent from that area.</P>
    <P>When the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, was going through the Dáil last year I described it as one of the most significant changes in Irish foreign policy since we joined the European Community in 1972.  I still believe that most people did not appreciate the significance of the changes made in that legislation. While we were told that the purpose of the Bill was to allow the participation of Irish troops in peace enforcement operations, the legislation made no reference whatsoever to peace enforcement, but authorised the commitment of Irish troops to &ldquo;any international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo;.  There were no qualifications or conditions attached and the legislation effectively cleared the way for participation by Irish troops in aggressive military operations, once they had been sanctioned by the Security Council or the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>In view of the points raised by other speakers to this debate in relation to the Western European Union, what precisely <Col N="1195" /> would the current phraseology in the Act mean in circumstances where the United Nations Security Council or the General Assembly were to sub-contract a peace enforcement mandate to the Western European Union?  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on whether Irish troops would be permitted to participate in such an operation under such a mandate under the current legislation.</P>
    <P>The current review of the role and organisation of the Defence Forces cannot be taken in isolation from the wider debate about foreign policy, the role being developed for Ireland within the European Union and the commitment in the Maastricht Treaty to be involved in European defence policy, with the possibility post 1996 of being involved in European defence <i>per se.</i> These issues cannot be ignored and I would expect the Minister to lead the debate on the implications for the Irish Defence Forces of the current debate on Irish foreign policy.  The two can no longer be kept in separate compartments as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I still believe the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, was a mistake, that it was passed without proper consideration of the implications and that it should be repealed.  I remain committed to the participation of Irish troops in peacekeeping operations.  Like most Irish people I am immensely proud of the Army in helping to keep the peace in various trouble spots throughout the world.  However, I do not want to see Irish troops become the pawns of the big powers in dangerous and ill-defined peace enforcement operations.  It strikes me in relation to the report before us that while the Minister referred to the changes in the mandate for Somalia he did not detail the terms of that mandate to the House in the course of his report.  It is significant that the mandates under which the United Nations sends troops abroad, whether Irish or otherwise, are not automatically made available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Recent events in Yemen raise the question of how decisions about intervention <Col N="1196" /> are made by the Security Council.  We have a range of experiences since the ending of the Cold War in various parts of the world, ranging from the former Yugoslavia to Somalia.  Rwanda is a new area of concern which appears to be the tip of a very large iceberg.  We need to be extremely conscious of the implications for the rest of Africa of the type of conflict which is raging in Rwanda and the role the United Nations may play.  A civil war is raging in Yemen and there are no calls that I am aware of for the United Nations to intervene to stop it. Yet there are calls in relation to Rwanda and there have been persistent calls in relation to Bosnia.</P>
    <P>There are issues behind the newspaper headlines which make for decisions at United Nations level.  I draw attention to an article on the United Nations &mdash; which I quoted last year in the defence debate &mdash; in the March, 1993 issue of the <i>Irish Law Times</i> by Ms Liz Heffernan, a lecturer in law in Trinity College, Dublin, who said:</P>
    <P>signs of undemocratic practices have emerged . . . not least the selective nature of Security Council action and the use of the Council as a vehicle for the promotion of the agendas of permanent members.</P>
    <P>We need to have a more comprehensive and global view of the role of the United Nations forces and the role the Irish Defence Forces will play now and in the future in relation to requests we may have from the United Nations and the areas of activity.  For example, the Minister in his report referred to &ldquo;future involvement of Irish troops&rdquo;.  He makes the point in relation to Somalia that the time may have arrived to withdraw &ldquo;in the circumstances and having regard to our many other commitments&rdquo;.  The Minister does not explain what he means by &ldquo;in the circumstances&rdquo;.  In the latter part of his report he stated that: &ldquo;Consistent with the safety of our troops, which is an overriding consideration, this commitment to peacekeeping will continue...&rdquo;. What policy considerations does the Minister take into account in <Col N="1197" /> reviewing the participation of Irish troops in Somalia?  It is not clear from the report why he believes it is necessary seriously to consider withdrawing Irish troops when the conflict is not settled.  These are issues which the Minister's report should have dealt with in more detail.  If the Minister had produced a longer report for the House it could have dealt with the issues I am raising.</P>
    <P>The Somalian United Nations operation is a classic example of the difficulties which the United Nations will face in the future.  While there was a genuine need to ensure that humanitarian aid was provided for those in need and that the relief organisations were protected, the whole approach was wrong.  In the early days of the operation huge numbers of mainly United States combat troops were sent into Somalia with an array of deadly weapons and sophisticated equipment but rather than bringing peace they brought more conflict. While the conduct of Irish troops has been exemplary, the conduct of the United Nations contingents was more appropriate to an army of occupation.  I draw attention to the fact that in Somalia United Nations troops shelled suburban areas and housing estates, supposedly in pursuit of the warlord Aidid, now commonly know as General Aidid.  Housing estates were shelled in the belief that the conflict would end if they got this man. That was a nonsense.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the fact that no one would stand for shelling a housing estate in Northern Ireland in the pursuit of apprehending those involved in the conflict such as the Chief of Staff of the IRA or the Loyalist paramilitaries.  My point &mdash; and I made it at the time &mdash; is that this is a stark example of what can happen when the wrong approach is adopted and combat troops are used in what is essentially a new role for the United Nations, peace enforcement.  I am not sure if it is known how many people died in pursuit of the political objective of the US troops of delivering the head of General Aidid to President Clinton.  The US troops have left and the mandate of UNOSOM II has quite properly been changed to peacekeeping. <Col N="1198" /> General Aidid, the former warlord, remains at large and only two months ago was able to meet the Minister for Defence in Nairobi, who later described him as his good friend.</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the Minister for meeting him.  I am pleased his good friend was alive to meet him and able to participate in the peace process in Somalia.</P>
      <P>Whether troops are deployed in peacekeeping operations or peace enforcement operations is a serious matter.  In reaching that decision we need to take account of myriad factors, of which we may not be aware because of distance and cultural differences.</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the role the Minister played, which was very positive.  He has also put on record his view on the UN peace enforcement mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Important information has come to light since the legislation was passed by the Dáil, that the Minister for Defence opposed sending Irish troops to Somalia on a peace enforcement mission.  If we had known that last year who knows what the Dáil might have decided?  The debate certainly would have been different.  It seems that the demand for the amendment of the Defence Act came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence defended that decision when all along apparently he was opposed to it.  During an inspection of the most recent contingent of Irish troops going to Somalia he told a reporter from <i>The Irish Times</i>&ldquo;I always felt that the UN enforcement mandate was a mistake, I believe that UN peacekeeping should remain peacekeeping <i>simpliciter.</i>&rdquo; The Minister confirmed this view when responding to my questions on 13 April. <Col N="1199" /> It is virtually without precedent that an important decision of that kind should be made, that the Minister of the day should defend a decision although he is opposed to it and, subsequently, say in this House he was always opposed to it.  I expect that if the Government seeks to put through another resolution seeking Irish troops for a peace enforcement mission he will refuse to push it through, it is the least he can do for this House and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to dwell on the question of abandoning our neutrality, which is not a black and white issue, we do not have to choose a traditional type of neutrality <i>versus</i> militarism or involvement in military alliances.  Ireland can play a much more sophisticated role in foreign affairs apart from joining the big boys in the hope that we will be regarded as good and as a result not ignored.  We have a very real role to play as a small State with a very honourable role in peacekeeping around the world.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from Defence Forces personnel who work in the Ordnance Survey Office.  Members who served voluntarily abroad have found it very difficult to return to their previous jobs on their return.  That is not a proper way to treat members of the Defence Forces who serve this country on peacekeeping missions.  I understand from recent replies to my questions that all such officers have been re-employed by the Ordnance Survey Office but, as far as I know, not all in the jobs they held before going abroad.  Ways must be found to ensure that when Army personnel volunteer to go abroad on peacekeeping duties their jobs are safe.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the speed with which I delivered my opening address but this was due to the limitation on time.</P>

      <P>My point is that the Minister's report, which is essentially his speech, was placed in the Library only a short time before this debate started. The report should have been given to us at least a week ago and it should be more comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first point is fair and I will consider it as the matter can be corrected.  The Deputy questions the comprehensiveness of the report but I think it stands on its own and bears examination on any question of detail.  I do not accept that aspect of the Deputy's criticism.</P>
      <P>I welcome the contributions by Deputies Bradford, Clohessy and De Rossa, although most of Deputy De Rossa's contribution was in the area of foreign affairs &mdash; he referred to neutrality, observer status at the Western European Union and whether we should become a full member thereof as well as discussing security in 1996.  These matters remain to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bradford asked whether we will continue to serve in Somalia, that will be a question for the Taoiseach and his Government in due course.  I am not certain that in the meantime we will be able to have a debate in anticipation of that decision.  I imagine that the decision will be taken some time towards the end of June or July, the Dáil may be in recess so I do not wish to give an undertaking on the possibility of a debate.  Today's debate was helpful and I know the Deputy's view on that issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey paid tribute to the troops and welcomed the presence of our troops in Somalia.  He referred to the happenings in Rwanda.  We heard this morning that the Security Council will be discussing the question of sending additional United Nations troops in whatever capacity they might be required.  I am grateful to the Deputies; this general discussion has been helpful and will advance my knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the report considered the report of the task force on the report <i>A Crusade for Survival.</i></P>
      <P>The Government welcome the report of the task force and the speed with which it brought forward its recommendations. I launched the report <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> in Castlebar on 3 February.  The Government announced the establishment of the task force on 16 February; the members were appointed on 1 March and this report was submitted to the Government on 18 April 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the task force were: to assess the recommendations of the report and bring forward proposals to Government as to the actions that <Col N="1202" /> might be taken and to make recommendations to Government on the most appropriate permanent institutional response.</P>
    <P>In establishing the task force the Government recognised the acute economic and social problems of the west arising from a declining population and from the projection that this population decline could continue, with the consequental social and economic implications, unless specific action is taken to arrest this process.  The Government has accepted the task force recommendation that the goal of policy should be to achieve population stability in the region on a county basis at 1991 census levels by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The task force identified a number of key issues of specific significance to the west and these are outlined in Chapter 2 of the report.  I do not propose to give a detailed list in this reply but copies of the report have been made available to this House.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the task force's view that the achievement of population stability requires the pursuit of appropriate national economic policy as articulated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the National Development Plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>The implementation process in respect of the majority of recommendations made by the task force is either ongoing as part of existing sectoral policies or planned as part of the measures to be undertaken in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has agreed to take immediate positive action in respect of a number of specific policy recommendations which were emphasised by the task force.  These include action in relation to milk quotas, assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, continued promotion of the west for mobile investment, review of registration &mdash; standards policy and funding of the accommodation base, licensing and planning framework for the sea fishing and aquaculture sectors and a <Col N="1203" /> pilot urban renewal incentive scheme in a small number of towns in the west.</P>
    <P>As regards the most appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving the objectives set out in <i>A Crusade for Survival,</i> the Government, on the recommendation of the task force, has approved the establishment of a partnership structure, the Western Development Partnership Board, within the local development programme.  The strategic focus of the partnership board will be, through the development of an action plan, to provide direction to the activities of the various agencies and community-based organisations concerned with economic development in the west.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that, as recommended by the task force, the board will be established and members appointed by Government by the end of June and that the inaugural meeting will take place as soon as possible after that date with the action plan to be compiled and published within 12 months.  The Government will require the relevant agencies within the region to prepare detailed responses to this action plan and these will be monitored by the partnership board.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 is being made available as initial funding for the board in 1994.  It is intended to cover administrative costs, including staffing and the initial stages of preparation of the action plan.  The figure reflects the fact that the board will be in existence for less than six months in 1994.  Funding in subsequent years will be settled in the normal way in the context of departmental Estimates and the allocation of EU funds for the local development programme over the years of the national plan.</P>
    <P>The Government has no plans to establish a similar board for the Dublin region. The underlying economic conditions in the Dublin region are quite different from those in the west, where the task force identified major problems, arising from an imbalance in the demographic structure, in the threat to the viability of small local businesses and to the maintenance of effective public and social services catering for the remaining <Col N="1204" /> population.  The Government recognises that local area or community groups no matter how well motivated or successful, cannot address such issues without a strategic approach at regional level.</P>
    <P>The stark facts outlined in <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> are that a century ago the region boasted a population of 910,000 people, which by 1991, had fallen to 510,000.  If current net out migration trends continue, the region stands to lose 110,000 people, one fifth of its total population during the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>The population in Dublin in the years 1986 to 1991 has been stable in contrast to the west.</P>
    <P>The economy in the Dublin region is much more viable.  The implementation of policies enunciated in the national plan with the support of EU Structural Funds will further develop enterprise and employment in the Dublin region.  I recognise the seriousness of the unemployment problems in Dublin, both in scale and in terms of the extent of long term unemployment.  The challenge is to develop policies which enable the unemployed to benefit from the economic developments occurring in the Dublin region.  This objective will be significantly advanced by the Government's policies regarding the tax treatment of those at work.  Equally relevant is the fact that the local development programme will support the creation and expansion of small businesses through support from enterprise boards of which there are four in the Dublin city and county areas, while the particular needs of the designated disadvantaged areas will be met through an integrated socio-economic development approach operated by partnership companies.  There are five such partnerships in Dublin at present, and two of these are being extended under the local development programme.  A further five new areas in Dublin have been designated.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that a further structure in the Dublin region would add value to the initiatives already in place.  Over the period of the national plan these initiatives will be assessed and evaluated and the Government can then consider <Col N="1205" /> if the policy objectives are being fully achieved or if further initiatives are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply which contains a number of aspirations and a great many generalities and which is a summary of the proposals of the task force arising from the report entitled <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> issued by the Bishops.  Will the partnership board have a chief executive officer to be appointed by the Government? Will it comprise nominees of the county enterprise boards and Leader projects as recommended by the task force and set definitive targets in terms of job creation given that the Taoiseach identified this as a specific requirement?  The chief executive officer of the IDA said it had set a target of 9,000 jobs for the west. How many of these will be delivered by the board either on a provincial or county basis and will it be given designated status as an incentive to attract jobs to the region given that it has lost 200,000 people in the past 50 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has moved a few steps ahead of the task force which recommended the establishment of a partnership board which will, with everybody concerned, prepare an action plan for the region.  A council will also be set up and the Government will facilitate and support everybody concerned in the region in whatever way it can.  Like the task force any recommendations will be accepted as we have no intention of imposing our will.  The people in the west want to do something for themselves, but need the support of the Government.  It is with that in mind that we will set up the partnership board which, in turn, will put together an action plan within 12 months.  We have committed £50,000 to pay the administrative costs of the board for the remainder of this year.  It is estimated that approximately £100,000 in administrative costs will be needed to run the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of the Western Development Partnership <Col N="1206" /> Board which is long overdue. How can the Taoiseach say that a similar initiative is not necessary for Dublin? Surely he is aware that the biggest boost in population has occurred in the Dublin region, that Dublin has the highest <i>per capita</i> unemployment rate, the most serious endemic poverty and deprivation and the most concentrated unemployment blackspots?  How can he say there is not a case for some form of regional initiative in the capital which is relatively the most neglected area in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure very few would agree with the Deputy that Dublin is the most neglected area in the country. The west is suffering a serious decline in population but that is not the position in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the population of Dublin. While there may have been a decline in the population of parts of the inner city, the population of the greater Dublin region has increased.  Many policy initiatives have been adopted to direct life back into the city to make the inner city a living place.  Urban renewal policies have been extremely successful.  Approximately 5,000 people have returned to live in inner city areas as a result of policies specifically focused on getting the population back to the inner city.  It is obvious from the image of Dublin over recent years that many of the dilapidated sites have been eliminated by the urban renewal initiative and that unemployment blackspots &mdash; which nobody is denying exist &mdash; have been tackled under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Areas have been designated under local employment and community development schemes.  Policies are focused on those areas.  The approach to be adopted for the west is not necessary for Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major problem to be addressed in the west is that of a declining population.  If the population there continues <Col N="1207" /> to decline it will become much more expensive to deliver services in the area.  There would also be many other repercussions.  The same is not true in the case of Dublin where more enterprise promotions are required.  The problem in Dublin is not one of population decline. The Government is pursuing policies for Dublin to focus on the problems of the city which are much different to those in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach serious about the problems in the west, apart from the passion in his response to the questions tabled by Deputy Kenny and me?  Does he realise he has not answered one supplementary question put to him by Deputy Kenny?  Is he aware that the general reaction in the west to the partnership board is that it is a pathetic and insulting response to an area clinging by its fingernails for survival?  Is the Taoiseach serious about this initiative? An initiative by the Minister for Social Welfare means-testing the dole, a scheme by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to keep milk quotas in the region and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment overseeing the development of indigenous industry is not adequate.  What indigenous industry is he talking about?  Is he aware that the only other two Ministers involved, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, reviewing registration procedures, and the Minister for the Environment exploring methods of securing EU funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to Bishop Finnegan's comments.  It is extraordinary that those who want to reduce the role of the Church in our lives want to increase the role of the State. Will the Taoiseach accept that the reason for the many difficulties in the west is the lack of employment and economic opportunities generally?  The Culliton report suggested that if we were to improve economic development we should have less bureaucracy, fewer State boards and task forces.  Will he accept also that the establishment of this task force and the number of State boards established in the past 12 months is in direct conflict with the recommendations of Culliton?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that Culliton had all the answers to the problems of the Irish economy and I said that on the day the report was published. Culliton made some good recommendations but they are not 100 per cent correct.  Deputy Harney is aware that the first major problem to be dealt with in the west is its depopulation.  It is unacceptable for Deputy Harney to cast a reflection on the interest of the bishops in the west in making people self-reliant and motivated to do something for themselves.</P>

      <P>They have been a force for the restoration of self-confidence in the people of the west and have taken a forward-looking position in motivating people there, the results of which are obvious.  Local communities are seeking <Col N="1211" /> opportunities to do something for themselves. They recognise that they cannot look to the Government to solve all their problems.  It is with that philosophy in mind that we will support them, continue to work with them and if people want to throw negatives at that initiative, so be it.  We will continue to be positive.</P>

      <P>In the past forces have been successful only when they were given teeth, political clout and resources to do the job for which they were set up. Is it intended to appoint a co-ordinator or a chief executive officer to the partnership board or will the targets and objectives set by the board be the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister?  Will a chairman of the task force deal with priorities arising from the action plans? The Taoiseach has rightly identified that population stability can only be achieved through economic development and harnessing various incentives.</P>

I know from experience that a task force did an excellent job to <Col N="1212" /> try to arrest economic decline following a series of closures in my county of Longford. Many opportunities may be developed in the west and tourism is a major development target of the Government in that regard.  The areas of fisheries and forestry could be developed.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, tried to interest company representatives in the United States in forestry development in the west.  In the past few weeks the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, announced new employment opportunities for Ballinrobe and Castlerea.  The Government decided to build a prison in Castlerea.</P>

There is a commitment in the National Development Plan to allocate money to that region.  We expect to take up the issue with Brussels to see what may be available to supplement the efforts of the western partnership board as it was fully supportive and, with the Government, contributed to the cost of examining the problems of the region.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the population of Dublin has increased by 250,000 in the past 20 years and that during the period there was a decline in industrial employment of 36,000?  It is that decline we seek to address.  Does he acknowledge that of the increase in unemployment between August 1992 and August 1993 of 4,400 people, 3,600 or 80 per cent live in Dublin and that the traditional policies of the IDA have discriminated against Dublin? If the Taoiseach says a different strategy is needed in the Dublin region from that in the west will he indicate what alternative he is offering the people of Dublin, having regard to the fact that macroeconomic policies have not lifted people out of the unemployment blackspots <Col N="1213" /> of the city which experience the most serious deprivation and poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny Dublin has its problems but they are not the same as those in the west.  That is the substance of this question.  There has been a decline in industrial employment in Dublin and its industrial base has changed dramatically in the past 25 to 30 years.  Many of the small industries in the old parts of Dublin have disappeared. Small textile and footwear industries are not in business and a different industrial infrastructure is being built.  It is sheer nonsense to say that the IDA discriminates against Dublin.</P>

      <P>Intel on the outskirts of Dublin employs 2,500 to 3,000 people and there are discussions about expanding the plant.  Recently there was an announcement about a plant in Blanchardstown. We know those projects are not sufficient; but it is sheer nonsense for the Deputy to say there is discrimination against Dublin.  We all know there is serious unemployment and that the Government is devising policies to focus on different areas to retrain and give a second chance to as many of the long term unemployed as possible. Deputy Rabbitte is aware that, unlike the west, Dublin has a base that can generate a level of economic activity.  I know the Deputy is in the middle of an election campaign and putting forward his case.</P>

Both are linked and result from a lack of planning or bad planning.  While there is massive depopulation in the west with a decrease of 208,000 and 148 townlands denuded, Dublin is becoming an uncontrollable monster.  Will the Taoiseach accept that a dynamic agency like SFADCo is required, with powers, an agenda, executive officers and a specific budget and targets to report back, through the Minister to this House?</P>

It is easy to come into the House and float support here and there.  We all read stories in the papers as to where support lies for candidates.  To my knowledge the Belgian candidate has not even made it public that he is a candidate, but we are told that various countries are supporting him.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 16 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in a press release issued on my behalf on 15 April last, the review of Bord Fáilte will pay particular attention to the suitability of existing structures and functions of Bord Fáilte in terms of strategically responding to the Government's targets for tourism growth; the compatibility of its existing mix of functions with the priority exercise <Col N="1223" /> of its core promotional role; whether Bord Fáilte's involvement of, and participation with, the sector in its developmental activities is likely to promote an evolving level of sectoral self-reliance over time.</P>
    <P>The study will also take into account whether or not various programmes and activities of Bord Fáilte are efficiently operated, effective and sufficiently responsive to the needs of the sector.  The review is due to be completed by mid-July.</P>
    <P>At this point, I have made no decision about whether or not the report will be published as I think that such a step would be both premature and inappropriate without knowing what will be in the final report.  Ultimately, it is only when the full contents are known and it can be determined whether or not issues of confidentiality or sensitivity are involved that such a decision can responsibly be made.  For what it is worth, however, and without prejudice to the reasonable concerns I have just mentioned, my disposition currently is to publish the report.</P>
    <P>As to the cost of the study, a fee not exceeding £150,000, and expenses not exceeding £30,000 have been agreed with the consultants involved.</P>
    <P>My attention has indeed been brought to the concerns expressed by some few organisations, such as the tour operators association (ITOA) regarding the consultancy study.  I have my doubts about the value of such statements which seem to be emotive and based on a clearly incomplete understanding of the situation. There is no sensible reason I can think of to sustain the view that the proposed consultancy study will do harm to the tourism sector.  Rather, it seems it should be very clear to all really concerned with the future of the sector that the study is designed to ensure this country will have the best possible institutional support available to it in the national drive to develop the full potential of the sector by the end of this decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it is the Minister's <Col N="1224" /> intention to have this report published. I am sure he would agree that, having paid £180,000 for the report, and having spent over £2 million on similar reports in the past ten years, the taxpayer deserves to know what is in it.  Would the Minister agree that the consultancy group should look into the relationship between Bord Fáilte and other groups?  This will have to be done by a further consultancy group if it is not done on this occasion. Finally, will the Minister ensure that the consultants will confer as widely as possible with all interested groups?  It is important that this job not be done quickly just to satisfy the Minister but that the tourism industry be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think this is a similar report to one submitted previously.  Reports have been commissioned on the tourism industry, on one occasion by the former Department of Tourism and Transport; other reports were submitted by the Irish Hotels Federation and others involved in the industry.  However, there has been no study by any consultant on the role of Bord Fáilte.  The consultancy report I am commissioning is unique.</P>
      <P>At this point I see no good reason why I should not publish the report.  However I cannot give a guarantee because the report may contain commercially sensitive items which it may not be appropriate to publish.  In principle I have no objection to publishing it, but I cannot give a commitment without seeing the report.</P>
      <P>I have previously given an outline of how I see the role of Bord Fáilte in tourism development.  Some time ago I said I would commission consultants to examine some of the items I spoke of both inside and outside this House.  When I receive the report from the consultants I will finalise my decision-making in regard to the role of Bord Fáilte.  That should be before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that Bord Fáilte has done excellent work for many years.  However, it is well to remember that nearly all of the State agencies have been examined in some <Col N="1225" /> way since their inception.  The exception is Bord Fáilte.  There is nothing unusual, therefore, in the Minister of the day deciding to look at an organisation that has been there for 50 years or so with a view to defining what its present role should be.  No one should fear what may come about as a result of this examination. If State agencies we set up were allowed to carry on <i>ad infinitum</i> and never examined, the Minister could retire.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of propaganda in the newspapers regarding this consultancy study.  Some of the suggestions were put forward with good reason but others were merely mischievous. My role as Minister is to ensure that the Government's programme for increasing jobs and investment in the economy is carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the consultants take Bord Fáilte's own proposals for the restructuring into consideration when producing their final report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the consultants will take everything into account. However, they were appointed with particular terms of reference.  I am glad the Deputy raised the question of Bord Fáilte's own proposals.  I did not see them until after I had proposed the consultancy study.  If they had proposals they must have kept them to themselves.  It is as well to clear up that point.  I am sure the consultants will take everything into account and come forward to me with ideas as to what should be done.  As I said to Deputy Deenihan during my last Question Time here, I will make my own decisions as to the changes I will make.  I am using the consultants to tease out some ideas and see what they come forward with but the decision regarding Bord Fáilte or any other matters will be my decision.  Some of those decisions will be successful, others will not but I am prepared to make them one way or the other.</P>

      <P>Overall, exchange rate policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Central Bank.  I am concerned, however, about developments which could make any of our exports less competitive.  That is why, following the 1992-93 currency crisis, I exhorted firms to take steps towards improving their treasury management capability, and I placed particular emphasis on the need to explore the possibility of collective action by small and medium enterprises on a sectoral or geographical basis.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála were asked to hold a number of regional seminars on treasury management to alert firms to the need for taking preventive steps and to advise them on the type of options open to them.</P>
      <P>In addition, a small expert group, including a representative of the Exporters' Association, has been established, whose main job is to devise the best practice for small and medium enterprises in the treasury management area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been Minister for Tourism and Trade during the last currency crisis and the Irish economy having survived that particular knock to its system, I believe we have learned some lessons.  I realise the Deputy's question relates to the fluctuation but to believe that the only factor involved in exports is the exchange rate position is to misunderstand the issue.  To have a successful export policy we must take account of low inflation and interest rates as well as other business factors.  The exchange rate at a particular period is not the sole determining factor in deciding the level of exports; many other factors must be taken into consideration. The period during which we had a fixed exchange rate was hepful to Irish exporters in that they could plan further ahead.</P>
      <P>I remember being in business before 1979 when we had parity with sterling. Every time there was a sterling crisis it affected the Irish pound.  We then had the exchange rate mechanisms from 1979 to a period in the 1980s which allowed exporters to plan their activities a short time in advance.  However, it also removed an essential aspect of business that existed in the 1970s which involved having to take account of one's treasury management function and many businesses forgot how to handle that aspect of their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions regarding a single European currency are premature and are not being <Col N="1228" /> considered at this stage.  At present I am satisfied that the rate at which the Irish pound is trading is not placing an undue burden on exporters because of the other factors I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the Irish pound trades at 98p, it will pose a threat, particularly to the food, textile and furniture industries, as accepted by the Exporters' Association? The Minister outlined the measures various companies should take but what are the Government's contingency plans if we have another crisis similar to that in 1992?  Has the Minister and his Department any immediate intervention plans to cope with such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exchange rate policy is a complicated mechanism and if one predicts it will go one way, it usually goes the other.  The success of the Irish economy over the years has led to some exchange rate problems.  The weakness of our near neighbour, the UK, due to the various aspects of its economy, is placing the Irish pound in a stronger position than sterling.  Our successful economy has produced its own exchange rate difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK and is exacerbated by the fact that while our dependence on the UK market has decreased since the 1960s from a ratio of approximately 70:30, 30 per cent of our total trade continues to be exported to the UK. Any strengthening of the Irish pound, therefore, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound sterling rate creates problems for Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>The last currency crisis underlined one key aspect of which nobody seemed to be aware.  Due to the competitive position of Irish exporters in the past number of years, they have held on to their market share despite the deteriorating currency position.  Our strength in the other areas or the other economic indicators has convinced me that there is no crisis and, therefore, I see no reason to worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 21 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Under the planning regulations planning permission is required for a material change of use of premises.  The regulations recently made by the Minister for the Environment clarified the position as to what is regarded as a material change for this purpose and what is exempted. Prior to a Bord Pleanála decision early in 1993, the provision of tourist accommodation in private houses was widely understood to be an exempted category under the Planning Acts.  The Bord Pleanála decision, however, changed that understanding resulting in the need for new regulations.  A decision had to be made in drawing up the new regulations as to what was a material change and what might be exempted.</P>
      <P>This is never an easy task and is certainly not one for which a solution acceptable to everyone is possible.  I am happy, however, that what has been done strikes a fair balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that smaller bed and breakfast premises are exempt from approval for change of use under the planning regulations does not absolve them from operating in a responsible way and providing <Col N="1230" /> a safe and secure environment for their guests.</P>
    <P>Fire safety in existing tourist accommodation is governed by the Fire Services Act, 1981.  The Act imposes a duty of care on the person in control of such premises in relation to fire safety and provides that the fire authority may exercise certain enforcement powers in relation to those premises.  The Minister for the Environment, to assist persons in control in fulfilling their statutory obligations under the Act, has published a guide to fire precautions in existing hotels, guesthouses and similar premises, and codes of practice for the management of fire safety in places of assembly and for fire safety of furnishings and fittings in places of assembly.</P>
    <P>The Buildings Regulations, 1992, the objective of which is to secure the health and safety of people in and around buildings, have been in operation since June of that year.  They apply to all new and refurbished buildings, including those containing tourist accommodation.</P>
    <P>As far as the recent planning regulations are concerned, the impression may have been given that these indicate a loosening of the planning requirement. That is not the position, however, as I have explained.  From now, for the first time, the significant segment of bed and breakfast premises &mdash; by which I mean those of a size representing real competition for hotels and registered guesthouses &mdash; will be obliged to seek such permission.  The new regulations, therefore, represent a real tightening of the controls in this sector, compared with the situation heretofore.</P>

      <P>I am more confused than ever.  Does the Minister accept that 80 per cent of all hotels and guesthouses are small businesses with 30 bedrooms or under?  They pay hefty commercial rates and generate jobs in the tourism trade. Has the likely impact of this new planning measure on existing hotels and guesthouses been assessed?  Will jobs be lost? What impact will the measure have on the job targets set for industry?</P>

      <P>This measure will not have the effects feared by the Deputy. It was assumed that one did not need planning permission for a change of use if one had a small B &amp; B.  In a case in Galway An Bord Pleanála decided there was a change of use.  In framing the new planning regulations the Minister for the Environment has decided that a house with more than a certain number of bedrooms will require permission for a change of usage.  Up to now one did not have to apply for planning permission.  It is tightening the law and will not affect the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>in regard to the decision of the Government in October 1993 to provide export credit insurance for exports to Iran, the number of applications for cover received so far; the total value of the contracts in respect of which cover has been sought; the number of applications which have been approved; the value of the contracts in these cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Since the Government's review of the provision of export credit insurance for Iran in October 1993 my Department has received a total of 19 applications for insurance cover.  The total value of contracts in respect of which cover was sought significantly exceeded the limit for the market set by the Government.  Some of these applications were not proceeded with by the companies concerned while others represent a number of applications from the same firms.  Still others did not meet certain technical requirements.</P>
      <P>Consequently just seven policies have been issued to date in respect of contracts with a total value of £16 million.  The exposure on these contracts was £9.1 million.  Four of the contracts involved the sale of beef to Iran.  Three have been paid in full while the fourth has only recently been issued.</P>
      <P>Our current exposure on this market, including exposure on policies issued prior to the Government's review, is £3.8 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently had the benefit of a briefing by the Iranian Embassy.  Our most recent beef export figures are very healthy from the point of view of this economy.  If Iran is considered a good credit risk, why is it necessary for us to persist with export credit insurance for such exports?  Am I correct in saying it is because these are not insurable in the market that resort is had to the ECIS? Why is that necessary in the case of Iran?  On whom is the benefit conferred?  Is it conferred on the exporter rather than the national economy?  Seven policies were issued valued at £16 million. Does the Minister consider that the exposure of £9.1 million is very high?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with export credit insurance and the <Col N="1234" /> merits or otherwise of it.  That can be debated another day.  The export credit insurance scheme has operated for a long time.  Since 1991 we have covered only political risk for any country.  A commercial insurer will not insure against political risk.  It will only be taken by export credit insurance agencies.  The Government reviewed the position in October.  I have stated the number of companies who availed of the scheme. The State might have insured a small amount of beef to Iran in the recent past. There have been problems in the beef industry, with consequential unemployment. The export credit insurance scheme is of benefit to the economy in that it helps to sustain jobs.  Similar to insurance companies, my Department makes a commercial decision on the terms and conditions it applies to any particular policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Iran was not off cover but that the scheme was effectively discontinued for a period.  Will the Minister outline the main beneficiaries of the scheme since the renewal decision, if one can put it that way, in October 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy correctly stated, Iran was never off cover. He should well remember when the Government made its decision to renew the scheme I replied to a matter raised by him on the Adjournment in that regard.  As I said at that stage, like my predecessors it is not my policy to name the companies which avail of the export credit insurance scheme; it has never been the policy of anyone with responsibility for this scheme to name the companies which avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue the matter unduly as I do not believe an issue arises in the case of Iran, but will the Minister agree that more than one of his predecessors got into trouble for not giving answers in the House about the beneficiaries of the export credit insurance scheme?  There does not seem to be an obvious commercial implication <Col N="1235" /> as to why we should not be told who avails of the export credit insurance scheme, which ought to be a transparent matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can apply the same general rule to all Departments. The Department acts as an insurance underwriter in the case of the export credit insurance scheme.  It is not the policy of any insurance underwriting company in Ireland or the United Kingdom to give details of the companies which have policies with them, and the Department should be able to guarantee the same degree of confidentiality to its clients.  The names of the companies availing of the export credit insurance scheme is sensitive commercial information. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, some companies do not avail of this scheme; they are able to make their own commercial decisions.  If companies knew that their competitors were availing of the export credit insurance scheme, which entails a cost, they would be in a better position to make a bid at that stage.  It is not my policy to give the names of the companies availing of the scheme.</P>

      <P>An Bord Tráchtála currently forecast that the total value of exports will reach £19.8 billion this year. The national development agencies, in line with Government policy, are giving top priority to maximising the contribution of exporting companies to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as ABT, the national export promotion agency, is concerned, I have <Col N="1236" /> set it a target of helping Irish indigenous firms to increase their exports by almost 75 per cent &mdash; from £3.9 billion in 1993 to £6.8 billion &mdash; by 1999.</P>
    <P>The fact that the indigenous exporting sector has been shown to be much more labour intensive than the multinational sector is reflected in the priority and focus accorded to this group in ABT's planned activities under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999.  ABT, in co-operation with the other development agencies, will, of course, be attempting to ensure a greater transfer from export growth into employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte and I previously discussed this issue on two fronts: first, why there has not been a consequential increase in jobs and, second, the level of transfer pricing &mdash; other names are given to this practice.  As Minister with responsibility for Tourism and Trade, my target is to increase exports by indigenous firms from £3.9 billion in 1993 to £6.8 billion by 1999, an increase of approximately 75 per cent. The total value of exports of £19.8 billion forecast for this year relates mainly to multinational companies.  Various reports, one of which was published approximately 18 months ago, economic experts, statisticians and professors in educational institutions have addressed this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in increasing the level of exports by indigenous Irish firms from £3.9 billion in 1993 to £6.8 billion by 1999.  Exports account for two out of every three jobs in manufacturing and of the total of 222,000 jobs in manufacturing, <Col N="1237" /> 140,000 are dependent on exports.  Of the 140,000 jobs dependent on exports, 98,000 or 70 per cent are in indigenous Irish companies.  Exports by indigenous Irish companies account for approximately 20 per cent of total exports.  Indigenous companies are much more labour intensive than multinational companies.  A report published last year dealt with the extraordinary reasons as to why multinational companies cannot translate their high level of productivity in terms of exports into jobs.  I am interested in indigenous industries which, as proven by these figures, can create the greatest number of jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any view on why the apparently very healthy export performance, which is a continuation of what has been the trend during the best part of a decade, has still not been translated into a proportionate number of jobs and why the level of industrial employment has largely remained static?  If our export performance is so healthy why can we not use it to boost additional job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While industrial employment has increased during the past decade, we have also lost a considerable number of jobs.  Various studies by the NESC and academics have dealt with this issue.  I have my own views on it, which I articulated many years ago. Many people, including the ESRI, have predicted that there will be a reasonably healthy increase in the number of people in employment during the coming years. Twelve years ago I read an obscure article on the international recession during the 1970s in which the writer asked why, after two years of growth, there had not been a consequential increase in jobs.  I forget who wrote that article but he made the simple assumption that firms reduce their number of employees during a recession &mdash; for example, a company which employs, say, 300 workers will make 150 of them redundant &mdash; and they wait a long time after the recession is over before they start employing people again. In the meantime probably there may be <Col N="1238" /> a growth in technology resulting in higher productivity per person.  As we come out of the recession, it is as good a propositional theory to advance as any I have read in the intervening 12 years.  It is as sensible a suggestion as many others backed by much high falutin theory and so on.  It makes as good sense to me as some other theories advanced.</P>

      <P>At the outset I must express my dismay at the decision by Chic by HIS not to proceed with the project. I share the deep sense of disappointment felt by the people of Kilkenny and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>When I announced the project on 25 February last, which was attended by the company's head of European operations, there was no indication that certain problems would arise in completing the finer details of the proposal which had received the approval and full support of Government.  Planning permission for the facilities had been received and tenders for construction work were about to be sought.</P>
      <P>In completing the legal aspects of the proposal, as is the normal procedure, certain difficulties arose between IDA Ireland and the company.  The main issue was the insistence by the company that the grants be paid at the start of the project rather than on a phased basis as job targets were met.  The House will appreciate the need to ensure that adequate safeguards exist in relation to the use of taxpayers' money.  In this case IDA Ireland could not accede to the demands of the company.  Despite further detailed negotiations, including a personal intervention by me, it was not possible to change the company's decision that they were not proceeding with the investment.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the loss of such a major investment but wish to stress that every avenue was explored in the efforts to secure the project.</P>
      <P>I assure the House and Deputy Pattison that IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with all interested parties with a view to getting an alternative project for Kilkenny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this is a major embarrassment for IDA Ireland and the country in view of the fact that an announcement was made on 25 February that a potential 460 jobs in a manufacturing facility was to be established in Kilkenny without any contract having been signed between that company and IDA Ireland?  Would the Minister agree that such inward-investing prospectors, such as this company, are at a tremendous advantage once such an announcement is made and a contract not signed since in this instance the company sought extra special facilities and aid in order to advance this facility for Kilkenny?  It was allowed do so through the strategy of IDA Ireland and the Minister of making announcements, without contracts being signed, to the effect that everything will be in order whereas the finer details should have been teased out before the announcement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is a major embarrassment to either IDA Ireland or myself.  What is at issue here is the safeguarding of taxpayers' money. A contract was signed, to the extent that approval in principle was signed and agreed by both sides, subject to the legal details being worked out, as in the normal practice with every IDA project over the past ten years.  The normal practice was followed in this instance.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, late in the day, long after Mr. Milan Danek, the chief of European operations, who participated in the announcement in Kilkenny, had indicated that they were coming to Kilkenny, the company and its representatives sought certain requirements, some of which were met.  However, IDA Ireland, with my full support, was not in a position to break its standard practice of ensuring that job targets would be met by grants approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is reckless and irresponsible of a Minister, or any other Government spokesperson, to announce new jobs before contracts have been signed?  We are aware of the premature announcement <Col N="1241" /> of 2,000 new jobs in the south east in recent months which have been lost to the region.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject utterly what Deputy Quill said, this was not a premature announcement.  This announcement was authorised by the company when its chief of European operations was present.  This agreement had the approval of the board of IDA Ireland and the Government.  IDA Ireland is sending a clear signal to Irish taxpayers that their money is well guarded and is sending an even stronger signal to the international investment community that, while Ireland remains the best location for investment in Europe, we will not be taken in by anybody.</P>

We simply will not acquiesce.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned one iota &mdash; and was glad to hear the Minister express a similar view &mdash; about the embarrassment of this but I am concerned about the severe, cruel blow to the people of Kilkenny and surrounding areas whose hopes had been so raised. As the Minister will be aware, the former Fieldcrest factory closed more than 12 years ago.  A portion of the premises was taken over and provided good employment, but a large part remained vacant in which it was hoped this company would be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister give the House an <Col N="1242" /> assurance about a replacement industry since the people of Kilkenny have been waiting for more than 12 years with high hopes of the finalisation of this project? Those hopes have been dashed.  Can the Minister soften the severity of the blow this disappointment has dealt to the people of Kilkenny and surrounding areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate and share the Deputy's concern in relation to how the people of Kilkenny and the surrounding area must feel about this announcement because they had been led to believe by the company that it was coming to Kilkenny.  They would much prefer the situation which has arisen now than one in which a company did not commit itself properly or provide the safeguards that are normally required by the IDA and which the IDA is getting from all the other inward investing companies here.  The balance of the Fieldcrest facility which is owned by Forfás, on behalf of the IDA, will be vigorously promoted by the IDA.  There is much more interest in inward investment in the Irish economy and every effort will be undertaken by the IDA to get a replacement project, as soon as possible, for Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister decide that what was sought in this project was bad value for money, given the newspaper reports that the cost per job was less than £10,000 which, by the standards which the Minister usually applies, would be roughly half that sanctioned in other cases?  I know the Minister does not like to be reminded of the Clonmel and other projects.  Will he agree that if you announce a project without a watertight agreement you are inviting gazumping and upping the bid, particularly when the international environment for mobile projects is so hotly contested?  If you do not have a watertight agreement and make an announcement you are open to pressure.  The lesson to be learnt from this experience as well as from the other experiences is <Col N="1243" /> that you must not make any announcement until the legal contracts are signed.</P>

      <P>Please do not tell me that you will dispute between Clonmel and Limerick.  In respect of the AST project which was coming to Clonmel, the company changed their minds because they acquired the Tandy Corporation.  They closed down the Tandy Corporation in Scotland against very strong efforts by the Scottish Development Corporation and decided to transfer everything to Ireland.  They found that the only available location of 400,000 square feet was in Limerick so that there is no comparison and no connection whatsoever. The project was not lost.</P>

      <P>To respond to the second part of the Deputy's first supplementary, it is not a question of value for money but rather a question of safeguarding taxpayers' money.  The money being given out is not mine or the IDA's private money.  This is not a private venture capital group which is examining projects and investing money.  These people sought the payment of the grants up front in advance of job targets being delivered. Over many years the IDA has established good practices and procedures precisely to safeguard taxpayers' money to ensure if a deal is made with an inward investment company that it relates to the cost per job.  Deputy Bruton is correct in saying that the relative cost per job is cheaper because of the capital infrastructure related to the number of people being employed, but under no circumstances could the IDA be expected to pay, in the first month, all the moneys related to jobs supposed to be put in place over a three year period.  How could they guarantee that those jobs would be created?  The normal business practice is not to pay for the goods until they are delivered.  These people sought cash up front with no guarantees.  We will not use taxpayers' money in such an irresponsible and reckless fashion.  I support what the IDA did.  These conditions were on paper the first day they began to do business with us.  Those conditions did not change up to or after 25 February.  Subsequently they sought to change the conditions and other matters related to guarantees and undertakings about taxpayers' money. We will get good investment into Ireland but I will not sell this country and the taxpayers short.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that the Minister is making a song and dance about all the difficulties in the negotiations, how is it that an agreement was announced as if it was signed, sealed and delivered despite the fact that there were obviously major difficulties involved in the financing of <Col N="1245" /> this business, resulting in such disaster for people who thought they had 460 jobs?  Why would any Government make a formal announcement, completely unaware of what would happen afterwards? How many other companies may be in the same position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement was made.  From the time Deputy Bruton's brother was Minister for Industry and Commerce it has been the practice to make an announcement once approval is given by Government and heads of an agreement between both sides, through the IDA, have been arrived at.  The matter becomes public knowledge when the company applies for planning permission or seeks employees.  This has been normal practice during the past ten to 15 years.  The company, which was well aware that the conditions and requirements negotiated would be signed up after the formal announcement, changed its mind and sought to change conditions which were on the table at the outset.  The announcement was made by the company.  Mr. Milan Danek came from Munich to Ireland and spoke to journalists.  Some Deputies were present and heard what he had to say and why he thought Ireland was a good location.  He had nothing but praise for the treatment he got from the IDA and so on.  No new conditions were introduced by the IDA or the Government.  Changes were sought afterwards by the other side which had the effect of asking us to be less mindful of taxpayers' money.  Neither I nor the IDA was prepared to agree to that.  Most important &mdash; and in some respects I am glad of the opportunity to debate this matter &mdash; I am not prepared to be blackmailed in public by the suggestion by Deputy Quill that to avoid political embarrassment we might have acquiesced to the demands of this company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an upset and an embarrassment.  The reality is that the Minister should know what is going on in the IDA and in the company.  The company has pulled the wool over the eyes of the IDA by the manner in which they have negotiated this contract and by getting the Minister and the IDA to announce this facility for Kilkenny.  They forced the Minister into a situation where he had to increase the aid on offer to the particular American firm.  It was a grand strategy by the company which worked to their advantage in this case in a competitive international environment for inward investment.  Will the Minister change the practice in light of this experience and in light of the fact that the company nominated for Clonmel went to Limerick?</P>
      <P>The facility at Clonmel transferred to Limerick but in this instance I understand the facility may not stay in the country. What special initiative will the Minister take to overcome the upset and embarrassment of this unique situation and fill the vacant space of 80,000 square feet in the former Fieldcrest plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a case of embarrassment. It is an attempt by a company to squeeze more than was originally on the table.  I fully understand and share the <Col N="1247" /> upset caused to the people of Kilkenny on learning that the company which had informed them it was coming to the city was not now coming.  The company had hoped perhaps that because of the publicity the Government would be forced to deviate from sound commercial principles. Anyone in business knows that you do not do business in this manner and do not pay cash up front for goods when you cannot be certain of delivery. That simply is not smart.</P>
      <P>I will not change the policy.  I believe the IDA has been right and any other serious investors considering this country will recognise they are dealing with a professional agency and a serious Government that will not be forced into panic decisions because of the pressure of possible embarrassment.  Neither will I change the policy on announcements because when the heads of an agreement have been arrived at and approved by the Government, following the IDA's board assessment of the project, the matter very quickly becomes semi-public knowledge because of applications for planning permission and advertisements for employment. Instead of information being imparted in a haphazard form it is better, as has been the practice, to announce projects approved by the company, the IDA and the Government.  That is exactly what happened in this instance and I do not propose to change that procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept responsibility for industrial policy and recognise that the procedures that operate have to come through my desk.  In this instance the company negotiated with the IDA and the IDA board, following detailed negotiation, agreed the heads of an agreement in respect of that company, which came before me for sanction.  I sanctioned it and subsequently brought it to Government and recommended it. Members heard Deputy Bruton say that in comparison with other projects on a cost per job basis it is very good value &mdash; and the Government accepted it on that basis.  This is in line with normal practice and procedures.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the IDA's position has been weakened as a result of this incident.  The fact that the IDA refused to budge on what must be interpreted as unreasonable changes in position on issues never raised by the company prior to that agreement being reached clearly sends a signal that the IDA is a serious operation backed by a competent Government which will only do business with serious investors.  We are not here to facilitate people who think we may be a soft touch.</P>

      <P>I am happy to reply to the Deputy because he reminded me of something I had forgotten &mdash; because Forfás had requested the existing temporary tenants in the Fieldcrest factory to vacate it, news of this project became known, hence the reason for making these announcements as soon as the heads of an agreement were arrived at.  I agree with Deputy Pattison, I met the deputy vice president of the company in October in Atlanta, Georgia, and at that stage he was talking in firm terms of coming to Kilkenny.  That facility has been off the IDA's books for other potential investors because it had every reason to feel sure that it had secured an inward investor.</P>
      <P>The IDA will put the facility actively into play for the very positive number of inward investment inquiries.  I am told by Kieran McGowan of the IDA that it is looking at its best year ever in inward investment projects.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening, as I commenced my contribution, I pointed out that the Minister had effectively wheeled a Trojan horse into the House and that, apart from organising trade fairs &mdash; to borrow from the Minister's speech &mdash; to get the leprechaun, shamrock and harp on the one stand the functions of this new board are far from clear. This Bill is a tragic, wasted opportunity. As the Minister said, its origins go back to the Culliton report and to the subsequent report of the expert group on the food industry which made detailed recommendations on the subject.  Those who were involved in the Culliton review <Col N="1279" /> group and the expert group on the food industry must be sadly disappointed with the Bill as it falls far short of the detailed and excellent recommendations of those bodies in their reports.</P>
      <P>This is a window dressing exercise; we are pretending we are establishing a worthwhile body in this most important food and agricultural sector.  We should have waited until we were in a position to present a comprehensive Bill and adopt an integrated approach from the plough to the plate in relation to food production, processing, promotion and marketing &mdash; the entire food chain &mdash; instead of trying to fool those involved in business by putting in place a high powered sales team.  Apart from this, I cannot find any other functions which the Bill will confer on the new board.  There is nothing wrong with putting a high powered sales team in place but we need to integrate far more in this vital industry which contributes over £2 billion in GNP.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that a greater degree of unity is needed in the activities of State agencies as regards promotion and market development for food products, particularly overseas, and that a number of our fellow member states of the European Union have single agencies for food promotion which operate with considerable success.  He spoke about promotion and marketing; yet he directed his comments at promotion only.  He either believes that promotion and marketing are one and the same or that An Bord Bia will be responsible for promotion but he cannot have it both ways.  As far as I can see, An Bord Bia will only have a role in relation to promotion &mdash; the super sales team.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I expect that plan to develop synergies between the different food promotion activities and to develop also &ldquo;an overall promotion strategy which, making full use of the Irish image, would have a major impact on markets abroad&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quotation was borrowed from the report of the expert group on the food <Col N="1280" /> industry.  Does the Minister accept there is a difference between promotion and marketing and my point that the Bill deals only with promotion, in other words high powered sales teams?  What role, if any, will the new board have in relation to marketing?  It may well have none because I do not think the European Union will allow us to support efforts to market branded products as distinct from generic food products.  This would be contrary to the best rules of fair play in the European Union.  We have been frustrated by these rules for some time.  It is hard to explain to young people the reason we cannot market Irish made food products and run &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns which were successful in the past. I understand this is not acceptable under the rules of the European Union; we are supposed to promote European produce. If that is the case will the European Union allow An Bord Bia to market branded products?  I do not think so.  I do not see the board having a role in relation to marketing.  Perhaps it will be able to make up the rules as it goes along or, to put it more politely, to determine its functions.  To borrow the Minister's words, it will stop the squabbling at food fairs and ensure that everyone is on the same trade stand so that we get value for money.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to combine the present functions of CBF and the food unit of An Bord Tráchtála and to include the export promotion functions of An Bord Glas in relation to edible horticultural products.  Despite the recommendations of all the expert groups who reported on this most important area in recent years, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is not to be included.  Fish, fish processing and value added fish products are extremely important but, more importantly, have great potential for growth if properly organised and structured.  I have no doubt the Minister will tell us that a review of the functions of BIM is taking place within the Department of the Marine and that when the review is complete and gathering dust on some shelf An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will not form part of An Bord Bia because the Minister <Col N="1281" /> for Agriculture, Food and Forestry lost that battle with the Minister for the Marine.  There is no point in trying to fool any of us as it will not work.  It makes a nonsense of the concept not to include the fish processing sector in an integrated approach to food promotion and marketing.</P>
    <P>What is worse is that An Bord Bainne will have nothing to do with An Bord Bia.  An Bord Bainne is an extremely successful co-operative which promotes and markets dairy produce but it will not be included in the terms of reference of the food board.  The reason that will be given is that it is a co-operative and can deal only with semi-State structures.  Is this the truth?  Will An Bord Bainne continue to carry out its present functions?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>With that exception, An Bord Bia will be responsible for promotion and market development for the whole range of Irish food and drink products.</P>
    <P>Unknown to those who run An Bord Bainne, its promotion and market development activities in the dairy sector will now be run by An Bord Bia.  If this is not true, the Minister misled the House and if it is he should tell An Bord Bainne because it does not realise it.  Either way the Minister has a problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Kerrygold promotion, will there be duplication?  Are the promotion and marketing development activities of the dairy industry on which Kerrygold have spent approximately £6 million to be duplicated or run by An Bord Bia?  I ask the Minister to clarify that matter quickly.</P>
    <P>Will dairy farmers be asked to pay a levy on a gallon of milk to fund An Bord Bia?  The board will not receive any extra Exchequer moneys; it will be funded by way of levies, grants-in-aid, European funding and charges for its services.  If the board is to be responsible for the promotion and market development of the dairy industry will dairy farmers have to pay a levy?  Will the Minister answer that question?  Will there be a levy on a gallon of milk or some other product to fund An Bord Bia?  The National Dairy <Col N="1282" /> Council set up recently to promote the consumption of dairy products at home is doing an excellent job.  Will responsibility for it rest with An Bord Bia?  Is this an integrated approach to food marketing? As much responsibility lies outside the board it is difficult to see the point of creating the structure proposed in the Bill.  The Bill recommends an integrated State aided agency, but there is some confusion about the areas which rest inside and outside the board.</P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with the funding except to say that the Minister bought peace with the IFA and CBF by giving assurances that the subsidiary livestock committee will take over, lock stock and barrel, the functions of CBF. We are given to understand that the levies CBF receive will accrue to the subsidiary livestock committee to spend on the functions which are the responsibility of CBF at present.  The Minister knows that is not the case and that the Bill cannot be interpreted in that manner. The subsidiary committee will have the role of collecting the levy, but unless the board decides to allow the committee to spend it, the committee may not be able to do so.  We do not know if the board will make that decision, that is not provided for in the Bill.  CBF has been turned into a collection agency, given a different title and the Minister has bought peace with it in order to have this legislation passed.  I am not fooled by this and neither are many others.  The ICMSA is extremely concerned about the Minister's intentions in respect of the livestock subsidiary committee and it has every right to be.</P>
    <P>What independence will the committee have?  Will it be able to spend money? There is a minefield of bureaucracy attached to this.  Staff will be transferred from CBF to the board of An Bord Bia and not to the subsidiary committee that will take over the functions of CBF.  What staff will be available to the subsidiary committee?  Will it be pruned and streamlined to the extent that it will not be able to carry out its functions even if functions are transferred to it from the board? Many people could be buying a pig in a <Col N="1283" /> poke with assurances that appear to have been given behind closed doors.  If those assurances were not given I fail to understand how reputable groups, such as CBF and the IFA, would buy what this Bill purports to do in relation to the livestock subsidiary committee and the decimation of CBF.</P>
    <P>Many of those remarks could be directed at the other subsidiary committees. The Minister also proposes to set up a consumer foods committee.  This area, which includes the catering sector, is very important.  Experts have pointed out that this is an area of real growth in terms of food production and value added.  There is great potential for growth in the sale of catering products such as biscuits, ready meats, pizzas, breakfast cereals and so on.  We do not know what independence, staffing or funding the proposed committee will have.  To whom will it report?  Will it have a chief executive officer or will it have to report to the chief executive officer of the board?  What autonomy will these committees have?</P>
    <P>Is it right to fragment the industry by having so many committees?  Such a fragmented, bureaucratic structure may not be the right way forward for An Bord Bia.  Why did the Minister not opt for a cradle-to-grave or plough-to-plate approach, such as in the Foods and Drugs Administration in the United States?  The people in the US have such confidence in the FDA that it only has to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and there is no further concern about the issue it investigates.  It has only to ban the marketing of a product and people can be assured it will be banned.</P>
    <P>We need a body that is held in such esteem that it commands the confidence of the demanding consumer.  The FDA has managed to do that and to corner public assurance in the US.  I am disappointed that the opportunity was missed to extend this so-called integrated approach and adopt an overall approach to quality control which would include health and safety, quality assurance, hygiene and many other issues that are crucial in preserving our quality food <Col N="1284" /> image.  Why did the Minister let that opportunity slip?  Could he not get agreement from the Minister for Health?  He has fallen out with the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, because responsibility for this board lies with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  He appears to have fallen foul of the Minister for the Marine because BIM got its way and to have lost the debate on health, safety and hygiene with the Minister for Health.  What are we left with?  It is no wonder I consider this Bill to be so inadequate as to be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>There are many other variables with which we must concern ourselves in terms of the future of food production and increasing value added here.  It is most important that we get this right.  The overall importance of the food industry in safeguarding our rural economy both by maintaining viable farming and providing non-farm jobs in rural areas is crucial in a post-CAP reform era and with the impact of GATT from January.  CAP and GATT have concentrated our minds on the quantitative controls and limitations in production of main farm enterprises, but we must create jobs in rural areas to ensure that non-farm jobs replace those who are leaving the land.</P>
    <P>The status and health management of our herds is also important.  The recent threat of the Germans to ban imports of our beef concentrated our minds on how vulnerable our markets could be if some of our so-called friendly neighbouring countries in the EU decided to look after their domestic producers to massage an electoral lobby, as in the case of Germany. I commend the Government and CBF in that regard.  I am delighted I raised this issue on the Adjournment of the House before the Minister made a public statement on the matter.  I supported the Minister in tackling the German authorities on their threat of restricting our beef exports.  No matter how well we get our homework done and the structure of the industry right we will always be vulnerable to those who want to destroy our increased market share in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> There is an ongoing threat of a major accident at Sellafield, particularly with the commissioning of THORP.  God help us if something should go wrong, although the chances are remote, but we thought that of Chernobyl.  If such an accident occurred our argiculture, agri-food business and efforts in marketing, sales and green image would be gone for decades in one fell swoop.  Are we insured against that?  Have we argued our case adequately with the UK authorities or the authorities in Brussels?  I do not believe we have.  What case will we have against the UK authorities if a questionmark hangs over the quality of Irish food because of a minor or major accident at Sellafield?</P>
    <P>I do not know what protection will be afforded to our major agricultural and agri-food industries?  I have yet to be convinced that the Government realises the seriousness of the issue.  Apart from human health and our environment, our two main industries of agriculture and food and tourism are extremely vulnerable.</P>
    <P>There are implications resulting from the changes in GATT, the US rules on growth promoters in beef and the export of US beef to the European market.  We no longer use growth promoters and rightly so.  The consumer demands a quality premium product.  What are the EU plans and our Minister's plans in this area to meet like with like, to have a level playing field in beef production when US beef producers can use growth promoters and have a greater, more efficient and cheaper production of a quality product? How can we compete with that position as price will often win out?  If they can produce lean beef on the supermarket shelves of Europe more cheaply than we can, how can we justify allowing the US to use growth promoters when our farmers and those in Europe have rightly agreed not to use them?  The same rules should apply.</P>
    <P>Pig production is an area of growth potential and we produce quality pig meat.  The Japanese market offers great opportunities to this industry.  Why should our pig producers continue to <Col N="1286" /> labour under a £6 per pig price differential to that of their mainland European competitors?  Our compound feed is £27 per tonne more expensive than in Europe.  That is a direct result of CAP and the grain regime.  When will the feed equalisation grants scheme the Minister is &ldquo;looking at&rdquo; be in place?  Our industry could develop and capture the European market, but we do not appear to be doing much in this area.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the Minister that we are the only island nation in Europe.  We should reconsider the EU animal and plant health directive in terms of risks to the excellent health status of plants and our herds.  Should our country not be used as an isolation unit for the European Union in the event of a major outbreak of disease?  If we had appropriate rules and perhaps some derogation our island status would ensure a nucleus of clean animal and plant stock.  We should carefully consider how we are bound under the present animal and plant health directive. There is a missed opportunity in this area.  We have a special case to make and the Minister and his Department have failed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Orderly marketing and seasonality are other major problems.  Orderly marketing is required to ensure a regular supply to our meat processors.  The retention periods for the special beef premium and other issues have created scarcities at certain times of the year and promoted gluts at others, with the 100 day retention periods. I believe the Minister has plans to resolve that problem by having several retention periods throughout the year for some Euro schemes.  Clarification is required in this area, particularly in respect of the special beef premium and others.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas involved; I touched on only a few.  I would like the Minister to reply to all our specific questions as it is important that we understand why the Bill is worthy of support and does not represent a major missed opportunity.  The Minister should explain why he did not go down the road recommended by Culliton and the expert group and why so many of the food agencies <Col N="1287" /> are still outside the ambit of the Bill.  It is difficult to understand why this is the case.  Our food processing industry is allocated £30 million from the Government and Europe in investment aid.  It is a major industry with huge potential.  We need to integrate our approach towards State support services and this Bill fails to do that.</P>
    <P>How much money will be included in the Community Support Framework for research in the food industry, one of the great Cinderella areas?  The Government appears not to understand the concept of or need for research to ensure that in five to ten years we will be at the races, as it were, and lead the field in food production and quality control, ranging from producer to processor to marketing and retail outlets.  Research has been neglected. It has been talked about at liaison committees recently.  Does the Government understand the importance of agricultural research at Teagasc level through to the different agencies within the industry and State agencies in the many areas related to food production?  I am not sure it does.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the role of veterinary surgeons.  We have an excellent system of checking animals at meat factories, post mortem and anti-mortem checks. That level of detailed examination is not carried out in other countries.  Such a standard is critical if we wish to maintain our quality image.  It was critical in selling our case to the Germans when the recent BSE scare arose.  Veterinary surgeons have no quality control role in An Bord Bia; it is amazing that they have been excluded.  Regarding safety, quality, hygiene, product assurance, testing and quality control I do not believe An Bord Bia will have a function according to the terms of reference to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Culliton report that we must strive for a leading and unique position in Europe as a producer of high quality and environmentally friendly safe food.  We must &ldquo;establish the highest standards of safety and integrity in the Irish food chain&rdquo;.  The policy review group suggested a unified food safety <Col N="1288" /> inspection service which is not provided for by this Bill.  The Bill falls so short of what is required and what Culliton and the reports of expert groups detailed as necessary that it is merely a window dressing exercise and does not deserve support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit of the Bill but it is presented by the wrong ministry.  Extending the influence of State institutions to bring about development is not a positive step.  I would rather see a Bill to reform taxation or one which would encourage enterprise.  If State institutions are to be changed, radical proposals need to be implemented.  Tinkering will create uncertainty without beneficial effect.</P>
      <P>We, in the Progressive Democrats, support the view expressed by Senator Feargal Quinn in the Moriarty report. He stated:</P>
      <P>So long as food is a function of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, food will remain subordinate to agriculture.  At best our vision of food will be restricted to the agricultural horizon.  At worst, food will be allowed develop only to the extent that is serves the needs of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Bill, if it is necessary, should be presented by the Minister with responsibility for trade and commerce.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be presented to us as a step in the implementation of the Culliton report.  Let us look at the facts.  The Culliton report said in one of its headlines &ldquo;It is time for the Government to take hard political decisions needed for a decisive reform of the taxation system&rdquo;. These decisions have not been taken.  It said we should advance ahead of other countries in environmental protection.  I see no evidence of any will to implement this.  It said in relation to State agencies: &ldquo;the activities of the agencies are now less significant for industrial performance&rdquo; but recommended nevertheless that industrial policy intervention needed to be delivered in a more integrated and cost-effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> The report recommended that a new agency to oversee the development of Irish industry be set up.  It would bring together the services provided by the old IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and Eolas.  This agency has not been set up.  An Bord Tráchtála has been left as it is, but two new bodies, Forfás and Forbairt, have been set up to carry out the functions of the IDA and Eolas &mdash; moving the deck chairs.  There is no evidence that the new structures will be any better than the old, and the radical solution recommended by Culliton has been rejected.  The Government, under pressure from various institutional interest groups, funked the issues.</P>
    <P>It set up 27 &mdash; 30 if one includes the new local authorities in Dublin &mdash; local development councils whose functions cut across those of the IDA and Shannon Development.  It has multiplied significantly the number of board members, board meetings and jobs for the boys, but these changes have meant that those trying to provide public services in industrial development have to watch their backs for inter-institutional squabbles rather than getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>The food industry has always been a special case.  Culliton employed special consultants to look at this area.  It recommended a national plan for food be developed and a review group to prepare such was set up.  They did good work and there is some evidence, in the allocating of Structural Fund money for food research, that elements of this plan are being implemented.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wished to give stimulus to the food industry, he could have taken the blueprint of the original Culliton report and amalgamated the developmental activities of the IDA, the research and development activities in food carried out by Teagasc and the promotional work carried out by Bord Tráchtála, BIM and CBF.  Then he would really have a Bord Bia &mdash; a development arm of his Department &mdash; worthy of the name.  This Bill, which merely proposes amalgamation of the food marketing activities of Bord Tráchtála and CBF and the minuscule foreign activities of An Bord <Col N="1290" /> Glas, is hardly worth the effort.  What evidence is there that there has been in the past significant duplication of work by these bodies?  I understand that there were reasonable working arrangements between them, but in the period before this Bill is passed there will be suspicions, angling for position and so on, none of which is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Most of the Bill is innocuous.  It is difficult to see what is achieved by it that could not be achieved with the existing institutions.  I note that the functions of the board are concerned with marketing of Irish food and livestock, but exports are not mentioned.  It is implied that the board will also be concerned with marketing Irish food in the home market, as were CBF and the former Irish Goods Council.  Why then is it only the export promotion activities of An Bord Glas which are to be included?  Why not their promotional activities on the home market?  There is an inconsistency here.</P>
    <P>In section 15 there are very specific requirements regarding the make-up of the subsidiary board for meat and livestock. Sections 14 and 16 are not as specific. Farmers, meat exporters, butchers and livestock exporters are all to be represented, but would it not be appropriate that a marketing board be market led and have representation of consumer interests?  This is a perfect example of the production led outlook of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which Senator Quinn warned against.  I would recommend consumer representation on the main board and all its subsidiary boards as of right and we will be proposing an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is nonsense.  The functions of the board include market surveys and market intelligence.  Information for food companies is the essential purpose of the board, yet section 26 prevents the disclosure of any information relating to any company without the company's consent. If, for example, Unilever is about to launch a new margarine, this information cannot be given to Irish food companies without Unilever's consent.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 33 <Col N="1291" /> which deals with numbers and pay of staff.  Similar provisions are in force in most other semi-State bodies and the principle is not in question.  In practice, however, the Department of Finance inhibits initiative throughout the public sector.  There are examples where Teagasc has won contracts and been awarded money from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for food research but cannot get permission from the Department of Finance for the necessary staff to carry out the contract.  We support, welcome and encourage initiatives in the semi-State as well as the private sector, but the detailed control on all aspects of staffing exercised by the Department of Finance is a real barrier to initiative.  I fear a similar result with An Bord Bia.  Good marketing men and women are expensive.  Will An Bord Bia be allowed to hire them at the going rate or will it be restricted to paying too little and only getting second best?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The main institutional recommendation of the expert group on the food industry is that a single agency &mdash; An Bord Bia &mdash; should be set up to coordinate the promotion and marketing of Irish food products abroad.  The functions of the board are set out in section 8 of this Bill.  This recommendation immediately generated tension between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Tourism and Trade about which should be responsible for the new board.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry won that battle, but he has yet to win the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Critics of the Government approach, who include Senator Feargal Quinn, the lone dissenting voice on the expert group &mdash; worry that the food board being set up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be hidebound by agriculture and farming interests and will be unable to make Irish food companies more competitive.  I believe that if the board is dominated by the producers view it will have neither the vision nor the <Col N="1292" /> capacity to develop the food industry in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads in the development of our food industry.  The Minister had an opportunity in establishing An Bord Bia to prove Senator Feargal Quinn wrong, to prove that it is possible for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take on this innovative and developmental project as recommended by the expert group.  However, the Bill gives neither the framework nor the conviction that the message has been heard by the Minister or the Department.</P>
    <P>What is needed in this Bill is focus.  A much clearer division and co-ordination of responsibilities is needed, along with the earmarking of appropriate representation on the board itself.  There is a great difference between stating an objective and reaching it.  This Bill is along way off reaching the objective of establishing an effective single food board, which is not just a promotion body but is also leading up market development.  That is still the challenge that faces us and it has not been faced squarely in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The success or otherwise of An Bord Bia is vital to the future development of our food industry.  The Irish food industry had an estimated output of £7.6 billion in 1992, yet our consumer food industry is still underdeveloped.  It requires a major initiative not only in promotion but in policy development, particularly in the context of post CAP reform and the GATT agreement when the old ways no longer stand up to the test of modern demands.  An Bord Bia has two possibilities. It can be a monolithic bureaucratic colossus towering over the food industry, one that is producer rather than market driven, one that carries an outmoded system of dependence on production which aims to dispose of produce instead of producing what the market demands.  Alternatively it can be an agency full of hybrid vigour from which exciting policies can emerge and a modern international food industry can grow, one based on consumers needs, an agency that works back from the consummer <Col N="1293" /> to the producer, not the other way around.  That is the choice.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on the food industry laid down the framework for An Bord Bia It points out clearly the need to create added value and the potential to protect existing jobs.  It warns about the future context in which the Irish food industry will find itself &mdash; increased competition, reduction in intervention and EC food legislative restrictions.  It argues for a fundamental shift to prepared consumer foods and ingredients.  The report states: &ldquo;Over the next five years sound and market-led prepared consumer food projects should have priority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another shift recommended by the report relates to State funding.  Of EU and State funding approved in 1989 to 1991, 85 per cent was spent on fixed assets and the remainder on equity, research and development, management development and training.  The report sets limits, for example, by 1997 fixed assets non-repayable grants should not exceed 60 per cent.  This highlights the urgency of investment in human resources for research and development and market development.  What does the Minister intend to do about this?</P>
    <P>Lack of a marketing ethos backed up by marketing skills still represents one of the great structural weaknesses within the industry. Even many of the major companies do not have dedicated and trained marketeers.  Establishing marketing divisions and installing professional marketing personnel can dramatically change the product profile of food companies, yet we do not have sufficient numbers of them.  A dedicated college of science, technology and marketing would be able to meet this need.  We already have a model in Limerick in the context of the software and hardware industries where there is a link-in to companies and to the industrial base.  Education and training are critical to the success of the food industry.  The major question not asked in the report of the expert group is who takes responsibility to see that the education and training <Col N="1294" /> needs of the food industry are met. At present different bodies are involved, including universities, regional technical colleges, Teagasc and FAS.  It is time to consider the establishment of one authority which would combine the various bodies responsible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the funding of research into the food business, announced recently by the Minister, will any of that money be used for technological research?  In the same way that native-based hardware and software development in the computer industry has taken place, we could surely develop innovation in manufacturing food processing equipment if the framework and the desire were there.  Does the Minister intend to undertake that task?</P>
    <P>There has been much emphasis on developing a green image for Ireland. That may well be over-estimated.  There is a down side to that kind of strategy; one environmental disaster can negate its value, and the image can only be as good as standards and reality dictate.  We have only to look at the recent hysteria in Germany over BSE in Irish beef to see the dangers of a poor image.</P>
    <P>We need to address this question in a dynamic way and it would be appropriate to develop an internationally recognised Irish food quality symbol or statement. Last night the Minister mentioned harps and leprechauns, but we could be much more global in our approach and I presume there is no real restriction within the European Union that we could not overcome in developing this international market.  When we look at other countries it is obvious we have much to learn.  The Irish &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark is not an appropriate model.  What we need to do is bury the concept of buying Irish and move towards the concept of selling Irish. An internationally recognised symbol of quality would be of great benefit; the Irish name is good only if we can get the message across.  Goods carrying it would have a quality assurance with the imprimatur and authority of the Irish State.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the &ldquo;Kerry-gold&rdquo; brand offers opportunities in a similar way.  It is worth noting that this <Col N="1295" /> week the editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> made the point of expanding the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand to apply to selected cuts by specially supervised beef plants. He said:</P>
    <P>We now have a unique chance to re-emphasise the health and nutritional quality of our beef.  We should not let that opportunity slip.  That requires rigorous enforcement of standards as well, of course, as a guaranteed supply of raw material.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishes An Bord Bia and designates its functions.  However, it does not explain how the work of the board will be carried out in a streamlined manner.  Since the idea is to establish a single food promotion body whose functions would comprise those currently exercised by CBF, An Bord Tráchtála and the export, marketing and development functions of An Bord Glas, it is worrying that it is not proposed to coordinate all these functions clearly under one roof.  If there is division of responsibility who, ultimately, will be the master? It is worth noting that CBF is the only body that, in effect, is copperfastened within the structure in a new form.</P>
    <P>It is not clear how An Bord Bia will operate.  For example, will An Bord Bia be able to open its own offices abroad or will it use offices belonging to An Bord Tráchtála?  The familiar difficulties of interdepartmental arrangements have not been resolved in this Bill.  We need a food board and we need it under one roof with a good director and under the right Minister.  Otherwise it could well become one of the worst quangos of the lot.</P>
    <P>The Bill is woolly in regard to powers and responsibilities.  In section 9, which deals with the transfer of functions, it is not clear who will transfer the powers or how levies will be controlled or spent. The IFA has demanded that levies from primary producers should be paid only in proportion to the different sectors they come from.  This raises the question of funding and resourcing of An Bord Bia. If the primary source of funds is the primary producer this gives the producer an <Col N="1296" /> inordinate capability to argue for representation on the board.  Indeed the Minister stated last night that this impied a certain representational pattern.  We must know what he means by a certain representational pattern because that is the key to the success or otherwise of An Bord Bia.  Where does that leave the processor, the retailer and, in particular, the consumer, the key player who has been disregarded in this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is not clear either how other sectors fit into the overall plan.  There is a mention of subsidiary boards but the only board that is covered definitively in the Bill is the meat and livestock subsidiary board.  The Minister considers that a subsidiary board for prepared consumer foods should be set up.  It is an underdeveloped sector with great potential, but it gets no mention in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the marketing section of An Bord Glas will be absorbed into An Bord Bia.  The same is true of An Bord Tráchtála.  It would be of benefit if there were a representative of An Bord Tráchtála on An Bord Bia but there is no such commitment.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board is nonspecific. Appointments to the board are in the gift of the Minister.  There is no indication of how BIM or Teagasc will fit into this new board or that the universities will have a role to play, considering their development of food research and policy analysis.  Most important, there is no indication of the role of retailers and consumers.  None of these key elements is specifically given a role in An Bord Bia and that is one of the most worrying aspects of this proposal. There is no clear concept of the capability and the make-up of An Bord Bia to meet the task it is being set up to tackle.</P>
    <P>We have already seen a dynamic contribution from one of our leading retailers, Senator Feargal Quinn, in his role as a member of the expert body on the food industry.  Surely there is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that that kind of contribution is included within An Bord Bia in a way that clearly demarcates the direction and the focus of the board.  Other than a vague and <Col N="1297" /> ominous phrase about persons who have a knowledge or experience of the food industry, we have no indication about the make-up of the board.</P>
    <P>We have seen the incredible power of producers to define the industry.  I am apprehensive about the way this board will shape up considering the lack of clarity of the Bill.  This applies even more to subsidiary boards.  Other than the way they are to be set up, there is no indication of their role and no specific function outlined for them.  There are terms of reference outlined for An Bord Bia itself but there is no such definition of the functions of subsidiary boards.  The Minister has a responsibility to tell this House his terms of reference for any subsidiary boards and his objectives in relation to them.</P>
    <P>It is not clear either from this document what the relationship between An Bord Bia and the IDA will be.  The IDA is a source of large investment which has been directed at food processing.  The necessity for links between the IDA and An Bord Bia is irrefutable, but no link is mentioned.  This is essentially a food promotion body and it must link in to the existing industrial development bodies.</P>
    <P>The source of funding is not particularly clearly defined.  Again in appears to be in the gift of the Minister whether he will turn the tap on or off.  Essentially this board will be producer-subscribed in the provision of levies which may well be expanded to cover areas other than those currently covered by levies.  If there is to be a partnership arrangement among producers, processors, retailers, consumers and the Government, it should be reflected in some way other than a simple grant system, which the Minister can adjust at will, or the levies that apply already.</P>
    <P>This Bill is disappointing; I hoped it would mark a new initiative on the food industry in the Department but it does not even cover the comprehensive nature of the industry.  It concentrates on the meat and livestock sector yet provides no particular framework for the dairy industry or the brewing industry which constitute such a major slice of our food <Col N="1298" /> production.  Nor is there any sign of development, for example, of the horticultural side of the food industry.</P>
    <P>The staffing measures involve primarily the transfer of existing staff to new arrangements but the overall control and management is not clear from the Bill. This raises considerable apprehension as to the usefulness of An Bord Bia. Although the board has the opportunity to become a dynamic force in the development of our food industry and, most importantly, in the development of thousands of jobs, the report of the expert group argued for a rate of job creation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 new jobs per year under its proposed programme.  This programme is outlined in the expert group report.  It requires major funding over a five year period. The gross overall cost would be £1,227 million.  The programme is a framework within An Bord Bia is simply one element.  It would also provide for an investment fund for branded products, easy financing for dairy product development and a change in the mix of products in our output but, primarily, it argues for a consumer led approach which is fundamentally different from the approach that has been traditionally maintained by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The weakness inherent in An Bord Bia was outlined in a clear and vivid way by Senator Feargal Quinn in his minority report.  In that report he stated:</P>
    <P>The present structure reflects the outdated view that the purpose of Ireland's food industry is to dispose of agricultural output.  In today's conditions, particularly the extent of unemployment, that is the wrong approach.  The purpose of the food industry should be to create wealth and jobs by serving the needs of consumers. That it disposes of agricultural output should be seen as a bonus, not the steering force that determines how the industry develops.</P>
    <P>I see no mention of the consumer in the Bill, yet the consumer is central to the issue, the key player.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The NESC report, No. 96, A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment, stated that &ldquo;while the scale of Ireland's agricultural exports in such commodities will continue to be a significant share of exports for the foreseeable future, it is only by pursuing a clear strategy of moving up the value chain that the contribution of the agri-food sector to the national economcy can be maximised and additional employment generated&rdquo;.  That is the challenge and that is why the Bill is such a disappointment.</P>
    <P>The main obstacle to this kind of development is the fact that the Irish food industry remains primarily producer rather than consumer driven.  Irish agriculture remains more dependent on the intervention mechanism than any other member state of the EU.  Irish agriculture will have to come to terms with major changes in the marketplace.  In order for that change to take place we need a food board, An Bord Bia, that is dynamic, well structured and well representative of the key players with a solid financial base and with a clear direction and understanding of where it is going.  This Bill does not provide for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make some observations on the Bill before us.  I join with other speakers who have generally welcomed this legislation which arises from the report of the expert group on the food industry who reported in 1993 to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up a single body which will be responsible for the export promotion of food.  Such a body has been foreshadowed by the policy review group of the Department, which reported in 1990, and by the more recent publication, the Culliton report. The Bill is most timely.  It could be argued, indeed, that a single food export promotion body should have been set up before now.  Regardless of the developments in the agricultural policy of the EU in the past year or two, it makes the needs for a single body very clear.  The dramatic <Col N="1300" /> changes which have taken place in the CAP, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the demands of the Single Market place additional pressures on our food industry.  As an industry we are in the business of increasing the value of our output and our sales.</P>
    <P>The 1993 export group report shows that while the industry has made progress, much work remains to be done. For example, we need more vacuum packed exports in the beef sector; we need to increase cheese output; much development is needed in the prepared consumer food sector; there is need for education and training for the industry as a whole and individual firms must become more involved in the whole area of research and development.</P>
    <P>The export group estimated that over the next five years their recommendations will cost approximately £720 million.  That money is to come from the food industry, the EU and Exchequer sources.  The programme for the industry, as recommended by the group, will result in an estimated additional 1,500 to 2,000 jobs per year when the programme is fully operational.  The single food promotion body, as provided for in the Bill, is a necessary part of this programme. Because of our small population, we are very much dependent on the export market, hence the need for a co-ordinated effort to bring home to both the consumers and the distributors, who are putting the products into the export market, that Ireland is a supplier of high quality foods produced in a very favourable environment.</P>
    <P>I wish to add my support to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage.  I congratulate him on bringing in this legislation and I hope it will have a successful and speedy passage through the Houses. I wish to ask a few questions about some of the provisions in the Bill.  What will be the working arrangement between An Bord Bainne and An Bord Bia?  It is important that a satisfactory working arrangement is put in place in that area.</P>
    <P>In section 2 (1) inedible horticultural produce is, by definition, excluded from the work of An Bord Bia.  As we all know, <Col N="1301" /> an important sector of the horticultural industry is the nursery stock sector, that is, the growing of ornamental shrubs and trees.  Bord Glas, in co-operation with An Bord Tráchtála, is very much involved in the export promotional work in the nursery stock sector.  Having regard to what has been happening in the horticultural industry, whether one is talking about the field vegetables, the mushrooms or, indeed, the nursery stock, under the new provision the export aspect of that work will be taken over by An Bord Bia.  It is important to consider the position of the nursery stock sector when the new arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>The definition in section 2 (1), defines food as including drink, which is a contravention of the normal usage of the word.  I strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the inclusion of the products from the nursery industry in the general responsibility of An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Food is defined in the Bill as edible products and agricultural products.  Are they to be excluded?  What will be the position regarding flax production, tillage products normally fed to animals, wool and hides?  There is not a huge export dimension to these products but there could be and will the new board have responsibility for them?</P>
    <P>As regards the fishing industry will the board assume responsibility for the export promotion of fish products which was the responsibility of BIM?  If we are to have a co-ordinated approach to the promotion of the food industry it is important that the range of products within the industry be promoted under the same umbrella.</P>
    <P>I take it the normal period of appointment of board members will apply.  The principle of giving organisations within the industry the right to nominate members to the board can be a dangerous one.  The difficulty is that people with the necessary qualifications may not be nominated to the board.  Nominations may have much to do with the internal politics of the organisation concerned.  In many instances people may be nominated <Col N="1302" /> who are manifestly unsuited to the onerous responsibility of progressing the industry.  The food industry is very important and it is essential that those appointed have an interest in it and make a tangible input to the work of the board. Under the legislation the Minister will retain responsibility for nomination of the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope the new board will fulfil its role.  We look forward to greater prosperity for the food industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is disappointing. It derives from one of the recommendations made by the expert group on the food sector last year.  As a means of giving that recommendation concrete form the Bill has a number of defects not least of which is, like other Bills presented by the Government, this one which is excessively bureaucratic.  The Government has a fatal tendency to find the most bureaucratic way possible to operate.</P>
      <P>It was amused and gratified to hear that criticism shared by Deputy McManus of Democratic Left.  If we go on for long enough Democratic Left will become a market base party.  A few weeks ago I heard the Deputy talk about the importance of being market oriented.  I congratulate her on arriving at the point where Democratic Left object to bureaucracy.  The party will get sense one of these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill illustrates that Fianna Fáil, to its eternal shame and confusion in the future, has given in to the apparatchiks in the Labour Party who always seek out the most bureaucratic way possible of doing what they set out to do.  That was clear from the Minister's speech.  I have rarely heard an introductory speech say so little about the inspiration behind the measure taken.  It is appalling that there was no suggestion of any notion of enterprise or development.  The Minister blandly told us the Culliton report had made certain recommendations as had the expert group.  Then he gave us an expanded version of the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the <Col N="1303" /> Bill.  He did not give any of the reasons for what is in the Bill.  I suspect it is because there is no good reason.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle commented on the Bill earlier.  This is like a dustbin Bill.  Had the Minister waited for longer he may have found a few more things to throw into it.  There is no plan to the Bill.  It is a random collection of what exists.  This dustbin Bill will not change the world as far as the promotion and marketing of agricultural products and food is concerned. We could put up with bureaucracy which would change the name and location of a quango.  If the Bill did nothing but change the style of the organisation it would not be so bad.  However, it is important to bear in mind that the recommendation of the expert group, on which this Bill is founded, was made as part of a strategy.  There is other material in that report but the Bill bears little relation to much of it.  There is no indication that the Government is pursuing that strategy.</P>
    <P>I praised the report when it was published and while it has some defects, it is a good, well articulated one.  Those who produced it have every right to feel disappointed and let down by the way the Bill has been brought forward.</P>
    <P>The group highlighted the absolute necessity of reducing seasonal imbalances in milk and beef production if we are to maximise added value from food production.  It recommended that we should aim to reduce the percentage of milk used for butter from its present level of 60-65 per cent to 50-55 per cent over three years.  It also recommended that we should reduce our share of European Union butter production from 8 per cent to 6 per cent and try to increase our share of semi-hard cheese production from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.  There is nothing in this Bill or anywhere else to indicate that the Government has taken any action either at European Union or national level to bring about those changes. If we do not do so then it does not matter a tráithnín what we call the board, how it is appointed or the amount of funding it will get; it will not make much <Col N="1304" /> difference to the value added by our dairy sector to the economy.</P>
    <P>The group recommended we should aim to ensure that 20 per cent of our slaughterings would take place in each of the first three quarters of the year.  Very little progress, if any, has been made in that direction since the report was published. The excessively rigid retention periods which are still insisted on under the beef premium schemes are a very decided obstacle to achieving that kind of pattern in our beef output.  As has been repeatedly pointed out to the Minister, those excessive retention periods are a very real obstacle to the orderly marketing of beef and, therefore, a very real obstacle to expanding and increasing added value in food production.  Needless to say, the beef industry is still trying to come to terms with the fallout from the humiliating defeat of the Minister on the carcase weight issue, a defeat we could all see staring him in the face long before he even recognised that a problem existed.  This is another factor which will militate against the kind of strategy set out by the expert group and which makes this Bill irrelevant in terms of any strategy to develop our food industry.</P>
    <P>The expert group proposed that the development agencies should consider supporting final processing and marketing activities abroad.  There is no evidence that anything of that kind has been undertaken or contemplated by our development agencies.  We all know that it is only now our development agencies are finding their feet after the enormous and useless bureaucratic shake-up the Government imposed on them.  I want to remind the House that we now have the IDA, Forbairt, Forfás a mass of committees spawned in the bowels of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the country enterprise boards, etc. They will not be able to do anything concrete in terms of achieving the kind of objectives set out by the expert group. The evidence is that so far nothing has been done which even goes in the direction of that particular recommendation made by the group.</P>
    <P>The expert group recommended the <Col N="1305" /> creation of a substantial branded product development fund from extra European Union Structural Funds.  That recommendation was grand at the time &mdash; the report was published in April last year &mdash; but nothing like this has happened to date.  On the contrary, we now know that the amount of Structural Funds we will receive will be considerably less than the amount the Government dishonestly claimed we would receive even at the time the expert group report was published. We also know that the amounts allocated to the various programmes set out in the spurious National Development Plan are in danger of being cut.  We all know perfectly well that so far Fianna Fáil, Labour, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Quinn, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for the Environment and the Taoiseach have all refused to give even the slightest idea of which parts of the spurious National Development Plan will be cut by 8 per cent, 12 per cent of whatever percentage is forced on the Government as a result of its stupidity in the handling of the Structural Funds episode.</P>
    <P>The climate has changed utterly since the day the expert group proposed that we should have a substantial product development fund from extra EU Structural Fund resources.  We now know that there are no extra EU Structural Fund resources and, as far as I can see, no consideration whatsoever has been given to the creation of a branded product development fund.  Another important piece of the strategy set out by the expert group on food production has been totally ignored.  This is another reason the Bill should be completely scrapped.</P>
    <P>Neither the operational programme for the food industry nor any other operational programme has been published. There is no way we can know the kind of development funding the Government has in mind for the food industry or any other sector of the economy.  We have no idea what the development climate will be for this new body which the Government intends to cobble together from the <Col N="1306" /> various bodies now in existence.  We do not know the kind of framework under which this body will work.  How in God's name can the Minister expect this House to give him its views on this body or how can he have any informed view on the kind of role this body should have?</P>
    <P>The food industry is not the only sector in which there is uncertainly in the context of this infamous and spurious National Development Plan.  The expert group had a number of wise things to say about the necessity for port development. The Minister should look again at the report as he has a constituency interest in this matter.  We do not know what will happen in this regard; we do not know what the operational programme in the relevant sector will be.  We do not know the level of funding and, therefore, we do not know the kind of funding which will be available for port facilities.  The food industry will not know the kind of improvements it can expect in terms of the facilities at its disposal to expand exports.</P>
    <P>Given the uncertainty about the National Development Plan and the Government's absolute failure to make any significant progress with the other parts of the strategy on which the whole idea of putting this new body in place was built, it is nonsense for the Minister to introduce the Bill at this time.  The Minister referred to the Culliton report.  I invite him in all seriousness to look again at that report and the Moriarty report, the report to Government on the report about the report.  There is a yawning chasm between what the Government has been doing for the past year and the recommendations in those reports.  It is absolute nonsense for the Minister to come forward with a Bill which pretends to be part of a strategy for the food industry. He is wasting the time of the House in bringing this Bill before it.</P>
    <P>I was tempted, as I sometimes am, to find out whether the Government has a quorum in the House today, but I will not do so for the moment.  I was surprised at how little some people have to say about this Bill.  I thought Deputy Kirk would have more to say about it. <Col N="1307" /> However, he too seems to have given in to the apparatchiks of the Labour Party and accepted bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I was astonished at Deputy Clohessy's short contribution.  The last time the Progressive Democrats were in Opposition they would have been &ldquo;panoramic&rdquo;, to use a slang word, about a Bill like this.  I thought they would have examined its provisions about the appointment of members of the board and requested a High Court judge to supervise the Minister in making such appointments. However, they appear to have lost their interest in agriculture and people will remember that on 9 June when they realise how little interest Progressive Democrats candidates have in the food industry or in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more in the Bill that fails to match up to the Report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry published in April 1993, which refers to food safety, quality and nutrition.  Recommendation No. 27 talks about minimum safety and hygiene standards for food.  What is the Minister doing about that?  Is anything planned in that regard that would help this new body to promote and market Irish food abroad?  As far as I know the Minister has not brought anything forward.</P>
    <P>For example, in recommendation No. 31 of the report, the Expert Group makes wise remarks about topics that should be included in the existing syllabus in the second level curriculum in our schools.  It is proposed that the Minister should have a nomination to the proposed Council for Vocational and Educational Awards, that FÁS should establish a 16-week foundation course for food and that the Dublin Institute of Technology should provide pre-entry training for meat factory operatives.  Is any of that being done?  Is it even contemplated? Will this new board have any say in that, or is this just another pious platitude?</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 33 of the report of the Expert Group is an interesting one, part of which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> £15 million per annum in additional EC funds for food non-commissioned R &amp; D should be included in the new EC Structural Funds Frame work...</P>
    <P>That is a far cry from the initiatives the Minister announced last week about research and development when, if my memory serves me correctly, he spoke of £7 million.  What is the Minister doing about that?  He is not going even half way to meet it and appears to have a different type of research and development programme in mind.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is based on one recommendation of the report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry, nothing is being done about other key recommendations.  The measures envisaged in the Bill can have little, if any, effect on securing the objectives &mdash; with which I agree &mdash; set out in that Expert Group report.  Therefore, it is a nonsense taking the step the Minister wants the House to take now because we will be taking it in a vacuum.  We might as well not bother going to all the trouble of passing this Bill because it will not have any effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be surprised if I congratulate him on a provision in section 3 regarding the way orders are made&mdash;my old hobby horse.  To my gratification I find, by and large, that for most of the orders it is proposed to make under this Bill the Government and the Minister have decided to do so on the basis that there needs to be an affirmative decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, I am still not happy because there are several instances in this Bill of orders being required to be made about important matters where that procedure will not be followed.  I approve of a great many of the provisions in relation to making orders but there are some cases where orders or regulations can be made without the Houses of the Oireachtas having affirmative power over them.  I do not want the Minister to say that this passive procedure, as I call it, is hallowed by tradition because the last time the Opposition wanted the opportunity of debating a proposal for an order &mdash; which <Col N="1309" /> would pass if the House did not annul it within 21 sitting days of its having been laid before the House &mdash; the Government simply refused to give time to debate it. It is not something one can do in Private Members' time but this bureaucratic, excessively socialist Government, which is supposed to be in favour of open government, on the one occasion on which it was asked to allow this House to debate an order, undemocratically &mdash; indeed contemptuously &mdash; refused to give time.  If this Government behaves like that I will be suspicious of the way it goes about making orders and will always question provisions in Bills about important matters that will have the effect of allowing them to go through on the nod.</P>
    <P>In section 10 it is proposed that the Minister may, by order, assign to the board such additional functions as he considers incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to it by this Act.  That is another dustbin provision, allowing the Minister to have second, third or fourth thoughts, to come back in a year's time and decide that something he left out of the Bill can be inserted. That kind of power should never be inserted in a Bill like this.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), the Board may make such charges it considers appropriate in consideration of the performance by it of its functions, the provision by it of services and the carrying on by it of activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped these charges would not be excessive but there are no provisions in the Bill to have them controlled or inspected by anybody.  The Bill provides the proposed new board with powers to enforce these charges.  I am not talking about levies, I am talking about fees the board is empowered to charge for its services, if indeed it can find unfortunates in a position to want to avail of its services, particularly if it is operating within the kind of policy vacuum about which I spoke earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, since you are so generous as not to blame me for that, I shall now conclude.  Perhaps the Minister will answer this question.  We recently had a Second Stage debate here on the Irish Horseracing Authority Bill, 1994, which provided for various means of establishing boards and nominating people.  I have a couple of questions about that.  In relation to that Authority the Minister wants to be able to appoint people whom he will select but, in every case where he asks an organisation to make suggestions for the Horseracing Authority Board, he asks them to nominate three people for every vacant position, one of whom must be a woman.  The Minister will have the option of deciding which of those three people to appoint. No such provision is incorporated in this Bill.  Why?  If the Government is serious about doing this kind of thing why is this provision not incorporated in every Bill? In the Irish Horseracing Authority Bill, 1994, the Minister has the arbitrary power, or seeks to obtain it, to fire the chairman or any member of the board without giving cause.  As far as I can see, the same provision is contained in this Bill.  Why?  If the Minister has any kind of confidence in the choices he or she makes why is it necessary to have arbitrary power to fire people?</P>
      <P>Because it is not supported by any of the other strategy required to make a real effort to develop value-added in the Irish food industry, the Minister should have the sense and decency to withdraw this Bill because nothing by way of support is provided for the structures he sets out to establish under its provisions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the afternoon I attended a <Col N="1311" /> meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to which I am due to return to help draft a resolution.  It was unfortunate that while I was chatting informally with Deputy Crawford, I missed Deputy Dukes's <i>obiter dicta</i> on the Progressive Democrats and, consequently I am not in a position to respond.  I am sure the Deputy was firing on all two cylinders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the reference to the High Court which reminded me of the <i>obiter dicta.</i> I agree with the tone of Deputy Dukes's remarks regarding the policy and structural context in which this Bill was introduced.  In some respects it is like a free floating balloon which is not organically tied in with An Bord Bia to some of the requirements to develop the Irish food industry.  To argue that it is in line with the Culliton strategy is a claim to which the provisions of the Bill are not entitled.  The Culliton strategy, so far as one can judge, is in the sphere of the bible, much quoted and, in Catholic countries, seldom read.  The Culliton strategy which is reflected in many ministerial speeches and interventions in the House and elsewhere in a number of key respects, has been laid to rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall from the debate on the Finance Bill, which is before this House and on which we will resume debate tomorrow, that on the tax front Culliton had recommended, in respect of assisting employment in Ireland, that we should move to a position where not more than 20 per cent of taxpayers would pay in excess of the standard rate.  While that cannot be achieved overnight the modest steps taken in that direction by the Government indicate that it too has been buried by this administration the life of which is shortening if one can take the recent midterm review by the Labour Party Conference as a measure of the Government's life span.  It means it is even less confident about its survival than some of <Col N="1312" /> the presumptions from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is clear, because of the Government's overwhelming majority, that whatever amendments are accepted An Bord Bia will be established.  As soon as this board is created there will be a debate on the location of its headquarters.  If this is an agency for the food industry it should not be located in the capital city. I am aware that in respect of this matter delegations from the Cork Chamber of Commerce met the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy J. Walsh, and, possibly, the Minister of State, urging the case for my constituency. There are significant players in the food industry in that region, particularly in the dairying sector and their preeminence in terms of product development and food marketing there indicates that the Cork region has a claim for the siting of such a board in the area.  It is important that in any region outside the capital city which seeks to site the agency there be a critical mass on other fronts also.</P>
    <P>In regard to the food, dairy, science and technology sectors University College, Cork has all the research back-up needed on product and food development and on processing and manufacturing. The Teagasc centre Moorepark has not only established a high reputation domestically but is foremost in the European Union.  I made those observations in the context of the Culliton report notwithstanding my constituency plea to the Minister.  The Culliton report, in respect of industry in general and not least in respect of such a large scale indigenous industry as food, referred to the concept of developing clusters and suggested that projects which floated alone did not make sense. The concept was that a cluster which had a critical mass of industry, expertise, academic and support infrastructure should be part and parcel of the development of industrial policy.  Taking the Culliton report and examining the cluster concept which underpins much of its industrial development philosophy, Cork has a pre-eminent claim and I look forward <Col N="1313" /> to the Minister's immediate conversion to that cause.  I hope that the board, when established will be located in the southern capital or in that region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, in the debate on the establishment of An Bord Bia to be able to say that I welcomed that board.  My worst fears have been realised by the Minister's statement and in the text of the Bill.  I was surprised at being called so early in this debate.  I had thought that because of the importance of food production and the meat and livestock industry that there would have been a big demand by Deputies to speak on this Bill.  I do not have a prepared script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was an active member of the board of CBF, which represents the livestock industry, for seven years. What has happened since? The budget suggested by the Minister for An Board Bia is £14 million for the entire food industry.  A sum of £11 million has been allocated to CBF which means that only £3 million has been earmarked for the change over from CBF to An Bord Bia.  If this is passed the Irish livestock and meat industries will lose their identity.  It will be swamped in the bureaucracy.  We are reverting to the situation that existed prior to 1979 when the then Minister nominated every member of the board of CBF.  It means that those who pay the piper will no longer be able to call the tune.  I know the Minister will tell me that they will sit on numerous committees and in fact will have their own board, but the reality is that decisions on how the administration will be run will be made by a politically appointed board.  I note that the Minister for Tourism and Trade will nominate one member for appointment and the 11 other ordinary members of the board will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I hope that member will be representative of the sector that pays £4.5 million in levies and that we will ensure that other members representing the farming organisations will be appointed to the board so that those who pay the levy are represented. <Col N="1314" /> CBF receives levies of £4.5 million from farmers, £1.203 million from industry and £1.5 million from Government, £1.5 million from the European Union Special Fund, £0.3 million in projects and £1.9 million from the Structural Funds, making a total of £10.9 million.  It is not fair that the people who subscribe that money should not have a say on the board of this organisation.  Will the Minister reconsider his position?</P>
    <P>I was first nominated in 1979 by the IFA to serve on the board of CBF.  We were asked to subscribe levies to which we agreed but on the understanding that the moneys raised by levies would be added to CBF's budget.  However, the then Minister, Mr. MacSharry, halved the CBF budget.  It was not until Deputy Dukes became Minister for Agriculture that CBF received a serious allocation, the sum of £772,000.  By 1986, the then Minister, Deputy Deasy, raised it to £1 million and at that time the Government did not have control over the board.</P>
    <P>CBF was then asked to take over the promotion of pig meat.  Then, in the height of great difficulties, its budget was slashed once again to somewhere in the region of £500,000.  It was only when the meat processors committed themselves to paying in the region of £1.2 million towards projects that the present Government increased the budget to £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the food industry we must finance An Bord Bia properly, not in the stop-go way that CBF was financed.  The former Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, without much opposition from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, reformed the CAP and introduced GATT reforms and this will mean we will have to sell more of our product on the European market.  We will need greater expertise and greater promotional efforts to achieve this.  In recent times we have seen the effects of a food scare in Germany. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has encouraged CBF to spend more money in trying to regain our lost market share.  I remember going to Germany in 1980 to promote Irish beef from <Col N="1315" /> the green grass of Ireland.  We were very successful but in the meantime people felt they could supply a lesser quality product and we did not maintain the ground we won initially.  Bord Bainne has successfully marketed the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand and has maintained its market share.  CBF has continued in spite of all the difficulties and I understand its market share has increased significantly in recent times.</P>
    <P>If we want to retain the trust of those who pay the levies we must take a new look at the composition of this board.  We must do so today.  Yesterday the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I intend to set up the board shortly on an interim basis pending the final passage of the Bill.  That will enable a good deal of preliminary work to be done in advance of final establishment and will help to achieve my aim of getting An Bord Bia down to work as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Will the board be set up in the next week or so to guarantee places to people who work hard on the election?  Is there need for such a rush?  I do not think there is.</P>
    <P>I was appointed to the board when CBF was set up and I feel I played a role in ensuring that the board took account of the needs of producers and processors. The board had a coherent approach and people worked together.  I believe it has worked even better in recent times since industry made a commitment to provide some funds.  As the Minister said, CBF is being wound up.  People are being appointed &mdash; we may call them political hacks &mdash; to run this new board while the other groups will be represented on smaller committees.  This is wrong and the Minister must reconsider.</P>
    <P>Some sections of the media do not believe that the agriculture and food industry has a major role to play.  It does and will for many years to come.  It is extremely important therefore that we get this matter right and the board is established properly.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the board would cover a much wider area.  It will cover the work <Col N="1316" /> done by CBF and some of the work done by the national marketing board and An Bord Glas.  The pig industry which has come through a difficult period must be strengthened and encouraged, with the mushroom industry which is a major export earner in my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  As it has not been affected by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy we must ensure that it is properly promoted.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be close co-operation between all the other sectors of the food industry.  I remember attending food fairs where there was a degree of disunity and products were promoted under two or three different banners.  We must ensure that our products are promoted under the one flag in cities such as Berlin and the united front is presented.  I do not know as much about An Bord Glas and the others involved in the food industry but we must encourage the industry to provide a better product, including branded products.</P>
    <P>There is a need for trust.  Without it, this new board will start from a bad position. I ask the Minister to reconsider the way the board will be established and funded in the future and members appointed.  We have not received the funding that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste claimed we would from Europe. The Government will ensure that the flagship industries will be financed.  This may mean that less money will be available for this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister must reconsider the structure of the new An Bord Bia.  We should ensure that as many jobs as possible are created in food processing.  To do this we need a board which will market our products properly and which will have the trust of farmers and the industry as a whole, not just the meat and mushroom sectors.  The industry needs to move forward with unity of purpose to ensure that it gets the best price for its products, that as many people as possible retain their jobs and that as many farmers as possible remain on the land.  The reason the price of cattle, milk and lamb is so good &mdash; the Minister is claiming <Col N="1317" /> some of the credit for this &mdash; is that our currency was devalued by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was looking forward to the establishment of An Bord Bia but I am very disappointed with what has been proposed. The Minister must reconsider the questions of representation on the board and funding.  The personnel who have worked in CBF and other sectors have the necessary expertise to move us forward into the next century with pride.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which has an important contribution to make to the development of the food industry, which has enormous potential.  A long list of people have made this point during the years, some of whom took to writing reports which now fill the libraries of universities and Government Departments. However they flattered to deceive and did not make any contribution in allowing the industry to fulfil its enormous potential.</P>
      <P>In the early seventies Professor Séamus Sheehy and Doctor John O'Connell from UCD suggested that the industry had enormous capacity to create jobs if a series of conditions was met. Other reports were produced by Mr. Bob O'Connor and a Mr. McStay for the ESRI, who were more cautious, and by Coopers &amp; Lybrand.  A full section was devoted to the industry in the Culliton report.  No aspect of Irish life has been reported on as extensively as the food industry, yet it has not fulfilled its enormous potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I have been encouraged by developments during the past ten to 15 years in some sectors of the industry, particularly the dairy sector where enormous progress has been made in seeking new markets and developing new products.  In the meat industry the story is not as encouraging; by any standard, it is exceptionally disappointing. Irish meat products have little, if any, real impact on European markets.  It is difficult to find branded Irish meat in any major European supermarket.  I am not aware of any serious penetration of international markets by Irish meat.  That problem needs to be addressed.  Over the <Col N="1318" /> years the meat industry has been typified by an attitude of opportunism, profits in the short-term with little consideration or concern for the long-term capacity of the industry.  I hope that will change in the future, although I am disappointed with much of what I have seen recently.  It is disappointing that the export of live cattle is rapidly increasing.  I am aware of the pressures on the farming community and the tremendous anxiety farmers are experiencing in terms of urgently maximising the price of their produce.  In some cases such maximisation has been achieved with little concern for the long term impact.  It is regrettable that there has not been greater concern for the long term effects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford talked about the &ldquo;best price&rdquo;.  That is fair enough, but the best price now is not always the wisest. In marketing food we are talking in the long-term.  If we are to develop products it is essential that there is an element of consistency and that consumers can be certain that high quality Irish beef is available on the shelves of European supermarkets when required.  As far as meat products are concerned we are simply producers of commodities.  We are slaughtering animals, cutting them up, boxing the meat and effectively selling it at a wholesale level.  While those circumstances prevail we will not have a hold on consumers or establish consumer loyalty and we will be at the mercy of the huge conglomerates who can shop around and buy in bulk.  We will be at the mercy of the Dunnes Stores equivalent in Europe who are able to exert enormous influence and power in markets.  The dairy industry and Dunnes Stores are well matched in the knockabouts they have had in terms of price.  I am disappointed at the progress in terms of marketing Irish meat on the European market.</P>
    <P>The progress which has been made in the dairy industry can, to a large extent, be traced to the faculty of dairy science in University College, Cork which, by any standards, has made a remarkable contribution to our dairy industry. People in that faculty have set their minds to building solid foundations and to <Col N="1319" /> developing technology and expertise in business.  Many of them compare favourably with the best in the world.  In saying that I am not being sentimental in regard to our capacity; those comments would stand any analysis.  The high level of technological capacity in our dairy industry originated in UCC.  I accept it has been boosted by other agencies such as An Foras Talúntais that have provided research and technical capacity over the years, but most of the captains in the dairy industry started off in the faculty of dairy science in UCC.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed about the extent to which the food industry has failed to consolidate.  I was encouraged recently to note some of the annual reports of the major dairy co-operatives in which the managers referred to the desirability of further consolidation.  At least it appears the subject will be debated in the industry.  It is important that progress is made on that front.  If we are to be realistic and face up to world changes in respect of the food industry, we are talking in terms of two or three changes in respect of the food industry, we are talking in terms of two or three major food conglomerates.  It is important that we move in that direction as rapidly as possible.  I accept it will not be easy and that political considerations are involved.  The chief executive of a major dairy co-operative will not take lightly the idea of stepping aside &mdash; in the words of Charles Haughey &mdash; to allow somebody else become the chief executive of a consolidated and much larger organisation. Without consolidation our food industry will not have the capacity to invest in research and development or product development.  It will not have the capacity to invest in marketing or to penetrate major European markets to establish brands and hold a market share.</P>
    <P>In some cases it may be necessary for those in the industry to form partnerships with international food conglomerates and I hope that can be done from a position of strength rather than weakness. For that reason I am anxious that future consolidation takes place.  The Minister <Col N="1320" /> and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry should do everything possible in that regard.  I accept this is a minefield and I am not suggesting that the Minister should go into this lightly, but the idea is worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>Our food industry is in many respects starting from a position of strength. Research on European markets indicates that our food is perceived as being wholesome, of a high quality and produced in a healthy environment.  Because many consumers are preoccupied with health considerations, our food has the type of image to suit them.  The reality may be somewhat different, but that is the perception of our food.  It is essential we maintain that image.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent crack-down on the abuse of angel dust.  Having regard to its long-term effect, it is regrettable that such abuse should take place.  It would be disastrous if European consumers perceived a problem in regard to Irish food produce.  I welcome the firm action taken in that regard.  I also welcome the action of the Department in respect of BSE which is a major concern for consumers.  It could be said that it is radical to adopt a policy of depopulating entire herds having regard to the small number of cases.  However, that type of radical action is necessary to ensure there is no doubt in regard to our meat products.  Such action may be expensive in the short-term, but wise in the long term because it protects the image of our food products and, more importantly, it protects the consumer from the risks associated with BSE.  The small number of cases is tailing off because of the action by the Department.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of Senator Quinn about consumers not getting the attention they deserve.  Not everybody might agree in that regard, but the interest and concerns of the consumer are paramount. In the final analysis the consumer will call the shots because he or she will decide on what products to spend their money. However, I do not agree with the suggestion that the food section should be moved from the Department.  It is easy to make a superficial case in favour of, <Col N="1321" /> but when one considers the levels of expertise in the area of food, the interaction between food and agriculture, food and the veterinary services and so on in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, one realises the importance of the food section remaining within the Department.  However, it should be more consumer orientated and there is no reason that should not be possible.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the concerns of farmers and the politically lobbying on their behalf during the years is a declining force.  Unless we recognise that, the food industry will not reach its full potential. Deputy Creed is smiling.  I recognise that a significant number of farmers in County Cork, who I am sure will give Deputy Creed their number one vote, and I am sure he will speak on their behalf shortly. I do not see a conflict between the concerns of farmers and consumers.  If farmers do not produce what consumers want they will not buy them.  The food business is international and there has been a significant penetration of our market by overseas foods.  If our consumers cannot buy the food they want from Irish producers they will buy an imported product. It is important that maximum levels of interest be paid to consumer concerns and that the industry addresses them. The new board will have an important role in that regard.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have been concerned about hygiene standards in retail outlets. Everyone who works in the food industry should have a knowledge of food hygiene.  I do not suggest they attend intensive courses, but the basic principles should be understood by those who work in shops which sell food.  It would be a good investment if such people were required to attend a short course, of one to two weeks, on food hygiene.  Further education in this area is needed, because some people working with food, handle it in a way that would not be recommended in textbooks on food hygiene. An initiative should be taken by the board or other agencies responsible in this area.</P>
    <P>The consumer should not be doubtful about products labelled &ldquo;home made&rdquo;. <Col N="1322" /> Are they made at home or do standards apply to them?  I am aware EU directives on such matters will be implemented, but we should set the pace in respect of labelled products, such as health foods, which lead the consumer to buy and to pay more than the market price for them. If the consumer is prepared to do that it is only fair that he or she should be assured that basic standards are met. People who make up those nice names continually change the goal posts and if strict regulations are laid down they will come up with a new buzz word.  It should be possible to ensure consumers receive the product they believe they are buying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to the people who will be appointed to the board of the new organisation, it is essential to have people of the highest calibre. The industry is too important to play politics with.  If the board is to be successful people with the capacity to steer it in the right direction should be appointed.  I have no doubt that will be the Minister's first priority.  The food manufacturing industry is still a major employer with 40,000 to 50,000 people and it has a capacity for a modest increase.  It is a significant employer, particularly in the context of a declining workforce in farming, estimated to decrease to 8 per cent of the workforce by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I am glad that fish is included in the board's terms of reference because the consumer will not distinguish between fish, meat, bread and so on.  The terms of reference of the board should be as wide as possible and encompass all products considered food by the consumer. Every taste is catered for by the lobbying capacity of organisations who speak on behalf of producers but there is very little lobbying on behalf of the consumer.  The board, its chief executive and other members should be conscious of the significance of the consumer.  The noise from the lobbying of the vested interests on behalf of producers should not drown the concerns and welfare of consumers.  If that happened it would have an undesirable effect down the road.  Terms such as &ldquo;market-led&rdquo; and <Col N="1323" />&ldquo;market driven&rdquo; are used.  I do not fully understand those terms and I suspect neither do many who use them, but it is essential that those concerns are carefully researched, properly understood and every effort made to address them.  Those appointed to the board should be aware of the tendency of producer lobby groups to distort or overstate their case or to have an influence which may be undesirable in terms of community welfare.  I do not suggest the Minister should go with that, but people in the industry should have a good understanding, capacity and a balanced approach to this matter and the views of consumers should be represented. I welcome the Bill and I hope it will move rapidly through the House.</P>

      <P>It is not represented in the House.  A single food promotion body has been recommended by various bodies including the groups set up to examine the food industry.  I am pleased the Minister is acting on that recommendation.  In Ireland we have something that many other countries seek, that is the green image, one that was portrayed magnificantly in the Eurovison Song Contest. The green image is associated with Ireland and is an invaluable asset in the promotion of Irish food.  In the future we must build on this image and I hope the board will use it in the promotion of Irish food.</P>
      <P>The food industry has undergone enormous changes in recent years.  There has been a tremendous growth in the industry.  Deputy Upton stated that 40,000 or 50,000 people are employed in the food industry, but, considering the number of subsidiary industries indirectly involved, employment is close to 100,000.  There is great potential for job creation in the food industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that funds will be made available for research and development.  We have been slow to invest in research and development because it is very difficult to see a return.  The most successful businesses throughout the world invest heavily in research and development.  If we are serious about promoting the food industry, it is vital that adequate funds be made available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a tremendous change in the eating habits of the Irish people, particularly the young population.  Ten or 15 years ago people would not have been aware of pizzas. There has been a growth in the number of Chinese restaurants around the country. While bacon and cabbage is still very popular, young people's eating habits have changed enormously.  It is important that the food industry take cognisance of that and meet the changing demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the difficulties created by angel dust.  We have, to a large extent, created many problems by giving bad publicity, particularly to the meat industry.  In other European <Col N="1325" /> countries people appreciate the industry and realise the effects on it of bad publicity. In recent weeks we witnessed a BSE scare.  The reduction in red meat consumption in that period was obvious and will be confirmed by the local butcher.</P>
    <P>There has been great competition in recent times among producers, with people marketing their goods through the use of catchy phrases.  CBF came up with a good line to sell meat: &ldquo;Beef eaters make better lovers&rdquo;.  The Curragh sheep farmer, not to be outdone, came up with an equally good phrase; &ldquo;Linger longer on Leinster lamb&rdquo;, which seems to have been very successful.  If we are to promote the food industry we must be imaginative in our approach and meet the changing demands.</P>
    <P>I recently ate new potatoes, which, unfortunately, were imported from Italy. We must address the question of import substitution.  In the coming weeks and months there will be large-scale imports of new potatoes from Cyprus, Italy and other countries.  In a country where soil is very suitable to the growth of potatoes, it is a shame that we import that product. It is important that every encouragement be given to Irish farmers to produce potatoes to at least meet home demand.</P>
    <P>I listened to a number of speakers, including Deputy Dukes, who was critical of the composition of the new board and the way it will be appointed.  He compared the composition of this board with that of the new racing authority.  I have every confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  He, and the Department, have taken the food industry very seriously and they are to be complimented on that.  It is vital that the Minister appoint people who have a thorough knowledge of the food industry and will do their best to promote it.  All parties must accept blame for appointing people not on what they could offer but on what they did in the past, but that system is changing, and rightly so.  It is vital the right people are appointed to this job as they will play a significant role in the future of the food industry, and I have every confidence that will be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the Bill which has been well received throughout the country, with a few exceptions.  It represents a step in the right direction.  I wish the new board every success.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  There has been a demand in recent years for a board to adequately advertise abroad our food, drinks and fish products and the provisions of this Bill gives us an opportunity to do so in a professional way.  It will be funded with £14 million per annum which is something to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Our food industry has been under great pressure lately because of the made cow disease scare, but our standards were so high that we were able to offset criticisms laid against us by the Germans and others.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the drinks industry is included as Baileys Irish Cream is one of our greatest products.  I would like to see further such development in the drinks industry.  It is nice to see it drunk abroad as well as here and to see that this Bill has taken cognisance of developments in this industry.  Sin an méid a bhfuil agam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the establishment of An Bord Bia.  The establishment of a single marketing agency for the food industry is a positive development. It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that the expert group on the food industry which reported to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last year recommended the establishment of a single food promotion body.  It is regrettable that this Bill does not meet that objective.  Section 2 (1), the interpretation section, defines agricultural products as meat, milk, eggs, cereals and other field crops, edible horticultural produce and fish.  Despite that, Bord Iascaigh Mhara is not included within the remit of An Bord Bia.  That suggests we are embarking on a half-baked idea and that, for political reasons, the concept envisaged by the expert group on the <Col N="1327" /> food industry cannot be delivered because the Minister was unable to surmount the objections which Bord lascaigh Mhara had to their independence being interfered with.</P>
      <P>The food industry is of enormous significance to the economy.  Although there has been a reduction in recent years in the number of people employed in the industry, the value to the economy in terms of exports is significant and we must make every effort to protect it.  Only recently the German authorities proposed, at the stroke of a pen, to exclude Irish beef products from German markets. That matter was satisfactorily resolved but it pointed up how much effort is required to defend the good name of our food industry.  It also highlights the fact that certain nations are prepared to embark on unilateral courses of action to meet internal political exigencies, which is not desirable.  The threat posed by the BSE scare emphasises the importance of being vigilant and alert to attacks on our food industry's market share.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not offer the taxpayer value for money in terms of the co-ordination of effort that is needed.  It does not indicate how An Bord Bainne will be incorporated into the efforts of An Bord Bia and the marketing strategy abroad. We are all familiar with the extraordinary efforts and expense incurred by An Bord Bainne to promote the Irish brand name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;.  As a brand name &ldquo;Kerry-gold&rdquo; is internationally recognised and that was achieved by An Bord Bainne. An Bord Bia will be responsible for the promotion and market development of the whole range of Irish food and drink products.  However, it is not clearly outlined how An Bord Bainne will fit into the new arrangement.  Will there be competing strategies for increasing market share by An Bord Bainne and An Bord Bia?  That is something we could not endorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has had a long gestation period.  The expert group that reported on the food industry had a number of positive things to say and gave clear indications <Col N="1328" /> as to how we should develop and progress those ideas.  The Minister has singularly failed to devise a coherent strategy to fulfil those objectives and give the taxpayer value for money in terms of increased market share.  It appears that what we are to have is a continuation of existing boards in one form or another and at the same time competing marketing strategies abroad by An Bord Bainne and An Bord Bia.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara will not be included, although that is an obstacle I would presume the Minister could surmount at another stage, given that he wants to include fish under the definition of agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlined is not coherent and does not meet the objectives set out by the expert group.  Given that this Bill was awaited with interest and optimism in many quarters, it is regrettable that the Minister has failed to capitalise on the good will that exists on the need for a coherent approach to marketing our products abroad.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry is, without doubt, of enormous importance.  The differences in approach that my colleague, Deputy Upton, alleges exist between the proponents for consumers and for agricultural interests are non-existent.  It is in a farmer's interest that there is consumer confidence in his product.</P>

      <P>The question of professional fees is an emotive issue.  Over several years questions have been raised in this House about the level of fees charged and the manner in which they were charged and various allegations and counter-allegations have been made.  A professional person has the right to charge the going rate whether to the public or private sector, but nobody is entitled to special treatment or to disregard rules and regulations simply because they happen to have contacts in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the Comptroller and Auditor General to become involved to the extent that he has is a clear indication of his concern that constant vigilance is of the utmost importance.  During the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday considerable time was given to a discussion on the manner in which professional fees are agreed, the level of the fees, the method of appointment and so on.  This is obviously a sensitive issue and I will do my utmost not to refer to the specific case in order to comply with Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I will refer to matters that were under consideration in the past which will undoubtedly come up for discussion in the months and years to come.</P>
      <P>The manner in which consultants are appointed is one issue but the necessity for those consultants in some situations is a totally different matter.  We live in the era of consultancy; consultants are engaged for every possible reason.  They are all high fee charging people who are professionally competent and capable but there is a danger of having a multiplicity of people doing the same job. My theory has always been that if the job is being done properly, it should not be necessary to employ somebody to give it a spin or to create a public perception that the job is being done somewhat better than it is.</P>
      <P>Politics being the game it is and with the interlinking at times of business and politics, the two roles become vague and very often merge into one another.  A difficulty then arises because even if the job is not being well done, someone decides that there should be a consultant engaged to advise and another consultant engaged to handle the public perception of the activity that is taking place.  It is at that point that we must question whether the State can get value for money or if the State's money is being aptly spent.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the consultant being employed to do the actual work, to employ a consultant simply to tell everybody else that the work is being well done is an absolute waste of public funds. There is no necessity for that, certainly not in the political arena, for the simple reason that Ministers or Departments have full control over the job they want to do, creating the necessary impetus and adhering to their own time schedules.</P>
      <P>If one examines previous reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the degree to which expert opinion is being needlessly and, in some cases, recklessly paid for by the taxpayer is alarming.</P>

      <P>Most people in this House, as well as the public in general, become quite alarmed when they read about the range of fees paid to consultants, and barristers in particular, for services rendered to the State.  There may well be a case for seeking a change in the system of evaluating fees which has operated for many years but certainly not in the way proposed in the motion.  We are usually led to believe that these fees are dictated by market forces.  As in many other walks of life, we are told that if we want the services of the top professional people, we must be prepared to pay accordingly.</P>
      <P>This debate has been brought about, I am sure, by the scandals of the past years and in no small way by the legal costs that arose from the beef tribunal and the fees paid to consultants during that tribunal.  Before proceeding further I would make the point that figures are not always what they seem to be when the client is the State.  When we read about &ldquo;X&rdquo; millions of pounds paid in legal or consultancy fees, we should remember that, unlike the rest of us, the State has the unique privilege of deducting approximately half of those fees at source.  This little exercise is known as income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell served the Committee of Public Accounts extremely well as its chairman over a period of six years. I am disappointed, however, at the manner in which the committee is currently managing its affairs, particularly where issues such as the tribunal, etc. are concerned.  For example, two of the members of the committee &mdash; and I have raised this matter with our colleagues in <Col N="1332" /> the Public Accounts Committee in the UK &mdash; were material witnesses at the tribunal, which we have discussed, and they have now assumed the mantle of prosecutors.  If Deputy Gay Mitchell were present in the House, I would say to him that those members have a vested interest in the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts and, time and again, they are keeping the issue of the tribunal and other matters on the committee's agenda.</P>

      <P>The motion was tabled as a result of fees paid to consultants some of which were incurred by Members.  I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of any hearing on the matter but it is common knowledge that some Deputies who raised the matter of legal fees and tossed allegations about like confetti were not prepared to substantiate them outside the House.  They have far exceeded their brief when they are responsible in no small measure for a large amount of these fees.

      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce co-operated fully with the consultant and supplied him with material throughout the tribunal.  It supplied files, publications and answers <Col N="1335" /> to questions and sought information from him.  Deputy O'Malley, in his capacity as Minister &mdash; for whom I have the greatest respect and who was on top of his brief &mdash; stated he was unaware consultants were appointed and yet they were in daily contact with his Department and officials. Members of the Committee of Public Accounts do their utmost to find out the facts.  As Deputy Durkan knows, when he asked staff of the former Department of Industry and Commerce to come before us they refused.  I cannot imagine how Deputy O'Malley could be unaware of the appointment of the consultants when they were in daily contact with his Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said he made no application for costs.  Perhaps his counsel should update him because he has applied for costs to be paid out of State funds.

He was one of the forerunners regarding the allegations in relation to consultancy fees.  What does he know about it when all his allegations were discredited?  My information did not cost the State anything but Deputy Rabbitte has applied to have his costs paid by the State and they were in the region of £3,000 per day.  I will not deal with the allegations he made which were discredited. His costs will be about £500,000 and Deputy O'Malley's will be close to £1 million.

      <P>In view of recent events, this motion is very irresponsible.  The Minister said that the Government would oppose the motion mainly because it is an attack on the statutory independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If there is one committee of the House which seems to be working reasonably well it is the Committee of Public Accounts.  Members of this House have a duty to ensure that we get value for taxpayers' money. However, the method proposed by Deputies Mitchell and Yates for ensuring that we get value for money could not be supported by the Government, we cannot put the Comptroller and Auditor General under a microscope to that extent.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General are set out clearly in legislation.  The Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866 provided that &ldquo;there shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.

      <P>This motion must be rejected for the simple reason that it totally ignores the historic role of the Comptroller and Auditor General from the time of Disraeli under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act to the present day.  One of our first great Ministers, Michael Collins, was a specialist in this area.  The legislation introduced last year gave the Comptroller and Auditor General extra auditing powers and, by correlation, made the Committee of Public Accounts more formidable and powerful.  The committee was delighted to be given new terms of reference and Standing Orders some months ago, I hope these can be developed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of control on the expenditure of money under Votes and the auditing of accounts, the motion cannot be sustained. The 1992 legislation introduced value for money audits and new management systems for Government Departments and bodies.  The key point is that the legislation enables the Comptroller and Auditor General, following consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts, to proceed along the lines outlined in the motion.  It is sad that a former long-standing chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts should put down a motion which proposes to cut across the role of the committee, which <Col N="1340" /> has carried out its functions very efficiently on an all-party basis.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee are unhappy that there is still no television coverage of its many interesting investigations. We remain in the age of newspapers, yet the 12 of us, members of the Committee of Public Accounts, put in a lot of work which cannot be seen by our constituents.  As the Minister will know, it is related also to legislation on the compellability of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one avenue we should explore is the extent to which our investigatory powers can be extended.  If one looks at other democracies such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, they appear to be quite prepared to go down a very long road to carry out such investigations themselves, thus avoiding some of the angst and unhappiness we have had to endure recently.</P>
    <P>There is genuine concern about the overall matter of professional fees.  There is still restricted entry to the accountancy profession and, to some extent, also the medical and legal professions.  There is still a type of monopoly within those three so-called labour markets.  At the end of the day, under the great dome of the Four Courts, if there are people who can charge £2,000 a day for their services, perhaps that is a matter for the administration of those professions.  The Minister and her colleagues in both Government parties could devote some time to examining that.</P>
    <P>I emphathically reject the motion before the House.  It does not deal with the real issue and, if anything, attacks the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>The constitutional independence of this office is extremely important.  From day to day and week to week, political controversies will emerge right across the board pertaining to different Departments. It would be a sad day indeed were those controversies to be extended, or offices like that of the Comptroller and Auditor General used deliberately to advance a particular political case.  We should not under any circumstances embroil the Comprtoller and Auditor General in political controversy.  We should always refrain from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year fairly comprehensive legislation was passed by this House, with a considerable degree of consensus from the Opposition benches, in terms of broadening the powers of the office of <Col N="1342" /> Comptroller and Auditor General.  It provided for a specific line of communication between an arm of this House, the Committee of Public Accounts, and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This means the Committee of Public Accounts, has the power to make suggestions to the Comptroller and Auditor General to pursue certain lines of inquiry if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>Within the provisions of that legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General can pursue issues of this kind, and has powers to inquire into any area of public funding to ascertain whether there has been efficiency or value for money.  Given that it was only last year that legislation was passed, the tabling of this motion is totally unnecessary on any logical grounds.  Therefore one can conclude that it was tabled solely to pursue a certain political agenda, perhaps in advance of 9 June, to promote certain individuals.  It is sad and regrettable that, in pursuit of such an agenda, an office as important as that of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be used, perhaps even abused, in this manner.</P>

      <P>I will be supporting the motion in the names of Deputies Gay Mitchell and Yates.  I find it very difficult to understand the construction being put on the motion by the Government side of the House.  Deputy Gay Mitchell has a record as somebody who has been concerned with monitoring public expenditure. He was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for five or six years and earned the respect of parties on all sides of the House for his performance in that office.  I cannot see why the motion attracts the kind of comment I heard on the monitor last evening. Unfortunately, due to other commitments, I was unable to hear this evening's debate but I did hear a quick précis of what Deputy McDaid had to say.  I trust, Sir, you will allow me deal with that in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we appear to have entered into a new fashion &mdash; no matter what the issue, consultants have to be engaged to advise on it.  There was a time when the Government was always one committee or task force away from taking action on whatever may have been the issue of the day.  Now we must obtain the advice of consultants.  It seems reasonable and fair to suggest that somebody should monitor the consultants to ascertain whether the taxpayer is getting value for money.  Many of these consultancy reports are allowed lie on shelves. Whether they are ever acted on, to what extent they are ever acted on, or <Col N="1344" /> the value of their recommendations is not something that ever seems to attract scrutiny in this House.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> I think it was of 30 April last, listed the big spenders.  Here was a gallery of Ministers competing with each other in terms of who could spend the most money on public relations advisers and consultants. The Taoiseach was listed as paying Carr Communications £36,000, that must be this year because there were other moneys paid to Carr Communications by the Taoiseach in the preceding year.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring paid, £84,817 to Carr Communications.  Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry paid £385,000 to consultants. Deputy McCreevy, Minister for Tourism and Trade paid £291,000 to Carr Communications.  Carr Communications is very fortunate to have this inside track. Deputy Bhreathnach, Minister for Education, paid £23,800 to communications companies.  Deputy Smith, Minister for the Environment, spent £494,422 on advertising campaigns.</P>

      <P>I will come to that.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, paid £835,281 to communications companies and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, spent £31,107.  Without making a meal of it, that is an unprecedented array of expenditure outside the Civil Service to recruit advisers, cosmetic spin doctors and so on to put a gloss on the Government's performance.  It is an extraordinary situation having regard to the extent of knowledge in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell is right in saying we have to examine whether we are getting value for money from these outside consultants.  We have to examine how they are chosen and selected and the terms of reference of the task they are given.  If the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, intervenes and says that a certain amount is for the AIDS awareness campaign she is clearly referring to the health budget, which I support.  That is correct and proper and one is not necessarily adopting a position of opposition in arguing that it be scrutinised, put out to tender and that the procedures be transparent and fair.

      <P>One is amazed at the feeble attempt by the Minister last night to rebut the motion.  The Minister's amendment seeks to replace the motion by the substitution of the words &ldquo;...without in any way approving of, or agreeing with high levels of professional fees...&rdquo;.  The Minister wants to be on the side of the angels.  He does not want to support the motion but he wants to make it clear to his northside constituents that he does not support the high level of professional fees we have been hearing about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised with the Taoiseach recently <Col N="1349" /> the question of outside consultants being employed by him to assist in the preparation of his case before the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry.  We are teasing out a similar issue in this motion, why it is necessary to go outside the panoply of the Civil Service, with all the knowledge, experience, training and loyalty to the State reposing in it for outside expertise to assist Government Ministers or the Taoiseach.  That has not been explained to Members.  It is the most fantastic proposition for which there is no precedent in legal jurisprudence, that in any case before a court, not to mention a tribunal of inquiry, the plaintiff, the defendant or a litigant before the court ought to have available to him or her a public relations consultant to try to put a spin on the day's happenings for the media.  Since the foundation of the State and setting up of the courts, the media has translated what happens in the court to the public according to their own lights and have been doing so reliably for many years.</P>

      <P>In the matter to which we may not refer, I tabled a parliamentary question initially to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It was innocuous, as a question must be, and asked about the recruitment of a company to advise his Department and so on in regard to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, the total amount of fees paid, the terms of reference of the appointment and if tenders were sought.  The Minister replied: &ldquo;The company referred to was recommended to my Department through the Department of the Taoiseach&rdquo;. In view of the Minister's statement I then tabled a question to the Taoiseach.  I will not repeat it but it was basically the same question I had tabled to the Minister.  Having regard to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, said it was recommended to him by the Taoiseach I then asked the Taoiseach if he would answer some questions.  Rather than answering the questions put to him the Taoiseach ran for cover and transferred the question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who had already transferred it to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>When the Minister came to answer questions on 24 March I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle advising me that parts of the question had been disallowed on the grounds that they were repeats in view of my original question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to which he had not replied.  The parts of the question which were allowed appeared on the Order Paper of 24 March in the following way, the qualifications of the company concerned, if the company provided any specific service for the Department of the Taoiseach arising from the tribunal and so on.  The question was not reached for oral answer, but given the importance of the issue I asked that it be held over until the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was due to answer questions on Tuesday of this week.  However, on that day I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle telling me that the question, which was perfectly in order on 24 March and appeared on the Order Paper for that day was now disallowed on the grounds that it related to a matter which is currently before the Committee of Public Accounts and on which the committee has not reported to the Dáil.  I do not want to go into the issue but I have been a Member of this House for some years, I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts since the last Dáil and this is the first occasion on which I have ever come across a question disallowed on the grounds that it relates to a matter currently before a committee of the House.  The net result of this saga is that Members of this House have been unable <Col N="1352" /> to secure answers to legitimate questions regarding a matter of public interest involving the expenditure of substantial amounts of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to comment on why the Taoiseach brought in private sector consultants to bolster his case, dig up dirt and do down the rest of us, but if the Members opposite keep heckling me I will deal with it at some length.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of the Minister's speech was that somehow this motion was a slight on the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not believe that any such argument can be supported.  The Comptroller and Auditor General got new powers under the Bill we have just passed; value for money audits is an instrument that has produced considerable results in the very few cases in which they have been carried out.  The House, in asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out this kind of assessment, is by no means reflecting on his office and if the House were to agree this motion we would be in a better position to assess whether the unprecedented amounts of money being paid to consultants is reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have sat here during the lifetime of this Dáil while unprecedented appointments were made to the offices of every Minister and Minister of State in the form of programme managers, advisers and so on.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerld, may well be disposed to saying that it has worked very well.  That is a matter of opinion, they have certainly made a botch of selling it to the public, but that is a different question.  If Ministers have programme managers, advisers and other people to deal with constituency work must we also go outside the Civil Service to recruit from a very narrow stream more private sector consultants and spin doctors to try to make the Government look good?  We would be failing in our duty as an Opposition if we did not draw this to the attention of people who are desperately looking for a small amount of money to keep community organisations alive and those who cannot get access to health services and a range of public services. The Labour Party, after its think-in last week, has decided to focus on housing because it contends it has done a fantastic job in Government in this area.  We have not moved on to another topic yet, but there must be another; I suggest health. The Minister for Health has done a good job, the Labour Party should focus on health as well as housing, but it stops at that.  However, there are still 30,000 on the housing waiting list.</P>

If memory serves me correctly, in the last Book of Estimates the budget for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was in the order of £1.9 million or £2.1 million. It is best spent in terms of the return. Each year the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlights the areas of wasteful public spending. The changes which have been made have resulted in savings.  I do not know if Deputy Martin is correct that such an examination could be undertaken within present resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In a nutshell, there is growing public concern about public moneys being lavished on chosen consultants outside the Civil Service to do jobs which in the minds of most people the Civil Service could perform.  People are concerned that there are favoured agencies and consultants who are being selected by one means or another.  They are concerned about the procedures that are being operated; that many of these contracts have been awarded without being put out to tender; that there is no transparency and no yardstick of measurement as to whether the conclusions of these consultants have been value for money and are just an excuse for ministerial indecision and inaction. That is the nub of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to support this motion which is timely if it causes the Government to pause.  It seems to think because it has an unprecedented majority &mdash; it <Col N="1356" /> has developed complacency and smugness already &mdash; it can continue to dole out public money in this manner for reports by consultants which in some cases are of dubious value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the level of professional fees is both important and timely.  Even from a cursory glance at the Exchequer accounts for the past five years one can see that the taxpayer is being ripped off.  It is hard to escape the conclusion that there is a golden circle, making millionaires out of a few at a cost of the public at large. Political ineptitude is the only possible alternative to political collusion in allowing mega bucks to be paid for all kinds of so-called consultancy services for the State.</P>
      <P>At the beef tribunal senior counsel were paid more than twice the daily fee paid to the Queen's Counsel at the Scott inquiry in Britain.  At the beef tribunal there were 160 lawyers most of whom are senior counsel.  This is but one example of manna from Merrion Street falling into the bank accounts of a few in the know. In many cases well drafted guidelines from the Department of Finance are ignored without rebuke or sanction while many contracts and payments are approved retrospectively when it seems nothing else can be done about it.</P>
      <P>The Government's amendment to this motion which refers to the Committee of Public Accounts is interesting.  The Committee of Public Accounts cannot discharge its functions properly without the power to summon witnesses and demand papers and to hold those who refuse in contempt.  This week the committee could not compel key witnesses to attend to establish the facts in two cases involving consultancy services costing £385,000 and where Department of Finance guidelines and procedures were completely ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government is serious about its amendment it should circulate and enact without further delay the promised compellability <Col N="1357" /> and privilege of witnesses Bill which is of vital importance in terms of the effectiveness of the committee system, in particular the Committee of Public Accounts.  We were promised several items that it would be published before last Christmas; we were then promised that it would be published during the Christmas recess and, later, in this session. It should be circulated and enacted without further delay.  We would then be able to avoid the need to hold costly tribunals in which the taxpayer is ripped off and Oireachtas committees would have some chance of ensuring that we get value for money and overcoming coverups and obfuscation whether inspired politically or by administrative inertia.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is important that under the Bill the Committee of Public Accounts should have the power to take evidence under oath.  This is important because it is not a crime to give false evidence without an oath whereas to do so under oath amounts to perjury and the matter could be referred to the courts. Without this power the committee will continue to be a paper tiger.</P>
    <P>Several cases in recent years suggest a certain tendency in public sector circles to pay above what would be considered reasonable.  The Telecom affair, the Glackin report, the beef tribunal and the Davy affair are but a few examples which point to a golden circle but a halt must be called to this largesse with public money.</P>
    <P>During the past 14 months as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I have been greatly impressed by the way the Department of Finance has developed its attitude and systems. The fault does not lie with the officials of the Department of Finance who were as shocked as Members of this House by the fees charged and paid in many areas. They are shocked by the fact that guidelines drawn up by them, approved by Government and circulated to Accounting Officers are frequently ignored without adverse consequences.</P>
    <P>The fees for the beef tribunal have <Col N="1358" /> been well debated.  At the time we were told they were fixed by the Attorney General and they had to pay the going rate. We were even told by some sources that the fees were much less than those paid for tribunals held in London.  We realise now that is not the case.  We know that the fees paid to those appearing at the beef tribunal are more than twice those paid in respect of the Scott inquiry in England.  We have also learned that there are clear controls on the establishment of tribunals and the fixing of fees in the British jurisdiction.  If we learn anything from the beef tribunal, it should be that a tribunal should never again be set up without an interdepartmental committee setting down the issues to be addressed, particularly its costs and the fees to be paid out.  Proper controls must apply in future.</P>
    <P>In the case of the beef tribunal a decision was made as a result of a Government motion, but thereafter it appears a Department or person was not charged with examining the issues to be addressed.  In other words, what was everybody's responsibility was nobody's responsibility and as a result the outcome was very unsatisfactory and costly.</P>
    <P>That is not the only example of extraordinary largess with public money.  It is not only within Government Departments that extraordinary fees are claimed and conceded.  In the Telecom Éireann affair an auctioneer paid two visits to a site without the knowledge of senior executives of the board and claimed a fee of £150,000.  It was considered a major achievement to have that figure reduced to £40,000.  That is another extraordinary example of how people believe they can rip off the public purse and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The House must address not only the question of the level of fees, but the frequency with which we use consultants. We appear to use consultants more frequently than we did ten years ago and their fees escalate by the year notwithstanding the fact that the expertise <Col N="1359" /> we buy in may be available in the public service.  We must examine areas of public expenditure which are not under the control of an accounting officer.  Legal fees are set by the Attorney General without reference to an accounting officer.  All such loopholes must be closed.  The gravy train must be stopped whether it is being fuelled by political considerations or administrative inertia.</P>

    <P>I was elected to this House in 1975 and am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I would like to put the record straight on matters arising from comments made by Deputy Rabbitte. I was a member of the committee which recently dealt with a report arising from allegations made by Deputy Jim Mitchell concerning the President of the High Court, the Attorney General and the Judiciary.  I was pleased the committee concluded its deliberations and that the matter was brought to finality. The second part of the conclusion of the draft report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges referred to an aspiration that members of any party &ldquo; . . . should refrain from making any assertion on a matter which is currently under consideration by the committee and before the committee has had an opportunity to report to the Dáil on its findings thereon.&rdquo;  The problem in this regard &mdash; and you, Sir, as a serving Deputy will be aware of this &mdash; is that when information is made available to those committees it is in the public domain.  It may be necessary to make such information available to the public, but a restriction cannot be placed on a Member of any party who is democratically elected to this Chamber by the <Col N="1360" /> people to represent their views to state his or her concerns in regard to those views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend getting involved in a row with the Chair.  The report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges suggests that Deputies should refrain from making allegations or discussing matters on which the committee has not had an opportunity to report to the Dáil.  We discussed this in detail and from my experience in this House, if a Deputy from any party rises to make a contribution he or she cannot be stopped from doing so, irrespective of the aspiration of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to which I would always adhere.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges an all-party committee, was discussing a sensitive issue.  However, when matters are public knowledge it should be legitimate to raise them in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern among the public about the level of fees paid to &ldquo;consultants&rdquo;.  I think it was Mr. Mark Kililea, MEP, who said that an expert or a consultant was someone in a pinstripe suit 50 miles from home, who carried a briefcase and who would know all the answers.  It seems extraordinary that the level of fees paid to some consultants in one week is equivalent to three years social welfare for someone else having equal voting strength in our democracy. The level of those fees is set by the Government.  The Taoiseach promised on 13 occasions that the ethics in Government Bill would be introduced and dealt with at an early date but there is still no sign of it.  That must have a bearing on <Col N="1361" /> the public's attitude to the manner in which the Government conducts its business.</P>
    <P>On 17 April the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> observed that, since coming into office, four Labour Ministers had made 200 appointments to the public service. Though it was emphasised in the article that there was no hint of impropriety so far as the appointments were concerned, it does show how broad the field is for those in Government to act in that way. Many of the consultants involved, from the highest earners to those we do not hear about; merely have their names inscribed on reports that are left lying on shelves in various parts of the country. Whereas business people, for instance, must be familiar with the detail of the expenditure in respect of their businesses, we, with one of the highest taxed populations in western Europe, are spending vast sums annually on consultants and other persons without ever hearing whether the return represents value for money or whether the objectives set out in the terms of reference are adhered to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell reminded us last evening that in the early 1980s fees totalling £9 million were paid for the design of our prisons which have not been built. Today, the Taoiseach, the leader of the Government with the biggest majority in the history of the State, is applauding himself for having a prison sited in Castlerea in his constituency.  A few years ago there would have been pickets outside the Dáil if anyone had decided on the building of a prison west of the Shannon. The Government allocates £3 million for the maintenance of the 3,000 miles of county roads in Mayo, roads that are traversed by legitimate taxpayers who pay £6 million annually in road tax but who have to contend daily with unimaginable horrors in gaining access to their houses, villages and towns while conducting their business.  It is worth contrasting their plight with what happened in the early 1980s when three times the <Col N="1362" /> annual amount allocated to a county was equivalent to that aid to consultants to design prison projects which were not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In the case of public moneys spent on consultants' and other professional fees we should know why a report was commissioned, what was its outcome and to whom the fees were paid.  At local authority level the auditor produces an annual report which can be examined by the public.  Such reports are complex and it may be difficult to extract information from them.  The same position applies in the case of vocational education committees. The Committee of Public Accounts has been traditionally the public watchdog in terms of the investigation and inspection of public expenditure. We hear constantly from the Government about the necessity for efficiency.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and representatives of agencies under his aegis are continually saying that if one is to manufacture quality goods and export them at competitive prices in a highly competitive marketplace, one must run an efficient business capable of keeping up with both national and international trends.  The Government can hand out not only £50, £100 or the widow's mite as it were, but hundreds of millions of pounds on an annual basis in fees to consultants and various other professionals.</P>
    <P>In Government one may be removed from reality.  The Mercedes is waiting at the gate, the door opens automatically as the Minister approaches.  There is never a question of his having to find parking space and walk for up to half a mile to a public meeting as the rest of us have to do.  Spin doctors supply the scripts, indicating which points should be emphasised and which sections are for the information of the Minister only.  Public funds are being used to have Ministers massaged politically and mentally so that they might feel good.</P>
    <P>I recall an occasion when my good friend, Deputy Lenihan, having lost his <Col N="1363" /> ministry, boarded a bus in Kildare Street without knowing where it was going. That was because of his having been ferried for so long by State car.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, should never lose sight of the way ordinary folk perceive what is happening in Government.  The perception is that there is a small golden circle who are there for the touch, that the tentacles of Government are spreading into the slimline, leanburn professionals. In many cases these professionals remain anonymous and a minority of them become parasites when engaged to complete a project.  They appear out of the wings when there is mention of a report being commissioned offering themselves as experts in the area <Col N="1364" /> in question.  Later, whatever information they produce will, when fed into a computer, translate into ECUs in Brussels so that there is a take for the professionals who must be paid for their work.  There is concern generally about the level of fees in many of those cases.</P>
    <P>The motion in the name of Deputy Gay Mitchell was not tabled for political reasons or because he has a fraternal relation contesting a forthcoming election. We made this clear some time ago. This motion appeared on the Order Paper of the Dáil about 12 months ago and we made it clear on a number of occasions since that it would be moved at an appropriate time.  This is an appropriate time and I commend Deputy Mitchell's motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this matter. Although the instances of wandering horses occur in my own area of Waterford city, this is a national problem, particularly in the larger urban areas.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is present, and one of the problems is to find out who is responsible in this area.  Is it the Department of the Environment, the Department of Justice or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?</P>
      <P>I sent people to one estate in Waterford City to count the horses roaming around the place.  One counted 29 and another 30.  These horses were just running loose and are very dangerous because they are not tethered.  Three or four of these animals are in foal and another four foaled recently.  This makes them even more dangerous because they are likely to lash out at anyone who approaches them.  Children in particular do not know how dangerous they are.</P>
      <P>This estate is close to a national primary road and on a few occasions previously these horses wandered on to that road which bisects the Ballybeg estate and the regional college.  In one instance a couple of years ago while small children were going to school, 16 of these animals came out of an alleyway and it was the grace of God that nobody was killed. However, if something is not done somebody will be killed in Waterford or somewhere else.</P>
      <P>There have been numerous instances of cars running into horses or horses running into cars and thankfully, nobody has been seriously injured up to now.  Not so long ago one of these big animals stopped on the road in front of me when I was on my way to my clinic and I could only get it to move by repeatedly sounding the horn.  This sort of thing goes on constantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for new legislation or regulations because at present the owners only have to pay whatever fees are levied at the pound.  If any local authority tried to recover its costs through the courts there would be a problem in identifying the owners of the animals, nobody knows who owns them.  A few months ago 31 of these horses were taken from Waterford and put into a pound in Kildare or Dublin but they were all back out 24 hours later. <Col N="1367" /> There is no point in just putting them into a pound.</P>
    <P>Waterford Corporation has to use long distance contractors because their own staff members were intimidated by the owners of the animals.  In the area I refer to there is a good GAA club and, again, the local authority has to spend a considerable amount of money fencing off the premises and depositing mounds of clay.  They have had to organise a number of raids in the last few years and I estimate that this is costing them between £20,000 and £25,000 to police this.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal in Waterford to provide a new pound for these horses. However, that will be a waste of time because it will be vandalised or the people running it will be intimidated. There is a need for a national pound so that these horses can be brought to one location.  The Garda are powerless because of the lack of suitable legislation. Fines should be increased to make it uneconomic to claim back the horses.  In addition, some method of registering and identifying these animals should be introduced. If a horse is impounded his ear could be notched so that if the animal is brought in again it will be recognised and confiscated in the case of a second offence.</P>
    <P>Something must be done.  Although nobody has been killed to date as a result of this problem the situation is extremely serious and somebody will be killed if appropriate measures are not taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kenneally for raising this issue.  It gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the limit and extent of the responsibilities of the Minister for Justice in relation to wandering horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the impounding of wandering animals rests with the local authorities who maintain pounds for this purpose.  The Garda are <Col N="1368" /> also authorised to impound wandering animals and to assist the local authority personnel responsible for this work.</P>
    <P>The law on wandering animals was updated by the Animals Act, 1985 which tackled the question in three ways.  First, it gave increased powers to the local authorities and Garda to impound animals. Second, it improved the effectiveness of the impounding procedure by giving local authorities power to order the sale, disposal or destruction, where appropriate, of impounded animals.  Third, it increased substantially the fines for turning animals loose, allowing them on the public road and rescuing animals from a local authority pound.</P>
    <P>The Act also abolished the then immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage caused by animals straying from such lands on to the road.  As a result, the laws of negligence now apply in such cases. The Act further permits the local authorities and the Garda to impound animals wandering on public roads even where the owner is known.  The authorities are also empowered to impound animals trespassing in public parks or other open spaces owned by a local authority or State agency.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Kenneally has written to the Minister about this problem in Waterford and I have been told that the Minister will be responding shortly.  The Minister has received a detailed report from the Garda authorities about the situation and she is aware that the problem is somewhat compounded by the lack of an animal pound in Waterford city.  She understands that this lack of a proper facility has been brought to the attention of the local authority by the Garda on a number of occasions.  The Garda have further informed the Minister that on the night of 9 February 1994, 22 horses were removed from the Ballybeg and Farran Park areas of Waterford city by local authority personnel assisted by members of the Garda. The animals in question were taken to a <Col N="1369" /> pound in Dublin.  The Garda are determined that this problem be tackled effectively and, in this regard, they have received the assurance of Waterford Corporation that similar operations will be undertaken where necessary.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister is not present to respond to this debate.</P>
      <P>Derrypark is situated at the eastern end of Tourmakeady, County Mayo and the school has been amalgamated with two others, those of Seanafarraghaun and Finney, Claremorris, County Mayo.

      <P>This problem will continue to arise in various other parts of the country on a more frequent basis as the natural and school going population declines.  The ESRI report concluded that there would be a reduction of 25 per cent in the school going population in the next ten years.  If the Minister allows this drop in teacher numbers to proceed, and if the Department insists on further amalgamations within the school area, this parochial centre will die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, a number of causes for hope.  First, this concession was allowed 12 or 13 years ago when numbers were at a similar level and a reprieve was given to this school.  Second, there is employment both in the factory at Killatiane, in the factory at Tourmakeady and, on an increasing scale, at Cornamona <Col N="1370" /> in County Galway.  In addition, there have been a number of queries under the rural resettlement programme. A family from England are due to inspect a house in the area on Sunday as are a number of other families between now and mid-summer.  It may well be that other children will be pupils of Derrypark school by 30 September.</P>
    <P>It can be concluded that the Government would appear to be in breach of Article 8 of our Constitution which states that the Irish language, as the national language, is the first official language. This is the last all-Irish Gaeltacht school in this area.  Irish is a natural, living, indigenous language.  The inspectors reports in the Department of Education show that the standard of spoken Irish and the standard of taught Irish is very high.  This will be lost if future families who might wish to reside here are left with a one teacher school.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the Government should do all in its power to preserve and maintain the Irish language. Special concessions are given to all-Irish schools in non-Irish speaking areas.  Why not give an additional concession for one year at least to the Derrypark school, which is in a fíor Gaeltacht.  People in the area continue to speak the living language in their daily lives.  I ask for special consideration for this and a number of other schools where a similar situation obtains.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress how dear this matter is to my heart and to the hearts of a great number of people.  We do not want to see an institution that has existed for hundreds of years crucified by a regulation of the Department of Education. Ministerial action in this regard will breed new life into this area and will allow those who want to continue living there, and those who may wish to live there in future, the freedom to do so in the knowledge that the Government is complying with the Constitution by doing everything possible to preserve the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> On behalf of the Minister for Education I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline to the Deputy the improvements which are being made to the pupil-teacher ratio under the Programme for Government.  The pupil-teacher ratio is currently 24.2 to 1.  By September 1994 the ratio will have been reduced to 23.4 to 1.  By 1996, as part of the Programme for Government, the pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 22 to 1.  I am confident that the Deputy will appreciate that these are substantial improvements.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government, the INTO, and managerial authorities of primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment of Derrypark national school on 30 September 1993 was 20 pupils which warrants a staffing in the 1994-95 school year of a principal only. Deviations from this agreement are permitted when a school is in breach of maximum class size guidelines, new maximum class size guidelines which will come into effect from 1 September 1994, are as follows: 37 in the case of single grade class group; 36 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades; 33 in the case of a multi-grade class group and 28 in the case of a one-teacher school. Deviation is permitted also when a school achieves a substantial growth &mdash; minimum <Col N="1372" /> of 25 pupils in the case of schools with an enrolment below 298 and 30 in the case of a school with an enrolment of 299 or over.</P>
    <P>Since neither of these two conditions apply to Derrypark national school, the first assistant's post in the school will be suppressed with effect from the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment.  The redeployment of the teacher will not take place before 1 September 1994.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that if the school's enrolment in September 1994 has increased to 28 pupils, the matter will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the redeployment of the teacher will contribute to a reduction of the teaching standards in the school.  There are many one-teacher schools in operation throughout the country and they provide excellent standards of education for their pupils.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like the Deputy to be aware that consequential to the national decline in enrolments, 420 posts which are now surplus to requirements are being redistributed and are being used for implementing the improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio which I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the reply to the fact that this is the last Gaeltacht school in the vicinity.  I will bring the Deputy's strong views on this issue to the Minister's attention tomorrow and, perhaps, the Deputy might take the matter up with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 May 1994.</P>

      <P>Self-catering plays a very important role in the development of the Irish tourism industry.  In 1993 7 per cent of a total of 3.2 million visitors coming to Ireland used self-catering accommodation as compared with 4 per cent in 1987.  As to registered accommodation, numbers increased from 79,000 people in 1987 to 227,000 in 1993.  Market share has grown from all regions, i.e. Britain, North America, Continental Europe.</P>
      <P>Currently there are more than 3,000 premises ranging from group schemes, meaning eight units or more, to individual units throughout the country.  Self-catering provides a direct input into the local economy, in terms of expenditure on food purchases and services etc.  In 1993, 4.2 million bed nights, representing 12 per cent of a total of 35 million bed nights, were recorded in self-catering accommodation.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy means when he refers to a deterioration of 1 per cent in our trade figures in 1995.</P>
      <P>The ESRI medium-term review points to the growth in international trade which is expected to result from the GATT which I signed in April on behalf of the Government.  The review also refers to the positive implications of the expected upturn in the economics of our most important export markets.</P>
      <P>In relation to Irish trade the review explicitly states: &ldquo;We expect quite rapid growth in the volume of exports over the next 3 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It further forecasts a 5 per cent per annum average growth in the volume of exports between 1995-2000.  The ESRI also predicts an increase in imports which it ascribes to increased consumer demand and increased investment.  However, the balance of trade is expected to remain positive in the period under review.</P>

    <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that there no statistics available on the number of Japanese who spent an overnight in Dublin and that there are no figures published for those travelling to <Col N="1252" /> London, Paris or Rome.  However, the overall number of Japanese tourists to Ireland in 1993 was 19,000, an increase of 34 per cent over 1992.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus are actively working in the Japanese market through one of Japan's leading tour wholesalers.

    <P>I also understand that there are no statistics available for the number of US tourists to London, Paris or Rome. However, the number of North American tourists to Ireland in 1993 was 422,000, an increase of 1 per cent over 1992.  An estimated 376,000 were US residents and 46,000 were Canadians. Approximately 62 per cent of US tourists, i.e. 234,000 persons spent at least an overnight in the Dublin region in 1993.</P>

      <P>The manpower survey of the hotel, catering and tourism industry in Ireland, carried out by CERT in 1992, showed that in the hotel and guesthouse sector over 30 per cent of owner-managers received formal training.  In the fast-food sector, 44 per cent of owner-managers received formal training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey also confirmed that there was a very high level of familiarity among managers and owner-managers of formal training courses offered by CERT.  Apart from the range of external management programmes run by CERT, it also operates an advisory and consultancy training service which targets approximately 200 establishments per <Col N="1253" /> annum, many of which are small owner-managed units.</P>
    <P>Training, of course, is a critical element in the Government plans to realise significant quality growth in tourism by the end of the decade.  With this in mind, I am determined, as part of my overall strategy for the sector, to upgrade even further our training activities and to ensure a clear focus on the key skills required to underpin a quality tourism product by the end of the next tourism operational programme.  My Department is currently working therefore with CERT and the industry in the preparation of a comprehensive manpower/ training policy which will help to determine priorities to the turn of the century.</P>

      <P>Ireland's greatest natural tourism strength is, undoubtedly, our clean and green environment.  We have the lowest population density in Europe with large open spaces and uncrowded roads, not to mention areas of great scenic beauty.  This is a legacy of history and nature that I am determined to preserve.</P>
      <P>This is not only a matter of principle, it is also strong commercial reasoning.

      <P>Bord Fáilte actively markets eco tourism under the banner of &ldquo;Ireland Naturally&rdquo; which is published in English, French, Dutch, German and Italian and is available in all our overseas markets.

    <P>We are not, nor do we wish to be, a mass tourism destination.  In planning for the further development of tourism, priority will be given to developing new markets and products to improve the seasonal and geographic spread of tourism in Ireland.  A planning framework is being created embracing tourism centres, rural tourism, special interest areas and touring routes.  Investment in products for the off-peak and shoulder seasons also features prominently in this context.</P>

      <P>The Market Development Fund was established to provide temporary support to companies in order to maintain employment and to help companies to remain in business while adjusting to the new market conditions during the exchange rate turmoil of late 1992.  A review of the scheme has indicated that the fund has succeeded in meeting its objectives.  Through the operation of the fund, 704 companies, employing 33,753 people, received assistance to cope with the difficulties caused by the currency pressures.  The total assistance paid out from the fund amounted to IR£26,941,985.  Only four of the 704 supported companies went out of business during the six-month period that the scheme was in operation.  In addition, employment numbers in the supported companies have been virtually maintained at the level originally approved. The evidence from the companies themselves confirmed that assistance from the fund made the difference between shedding labour or maintaining employment, between closing down or staying in business.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to allegations that migratory species are being over-exploited by tourist hunters.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 77,000 native hunters and 3,800 hunting licences were issued to out-of-State hunters last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> A breakdown of the latter figure and details of their hunting interests follows. As the Deputy will see only a percentage of these come here for shooting of migratory species such as snipe and woodcock.  It would appear that the present level of tourist shooting does not represent a threat to the convention on migratory species.</P>
    <P>The following measures are in place to monitor commercial shooting:</P>
    <P>(1)  Tourist shoot promoters have to submit details of their shooting rights to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  These are then assessed for gun day capacity and hunting licences are granted or refused with reference to these assessments.</P>
    <P>(2)  Game bag returns have to be submitted by each promoter at the end of the season.  In addition the NPWS Rangers regularly check shooting parties and inspect game bags.  An analysis of both bag returns and spot checks carried out last season revealed an average of three birds per gun day which is not excessive.  This is an important procedure in monitoring the wise use of game resources by commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>In addition hunters must hold a valid firearms certificate and hunting licence and have permission to shoot from the landowner or the holder of the shooting rights.  Notices are issued to all out-of-State hunters advising them of the general Irish hunting situation and the penalties applicable for contravention of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Complainants should report any alleged breaches of the Wildlife Act immediately to the gardaí or an authorised person under that Act. Persons convicted of offences face firearms seizure and fines up to £500 under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>The forthcoming launch of the UK national lottery will present a challenge to the national lottery, in particular in relation to sales now originating in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As part of ongoing commercial development and in anticipation of the launch of the UK lottery, the national lottery is currently reviewing options for game strategy and innovation.  In order to allow more scope for innovation in facilities and games and to provide for a more reliable service, the company recently implemented on-line validation for instant tickets and up-graded its on-line terminal and computer system. These developments will facilitate any further changes which may be required when the full details of the UK lottery operator become known.</P>
      <P>The National Lottery Company has coped successfully with many challenges in the past and I am confident that it will be able to meet this new situation also. In the context of the need for continuity in facing the new situation and the extensive successful experience already gained in operating the national lottery, the licence to the An Post National Lottery Company to operate the national lottery has been recast and will extend to the year 2000.  The revised terms are more favourable to the national lottery beneficiary fund.</P>

      <P>In 1985, the Government decided that personal assistants and special advisers in Ministers' offices should be exempt from the rules relating to civil servants and politics.  Programme managers who are not established civil servants are regarded as special advisers for this purpose and as such would be covered by the exemption.  The grades referred to are subject to the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the ethics Bill as it has not yet been published.</P>

My Department operates a number of educational schemes designed to allow unemployed people an opportunity to improve their academic qualifications and hence enhance their job prospects.  These schemes which allow claimants to return <Col N="1260" /> to full-time or part-time education while continuing to receive their social welfare payments and any secondary benefits are as follows: the vocational training and opportunities scheme (VTOS) &mdash; second level certificate courses &mdash; the third level allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Current EU regulations governing the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes already allow payment of 60 per cent advances before all applications for the year in question are processed.  This system in effect provides for payment of these premiums on a provisional basis as suggested by the Deputy.  Payment of the balances is governed by EU regulations relating to the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density and must await processing of all claims submitted by an individual applicant in the course of a year. Disadvantaged areas' headage schemes, other than for sheep, are normally on the basis of advances.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed, in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> to move progressively to a position during the period of the programme where all valid disadvantaged areas' headage claims will be paid by October of the year of application.  As a first step in this direction additional funding has been provided in my Department's Vote for 1994.  The Government is also committed to the payment of all eligible premium claims within three months of application in 1995 where this is allowed under EU regulations and to seeking changes in these regulations with a view to permitting premium payments to be made earlier in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that haulage costs in Ireland are adversely affected by our island-peripheral location imposing as it does haulage over greater distances than our European counterparts and the need to resort to a shipping mode to reach our markets in Britain and the continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infrastructural factors which could be said to militate against a lower cost base for the haulage industry here such as inadequate roads and port facilities have been progressively addressed by the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality. This work is to continue with substantial investment in these areas under the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> which outlines the primary objectives of transport investment in the period 1994-1999 as being: to improve internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities on an integrated basis, thereby reducing transport costs and offsetting the negative effects of peripherality; and to improve the reliability of the transport system by removing bottleknecks, remedying capacity deficiencies <Col N="1272" /> and reducing absolute journey times and journey time variance.</P>
    <P>Other factors which impact on the cost base of hauliers in this country include such items as tax and excise duties, fuel prices, ferry and port charges, insurance and labour costs all of which are outside the scope of my remit at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>Costs on the road haulage industry which result directly from the activities of my Department arise only in respect of the fees for the road freight carrier's licences and for the various authorisations needed to operate abroad. Such fees are kept as low as possible consistent with covering administrative costs.  I have just completed a major review in this area which will result in a simplified fee structure, involving lower charges in some instances, with effect from 1 June 1994.</P>

      <P>The national AIDS strategy committee meets when there are pressing issues which it needs to consider and the committee is in fact meeting today, 11 May. The work of the committee is divided into four sub-committees &mdash; care and management, prevention and education, HIV surveillance and anti-discrimination and these sub-commitees meet as required to deal with issues which arise. For example, the HIV surveillance subcommittee has been meeting every two months during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the health strategy which has just been published the recommendations from the national AIDS strategy committee form the basis for Government policy in relation to the provision of services for persons with HIV-AIDS and the closely related problem of drug abuse.  I greatly value the advice and <Col N="1275" /> recommendations made by the strategy committee and will continue to seek their advice in the future.</P>

    <P>As regards the individual referred to in the Deputy's question, I understand that he has been attending St. Brendan's Hospital on a continuous basis since 1985 <Col N="1276" /> and became wheelchair bound following an accident in 1993.  His injuries necessitated referral to the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre for treatment and therapy.  He was referred back to St. Brendan's a couple of weeks ago where he is being assessed with regard to suitable long-term placement.</P>
