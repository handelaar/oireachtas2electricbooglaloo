      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the current crisis facing TEAM Aer Lingus and the need for an injection of Government equity to avert the threat to 2,000 jobs.  The company is in a critical position and time is running out for the 2,000 people employed there.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7 and 10.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on No. 7 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of a main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes; and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not less than five minutes before the debate is due to conclude to make a speech in reply; (2) The proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 17 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with No. 7 satisfactory? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 10 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I propose that in respect of the Order the words &ldquo;if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion&rdquo; be deleted and the words &ldquo;up to 4 p.m.&rdquo; be inserted in their place, and that the following words be added &ldquo;At that stage the Dáil shall debate a motion for the establishment of a select committee to investigate the events surrounding <Col N="947" /> the issue of passports to financial associates of C &amp; D Foods Limited&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Surely that is a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's amendment.  Having regard to the reasonable intervention of the Chairman of the Labour Party this morning, it probably carries a majority in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter referred to by Deputy Bruton is not in order.  We are dealing with the Taoiseach's business, the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment must be related to the proposal before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Government is willing to establish a select committee to investigate the unanswered questions concerning the loan to C &amp; D Foods Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton should allow me to complete the business of the House.  I am asking again if the proposals for dealing with No. 10 are satisfactory.  Deputy Bruton may deal with a specific amendment to the proposal. He should not introduce extraneous matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="948" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Chair has not allowed the amendment which deals with the one matter concerning people today, I am not willing to accept the taking of other business if we are not allowed discuss the question of a select committee to investigate this matter.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Agriculture. Food and Forestry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I understand a discussion took place between the Whips, during the period when the vote was being called, which would allow for an amendment of the question put to the effect that the proceedings on No. 10 would not be concluded definitively at the time specified in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, but the Chair is not aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that such an agreement now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is a matter for the Whips to decide later.  I have put a question in conformity with the appropriate business of this House. The matter referred to by Deputy Bruton is one for the Whips to deal with later, if they so decide.  I am proceeding with the division.</P>
      <P>The Dáil divided: Tá, 63; Níl, 33.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recommends Mr. Kevin Murphy for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to move this motion recommending that the President should appoint Mr. Kevin Murphy to succeed Mr. Michael Mills in the position of Ombudsman.  Under the terms of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, Mr. Mills will vacate the office on reaching retirement age at the end of next October.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Ombudsman Act provides that the Ombudsman is to be appointed by the president upon resolution passed by the Dáil and Seanad recommending the appointment of the person concerned. The term of office is specified in that Act as six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure that I speak for every Member of this House when I say that this country owes Mr. Mills a debt of gratitude for the service which he has <Col N="960" /> rendered during his two terms of office as Ombudsman.  It should be remembered that he was our first Ombudsman and to him fell the onerous task of setting up the office, of making its presence and purpose known to the public and of establishing trust and confidence with a public service which was occasionally &mdash; during the initial years at any rate &mdash; somewhat suspicious of this new creation.  In this way he successfully counterbalanced any popular perception that the Ombudsman was there simply to attack the public service. Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Mills established the office as offering an easy and effective form of redress to those citizens who felt that they had been short-changed in their dealings with the public service.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills rose to these tasks with a determination and enthusiasm to vindicate the rights of the citizen in his or her dealings with the institutions of Government which, allied to a sense of fair play, ensured that the Office of the Ombudsman rapidly became a vital and respected element of our system of public administration.  His achievement has been reflected in the genuine tributes which have been paid to him from all sides of this House and of Seanad Éireann on the various occasions when his annual report or other matters pertaining to his office have been discussed in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A revealing index of Michael Mills' success has been the volume of cases which he and his staff have processed since he first took office.  An examination of the annual reports of the Ombudsman from the first in 1984 up to the most recently published one in 1992 reveals that some 30,000 complaints were processed and that, of these, some 20 per cent were resolved in favour of the complainant, while a further 26 per cent received assistance in one way or another by, for example, directing complainants to other benefits, other schemes or other courses of action which could afford a resolution to their problems.</P>
    <P>These statistics are a monument to a truly remarkable achievement.  I know that all Members of this House will wish <Col N="961" /> to join me in expressing our sincere appreciation for his contribution to our country and in wishing him a very long and happy life after he vacates the position of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Mills set a remarkably high standard of achievement and the Government was determined that, in recommending a successor for the position of Ombudsman, the chosen individual would be somebody who could emulate and, indeed, build upon these achievements.  When we approached Mr. Kevin Murphy and requested him to allow his name to be recommended for the position of Ombudsman, we felt sure that we had identified somebody with the ideal profile for the position.  We are appreciative of the fact that he responded positively to our approach.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to say something at this stage about the thinking which informed the Government's decision to approach Mr. Murphy.  We had in mind the way in which we wish to see the public service develop and the complementary role which a strong and committed Ombudsman could play in this process.</P>
    <P>A major element of the Government's approach is the perceived need to develop and strengthen the customer relations culture in the public service. When recently launching an initiative to develop strategic management in the Irish public service, the Taoiseach highlighted a number of specific ways in which customer service must be improved &mdash; for example, by making services accessible to the users, by making systems and procedures as simple and straightforward as possible, by ensuring that official forms are fully comprehensible and by reducing the number of official forms.</P>
    <P>We are blessed with a public administration which is rich in talent and commitment, possesses a remarkable degree of professional integrity and is immersed in the public service ethic.  I know from personal experience that nobody is more aware than our public servants themselves of the need to change and adapt in the face of the rapidly accelerating rate at which society and social expectations are developing here.  If change is to be <Col N="962" /> successfully implemented, public servants must have a sense of being involved.  Change cannot be imposed from outside.  I am confident that there is huge commitment to, and enthusiasm for, change among our senior public service managers.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have had reforms and attempted reforms of public administration in the past &mdash; some were largely ignored, while others were implemented in part.  What I feel sets the current initiative apart is the degree to which the purpose of public service is highlighted. There is clear focus on the ends to be achieved &mdash; the identification of the real needs of our citizens and the delivery of appropriate services to those citizens.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman operates within an independent legislative framework. Nonetheless, the Government considers that there is a significant parallel between his statutory role and the initiative announced by the Taoiseach.  This is seen most clearly in the shared commitment to championing the rights of the citizen in his or her dealings with the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The impact which an effective Ombudsman can make in defending citizens' rights can be seen most strikingly in those cases, which appear again and again in the annual reports, where he precipitated change which reverberated far beyond the individual case.  One thinks of such initiatives as the many procedural improvements, the reforms of anomalies, both legal and otherwise, the encouragement of public officials to adopt a more sympathetic approach to the predicament of their client, each one an initiative which made life much easier for so many of our citizens who had business to transact with Government Departments or other public agencies.</P>
    <P>In Mr. Kevin Murphy we believe that we have somebody who as Ombudsman could move forward the process of championing the cause of the individual citizens in their dealings with public agencies.  He is one of our most gifted public servants.  Indeed, on many occasions I have been the beneficiary of his valuable advice, and advice based on a wide experience of public administration <Col N="963" /> at the most senior level, advice always given frankly and objectively.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about those aspects of Mr. Murphy's background and experience which persuaded the Government of his particular suitability for the position of Ombudsman. His senior management postings have involved him in an extensive range of dealing with people outside as well as within the public service.  For many years he was a member of the Employer Labour Conference.  More recently he has played a leading role in negotiating the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the recent <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The skills which Mr. Kevin Murphy displayed in leading those negotiations included patience, judgment, intellectual and physical stamina and a creative approach to problem solving.</P>
    <P>In addition to these qualities, he possesses another and in my view vital attribute: the ability to maintain good relations with, and retain the trust of, all sides, without compromising his own position.  This is a quality which I have so often seen him display even when negotiations ran into stormy waters.</P>
    <P>I note with regret that the Government's announcement of its intention to nominate Mr. Murphy drew a knee jerk reaction from some who contended that a public servant was by definition unsuitable for this appointment or that this particular nomination would in some way diminish the independence of the Ombudsman.  These are views to which I do not subscribe and which have no basis in reality.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor the Government see this appointment as indicating in any way that civil servants should in the future monopolise or have any prior claim on this particular office.  The range of backgrounds from which Ombudsmen in other jurisdictions have been drawn is wide and includes, in many instances, public service backgrounds.  This diversity, I think, reflects the needs of the institution at different stages.  Our first <Col N="964" /> Ombudsman had to face the task of gaining acceptance for his office from parliamentarians and making potential clients aware of its existence and utility to them.  His unique familiarity with Deputies of all parties, who could well have seen the Ombudsman as competing with their own grievance resolution role, and his journalistic experience contributed in no small way to the successful accomplishment of these talks.</P>
    <P>At all times the essential task of the Ombudsman will be to bring justice and compassion to bear on the situations where the law, or the application of the law, does not provide them.  Investigation and resolution of individual grievances must always be his or her prime function. In that regard, I am aware that Mr. Murphy's trade union colleagues on the other side of the table always have viewed him as a tough and principal negotiator on macro issues of pay and conditions but as an accessible and sympathetic listener on individual cases involving grievances or inequities.</P>
    <P>However, there are other aspects to an Ombudsman's role besides individual grievances once the institution has secured acceptance as part of the administrative landscape.  For instance there is a need to assess independently, and provide feedback on, organisational deficiencies which give rise to individual grievances.  We have put in place mechanisms to review from the &ldquo;value of money&rdquo; point of view the operation of public service organisations and to improve their managerial efficiency.  The office of Ombudsman, at this stage of its development, has reached the point where we would be justified in looking to it to provide an institutional audit of such organisations from the point of view of the client.  This particular task would be facilitated by the appointment as Ombudsman of someone whose background gives a ready familiarity with the organisational and procedural functions of the public service.</P>
    <P>There are other prospective developments which reinforce that view.  This Government set out in its Programme for a Partnership Government an agenda for <Col N="965" /> change aimed at broadening, or as I would prefer, deepening our democracy. Our proposals in relation to such matters as ethics in public office, electoral reform and freedom of information are at an advanced stage and some will be brought before this House shortly.  In many of these areas, there will be a need for mechanisms to resolve disputes which have a public interest dimension or which arise between individual citizens and State interests.  The outgoing Ombudsman has already highlighted the similarity between the adjudicatory tasks involved and the current functions of his office. This is something which the Government will take into account in its consideration of these matters.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is Mr. Murphy's background which especially fits him for the position of Ombudsman.  He has a thorough grasp of the realities of public service here.  His high level management experience in the Civil Service would afford him a particularly valuable point from which to distinguish between those cases where legal or other legitimate circumstances preclude a certain course of action as opposed to those where dubious administrative practice is the main obstacle.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy had the unusual experience for a civil servant of competing successfully in a public competition for a senior management position of Deputy Secretary in the Department of the Public Service, a Department where he was soon to rise to the rank of Secretary. When that Department merged with the Department of Finance in 1987 he formed part of the top management team in that Department.  The positions which he has held in both Departments involved him in regular high level contacts with management in all Government Departments and with bodies in the wider public service as well.  They also required him on numerous occasions to take, and stand over, difficult decisions, decisions which would on occasions have been unpopular with his public service colleagues in other Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I am conscious of Mr. Kevin Murphy's particular <Col N="966" /> aptitude for innovative and progressive thought on all matters relating to the reshaping of the public service.  I know that the many Members of this House who like to keep abreast of the latest thinking in public administration will be aware of Mr. Murphy's reputation in this regard, based on his many public and published addresses.  Lest any cynics present might view these plaudits as the biased view of a Minister for one of his senior mandarins.  I should like to quote the words of Senator Professor Jospeh Lee, one of the most trenchant critics of shortcomings in the Civil Service.  In his book, <i>Ireland 1912-1985</i> about Mr. Kevin Murphy's contributions to one particular debate:</P>
    <P>Kevin Murphy ... committed himself to a courageous public statement on the possibilities for improved productivity in the civil service.  Few senior decision-makers in other institutions, whether in the public or private sector, would comment as candidly or as intelligently on the difficulties they faced.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost confidence that Mr. Murphy will make a remarkable contribution to this country if appointed as Ombudsman.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in commending this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Mr. Michael Mills, who served the office of Ombudsman with great distinction during the past number of years.  The annual reports produced by his office clearly indicate his concern for natural justice, for sorting out problems for a great many people and ensuring that the interest of his clients was followed through in as complete a fashion as possible. I wish Michael Mills well in his retirement.  He played a major part in the life of this country as a political journalist for many years and subsequently in his role as Ombudsman.  In dealing with 30,000 cases, 20 per cent of which were in favour of the client, Mr. Mills brought a great deal of relief to many people through his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of regional offices, <Col N="967" /> within the Ombudsman's department, was innovative and long overdue.  One has only to hear of the numbers of people who attend the regional offices for discussion on a wide variety of problems to appreciate the interest and understanding of the role of the Ombudsman's office.  He had to fight trenchantly and go public, during the reign of another administration, to seek extra staff and funding to ensure that the terms of his office were adhered to.</P>
    <P>My party is opposed to the proposed appointment by the Government of Mr. Kevin Murphy as Ombudsman, although not on the basis of his credentials and I have no doubt that the attributes accorded to him by the Minister for Finance are genuine.  I am sure he is a civil servant of great ability and, obviously, of long service to the State.  However, in his role as proposed Ombudsman he is appointed as judge and adjudicator over many of the offices, civil servants and colleagues with whom he now works. This appointment is being made without consultation with any leaders of the Opposition parties, a precedent stipulated when Mr. Mills was first appointed.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Ombudsman (No. 2) Bill, 1979 &mdash; volume 320, column 1175, Official Report of 8 May 1980 &mdash; the former Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, Deputy Calleary, gave details of the role of the Ombudsman as it was then seen.  He pointed out that civil servants are expected to be advisers and to ensure that the Minister's actions are legally correct and defensible and to analyse and offer views on available options.  He said:</P>
    <P>This role calls for certain skills ... and expertise.  At the same time, he is expected to be a manager in the best modern manner, identifying and even anticipating the citizen's needs ... While, in general our civil servants perform with a high degree of dedication and competence, it is clearly very difficult for any individual to discharge both of those roles at once.</P>
    <P>In column No. 1177 he went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> I and the Government regard it as vital to the success of the institution that the Ombudsman be acceptable to all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>There has been no consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition parties in regard to the proposed appointment of Mr. Kevin Murphy, which is not in keeping with the precedent established on the appointment of Mr. Mills.  The then Minister for the Public Service, Mr. Boland &mdash; volume 345, column 608 of the Official Report of 25 October 1983 &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>In accordance with the commitments made during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and Seanad in 1980, and specifically my own commitment here in the House on 8 July last, I have consulted with the Leader of the Opposition in advance of making known the nominee.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill, the office of the Ombudsman and the nominee being acceptable to everybody the Minister should, out of courtesy at least, have discussed this matter with the Leaders of the Opposition so that nobody would be in any doubt.  I also note that when the Taoiseach was Minister for the Public Service &mdash; volume 394, No. 6, columns 1674 and 1675 of the Official Report of 14 December 1989 &mdash; he was asked on three separate occasions, arising out of Private Notice Questions, by the former Deputy, Dr. Garret FitzGerald if the Government would consult the Leaders of the Opposition prior to making public the name of the proposed nominee for Ombudsman.  Three times, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; now Taoiseach &mdash; refused to answer any of those questions.  That is simply not good enough and a point that rankles.  This is an independent office with an independent adjudicator and the nominee should be acceptable to all sides of the House, through which he is appointed by the President, and to whom he is answerable.</P>
    <P>I note that the role of Ombudsman has been expanded by virtue of legislation and ministerial regulation.  The Minister was right in saying that the results of <Col N="969" /> decisions by the Ombudsman, in many of the cases on which he has adjudicated, &ldquo;reverberated far beyond the individual case&rdquo;.  The then Minister for the Public Service, Mr. Boland &mdash; volume 345, column 607 of the Official Report of 25 October 1983 &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>He may begin an investigation on his own initiative &mdash; arising out of a newspaper report, for example.</P>
    <P>There is a cloud over the Taoiseach as a result of newspaper reports which may or may not be accurate.  It may well be that the Ombudsman might wish to proceed with an investigation on his own initiative in so far as his responsibility relates to the Civil Service.  This would obviously have an impact on the present situation with regard to passports, as far as reports to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment are concerned about companies involved and named in the newspapers.  If the Taoiseach did not want to answer a question it may well be that the Ombudsman would decide to investigate whether the Taoiseach would benefit from any of the Masri investment in C &amp; D Foods.  If the Tánaiste does not wish to refer the present dispute to the Commission, provided for in the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, it may well be that the Ombudsman's office would initiate an investigation arising from newspaper reports.  If the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, does not wish to answer questions in regard to the consultancy firm appointed, the status of that firm, or to give the name of the managing director of that firm, the Ombudsman's office may wish to investigate that matter.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the appointment of Ombudsman motion on 25 October 1983 the then Minister for the Public Service, Mr. Boland, clearly said it was possible for the office of Ombudsman to initiate an investigation on his own initiative and he referred specifically to newspaper reports.  I make that point in case the Ministers involved do not wish to dispel any clouds which hang over the Taoiseach or members of the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my intention, but it is possible for the Ombudsman to initiate investigations on his own initiative arising from newspaper reports. There are newspaper reports which cast doubt on the independence of this House.  If the Ombudsman is to be a truly independent judge and adjudicator of the Civil Service and semi-State bodies these are legitimate questions which should be asked by him and to which he should seek answers.  I hope he will initiate an investigation into the matter arising from the newspaper reports to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one other point which is of great interest to me.  When the previous Leas-Cheann Comhairle former Deputy Tunney, spoke to this Act he referred to the Irish language.  He felt that the office of the Ombudsman should be allowed to investigate the matter. Numerous small primary schools throughout the country, particularly in fíorghaeltacht areas, are now being reduced to single teacher status.  As Irish is the official language of the State the Government should provide every support in those areas where it is alive.</P>
      <P>I am sorry but I have to oppose the appointment proposed by the Minister on the basis that no consultations took place with the leaders of the Opposition parties and that Mr. Murphy is expected to act as judge and adjudicator of his own kith and kin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that all the <Col N="971" /> plaudits given by the Minister for Finance to Mr. Murphy are well deserved.  I am sure he is a decent, skilled and experienced man and that the nation owes him a considerable debt of gratitude for the way in which he applied himself to the various positions he has held within the public service.  I do not say this in an offhand way.  I recognise the validity of much of what the Minister had to say in relation to this man's track record in the public service.  I accept that he is a person of considerable merit.  However, that is not what we are dealing with today; we are dealing with the question of whether he should be made Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In order to address this question properly it is important to go back to the origins of the office of the Ombudsman. It is relevant to note that the Devlin committee on the reform of the public service marked the starting point, in Ireland at any rate, in relation to the call for the appointment of a person to administer a system of administrative justice and who would be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also relevant to note that in 1977 an all-party committee of this House was established under the chairmanship of Richie Ryan &mdash; the late George Colley was vice-chairman &mdash; to discuss how the proposal that an Ombudsman be appointed could be advanced.  This committee, which reported in that year. recommended unanimously that the appointment of an Ombudsman should have cross-party support and should be designed to ensure that whoever would be appointed to the position would have the united support of the political establishment. The formula it devised at that time was that the resolutions relating to the appointment of the Ombudsman should receive the support of two-thirds of the Members of this House.  It decided that that was the correct way of ensuring that everybody in this House would be consulted on the issue and that the appointment would carry cross-party support.  By definition, it was also designed to exclude the possibility that one side of this House could decide to <Col N="972" /> impose its own candidate on the rest of the House in a way that was controversial or deprived the person nominated of the cross-party support that is essential to the proper functioning of the office.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there should be a two-thirds qualified majority was not, unfortunately, incorporated in the Ombudsman Act, 1980, but it is relevant to point out that in departing from this recommendation of the all-party committee the Government of the day made it clear that it was its intention to ensure that there would be cross party consultation and that the position would not be filled following a partisan nomination from one side of the House.</P>
    <P>As we find out so often in this House, words are cheap and promises are evanescent.  The logic behind the recommendation that the resolution relating to the appointment of the Ombudsman should receive the support of two-thirds of the Members of this House was quickly forgotten, although when Mr. Michael Mills was appointed there was consultation with the Opposition parties. The promise was kept for a short period but shortly thereafter it was discarded.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Mills came to be reappointed this House found itself in a peculiar situation in that there was opposition from the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and particularly from the Department of Finance, which was unhappy with him for a number of reasons, It was only after a titanic struggle, and one of the less publicised confrontations within the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition, that there was a back-down on the issue and he was reappointed for a second term.</P>
    <P>I regret to say, in sadness, that at that time the Department of Finance had its own agenda.  It deprived the Office of the Ombudsman of necessary resources. There was a cutback without any reference to this House and the Ombudsman had to protest that his Office was effectively being neutered.  I say this not to recriminate but to outline the facts, as sometimes we proceed on the basis of fiction.  It is worth pointing out that the independence and integrity of Michael <Col N="973" /> Mills, to whom the Minister has paid a generous tribute, was born out of cross-party consensus and a process of consultation. There was a clear indication on his nomination that he was to be independent of the public service and manifestly independent of political patronage.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, provides that the appointment shall be made following the acceptance of a resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  This was supposed to symbolise the notion that it was the Members of these Houses who would make the decision.  There is nothing in the Act which hints at the notion that the Government will make a nomination and seek the approval of the Dáil.  This was never envisaged; theoretically, the Government could have a minority in one House. This is not a Government position and it was never in the gift of the Government. It was therefore wrong for the Government to take the decision to approach Mr. Murphy.  It is also wrong for the Fianna Fáil and Labour parliamentary parties to accept that this is a Government appointment rather than a parliamentarians' appointment.  It should be dealt with on a cross-party basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was extremely polite in saying that the Government lacked courtesy in failing to consult with other Members of this House.  The manner in which this was done was much more than a lack of courtesy, it was a complete subversion of the principle and spirit in which this Act evolved and of the notion of cross-party agreement.  This was sprung on the Opposition as a <i>fait accompli</i> and in that context a big mistake has been made.</P>
    <P>It is said that this position has slipped into the grip of the public service.  When the next appointment is being made a suitably qualified and clever man in a similar position to that of Mr. Murphy could claim on the basis of precedent that he has first call on the position and say to the Minister of the day that it is the way it was done in 1994.  The position would be given to such a person unless there is something wrong with him.  Regrettably, this position has dropped into the maw <Col N="974" /> of appointments which can be made only from the public service.  The precedent is set and will not be reversed except by people who are determined to do so and have the nerve and guts to stand up to the public servants and say there is not a precedent and that while the person in question may be qualified they want a more independent person.  That will be a difficult case to make in the future.</P>
    <P>The recently published second edition textbook on administrative law by Hogan and Morgan outlines the necessity for independence in the position of Ombudsman. It is regrettable that the symbolism of that independence has been thrown away by the failure to consult other parties and the decision to appoint a person from the top ranks of the public service to be the judge of the public service.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what the Minister stated about the necessity for the role of Ombudsman to be developed to the stage of doing an institutional audit of organisations from the point of view of the client.  That is not the function of the Ombudsman and is not written into the Act.  It is, of course, true that the Ombudsman is given power to make recommendations, but to incorporate the Ombudsman into a role of carrying out audits on the public service for the Government is a mistake and does not have a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy is a senior and notable civil servant.  He is taking up this position for a period of years.  What will happen when that period expires?  If he is not reappointed, to where will he return? Will he return to the senior echelons of the public service?  In that context he is incapable of being independent.  He is being appointed at a time in his life when, having served his term and if he is not reappointed to the public service, he will have a strong moral case for an extension of his term as Ombudsman.  He can make the point that he made his decision in mid career which puts him in a slightly compromised position.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, so be it.  But if the position is open to members of the public service who would not have reached retirement age at the end of their term, they would be compromised in this way.  Therefore, it is desirable that we should look outside the public service to provide an administrative judge to report to this House on the public service.  I have nothing against public servants, but I do not believe that the Commissioner of the Garda should be made a criminal judge or that the position of Director of Public Prosecutions should be filled from within the Garda.  I draw that analogy with this appointment.  It is regrettable that the conventions in relation to this appointment were trampled down on this occasion.  We will be opposing the nomination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will not be opposing the motion for the appointment of Mr. Kevin Murphy to the position of Ombudsman.  Nonetheless, we are very disappointed at the failure of the Government to consult in the spirit of the legislation the other Dáil parties about the appointment as was the case when Mr. Michael Mills was put forward for appointment in 1983.</P>
      <P>Mr. Murphy will have a difficult act to follow in that Michael Mills has been an outstanding success in the position.  As the first appointee to the office he had only the broad legislative framework against which to operate, but he established the office of Ombudsman as a position of considerable significance in Irish life.  Mr. Mills turned out to be an inspired choice.  His integrity, courage, independence and commitment to those who turned to the Ombudsman as a court of last resort with their grievances have been the outstanding features of more than ten years public service in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> We should not forget that the treatment of Mr. Mills by a number of previous Governments was far from honourable.  In 1987 and 1988 the then Fianna Fáil Government attempted to emasculate the office of Ombudsman by starving it of staff resources.  The number of investigators in the Office of Ombudsman was chopped from 16 at the beginning of 1987 to eight at the beginning of 1988, despite the fact that his workload increased significantly over that period. It was only when Mr. Mills went public on the issue and it became a matter of controversy that staff members were restored to that approaching an acceptable level.  In 1989 the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government, in which the Taoiseach was then Minister for Finance and had overall responsibility for the office of Ombudsman, also treated Mr. Mills in a shabby fashion. Deputy McDowell stated that his party was not involved in those decisions; nonetheless, the objective manner in which Mr. Mills was treated was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Government did not appoint Mr. Mills until the last minute.  Apparently the aim at the time was to let the appointment time lapse, presumably to open the way to appoint a person who might be less of a thorn in the side of the bureaucracy. A lesser person than Mr. Mills might have been tempted to wash his hands of the affair and walk away.  The public owes him a considerable debt of gratitude for not doing so.</P>
    <P>Given all that has happened, it is unfortunate that the Government chose to announce the nomination of Mr. Murphy without consultation with Opposition parties.  The appointment of an Ombudsman should ideally be done on the basis of consensus and should not become a matter of political controversy; that is the spirit of the legislation as I understand it. Under the 1980 Act the appointment is made by the President upon a resolution passed by the Dáil and Seanad.  The political reality is that this gives the Government of the day the power to make the appointment.  If the public is to have confidence in the person appointed <Col N="977" /> and if the appointment is to avoid becoming a matter of political controversy, we need to review the procedures for appointing the Ombudsman.  We could model new procedures on those governing, say, the appointment of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, a committee of independent experts, including, among others, the President of the High Court and the chairman of An Taisce, draw up a short list of candidates from whom the Government must select its nominee. Surely it would be possible to have a similar committee of independent persons to draw up a short list of potential candidates for the position of Ombudsman. That would be a far better way of making the appointment than the present position on which the Dáil has been presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and the only choices open are to accept the nomination of Mr. Murphy or vote against him.</P>
    <P>I do not accept suggestions that Mr. Murphy is automatically unsuitable for appointment simply because he has been a senior civil servant.  I do not believe any profession should be excluded from consideration.  The political correspondent of a national newspaper was in many respects an unlikely choice, but he turned out to be a very good one.  Mr. Murphy will certainly have the advantage of knowing his way around the public service, knowing how it works and how civil servants operate.  It is also wrong to assume that public servants are hostile to the concept of an Ombudsman.  Many public servants have to work under rules and procedures that are outmoded and outdated, frustrating to operate and not necessarily in the public interest.  In many cases the intervention of the Ombudsman is welcomed by public servants because it forces changes &mdash; changes that are as welcome to the civil servants as they are to the public.  It is regrettable that Mr. Murphy has emerged as a nominee of the Government rather than as a choice of this House, but rather than rush to premature judgment people should give him an opportunity to put his mark on <Col N="978" /> the job just as Mr. Mills did.  He has a distinguished record of public service and there is nothing to suggest that he will not carry out the functions of the office of Ombudsman in the best manner possible.</P>
    <P>I will say a few words to give my friend, Deputy Mitchell, time to draw his breath. Deputy Enda Kenny raised a matter arising from my speech on the passport affair, specifically the question of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a legitimate contribution in the context of this motion.  It is most regrettable that the document I put on record yesterday ruled out participation in the scheme by nationals of <Col N="979" /> Chinese origin or from the Indian subcontinent.

I am not going into detail of how the Taoiseach's business profited from a decision by Cabinet, I am merely raising the race angle and the procedures in the Department of Justice.  It is not acceptable that the Department of Justice's interpretation of the scheme discriminates against people on the basis of race or colour.  That is a legitimate area for the Ombudsman to investigate and to establish why such procedures have been put in place and why the Minister for Justice of the day should acquiesce to such discriminatory procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which the Government has handled the appointment of the Ombudsman is regrettable.  Parliament is supposed to have a say in the appointment of the Ombudsman and effectively it has been gazumped.  The Government has undermined the role of Parliament and has encroached on its role.  This is not a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which we make appointments to important positions is seriously deficient.  Anonymous personalities, whose views and track record are not known to Members never mind the public, are being appointed to major positions.  I know some people know a great deal about Mr. Murphy, and quite honestly anything I know about him is good, but I do not know his personal views on the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.  Likewise an anonymous personality has been appointed Governor of the Central Bank, and this appointment to a very major position has been made without the public knowing <Col N="980" /> his track record or his personal views, even though his personal views could impinge on the daily lives of people.  For example, his views on interest rates and the exchange rate would impact on the prospects of business, but his personal views on these matters are unknown.</P>
    <P>The personal views of public servants are unknown because in public they express only views of the Minister and the Department.  When public servants are to be appointed to positions such as Ombudsman, Governor of the Central Bank or Chief Justice, their personal views and their track record are vitally important.  I submit that we should have given the lead.  We should have an appointments committee where nominees are put through a rigorous cross-examination of their track record and fitness for the position to which they are being nominated.  We have to put an end to the method of appointment being resorted to by the Government on this occasion.</P>
    <P>If we want to improve performance in the public sector we need much greater accountability; but the reality is that there is far too little accountability and, certainly in positions which are defined by law as independent, there is no accountability.  I have consistently raised the difference between independence and accountability, the need to make independent offices accountable so that their performance can be evaluated.  The position of Chief Justice will be filled shortly.  It is vitally important that Members and the public know the views of the nominee before he is appointed to that position, but we will not have any say.  Similarly, we do not have a say in the appointment of Ombudsman, the Governor of the Central Bank and other positions, such as chief executives of semi-State companies, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner and the Army Chief of Staff. All appointments to these major positions should be the subject of scrutiny by this House.  I would go further and include also Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries of Government Departments as well as Ambassadors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> This House has been reduced to a cipher, because effectively we have no say in most matters. Appointments are being made willy nilly.  Once a person has been appointed, there is no prospect of dismissal and therefore they do not have to perform.  The main duty of Parliament is to ensure that the Government and its agencies are held accountable, that both are kept on their toes and perform.  That role has been denied to this House.  This Government is not the only one which has done that, but this practice has emerged and our democracy, economy and people are the poorer for it.  If we are serious about parliamentary reform, redressing the major problem of cynicism about politics and politicians among so many of our people, we should ensure that Parliament is much more relevant than it is, particularly in respect of such important appointments.  I am aware that some of my suggestions may involve changes in our Constitution but we are prepared to contemplate other changes to it.  Why will we not contemplate the necessary changes in our Constitution to give the House the effective say it should have on behalf of the people it is elected to represent?  It is thoroughly unsatisfactory that people about whom little is known are appointed to senior positions.  They may have been senior civil or public servants for a long time, but little is known about their personal attributes.</P>
    <P>Regarding Mr. Kevin Murphy's nomination I have known him for a long time, he was a distinguished Secretary of the Department of the Public Service before it was abolished, but I do not know anything about his attitudes to the many deficiencies in the public sector.  I wonder whether it is appropriate for a senior public servant to become the referee of the public service.  It is rather like the appointments Henry VIII made to the Archbishopric of Canterbury &mdash; he put in his own man.  There is a danger we are doing that in this case despite Mr. Murphy's very good personal qualities. This House has not had an opportunity to establish whether Mr. Murphy will <Col N="982" /> have the independence of mind and commitment to ensure that the Office of Ombudsman remains independent of the Executive and will perform in the manner expected by parliament.  I criticise the Government for its handling of this matter.  I understand what happened. Three senior people in the Department of Finance were looking for promotion, only one could be appointed Secretary of the Department of Finance and one appointed Governor of the Central Bank but as three people were in the running they seized this parliamentary position. In Britain the Ombudsman is called the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to signify he is a parliamentary officer not a government officer.  The Government should be ashamed of itself for encroaching on the territory of the Dáil and all parties in the Dáil should have been consulted in regard to the nomination.</P>

      <P>When Mr. Murphy takes up the appointment he will no longer be a civil servant.  The major advantage is that he will not be required to play two roles, his only role will be that of Ombudsman.  I acknowledge that the remarks made about him by Deputy McDowell and others did not refer to his personal position.  His functions as Ombudsman are clearly laid down. Anyone who knows Mr. Kevin Murphy, and I know many Members have had dealings with him, will be aware of his knowledge of the public service sector and his views on reform.  He is probably a unique senior civil servant in that he was appointed to senior positions by Governments made up of different parties, namely Fianna Fáil, Labour, Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael. More than most public servants his views are well known.  As part of his duties he will have to deal with civil and public servants whose actions may not always have been in line with public interest, but he never shirked from addressing those problems.  I have never in my dealings with him, or other senior figures in Departments in which I served, seen him intimidated or avoid pulling any punches. He has always managed to handle his position extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that an Ombudsman has a particular background does not mean that he is not able to deal with various difficulties.  Until recently our Governor of the European Investment Bank was a civil servant.  Recently, I changed the conditions applying to that position because a former Member of the Oireachtas, Professor Hillery, who had excellent qualifications, having had a banking career and acted as consultant for various banks, took up that appointment.  I agree with Deputy McDowell in that I would not like to see positions hogged or held by certain people.  I was fearful that I would be <Col N="984" /> berated in the House for appointing a politician, but I commend the House for not doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the parliamentary commissioner in the United Kingdom.  He is a former civil servant.  I understand our DPP is a former civil servant and that post is held by civil servants in other European countries.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the point that there should be consultation.</P>

It is regrettable that Deputy Mitchell said the only reason Kevin Murphy was appointed to the position is that he could not get another appointment.  Kevin Murphy who probably might have left the Civil Service shortly because his seven year term is up would have had no difficulty in picking up a senior position. There was no financial gain for him in this position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `the Irish thoroughbred horse' means a horse eligible for entry into Wetherby's Thoroughbred Stud Book;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is self explanatory.  The Bill deals with the horse racing industry. We are not talking about the racing of donkeys, ponies or any other equidae. We are talking about the thoroughbred horse racing industry.  In the Bill the Irish thoroughbred horse is referred to, in particular on page 9, line 31; yet in the definition section no attempt has been made to define what we mean by the Irish thoroughbred horse.  To be clear about what the Bill refers to we must have a definition of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  In my amendment I am suggesting the defintion that &ldquo;the Irish thoroughbred horse means a horse eligible for entry into Wetherby's Thoroughbred Stud Book&rdquo;.  If the Minister wishes to define it otherwise I will listen to his suggestion, but a definition of the Irish thoroughbred horse is needed in the definition section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="991" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Doyle's amendment.  The reference to which she referred is contained in section 10 (f) which gives the proposed Authority, as one of its functions, the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  We would all agree with that notion, but it would be useful for the Authority and for everybody else to know exactly what it is promoting. Since our concern &mdash; and I believe the Minister shares this &mdash; is, first, to continue to improve the quality of Irish horses and, second, to further develop the name and reputation of our horses abroad and at home, it would be necessary that the proposed Authority has a clear term of reference in this regard. The best way of making that clear is to give a proper definition in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish thoroughbred horse is internationally recognised. Thoroughbred horses bred in Ireland or in the UK are registered in a general stud book covering both countries and that has been the case since 1791.  The stud book is maintained by Wetherby's and the registration process for Irish breeders is carried out by a subsidiary of that company.</P>
      <P>The definition proposed by Deputy Doyle is incorrect in so far as the general stud book maintained by Wetherby's also includes non-thoroughbred horses.  I must oppose this amendment on the basis that it is unnecessary.  The phrase &ldquo;Irish thoroughbred horse&rdquo; is used only once in the Bill and in a general way regarding the marketing and promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  It is sufficient that what we are talking about is generally recognised.  If it would be helpful, I have no difficulty in asking the new Authority to define the Irish thoroughbred horse in a more clear way for the purposes of the promotion function given to it under this Bill, if it wishes to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister read my amendment, but he treated me to a lecture on how one registers thoroughbred horses.  I am aware of that process and I agree with the Minister. But my amendment actually refers to &ldquo;a <Col N="992" /> horse eligible for entry into Wetherby's Thoroughbred Stud Book&rdquo; which distinguishes from the non-thoroughbred section of Wetherby's, of which I am well aware.  I do not understand the Minister's reply in view of the wording in my amendment.</P>
      <P>There may be better wording which could be used to define an Irish thoroughbred horse, but if one of the main functions of the Bill is to promote the Irish thoroughbred horse &mdash; and there is no definition anywhere in the Bill as to what we mean by an Irish thoroughbred horse &mdash; this represents a serious defect in the Bill.  There are other boards, interim and otherwise, dealing with horses in Ireland. A board which is being chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley, of which the Minister will be aware, is currently dealing with another section of the horse industry which is generally referred to as sport horses.  There is a definition of what we regard as a sport horse and I am asking the Minister to distinguish clearly, in relation to a Racing Authority for thoroughbred horses, and to define what we mean by Irish thoroughbred horses. This is an easy requirement for the Minister to concede and it is necessary also to make complete sense of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that it should be left to the Authority to decide what it considers to be an Irish thoroughbred horse.  I have no doubt it could come up with an appropriate definition, but I believe the completeness of this Bill needs that definition included in the definition section.  The Minister suggested it might be superfluous to include such a definition.  But there are other matters in the definition section that to the initiated would be superfluous also, yet the Minister chooses to define them.  I will not go into those in detail but, for example, there is a definition of a levy and &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is defined as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and I could give other examples also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not long ago in this House I requested that a definition for &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; be included in a particular Bill and I was told quite clearly on that occasion by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy <Col N="993" /> Smith, that any idiot &mdash; the Minister used more parliamentary language than that &mdash; would know which Minister was being referred to.  The Minister is basically saying that any idiot knows what type of horse is being referred to.  He finds it necessary to define that it is he, the Minister, that deals with this Bill and I suggest to him that anyone should be able to work that out.  If one applies the same logic, the definition of the Irish thoroughbred horse should be included in the definition section.  If the Minister is prepared to consider the matter between now and Report Stage, I would accept that.  If the Minister feels my amendment is weak in any way I would be pleased to accept any wording of the Minister's as long as he accepts the principle of including a definition of the Irish thoroughbred horse in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reflect on the meaning of what he has apparently just read from his brief?  The Minister said there was no need for a definition of the thoroughbred horse because everybody knows what it is and in the next breath he said he would be quite happy to ask the Authority to give a clearer definition of a thoroughbred horse. Which statement are we to believe?  I think we should believe the second statement, because the Minister has conceded that it would help clarity if the Authority had a clearer definition of a thoroughbred horse.</P>
      <P>It would be much more of a help to clarify if that definition was written into the Bill.  If the Minister is prepared to ask the authority to come up with a definition, why will he not put that into the Bill?  If the Minister feels that the matter is sufficiently important to ask the Authority to do it, then by definition it is sufficiently important to include it in the definition section of the Bill.  In doing that the Minister would not be conceding anything.  He would help clarify the Bill which in a few places lacks clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disingenuous for the Minister to say everyone knows what a thoroughbred horse means.  We all know that an elephant is a pachyderm, but not all pachyderms <Col N="994" /> are elephants.  We all know what a thoroughbred horse is not, but it is a little more difficult to define what it is. Since there is a widely known and universally accepted definition of a thoroughbred horse and classification of horses that we regard as thoroughbred, why not use that in a Bill designed to set up an Authority, one of whose functions will be to promote the Irish thoroughbred horse?  I cannot see how inserting that definition in the Bill would do damage. There would be advantage in doing so, as the Minister has implicitly recognised. We should insert a suitable definition and if he does not like the one proposed by Deputy Doyle he should bring in a more precise one on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `licensed racecourse' means a racecourse which is licensed by the Racing Regulatory Body under the Rules of Racing;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Turf Club have understood this for 200 years.  It is superfluous. I object to it being included.  It makes no sense.  We need not spend all day on these definitions, but the Minister is being selective about what he considers to be necessary.  For 200 years the Turf Club and those involved in racing have understood what a licensed racecourse is and the logic used to turn down my definition of an Irish thoroughbred horse could be used in the case of this amendment.  The Minister is not being consistent.  I fail to understand why that is so.  There is nothing wrong with this amendment.  It clarifies the matter in the same way as did my amendment.  Can we establish that the Minister is only prepared to accept amendments in his name?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see why the Minister is anxious to include this definition in the Bill, but I agree with Deputy Doyle.  The difference between this definition and that of a thoroughbred horse, which the Minister mulishly will not accept, is that <Col N="997" /> this one is necessary in order to put in place the bureaucratic structures provided for in the Bill and to allow moneys to be charged for various purposes.  The Minister, in keeping with the Government's general approach to such matters, is quite prepared to have detailed definitions where they are necessary to implement the bureaucratic nonsense contained in this and other Bills.  He is prepared to have definitions which clarify matters and put them beyond doubt when there is a question of charging people money; but when a definition is required solely to clarify the matter, the Minister does not see a need for it.  That approach is symptomatic of the way the Bill is framed and of how the Government goes about its work.</P>

Did the Minister discuss with his party his ruling out of a form of racing that many have enjoyed over the years?  There may be justification for doing so, but lest what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill be slid under the carpet, does he have party support for these measures?  What are the Minister's views on flapper meetings and the reasons they developed over the years? Is there room in the future for flapper meetings?</P>

      <Col N="998" /> In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following definition:</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 7, after &ldquo;day&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Effectively, this amendment would make the definition of a race fixture read: &ldquo;race fixture means the venue and the day or days of a race meeting.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 6 proposes to delete the remainder of the present definition &mdash;&ldquo;where a race meeting lasts for more than one day, each day of the meeting shall be a separate race fixture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We propose to minimise the level of bureaucracy in running race meetings. The Bill proposes to establish a race fixtures sub-committee of the new horse racing Authority.  The logic behind deeming each day of a festival meeting as a separate race fixture escapes me.  I would like the race fixtures sub-committee, which should also be the race programme committee, to be in a position to deem a meeting held over a number of days as a single race fixture and deal with it accordingly. This makes sense, would minimise the bureaucracy and level of interference and reduce the work.  The prize money and other matters which have to be considered could be discussed in the context of the different race programmes for each day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would have the effect of leading to <Col N="999" /> some confusion in this area.  At present the Turf Club and Racing Board regard each day of racing as a race fixture and a group of race fixtures as a race meeting. For example, each day of the week long Galway race meeting is regarded as a race fixture.  The term &ldquo;race meeting&rdquo; is used in a futuristic sense in section 38 which refers to something which may or may not happen.  A race fixture is one definite date which has been allocated, and this term has been used by the Turf Club and Racing Board for many years. If I was to change that definition now it could lead to much confusion.  I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to section 38 but I do not think he referred to the correct section.  I would like him to explain his statement that the term &ldquo;race meeting&rdquo; is used in the Bill in a futuristic sense &mdash; it is either a race meeting or not or a race fixture or not.  It is all very well for the Minister to read, po-faced, a statement about the present position &mdash; we all know what it is &mdash; but we are concerned about what will be put in its place, which, under sections 19 and 20 will be a fairly hefty piece of bureaucracy. It is proposed under section 19 to set up a race fixtures committee while it is proposed under section 20 to set up a race programme committee.  These committees will be set up under the aegis of the new Authority.  We are not talking about the present arrangements, the involvement of the Turf Club, etc., we are concerned about what will happen under the new Authority which the Minister proposes will have at least two separate committees under its aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These committees will be different in that the race fixtures committee will have a chairman who shall be both a member of the Authority and a steward of the racing regulatory body, one steward of the racing regulatory body, two representatives of authorised racecourses and three other members representative of the horse racing industry, while the race programme committee will be established by the Authority after consultation <Col N="1000" /> with the racing regulatory body &mdash; this consultation is not required in the case of the race fixtures committee &mdash; and it may include persons who are not members of the Authority.  The procedures for the two committees are different.</P>
    <P>If one looks at this issue from the point of view of the punter, trainer or owner, two committees will have an input in deciding the kind of event which will be held, the number of races and the number of days over which they will be held. Nobody in his right mind can tell me that when setting up a new Authority one must establish two committees, one of which will include people who are not necessarily members of the Authority and who will decide whether there should be a one, two or three day meeting and the number of races in the different classes which should be held.  This comes back to my earlier point about the Government's obsession with bureaucracy. For the life of me I cannot understand why an Authority which will have the kind of functions set out in the Bill should solemnly set up two committees to decide the days on which races will take place in a given place and the types of races which will be held.  Anyone with even half a head will understand that two solemnly set up committees are not required to decide all these matters.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me correctly, the Minister told us that one of the purposes of the Bill was to streamline the procedures and administration of racing. One does not streamline something by sticking another excrescence on top of it, which the Minister is proposing in this case.  For his information, streamlining means removing obstacles which impede the airflow and reduce the speed at which the object passes through the atmosphere. He will not facilitate the passage of this yoke through the atmosphere by adding the excrescence of another committee. If he reads sections 19 and 20 he will immediately see that the jobs to be carried out by the two committees could very easily, quite handily and in a properly streamlined manner be carried out by one committee operating under the aegis of this Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I invite the Minister to reconsider our amendments.  Why do we have to repeat everything that was done in the past and propose in what is supposed to be a streamlining Bill the setting up of two committees?  I do not understand why the Minister is being so obstinate about this issue.  The job set out under section 19 could be carried out just as easily by one committee as by two.  Our amendment which proposes that each event, regardless of whether it lasts for one, two or three days, shall be regarded as the one event will tidy things up and remove some of the nonsense, mystery and bureaucracy in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a member of a party which is supposed to like to do things in a convenient, smart and sometimes glib way.  However, it has delivered itself over entirely, handed itself up hand and foot, to the bureaucratic apparatchiks of the Labour Party which loves committees and extra bodies.  It is surrounded by advisers, programme managers, assistants, brothers, sisters, aunties and uncles and cannot move anywhere without being advised on where to go, and it is now doing exactly the same thing to the Minister's party.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since the Minister, who is so laid back about all these matters, had to be invited by the IFA to look at the disadvantaged areas in West Cork; he is so streamlined he did not know where the disadvantaged areas were in his constituency.  Now he wants to burden himself with committees, rules and bureaucrats.  It is because the Minister has sold out, because he has bound himself hand and foot to the bureaucrats in the Labour Party &mdash; who would not be able to enjoy a race meeting if they were paid to do so &mdash; that they are all so worried about this being done in accordance with the proper canons of Marx.  The Minister should forget all that stuff, get rid of all the extra nonsense being put into this Bill and accept this amendment.  Let us all clearly understand once and for all that, when we talk about the Galway Races, it is one event even if it lasts for three days; that when we talk about the Listowel <Col N="1002" /> Races, it is one event, not a series of different fixtures.  The people in the racing industry would thank the Minister for doing so.</P>

      <P>I will not avail of this debate to engage in political point scoring. I take a different view from Deputy Dukes.  I suspect that, as we go through the various sections of this Bill, I shall be taking sharply contrasting views from his. It is not fair to say that bureaucracy in the racing industry amounts to even a fraction of what it is in the political arena, a ploy of all political parties is the establishment of committees and commissions to investigate matters, thereby putting them on the long finger.</P>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill because its provisions focus on the horse breeding industry in which we can compete with the best worldwide.  Everybody connected with it can take a bow.  For generations Irish jockeys have distinguished themselves, particularly in the national hunt field.</P>
      <P>While deploring bureaucracy in any walk of life a certain amount is needed in the racing industry.  What is undoubtedly needed is a fixtures committee, an aspect of racing long regarded as chaotic.  Representing a small town like Dundalk, with a small, struggling racecourse, we look askance at the allocation of lucrative fixtures to the Curragh, Leopardstown, Galway, Listowel and other areas.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's remarks on this amendment. It involves the definition of a &ldquo;starting price licence&rdquo; being added to what is effectively a new section 33 by an amendment to section 33.  In the context of the Minister's amendment to section 33 we need to accept it.  We should put on the record the need to nationalise starting prices, a point we have almost reached. It seems an amazing arena within which the Civil Service should become involved, in a semi-State authority.  I know there is confusion at present between two different systems.  Will the Minister explain why he feels it necessary to considerably amend, as he proposes later, section 33, thereby making sense <Col N="1005" /> of this definition?  We need to accept the definition, the overall concept of a &ldquo;starting price licence&rdquo;; in other words, having the Civil Service running the starting price system.

Any part of the racing press one cares to read will show that, despite the Minister's best efforts, comprising a list of at least three, his options are very narrow and self-selective.

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;62 (5),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 62 (5) reads:</P>
      <P>Any person excluded from a racecourse by virtue of subsection (1) shall comply with the exclusion notice.</P>

      <P>The authority or the Racing Regulatory Body, may exclude by notice ... a person from being either</P>
      <P>(a) on any authorised racecourse, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is going too far.  Other amendments in my name, and that of Deputy Dukes, show that the authority being given to exclude people from racecourses is too open and handed over too freely.  Several amendments refer to the use of gardaí in the event of someone having to be removed from a racecourse.  We do not want to return to the position of having bouncers on the turnstiles at racecourses. <Col N="1007" /> It would be like what nightclubs and discos have to do.  Will the Minister explain what he has in mind?</P>
    <P>A person who is causing a nuisance, breaking the law or spoiling other people's pleasure and enjoyment at racecourses should be asked to leave by a garda and escorted off the racecourse.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind to escort such people from a racecourse. A person who gets drunk and is disorderly is a nuisance and spoils other people's enjoyment.  They should be asked to leave and be escorted off by a garda on duty.  To say they shall be guilty of a summary offence is going a little too far.  Will the Minister explain what he proposes?  Will he bear in mind several other amendments we have tabled in relation to this type of difficulty at a racecourse? The deletion of section 62 (5) relates to the case we are trying to make in the handling of those who are out of order at a racecourse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to delete from the list of summary offences the section which requires a person who has been issued with an exclusion notice by the Authority or the regulatory body to exclude him or her from a racecourse to comply with that notice.  I cannot accept this amendment because there would be little point in giving the Authority the power to exclude someone from a racecourse if, when it is not complied with, there is no action that can be taken.  This action of excluding someone would be very rare and would be a necessary last resort and control which would be accepted by most reasonable people.  That provision was contained in the 1945 Act.  Before this fairly drastic action would be taken a person would have to cause tremendous problems at a racecourse, or racecourses, and upset other people's enjoyment.  A letter would have to be sent to the person and the racecourse authority.  Most people go to racecourses for enjoyment but if a person, or persons, decide to upset their enjoyment there comes a time when the Authority and the racecourse concerned <Col N="1008" /> would be entitled to exclude them from the racecourse and have the offence listed as a summary offence.</P>

      <P>I am not opposed to that requirement.  In recent years at English race meetings there were unsavoury incidents where groups of people caused much disruption to racing.  Is that what the Minister has in mind or is he considering a more sinister element?  For example, has he in mind a person who may be suspected of doping horses or being involved in the doping of horses, which is a serious offence?  The Garda Síochána, as Deputy Doyle suggested, are capable of dealing with unruly behaviour.  Does the Minister consider that people who are regarded by the racing authorities as unsavoury should be excluded from racing?  If that is so I commend him.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister.  The problem may be exaggerated by this debate.  I do not see this as being a regular occurrence in Ireland but we are aware of incidents where undesirable people were no longer welcome at race tracks throughout Britain.  It is important that the Authority should have the power to ban those people from meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind the person, or persons, who create a nuisance and upset people who want a day's or evening's enjoyment at a race fixture.  If they persist in causing upset the Authority should be entitled to take action. There are several ways people can cause upset, one of which is hanging around boxes and interfering with horses.  People may interfere with the running of a race, or races, as we have seen in the past.  It would only be in an extreme case, and after the people had been written to, that this action would be taken.  I do not envisage the Authority or the managements of racecourses taking this action except on rare occasions.  This provision, which was contained in the 1945 Act, is a precaution worth having in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>How many times has the power under the 1945 Act been invoked? How many people per annum, or in the past 50 years, have been served with exclusion orders of this kind?  I suspect the Minister is not in a position to tell us because it happens so infrequently.  What worries us, not because we have any predisposition against the Authority or that we would wish the Authority not to be in a position to run its affairs and to have racecourses run their affairs in a proper and orderly manner, is that a power is being given to an authority to take a course of action which, if people do not agree with it, renders them liable to prosecution. Failure to comply with an exclusion order will be a summary offence and people can be fined.  The fines in the Bill are not particularly light.</P>
      <P>We are handing over to what are essentially private authorities, the authorised racecourse owners, power to take action which will result in other people becoming summarily liable under the law.  As a general rule I do not like that manner of proceeding.  I understand people can make themselves obnoxious at racecourses or at other public gatherings in a number of different ways.  We need to be on our guard about that; we have the Garda Síochána to deal with such matters.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister has not answered the questions put by Deputy McGahon. Under later sections a racing regulatory body has, as I am sure Deputy McGahon has noticed from his detailed perusal of the Bill, the power to charge for the provision of security services.  I assume that the kind of security service the racing regulatory body should be offering to racecourses is advice and assistance on how to keep people who may be interfering with horses in one way or another away from them.  That however is a separate matter.  If this Bill is passed, the racing regulatory authority will have the power to charge racecourses for these services.  I do not disagree with this principle. The matter should be dealt with in the way suggested by Deputy McGahon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like the idea that we should give to private individuals the power to <Col N="1010" /> take a certain course of action which may render other people summarily liable under the law.  It is not a good argument that this power was given in the 1945 Act because, with all due respect to those who legislated in 1945, they did not necessarily hold the same view of civil liberties.  It is an even worse argument that the powers under that Act have been used rarely.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this matter.  I do not like the idea that we should give private individuals or interests the power to take a certain course of action which may make other people summarily liable under the law when we have the Garda Síochána to do the job for us.  Deputy Doyle has highlighted our other fear in this regard.</P>
    <P>Our racecourses are well run and are places where people can enjoy themselves. I would hate to see them develop a tendency of employing their own bouncers, as is the case in the drinking joints in Leeson Street, where bouncers decide who should be allowed to enter, I presume on the directions of the boss of the establishment, and who occasionally have turned out to be, as we are all aware, a violent breed of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know, from the Turf Club or the Racing Board, if any people are currently proscribed from entering race tracks?  As Deputy Dukes said, he did not reply to my question.  The threat of doping at race tracks is a serious matter because of the danger posed to the jockey, the racehorse and the unfortunate punter who may have a bet on that racehorse.  The Minister should address this matter in a meaningful way.  Is there available to the Department a list of people who are not allowed enter racecourses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have such a list or know the actual number of people who have been prosecuted under the 1945 Act.  Problems have been encountered. In our consultations with the industry it made it clear that there was a requirement for this provision for a number of reasons.  I thought I had addressed the matter raised by Deputy McGahon of <Col N="1011" /> people gaining access to stables and boxes at racecourses and interfering with racehorses.  It would be intolerable if the new Authority was not in a position to take any action other than warn the people involved if they refuse to leave the area or return to perpetrate the same offence.  This power will be used rarely and only after the Authority has communicated with the people concerned in writing.  This power is necessary and for that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment.  Because of an amendment to section 59 dealing with racecourse authorisations it is necessary to amend the reference in section 6 to the offence.  Under section 59 the offence will now be against subsection (6) rather than subsection (1).</P>

      <P>Section 59 (1) would make it an offence to operate any kind of racecourse without authorisation.  It is <Col N="1012" /> almost impossible to define &ldquo;racecourse&rdquo; as there are many types in existence. Some, like Laytown, operate on a beach with few or no facilities, while others have elaborate structures.  To make it an offence to operate any racecourse without authorisation would automatically make flapper meetings illegal.  Deputy Doyle made reference to such meetings earlier.</P>

The Authority will therefore ignore the few inconsequential flapper meetings, but if somebody wishes to build a major racecourse beside an existing racecourse to the detriment of the industry, the Authority may require such an unauthorised racecourse not to operate as an official racecourse.</P>

    <P>The Joint Declaration provides a basis <Col N="1018" /> for agreement by the people of Ireland, North and South, that from now on their differences can be negotiated and resolved exclusively by peaceful political means.</P>
    <P>There can be no vestige of justification for the taking of a single further life.  The overwhelming majority of Irish people of all traditions wish to see an end to the violence which is poisoning the life-blood of this island and blighting the prospects for the present and future generations.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the Republican movement know the decided views of the Irish people in this matter.  I cannot say how they will respond.  Actions, rather than words, will give the true measure of their intentions.  The continuing campaign of violence makes its own statement which no amount of theorizing can disguise.</P>
    <P>A positive response to the Joint Declaration, in the only form that counts, namely a permanent end to violence, is long overdue.  To defer it until after the European elections is disdainful of the lives that may be lost in the meantime.  I would also have thought that the voters who are being canvassed by Sinn Féin in the European elections deserve to be told where Sinn Féin stand on this crucially relevant issue.</P>
    <P>Mr. Molyneaux has addressed a message to the Loyalist paramilitaries to end their violence.  I welcome it wholeheartedly and wish that other Unionist politicians would follow his lead.</P>
    <P>The two Governments made it clear that no single group, least of all paramilitary groups, can have a veto on political progress.  We are working on a framework to relaunch political dialogue and to guide it towards a successful outcome. We hope that those in both communities who currently support the use of violence will take the decisive step required to be represented at that table. It is clear that the prospects of success will be greatly enhanced if the two Governments can define a common approach to the key issues as a basis for discussion around the table with the other participants.  We are, therefore, engaged in intensive consideration of the scope <Col N="1019" /> which exists for the formulation of a joint approach.</P>
    <P>The issues which we are addressing are, of course, profound and complex and require the most careful consideration. While useful progress has been made in the discussions to date, significant work remains to be done on a number of matters which will be essential components of any future agreement.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State and I reviewed the progress which has been made when we met last week.  We agreed to return to this matter at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, which will take place shortly.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Major also took stock at their meeting in Downing Street last week.</P>
    <P>The two Governments hope to bring these discussions to a conclusion at the earliest possible date, and ideally within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>When a Framework Document has been agreed, we will need to give joint consideration at that point to the use we might make of it in our contacts with the other potential participants and to how the results of our work might be made public in an appropriate way in due course.</P>
    <P>The definitive abandonment of the use, or support, of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people. It is also a precondition for participation in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The manner in which a permanent end to violence could be established and verified, and the other practical consequences of a permanent cessation of violence, would be matters for decision at a later stage in the light of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that discussions aimed at the achievement of agreement on internal structures in Northern Ireland in advance of discussion of the wider relationships involved would have any greater prospect of success now than they had during the numerous failed attempts to do so in the past.  No progress can be made on the basis of a selective approach <Col N="1020" /> which focuses on one of the three key relationships to the detriment of the other two.</P>
    <P>I am ready, as always, to discuss with Mr. Molyneaux and other Unionist leaders any aspect of the search for political progress.  They are fully aware of the value which I attach to direct personal dialogue and I hope that they will take up the long-standing invitation which I have extended to them in this respect.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and <Col N="1021" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to take Questions Nos. 3, 5 and 10 among others together.  I ask the Tánaiste for fair and honest answers to the questions set out in Question No. 10.  Is it necessary for the participation of Sinn Féin in political talks that the IRA should permanently give up violence?  Will he state his views on whether it is necessary that the IRA should undertake any form of verifiable disarmament or whether it is possible for Sinn Féin to participate in the talks and in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation while the IRA retains its arms and explosives?  I must have a fair, unequivocal and decent minded answer to these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best and I hope I meet the standards set by Deputy Michael McDowell for a fair, decent-minded unequivocal answer.  The key to Sinn Féin-IRA being part of the political discussions is a permanent cessation of violence.  It has to be permanent and there can be no equivocation about that. There will have to be verification of the handing over of arms.  As I said publicly on many occasions, there is little point in attempting to bring people into political dialogue if they are doing so on the basis of giving it a try and if it does not work returning to the bomb and the bullet.  It has to be permanent and there must be evidence of it.  The details of verification are obviously a logistics matter that will have to be worked out and agreed by both Governments.  I assure the Deputy that neither Government will attempt to bring them into discussions and dialogue until they are satisfied that the violence has ended permanently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Tánaiste is trying to meet me some way along the road but he is not meeting me half way.  I ask again whether it is possible for Sinn Féin to participate in talks and in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation while the IRA retains arms and explosives and whether it is necessary as a precondition for demonstrating a complete commitment to the end of violence that some verifiable process <Col N="1022" />&mdash; I am not asking for a formal disarmament ceremony &mdash; is in place?  I ask the Tánaiste to say clearly that a precondition is an absolute and unequivocal statement by the IRA that the violence is over and that their arms and explosives are being dumped or destroyed, with a verifiable mechanism to ensure that has been done.</P>

      <P>I am not sure he is as I am answering the question as directly as it can be answered.  The Joint Declaration makes it very clear on behalf of both Governments that democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to use exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown they abide by the democratic process are free to participate fully in democratic politics. There will obviously have to be a precise means of establishing the commitment to use exclusively peaceful methods and that obviously has to be decided and agreed by both Governments.  There can be no participation by Sinn Féin-IRA in political discussions with either Government until they have made a very firm commitment that the violence has ended.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the new political framework must be based on consent.  Has he decided how to discern that consent?  How will he discover whether the people of Northern Ireland consent to the framework to be implemented?  How can he say a political settlement is based on a forswearing of violence if the verification of such forswearing is simply a logistics matter? Does he believe that paramilitary displays of the type we saw in Dublin city and Finglas are consistent with a forswearing of violence by the IRA?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>To establish the consent principle in Northern Ireland means getting the consent of the greater majority of the people in Northern Ireland to any proposed settlement.  That can be done by way of referendum.  Discussions would take place with the political parties who represent the public and a referendum could take place to establish the consent principle.  There are two aspects to the establishment of the ending of violence. One would be a political statement.  I assume this would be followed by a verification process which would be the responsibility of both Governments.  I would view that as logical.  I would find any paramilitary displays, like that which <Col N="1024" /> took place in Dublin, objectionable.  If the law is broken responsibility lies with the Garda Síochána and the DPP to prosecute people.</P>

The House has been helpful in this regard for a long time.  All parties have adopted a helpful attitude in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 13, 19, 30, 37 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>On 5 May, in the Adjournment Debate, I set out the main lines of the Government's response to the horrific slaughter under way in Rwanda since the killings of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in April.  On 24 May the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, outlined to the House the action taken or supported by the Government in pursuit of this policy, at the United Nations, in the European Union and bilaterally.  Those include an examination, at my initiative, of the position by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 16 May; a review by the Security Council of the size of the UN force in Rwanda; an investigation by the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights; an emergency meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights; the imposition of a UN arms embargo; an evaluation visit by the Troika of EU Development Ministers and an increase in EU assistance.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is at present on a mission to the region to assess the political and humanitarian position for the Government. He is visiting refugee camps in Tanzania as well as camps for displaced persons in Rwanda.  He is having talks directly with Rwandan parties and with the authorities in neighbouring countries. He will report to the Government on his return today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict in Rwanda has resulted in an unprecedented human rights tragedy. We are aware of its dimensions &mdash; up to half a million people may have been killed; millions have been forced to flee their homes to seek refuge elsewhere in <Col N="1027" /> Rwanda or in neighbouring countries, and disease and hunger threaten their lives.  Faced with this, Ireland was one of the first countries to press for greater co-ordinated action within the European Union and at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>On 17 May the UN Security Council authorised an increase in the UN force in Rwanda, UNAMIR, up to a level of 5,500 troops.  It also expanded UNAMIR's mandate to include the provision of safe conditions for displaced persons in Rwanda and the protection of humanitarian organisations.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a ceasefire and the agreement of the two sides to the UN's presence would greatly facilitate an effective UN operation.  To this end the UN Secretary-General has sent his special envoy and chief military adviser to Rwanda to consult the parties on all aspects of UNAMIR's expanded mandate. These talks are under way in Kigali and I understand that some progress has been made on the principle of a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the UN Secretary-General is actively seeking troop contributions to the expanded forces.  I understand that he has contacted several countries in Africa and outside.  Ireland has not been approached by the UN.  I have said that requests from the UN for Irish participation in peacekeeping operations are considered on a case-by-case basis.  If an approach were made by the UN in connection with the Rwandan operation it would receive very careful consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>An end to the killings and the establistment of the UN force are an immediate priority, but for the longer term stability of the country it will be necessary for the people of Rwanda to agree on the governance of the country and on the creation of the necessary institutions. Our political goal must therefore be a reactivation of the Arusha peace process.</P>
    <P>On the human rights front, Ireland called at an early stage for a special session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  This met in Geneva on 24 and 25 May.  Although Ireland is not a member of the commission, the Irish delegation <Col N="1028" /> participated actively in the European Union's contribution to the special session.</P>
    <P>The human rights commission adopted unanimously a strongly-worded and comprehensive resolution which was cosponsored by Ireland.  The resolution called for the appointment of a special <i>rapporteur</i> to investigate at first hand the situation of human rights in Rwanda.  It welcomed the recent visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Lasso, to Rwanda.  It requested him to make available a team of human rights field officers to assist the special <i>rapporteur.</i></P>
    <P>The special <i>rapporteur</i> is to visit Rwanda immediately and to report to the commission.  His report will be made available to the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and the UN Economic and Social Council.  Ireland will continue to press in these fora for effective action by the UN to prevent further human rights abuses in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated £500,000 to date for emergency assistance for the Rwandan crises.  We are prepared to provide further financial support for humanitarian relief for Rwandan refugees in the neighbouring states and for victims of the conflict who remain within Rwanda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has told us on numerous occasions &mdash; other Deputies and I have raised this issue many times &mdash; that he gave full support for a review of the UN Security Council Resolution which resulted in Resolution 918 on 16 May, will he agree that rather than wait for an approach to be made, we should offer troops for a humanitarian exercise in Rwanda as this would set an example to other EU countries who seem to be slow to send troops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From the answers to previous questions and discussions, the Deputy is aware of the procedures in relation to United Nations troops.  Irish troops will not be sent unless they are requested by the United Nations Secretary <Col N="1029" /> General.  A request is made after consideration of the type of operation, the logistics and other details from a military point of view.  The matter comes before the Government.  My Department considers the foreign policy aspect, the Department of Defence considers the military aspects and then the Government makes a decision.  No request has been received.  It would not be consistent with our participation in the United Nations to offer troops if the United Nations has not made a decision in relation to wanting Irish troops and the type of force they want in that area.  We must wait for the UN to contact us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that that attitude could be taken by all members of the UN and that nothing will be done in the face of the most tragic humanitarian disaster since Cambodia; that by sitting back and not taking positive steps, he is adding to the tragedy that has happened in Rwanda?  I ask him again to informally talk to the UN and indicate that he would be willing to help.  There are 80 Irish troops in Somalia in logistics doing a very valuable job.  Surely we can send troops to Rwanda to assist in all the new efforts that are allowable under Mandate 918 &mdash; provide security and support for the distribution of relief and contribute to the security and protection of displaced persons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>An International Conference on Population and Development will be held in Cairo on 5-13 September 1994 at which Ireland will be represented, almost certainly at ministerial level.  A final decision on the composition of the delegation will be taken nearer the date of the conference.</P>
      <P>The links between demographic factors and sustainable development are now accepted by all developed and developing countries, with many of the latter adopting population programmes which include family planning components. Population policy is essentially a national responsibility which should be supported by the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our view that action in this area should be based on the principles of non-coercion <Col N="1031" /> and non-discrimination; that there should be respect for ethnic and cultural differences; and that all population programmes must respect the rights of individuals and couples to choose the number and spacing of their children.</P>
    <P>The recent Preparatory Conference on Population and Development in New York made useful progress on a number of important issues.  Agreement was reached on much of the language of the draft action plan that will be adopted in Cairo.  A number of issues on which no agreement was possible will go to Cairo. These include levels of funding and reproductive health matters, including abortion.</P>
    <P>I consider that population assistance is a necessary component of Ireland's overseas development assistance programme, having regard to the dramatic rate of population growth in developing countries, particularly in Africa.  For this reason Ireland made a contribution for the first time in 1993 to the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, an organisation established by the United Nations to provide assistance in the field of population.  This organisation runs extensive campaigns and assistance programmes in Africa, Asia and Latin America with developing countries which request its advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>The contribution which we made to UNFPA in 1993 was £50,000.  This was about 0.1 per cent of our total overseas development assistance in 1993.  Our contribution to UNFPA will be increased to £150,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The question of whether Ireland will become more directly involved in population issues is being considered in the context of the expansion of the bilateral aid programme over the next four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply as far as it goes.  However, as world population is increasing by 0.25 million people every day and 90 per cent of that increase takes place in the Third World in the poorest of the developing <Col N="1032" /> countries, does the Minister agree that at least 4 per cent &mdash; this is a figure set down by many of the non-governmental organisations worldwide &mdash; of all official overseas development aid should now be targeted at population programmes?  The Minister might have some difficulty with his Government partners because this means funding family planning in these countries as the rates of population growth in those countries far outstrip their ability to sustain them.  Can the Minister give us a guarantee that, as part of our overseas development policy in the future, he will seek to reach a figure of 4 per cent of all overseas development aid going towards this area of population control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's fears about rapid population growth.  In sub-Saharan Africa the present population is expected to double by the year 2015 and that will put enormous pressure on resources.  That was recognised at the Earth Summit in Rio De Janeiro in 1992 where it was agreed that all future development strategies must take account of demographic trends.  I will not give the Deputy a guarantee on the percentage without giving it further examination, which I will do and come back to the Deputy.  However, I assure the Deputy that there will be no difficulty in Government about assistance from our aid programme for family planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 16, 20 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are in favour of measures to enhance the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland and consider that an enforceable Bill of rights would provide valuable guarantees to members of both communities that their basic rights were protected from legislative or executive abuse.</P>
      <P>In February 1987 detailed proposals for a Bill of rights for Northern Ireland were put forward by the then Government in the Anglo-Irish Conference. Since then the matter has been pursued on a regular basis at meetings of the conference, most recently at that held in May 1994.  It has also been the subject of ongoing discussion at official level in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
      <P>In these exchanges successive Irish Governments have made clear their support for the introduction of a Bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  They have also drawn attention to the case made in its favour by all constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland and by bodies such as the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and the Committee on the Administration of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The British response has been that they are not yet convinced of the need for a Bill of rights but are open to further discussion of the matter and will keep it under review.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the question of a Bill of rights is one of the issues which would be particularly appropriate for consideration in fresh talks aimed at a balanced and comprehensive political settlement of the problem of Northern Ireland.  In this context I welcome Sir Patrick Mayhew's observation that one possible feature of a political accommodation might well be some form of entrenchment of human rights.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced, however, that in current circumstances it would be productive or appropriate to call talks between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland to consider the question of a Bill of rights in isolation.  I feel that consideration of this issue would be most fruitful in the context of negotiation of an overall settlement building on the Joint Declaration.  This could also facilitate its secure entrenchment against subsequent alteration or repeal.  Moreover, while there is general support among the constitutional parties for the principle of a Bill of rights, it is likely that securing agreement on its scope and method of enforcement would be complex and difficult and best approached within the context of wider negotiations where a Bill of rights would be clearly seen as a complement to, and not as a substitute for, the other elements appropriate to a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  This appears to have been discussed now for over six years and as recently as last month.  I would not like to think that it is being held over as a prize to be given to the parties in the North for coming to conclusions on other matters but that the Bill of rights stands on its own merits and should be proceeded with anyway.  Does the Minister agree that a Bill of rights could also be considered for this part of the country and that this might give some assurance to communities in the North who might <Col N="1035" /> otherwise feel apprehensive about any agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to keep the question of a Bill of rights high on the agenda.  I regard a Bill of rights as extremely important.  It may not be the ultimate panacea but I would see it as an element of a balanced and comprehensive accommodation.  I do not see it being held over as a prize to be ultimately given if we arrive at a more comprehensive settlement.  I can only give a personal view because this matter has not been considered by Government, but I would have no difficulty about having a Bill of rights for this part of the country as well.  We are always seeking change from others; we too must demonstrate that we are prepared to make changes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be widened in scope to include discrimination, control of emergency powers, protection of communal rights.  I see it as being as wide and as deep as possible.  A Bill of rights could be developed in the course of discussion.  It would be a new and desirable element and the ultimate aim is that in terms of political rights and identities its scope would be as wide as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that on a Bill of rights there are two broad avenues of approach: first, as Deputy Barry seems to suggest, to secure it as a preliminary step and, second, to secure it as part of an overall integrated constitutional framework for Northern Ireland?  Will the Minister also agree it is desirable in the context of examining a future settlement for Northern Ireland to envisage a covenant, to use his terms, or a written constitution for Northern Ireland into which the enforcement mechanism <Col N="1036" /> for such a chapter of human rights would be built, with the equivalent of a court system to enforce those rights?  Will the Minister further agree that to deal with human rights in isolation is fruitless?  We need an overall settlement in which the people from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland have institutions and a constitution with which they have an affinity, and a court system which would enforce their rights.  I agree with the Minister that if both parts of this island could agree on a set of human rights outlined in tabular form, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, it would be well accomplished to incorporate it in constitutional law both North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there would be little point in having a Bill of rights unless the institutions are in place to offer protection. If we could achieve institutions in Northern Ireland that would have the support of both communities, we would make a great deal of progress.  One of the basic weaknesses in Northern Ireland is lack of support from both communities for institutions.  I previously spoke about a covenant and said that I envisage a covenant of rights and guarantees which would be capable of being applied, by agreement, to every part of this island and every aspect of the relationship between these islands.  I see it as providing an assurance for all time to every citizen on this island that basic political rights, including political identities, can be enshrined to ensure that, even if there are changes, constitutional or otherwise, nothing could undermine them.  The guarantees would have to be protected by institutions.</P>

      <Quest>if the matter of Community financing of common foreign and security policy was discussed at a meeting of the EU General Affairs Council on 21 February 1994; the position Ireland adopted on this issue at the meeting; if the United Kingdom and Denmark dissented from the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The issue of the financing of the operational expenditure for actions taken under the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; was discussed by the Council on 21 February 1994. Under the Maastricht Treaty such expenditure may be financed either from Community sources or in whole or in part by national contributions of member states.</P>
      <P>The Presidency proposal at that Council outlined three possible options as to how operational expenditure for actions under the CFSP might be financed: (i) from the Commission section of the Community budget &mdash; this option found favour with most of the member states, including Ireland; (ii) from the Council section of the Community budget &mdash; Denmark favoured this option; and (iii) from contributions by member states &mdash; the UK favoured this option.</P>
      <P>This matter has been the subject of further discussion, most recently at the May General Affairs Council, on the basis of a paper presented by the Greek Presidency.  The Council also discussed the technical details that would apply if expenditure were to be financed by national contributions of member states.</P>
      <P>All member states have indicated their willingness to accept some form of Community financing for CFSP actions.  This was on the understanding that the Council will retain responsibility for decision-making under the CFSP, as provided for in the Union Treaty.  It was agreed that negotiations should take place with the European Parliament to make the necessary arrangements.</P>

The Deputy's suggestion is worthy of examination and I will discuss it with my ministerial colleague who has operational responsibility in that area.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the reports that thousands of political prisoners are being held in China and of recent disclosures that a previously unknown group of dissidents are being held in prison in Beijing in connection with their role in the Tiananmen <Col N="1041" /> Square clashes in 1989.  These reports are a matter of concern to the Government and we will be taking them up with the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the question of human rights in China has been the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and the Chinese authorities.  In addition, it has been the subject of debate and consideration at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  At the most recent session of the Commission in March the Presidency of the European Union, speaking for all 12 members of the Union, expressed our joint concern that the administration of justice in China does not meet international standards in certain important respects, notably the lack of an independent judiciary, the arbitrary application and widespread use of the death penalty, the denial of rights to defendants, the extensive use of administrative detention and re-education through labour camps, and detention without trial for long periods.</P>
    <P>In a resolution, tabled by the members of the Union, we drew attention to the continuing reports of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China, including torture, and severe restrictions on the rights of freedom of expression, religion, assembly and to a fair trial.  China was successful in moving a no action motion and, consequently, the resolution was not put to a vote.</P>

      <P>Will Ireland be to the forefront in ensuring that, as long as there are infringements of human rights and secret prison camps where thousands of people are engaged in forced labour, China will not be given the respectability it seeks by joining in many international fora such as the World Trade Organisation and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is extremely important that international pressure on the Chinese authorities is maintained in relation to these abuses of human rights which were highlighted in recent weeks in regard to detention and labour camps. I hope to have discussions with the <Col N="1042" /> Chinese later this year and the issue of human rights will be very high on the agenda.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is desirable, following recent television pictures of people being marched to work in plants that export to the west, that the EU should take adequate counter measures to ensure that no economic entity, however defined in China, is in a position to export to the EU any product which was extorted by forced labour in camps?  Will the Minister indicate the measures the Government is taking to ensure there is a comprehensive counter action programme by the EU to ensure that such produce does not appear in our markets and that any bodies in China which are partially participating in such programmes are wholly excluded from any access to western markets?</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that human rights abuses are not new in China.  There have been press reports on this since 1989 and, indeed, before.  We enjoy &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; full diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.  We have an Ambassador from that country in Dublin and I presume that position is reciprocated in Peking.  Will the Minister inform the House whether he or officials of his Department have spoken to the Chinese Ambassador here on human rights abuses in China?  We know also that trade is increasing with the Republic of China; there will be a greater volume of trade this year than last year.  Will the Minister consider raising with the Ambassador this level of trade which is ever increasing in China's favour?  Will he consider linking the issue of trade with that of human rights abuses in China?</P>

I expect to have discussions with the Chinese later this year when I will raise the human rights issue as we understand it.  This has been a matter of concern to the western world for a long time and pressure must be maintained.  Trade is one area where pressure can be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 24, 31, 48 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's overall approach to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia has been, and will continue to be guided by <Col N="1045" /> three essential aims, first, to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict on the basis of the European Union's peace plan; second, to prevent the spread of the conflict and, third, to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims.  Our actions at the United Nations, in the European Union, and bilaterally, have been directed at achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>Since I last reported to the Dál on the situation in the former Yugoslavia there have been some significant developments.</P>
    <P>On 11 May in Vienna the Muslim and Croat parties in Bosnia agreed on a series of measures to enable the new consitutional arrangement agreed in Washington in March to come into effect. These envisage the creation of a Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina which will be associated in a confederal arrangement with Croatia.  The Washington and Vienna agreements brought an end to the heavy fighting between Croat and Muslim forces which had been under way in Bosnia for almost a year, and they pave the way for a settlement that will permit access to the sea &mdash; a key requirement for the people of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>On 13 May Ministers from the European Union, the United States and Russia met in Geneva together with the co-chairmen of the International Conference, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. They confirmed that the conflict in Bosnia cannot be resolved by military means and must be settled through negotiations. They also underlined their support for a settlement that preserves Bosnia as a single union within its internationally recognised borders.  Ministers called upon the parties to conclude a comprehensive cessation of hostilities and an unconditional resumption of serious efforts to reach a political settlement.</P>
    <P>There are some prospects for a general cessation of hostilities.  The Bosnian parties are to meet in Geneva tomorrow, under UN auspices.  The EU, UN, Russia and the US are also working for an early resumption of the negotiations within the framework of the International Conference. <Col N="1046" /> I do not wish, however, to underestimate the difficulties which lie ahead, particularly with regard to the negotiations on territorial issues.  Under the EU's plan, these require the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from almost one-third of the territory which they hold.  The negotiations on the relationship between the Bosnian-Croat Federation and the Bosnian-Serb territories will also be extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the other members of the European Union have condemned ethnic cleansing and rejected it as the basis for a settlement in Bosnia.  The refusal to accept the acquisition of territory by force is a central feature of the European Union's peace plan.  That plan also envisages important and detailed provisions on the protection of human rights and the reversal of ethnic cleansing; the right of refugees and displaced persons freely to return to their homes and the nullification of all statements or commitments made under duress, particularly those relating to the relinquishing of rights to land or property.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that a comprehensive list of human rights instruments will be incorporated in the settlement.  There is provision for ombudsmen to ensure that human dignity, rights or liberties will not be negated, and that ethnic cleansing will not be pursued.  In addition, the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will have a critical role in the prosecution of those who have violated international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>I have seen the most recent issue of <i>Bosnia Report</i> published by the Alliance to Defend Bosnia-Hercegovina which contains a series of articles on various aspects of the Bosnian conflict and proposals for its resolution.  Several of the proposals are already part of Euoprean Union policy and have been acted on, such as raising the siege of Sarajevo and Gorazde, the creation of aid corridors, the opening of Tuzla airport.  Others concerning human rights guarantees, the reversal of ethnic cleansing and the return of displaced persons and property, are central elements in the European Union's plan.  There are several elements <Col N="1047" /> in the proposals which I could not advocate, in particular, the lifting of the arms embargo, the arming of the Bosnian Government and the threat of widespread military intervention.  Such actions would be tantamount to saying to the parties that the international community had given up hope of a negotiated solution. They would spell the end of UNPROFOR and its vital work of humanitarian assistance and could lead to a more intense military conflict involving Serbia itself, with the risk of a spread of fighting elsewhere in the Balkans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that as long as the Serbs continue to shell and bomb their way to the peace table their actions should not be sanitised by allowing them to discuss a peace pact? Does he agree the time has come for the international community to say enough is enough and for sanctions to be increased if they do not cease their genocide of the Bosnian Moslems?  That point will be reached sooner or later and would it not be better if it were reached sooner rather than later when more lives will have been lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to achieve a negotiated settlement to an extremely complex and difficult problem.  We make progress at times only to see it undermined in a matter of days.  The attitude of &mdash; and aggression by &mdash; the Serbs has not been helpful in seeking a resolution of the problem.  The EU has attempted to lead the efforts of the UN, the US and Russia and will continue to do so on the basis of the peace plan which was devised.  Some progress has been made since we last discussed the matter and, despite the difficulties, I am hopeful we will make further progress.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the threat of use of military force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Further sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanctions proved effective where they were applied and it is important that they be maintained at the highest <Col N="1048" /> level.  The threat of air strikes was effective as regards Sarajevo and Mostar.  That was extremely important.  The work done recently by the UN, the US, Russia and the EU most recently in Geneva will be helpful and I hope the meeting which takes place tomorrow will record further progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree in restrospect that he was foolish to concede about four days before the air strikes that they would not be helpful? Regarding the outcome of any possible settlement in Bosnia Hercegovina does he agree that it appears territorial and ethnic issues come ahead of redressing the individual wrongs done?  Would he agree that the notion of having a war crimes tribunal in respect of rape and genocide is being put to one side and it is likely, as a matter of realpolitik, to achieve a settlement that there will be an amnesty in relation to such matters?  Will he indicate the Government's attitude to proposals for such an amnesty and how we propose to ensure in future that those who use genocide and rape as a means of achieving their political ends will not be rewarded in the last analysis with a geographic <i>status quo</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the prosecution of war crimes, I am sure the Deputy is aware that the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violation of international humanitarian law in the territory of former Yugoslavia since 1991 has been established.  It held two sessions in its seat in the Hague, one in November 1993 and one in January-February 1994.  It adopted rules of procedure and evidence and a third session began on 25 April.  The tribunal continues to make the necessary preparations for its future operations tasks such as arrangements for the tribunal, UN detention centre and the translation of evidence.  On 14 April the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution authorising the spending of up to $11 million for the tribunal.  Obviously these matters will have to be pursued.  As the Deputy suggested, I do not see where <Col N="1049" /> people would be allowed to profit or gain from the dreadful and abhorrent acts highlighted in the House during the earlier part of the conflict.  The work must be continued.  Ultimately, it is a question of negotiation in relation to the territories and former Yugoslavia.  Progress has been made in many areas and I am hopeful further progress will be made tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer regarding the war crimes tribunal was fuzzy.  Will he give an undertaking that it is the Government's position that there will not be peace in former Yugoslavia unless it is accompanied by justice? Rather than talking about negotiations in a vague way, it is absolute that we support the prosecution of people involved in the most serious and horrible war crimes the world has seen in recent times and that would form part of any settlement within former Yugoslavia?  Will the Minister confirm that is our foreign policy on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  We contributed to the establishment of the tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>And we will not negotiate any of that away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that crimes could be prosecuted.  That is the intention of the EU.  We are trying simultaneously to bring the parties to the negotiating table. Despite the atrocities and horrendous background to this conflict we had some success in recent months.  Ultimately, we must arrive at a negotiated settlement acceptable to all parties which will bring about lasting peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined three points at the beginning of this reply &mdash; the pursuit of a peace settlement; the prevention of the spread of the war and the supply of aid and defence of the civilian population.  Is he aware of the threats made by some participants in the current peace process, France in particular, towards withdrawing troops and <Col N="1050" /> cutting back on aid unless certain things were done?  Does he consider that is self-defeating and that it is a mistake to assume threats of that kind will ever bring about reconciliation of the peoples of Bosnia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the threats of the French Government and Foreign Minister.  These were discussed at our meetings.  It is my view that this statement was made as a result of frustration by the French troops at the lack of co-operation on the ground.  The troops in former Yugoslavia have been working in very difficult and testing conditions for many months.  They want greater co-operation. The British, Spanish and French troops acting on behalf of the European Union and the United Nations have made an enormous contribution.  I believe at this stage the threat will not be carried out and that the troops will remain to see if they can help to resolve this conflict.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the jurisdiction and enforcement procedures of the war crimes tribunal to which he referred must be sustained and built into any peace settlement and that, as a matter of Irish foreign policy, there will be no retrenchment or giving in on this issue?  It must be a central and integral part of any European Union support for a settlement in Bosnia that that jurisdiction survives and effective enforcement measures given to the tribunal to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible for war crimes and rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>The Minister referred to a negotiated settlement, implying that everything is on the table.  Will he give an undertaking that the role of an international war crimes tribunal will not be compromised in any way?  Naturally Serbia will seek a compromise on this issue and say if there is an amnesty for something they will give way on something else.  Is it our foreign policy that there should be no compromise in terms of the role of an international war crimes tribunal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 15 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The present situation in relation to the status of Irish in the European Union was established at our entry to the Community in 1973 and it has been given legal expression in Article 3 of our Accession Treaty.  The effect is that Irish is a language of the Treaties and all the basic Treaties, including the Treaties of Accession, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty are available in the Irish language.  Irish is not, however, a working language of the Union and it was not included among the list of &ldquo;official and working languages of the Institutions of the Community&rdquo; which was appended to the legally binding instrument of the Council which formally established the language regime of the Union.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the submission made by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge on the status of the Irish language in the European Union.  I am satisfied that it would not have been appropriate to have sought to raise an institutional matter of this kind in the course of the recently completed enlargement negotiations since we were anxious to see a speedy and successful conclusion which will allow the four applicant countries to accede to the Union by 1 January 1995.  However, the question of the language regime to apply to Community institutions is likely to be one of the institutional issues which will be raised at the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked officials of my Department, with officials from other interested Departments, including in particular the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to look into the matter in depth and to consider whether the Government should raise the issue of the status of Irish at the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.  I understand that they will be arranging an early meeting with representatives of Comhdháil Náisiúnta <Col N="1053" /> na Gaeilge to discuss its views on the position of Irish in the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question arises from a submission made by Comhdháil Náisiuínta na Gaeilge in which the support of the Minister was sought for the recognition of Irish as an official language of the European Union.  It makes the case that 500 posts could be created for translators and a contribution could be made towards developing a positive attitude towards the language in Ireland if Irish was recognised as an official EU language.  Does the Minister regard those as worth-while objectives?</P>

      <P>I have seen the submission made by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and I will shortly be arranging a meeting between representatives of my Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Comhdháil to discuss the implications of its objectives.  I will examine all the options, including the granting of full official status for Irish.  The primary aim of the Union in any consideration of the language regime in 1996 will perhaps relate to its streamlining.  To put this in context, in an enlarged Union of 16 member states the number of official and working languages will increase to 12 and each meeting at Union level will have a possible 132 interpreting combinations, requiring the presence of up to 42 interpreters at any one time.  If the Union should be enlarged further to 20 states or more the number of interpreters per meeting would increase to 55.</P>

      <P>That sounds like a reasonable suggestion and it will be raised during our discussions with the Comhdháil.

These matters will be discussed in an open way with the Comhdháil, with the 1996 intergovernmental conference in mind.  I will report back to the House on the options we propose to pursue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> There are currently ten applications for membership of the EU from Austria, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, Switzerland, Poland and Hungary.</P>
    <P>Ireland's general attitude to the question of enlargement is open and positive. The Treaty on European Union states that any European State may apply to become a member.  Our concern is to ensure that enlargement should not diminish the momentum towards European integration.  It is also essential that the applicants capable of assuming the obligations of membership.  In determining this the formal opinion of the Commission on an application for membership, as required under Article O of the Treaty, is of major importance.</P>
    <P>Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway have just completed negotiations to join the European Union.  Referenda on Union membership will be held in each country before the end of the year.  If the outcome of these referenda favours Union membership these countries can become members of the European Union on 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>Ireland has welcomed the prospect of membership of the Union by these four EFTA countries as we already have close relations with them.  We have shared a similarity of outlook on a range of international issues.  In addition, it is our view that membership of the European Union by Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway will help to strengthen the Union.</P>
    <P>As far as the applications from Poland and Hungary are concerned, Ireland supports the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 which accepted that the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe shall become members as soon as they are able to assume the obligations of membership. These include the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the protection of minorities and the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union.  Membership would also require the candidates to accept all the Union's goals, including political, <Col N="1056" /> economic and monetary union.  The European Council also affirmed that enlargement would have to take into account the Union's capacity to absorb new members while maintaining the momentum of integration.  The Polish and Hungarian applications, which were received in April, have been referred in the normal way to the Commission for an opinion.</P>
    <P>The Turkish application for membership was the subject of a Commission opinion in 1989.  This concluded that it would not be useful to open accession negotiations straight away but that a range of steps should be taken to intensify relations with Turkey, including the establishment of a Customs Union in 1995.  Work is continuing to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>The Commission also delivered its opinions on the applications from Malta and Cyprus.  The opinion on Malta confirmed its eligibility for membership but found that Malta's economy would require a major and fundamental overhaul to enable it to adopt EU rules.  The General Affairs Council last October largely endorsed the Commission's opinion and discussions have now begun with the Maltese authorities on the required economic reforms.</P>
    <P>The opinion on Cyprus was largely positive as regards Cyprus's economic credentials and suggested that the Union should send a positive signal to Cyprus confirming its eligibility for membership and proposing that the formal accession process could begin as soon as there is a prospect of a political settlement.  In line with this opinion the Council, in October 1993, recommended that the Commission should open substantive discussions with Cyprus with a view to preparing the way for eventual accession negotiations.  The Council also recommended that the situation should be reviewed in 1995 in the event that no progress had been made on the political front.</P>
    <P>Switzerland's application for membership will not be acted upon for the immediate future, following the negative <Col N="1057" /> result of the referendum on the European Economic Area Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure nobody in this country has any problems with the current four applicant countries because overall they have been net contributors to the Community.  However, there is a very serious question mark over the prospective entry of countries like Poland &mdash; and there was a Polish delegation here last week lobbying on this matter &mdash; in view of the fact that there are 38 million people in Poland and 2.2 million small farmers.  If countries such as Poland and Hungary, whose infrastructures are so run down, are allowed entry to the European Union within the next couple of years it is bound to have very severe repercussions on our economy, particularly our agricultural economy.  Before any such application is discussed within the European Union, particularly at head of State level, will the Minister agree there should be a major debate in this House on our attitude to it because of the implications for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in relation to the holding of a debate in this House; certainly I will make myself available for such discussion.  We may well have to have a discussion before the end of this session concerning the present enlargement and I would welcome the Deputy's contribution.  The position is that the European Council has affirmed that enlargement should take into account the Union's capacity to absorb new members while maintaining the momentum of integration.  That covers the point the Deputy made and his worries. I have said in this House on many occasions that if the enlargement is completed successfully &mdash; obviously dependent on the referenda in the four applicant countries &mdash; by January 1995 &mdash; the European Union itself will need a <Col N="1058" /> period of time within which to overcome the difficulties experienced in recent years, in terms of economic growth and tackling the unemployment crisis.  We should seek a new momentum within the Union prior to any further enlargement. Obviously we shall have to continue discussions with the eastern European countries which will have to effect significant improvements in their economies.  All the difficulties the Deputy raises in relation to, say, Poland or Hungary will be discussed well in advance of their entry. Nonetheless we need a period of consolidation within the European Union before further enlargement.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; could be proved when talking about an offence under this Bill since the subsection says that it would be an offence to commit, with the consent, connivance or approval of and so on.  How does one prove connivance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Connivance&rdquo; has a meaning, in this context, of silent assent; in other words, that the people in charge of or responsible for a company would know of the offence and allow it to continue. Of course, anybody prosecuted under the provisions of this section would first have to be found guilty in a court of law before any penalty could be imposed. This is a standard wording for which there is precedent in many sections of other Bills that go through this House.  On that basis I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 in the names of Deputies Doyle and Dukes.  Amendment No. 12 is related.  Therefore it is suggested that they be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 2, after &ldquo;section 3&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;11,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment purports to add section 11 to the section that deals with the laying of orders and regulations before the <Col N="1106" /> Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 11 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order&mdash;</P>
    <P>confer additional functions on the Authority, and they are listed.  I fail to understand why the Minister omitted section 11 from section 7 which deals with the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Second, our amendment No. 12, subparagraph (2) states:</P>
    <P>No order made under subsection (1) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under section 11, an extremely important provision, by order and without any reference to the House, the Minister may confer additional functions on the Authority.  This new authority could end up running the show without any need to seek the approval of this House.  Section 11 should be part of section 7 &mdash; the provision concerned with the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and be by affirmative order only, in other words that additional functions be given to this authority only by an affirmative order that will have to be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Part of amendment No. 12 reads:</P>
    <P>No order varying or revoking an order made under this section (including an order under this subsection) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been considerable disquiet for some time concerning the amount of secondary legislation being enacted rather than coming into the Houses of the Oireachtas to be discussed by democratically elected Members.  The number of times we resort to regulations to legislate must be questioned. This is part of being a member of the European Union.  European legislation, such as directives and regulations, is being introduced through this procedure. <Col N="1107" /> We are increasing the democratic deficit if the Minister can confer additional functions on the new authority without an affirmative order coming before this House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept both amendments.  Certainly amendment No. 12 must be part of section 7 because it is an order by the Minister, unless he wishes to act as a despot.  I may trust the Minister's intentions but who knows who will be responsible for that Department in the future.  It may be Deputy Rabbitte and where would we be if we did not have the control of the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas or, at the very least, the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas any order, given his affection for the agricultural sector.  My request is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section requires all orders or regulations made by the Minister and all regulations made by the Authority, under the Act, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and either House may annul the order or regulation by passing a resolution to that effect within 21 days of its sitting after the order or regulation was laid before it.  This requirement does not apply to orders made by the Minister relating to the establishment day, the bringing into operation of the parts of section 54 concerning the new levy on off course bets placed at an authorised racecourse and the bringing into operation of the new special licensing provision in Part IX of the Bill.  I oppose this amendment on the basis that I will be opposing any amendment to section 11 and, in such circumstances, the need for this amendment does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under amendment No. 12, Deputy Doyle proposes to amend section 11 substantially and has tabled a new section 11 with four subsections.  The key changes are in subsections (2) and (3).  The section deals with the power of the Minister to confer additional functions on the Authority by order.  In its present form this order would be subject to section 7.  This means that the order would be placed <Col N="1108" /> before the Oireachtas and either House would have the power to annul the order within the next 21 days on which they sit. The amendment proposed seeks to delete the annulling provision in section 7 and to amend section 11 so that an order, under that section, would not have effect until it is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would defeat the purpose of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister said but I cannot accept his reason for not accepting both amendments. Section 7 states:</P>
      <P>Every order... made by the Minister (other than an order made under section 3, 54 (6) or 68 (2) ... shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas...</P>
      <P>In other words by negative resolution. Under section 11, as amended, every order must be laid before the House. That is the reason I want an exception and I do not want it included with every order or regulation.  We want an affirmative order of the Houses of the Oireachtas when the functions of the Authority are likely to be changed by direction of a Minister without reference to this House.  The experience of our party, and I suspect of the other Opposition parties in relation to annulling resolutions, has been extremely negative.</P>
      <P>Last week my colleague, Deputy Barrett, who is our spokesperson on the Environment, tabled an annulling resolution to regulations which the Minister for the Environment had issued in relation to changes in planning law.  The Government refused to take the annulling resolution in Government time.  It finally conceded to permit statements on Thursday last so that there was not a proper debate or vote on the issue before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If annulling resolutions were accepted in Government time there would be a democratic case for what the Minister is saying.  As they are not accepted in Government time, it is adding to the despotic rule in terms of the volume of secondary legislation being processed <Col N="1109" /> generally.  I have no difficulty with the concept of a Minister adding functions to the Authority's remit but it cannot be done by diktat, which is effectively what is being provided for.  If it is a negative resolution that can be annulled within 21 days and the Government refuses to take that annulling motion during Government time it is effectively rule by dictat. I do not accept that as a democratic way to proceed.  It is adding to the democratic deficit and the increased irrelevance in the minds of the public of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept our amendment to section 11.  Subsections (2) and (3) of amendment No. 12 are clear.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to tie the hands of any Minister if there, is a desire to add additional functions to the Authority's remit but they can only be done by an affirmative resolution in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not distrust the Minister's intentions in terms of additional functions but none of us can guarantee who will be Minister for Agriculture in the future.  There could well be a Minister not so well disposed to the horseracing industry.  Conversely, if a Minister has the power to add additional functions to the Authority can the Minister restrict the functions of the Authority by order without an affirmative resolution of this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to allow the facility to give additional functions over the years, if so required.  The amendment seeks to delete the annulling provision in section 7 and to amend section 11 so that an order under that section would not have effect until it is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would defeat the purpose of the section which is there to cater for urgent situations that may arise where it would be appropriate that additional functions be conferred on the authority, sometimes at relatively short notice.  The safeguards are that in conferring additional functions, those functions must be connected with the functions of the Authority or the services or activities <Col N="1110" /> which the Authority is authorised to provide. In addition, the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained for any additional functions to be provided.  If the order has to be approved by the Oireachtas there could be a delay in providing for a technicality to allow the authority to act quickly.  for example, what would happen if a problem arose when the Dáil was not sitting and an order was required urgently?  There are sufficient safeguards and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not know who is responsible for allocating time but it is reasonable that the Minister should not have a difficulty in moving a motion in Government time. That is my own attitude to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the procedures of this House an annulling resolution cannot be taken in Government time; it can only be taken in Private Members' time although I am subject to correction.  This presents a difficulty given the increasing number of Bills being implemented by way of order to comply with European Union directives.  This matter should be taken up again by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as we are frustrating the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Last week, for example, we discussed the annulling resolution relating to the planning regulations but a week before the Minister indicated that the date of commencement would be 16 May.  The annulling resolution was finally discussed by way of statements on 26 May.  This was a farce and we engaged in histrionics. The Minister had no intention of listening to any of the points made.  Who are we fooling with this nonsense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked what would happen if a problem arose during the summer recess; when could an annulling resolution be taken if the Opposition parties did not like the extra functions being conferred on the Authority?  How could we voice our objections if we were not in a position to table an annulling resolution within 21 sitting days?  This makes no sense and constitutes despotic behaviour; in other words, the Minister will be able to do what he likes and dictate to the <Col N="1111" /> racing industry and the rest of us.  He will be able to confer extra functions on the horseracing Authority by diktat; this is nationalisation of the worst kind.  If this should happen during the summer recess we will not be able to discuss it.  What kind of issue does the Minister envisage which would require him to confer an additional function on the Authority which could not be discussed while the House is in session?  What eventually does the Minister have in mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no problem with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examining this matter if the Opposition finds it difficult to obtain time to discuss an annulling resolution.  This is only fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>The power to confer additional functions on the Authority is a standard provision in legislation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the general functions of the new Authority which include the overall administration of Irish horseracing other than the services operated by the Racing Regulatory Body under this Bill; the control of the operations of authorised bookmakers; the allocation of race fixtures and the setting of race programmes; the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse &mdash; we are not sure which definition will be used &mdash; and the making of grants and loans.  It is a catch-all section and may be taken with section 11 under which the Minister will be able, willy-nilly, to confer additional functions on the Authority as he or it thinks fit.  What we are talking about is the nationalisation of horseracing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good case can be made in favour of rationalising present structures provided we recognise the expertise available in the different sectors but the Minister has gone too far.  He has put a semi-State Authority and civil servants, irrespective of their ability, in charge of an industry which should stand or fall in the private sector.  I do not know whether the Labour tail or, as it was more colourfully put yesterday by Deputy McDowell, the Labour ass is wagging the Fianna Fáil horse and we have a jennet of some kind but is there a need to nationalise an industry which should be able to stand on its <Col N="1113" /> own two feet &mdash; and has &mdash; for hundreds of years?  As the Minister may realise, the most successful racing industries in other countries are controlled by the private not the public sector.  Where the public sector is over involved it is a disaster. I cite the industry in France as an example.  I am not sure why the Minister is so convinced that the answer to the problems which could be resolved within the private sector is to nationalise the horseracing industry.  I have strong reservations about the tone of the Bill under which the Minister will be able to confer additional functions on the Authority whenever he feels like it.  In other words, the Minister will have complete control over the racing industry.</P>
    <P>Let us examine other industries which have been nationalised.  The greyhound industry should not be held up as an example of the way in which to run a private industry which should be able to stand on its own two feet without the semi-State sector or Civil Service interfering. Under this Bill the Authority will have functions ranging from choosing the colour of the loo door at any racecourse to setting the SP.  The tentacles of the Government could choke the industry.</P>
    <P>Much will depend on the members of the Authority.  It is a political Authority; with the exception of four members, the Minister will have a say in each of the other ten appointments.  He will have a say in who will be chairperson.  I could refine that to &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and not be wrong.  Who knows who will be in the Minister's seat in future?  My concern is not about what the Minister will do, I will have great fun watching and commenting on that.  He or I might not be around in the future and, God help us, we might have Deputy Rabbitte as chairperson of the racing authority or somebody with no real interest in the industry who would consider it purely from a public sector point of view.</P>
    <P>All my concerns could be summarised under section 10 and relate to the excessive interference by the Civil Service and a Civil Service run authority in an industry that properly belongs to the private <Col N="1114" /> sector.  I wish the Minister had considered otherwise when drafting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish horseracing and breeding industry has been evaluated and reviewed for many years and it is time to effect fundamental charges.  If the industry was capable of bringing about those changes on its own it would be desirable to allow it to do so.  However, the facts are different.  The industry is in serious difficulties in a number of areas, one of the reasons being the shortage of funds.</P>
      <P>The industry initiated discussions under the chairmanship of Dr. Paddy Moriarty some time ago which led to a further round of discussions under the chairmanship of Michael Dowling, Secretary of the Department.  It is not easy in any sector, particularly the sporting sector, to get consensus, but a level of consensus was arrived at which led to the publication of a draft Bill.  That draft Bill was debated and amended by representatives of the industry and I have introduced a number of amendments to allay the concerns that were brought to my attention by the industry.</P>
      <P>Because of our small population a substantial amount of Exchequer funding is required for an internationally viable industry here.  We are not in a similar position to countries with a successful horseracing industry.  Approximately two-thirds of the funding will come from the taxpayer and for that reason there must be accountability; that is reasonable. It is my intention that the Authority will be responsible for the direction, development and enhancement of the industry.  I ask people to wait for a few days until the Authority is announced and they will then know I am serious about allowing it to get on with the job. The term &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; is pejorative and not helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Authority will be the executive and give direction to the industry.  Finance will be provided under <Col N="1115" /> the terms of this Bill to allow it to carry out that job.  The Authority will be responsible for the overall promotion and administration of the Irish horseracing industry, with the exception of the implementation of the rules of racing and the provision of integrity services which will continue to be provided by the Turf Club and the National Hunt committee.</P>
      <P>To facilitate such development the Authority will need to plan the future organisation of racing and will need a certain amount of finance.  The Authority's functions will include the allocation of race fixtures, setting up race programmes and funding the industry. The industry is reasonably well funded because funding was provided for it some years ago.  The prize money here compares favourably with Great Britain.  In future the Authority will receive the on-course betting levy and the Tote profits. I hope the Tote will provide a surplus which can be put back into racing.  There is no reason it should not and it is disappointing that is not the case at present. The Authority will be allowed to levy charges under section 12 and will receive a Government grant.  Those resources should ensure that sufficient funds will be available for prize money, the cost of integrity services and aid and support to develop facilities at racecourse.</P>
      <P>Racegoers want adequate and up-to-date facilities.  The Authority will be required to promote internationally Irish racing and the Irish thoroughbred horse on an ongoing basis.  For those reasons this legislation is worthwhile and has received broad support from the industry. There is no question of the industry being controlled by civil servants and significant grant aid is being provided for it.  The new Authority will be broadly representative of the industry and we will allow it to get on with the job I envisage for it, namely, the establishment of a first rate racing and breeding industry here.</P>

      <P>We all know who the chairperson of the new Authority will be and the chairperson of the existing Racing Board.  Given that the Minister <Col N="1116" /> has referred to the financial fiasco in the Racing Board, it does not add up.  The Minister obviously knows more than we do and the chairman did not have hand, act or part in the financial difficulties. Perhaps the Minister is not levelling with us as to whether this is the Racing Board mark II or a new nationalised racing authority. The old pals act is in operation as is the case in most matters here.  We have to accept much of that as par for the course.  If an explanation is needed as to why the finances of the Racing Board are in such a state and why the Minister had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of £1 million before Christmas hoping nobody would notice or ask too many awkward questions, how can the Minister have confidence in more of the same, which is what he is offering us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of more of the same.  This Bill was introduced to bring about substantial reform. I had no difficulty with wiping the slate clean for the old Racing Board, but in my discussions with the industry I said I would do a number of things which included establishing a new Authority with a clean sheet.  I expected it to increase resources and investment in the industry.  I did not want the taxpayer to contribute additional funding or for its resources to be reduced by a similar amount which is what happened over the past few years.  When the off-course betting levy was introduced it netted £3 million, but the end result was not any better.</P>

We would need a more expert punter than I to give the <Col N="1117" /> reasons for the decline in punting, the national lottery and other types of gambling may be to blame.  There is a range of reasons: people are now betting on golf tournaments and classics of various kinds and are even betting on the Lotto. We want to make the racing industry more attractive, get more people through the turnstiles with the industry generating more money from the Tote.  Provision is made in the Bill to have the Tote operated by a subsidiary company so that it is a stand alone operation.  In every other country the Tote generates a profit and I do not understand why it cannot be done here.</P>
      <P>Members will see that with the establishment of the Authority there will be radical changes in the industry.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;11.  &mdash; (1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order confer on the Authority, in relation to the development and promotion of horseracing, such additional functions connected with the functions for the time being of the Authority, or the services or the activities that the Authority is authorised for the time being to provide or carry on (including functions of the Minister in relation to any directive, regulation or other act adopted by an institution of the European Union in relation to horseracing) as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>

    <P>The Minister indicated that he will not accept my amendment.  However, line 1 on page 10 of the Bill refers to the &ldquo;European Communities&rdquo; but is the correct expression not the &ldquo;European Union&rdquo;, and my amendment refers to the European Union?</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Any individual, association, company or body corporate on whom or on which the authority shall levy a charge, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the Racing Regulatory Body, or by the agency of the Racing Regulatory Body, or jointly with the Racing Regulatory Body in connection with the powers conferred by this Act on the Authority and on the Racing Regulatory Body, shall have the right to appeal against the level of those <Col N="1120" /> charges to a court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment in response to those in the racing industry who feel aggrieved that there is no independent right appeal against decisions of the Turf Club or the Racing Regulatory Body.  I accept there are arguments for and against and many feel that the final say should rest with the Turf Club and the stewards.  Looking at the statistics over the years that is a fair comment because they have done an excellent job but in rare cases where people feel seriously aggrieved will the Minister state his view on whether a right of appeal against the level of charges should be allowable to a court of competent jurisdiction?  I accept that any appellant has the right to go before any court if he feels he has been denied natural justice &mdash; we have had some high profile examples and in the most recent ones the courts upheld the stewards' decision.  There are two distinct schools of thought on this issue which are as far apart as ever on it.  The House should have the benefit of hearing the Minister's view on whether the right of appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that people on whom the Authority levies a charge should have a right of appeal against the level of the charges to a court of competent jurisdiction.  This could prove to undermine the power of the Authority in setting charges if every individual affected had a right enshrined in legislation to challenge the level of charge applied.  All the relevant interests in the industry will have representation on the Authority and all those groups have strong well established associations to negotiate their position for them.  It is reasonable to say that the Authority will in its own interests set any charges that it sees necessary at a reasonable level and the representative bodies concerned will lobby to ensure the fairness of charges applied.  Section 12 (1) makes it clear that the charges must be &ldquo;necessary and appropriate&rdquo;.  If in the very exceptional <Col N="1121" /> circumstances that an individual feels that a charge on him or her is unfair that person will have recourse to the normal remedies such as judicial review.</P>

      <P>(d) the application for or the granting of any licence, permit or authorisation granted by it.</P>
      <P>The level of charge could be increased by the Authority as a means of limiting the number in certain areas or restricting certain activities.  May an aggrieved individual or group appeal or negotiate with the Authority?  In other words, must the individual or the body just accept the charges levied on it willy-nilly without having an opportunity to appeal?</P>

      <P>My reading of the Bill is that members of sub-committees, particularly external members, who are not already members of the Authority, shall not have to disclose their interests.  In the racing industry there are all sorts of interests that might need to be taken into account. Such interests could include those of influential owners of horses and racecourses and influential people in different financial sectors of horseracing, who, because of their general wisdom and experience, could serve on the fixtures committee and not be a member of the Authority.  I understand disclosure of interests is not required in such cases.  I wonder why the last three sections on disclosures of interests of the directors, staff and members of the Authority do not apply to members of sub-committees who may also be external members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> In this amendment we are attempting to rationalise the number of committees. We suggest that the functions that would be conferred by section 20 on the race-programme committee should be added to the race-fixtures committee and that the members of the race-fixtures committee would become <i>de facto</i> the race-programme committee without the need for duplication.  The logic of our amendments is self-explanatory.  Even though the race programme as defined is separate from the race fixture, both are interlinked. To have a successful race meeting both those matters must be properly attended to.  At present, the procedure whereby the race fixture and the race programme are discussed by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee &mdash; to my knowledge there is not an official committee dealing with it in the Turf Club &mdash; has worked successfully. I have every confidence in the functions of a race-programme committee being dealt with competently by a race-fixtures committee.  In the absence of hearing the Minister's argument on this I propose he accepts our amendment. I would be interested to hear his response to amendment No. 19 as it may be related to the case I am making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 17 and 18 would be to give responsibility for race programmes to a race-fixtures committee.  The race-programme committee has always been separate and is different from the race-fixtures committee.  Unlike the fixtures committee and rather than setting down major policy, it acts like a working group with a semi-executive function.  The business of the committee is time consuming and more officials are involved in it than in the fixtures committee.  The race-programme committee is covered under section 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak on my amendment No. 19 as it is complementary.  That amendment, as drafted, deletes all the sub-sections and leaves the simple statement that the race-programme committee should be established by the Authority after consultation with the regulatory body.  The regulatory body provides the secretariat <Col N="1125" /> for the present race-programme committee. The amended text will allow the Authority and the regulatory body to work together to decide the practical arrangements for the committee in terms of appointments, terms of reference, secretariat and so on.  In practice, this will not give rise to difficulty.  That amendment was tabled following exhaustive consultation with the various interests involved and there was substantial agreement on it to overcome any perceived problems in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the terms of remit of a race-fixtures committee and those of a race programme committee are considerably different.  However, the structure the Minister proposes for a race-fixtures committee in terms of appointment could be used also for a race-programme committee.  The same, equally competent and qualified people, would be on a race fixtures committee as those on a race programme committee. The race programme deals with the type of race, the prizes, the conditions, the number of races, etc.  Arranging a fixture and the details of a race programme are vital to the future of many racecourses.  If any bloody-mindedness were to be shown towards any racecourse it would be through control of the race programme and, perhaps, of the race fixture.  The future of many marginal racecourses could be controlled.  Getting a fair share of the headline races has been a matter of concern for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment helps in that he is deleting all the sections except for the first few lines of section 20.  That still just states that a race programme committee will be set up without any details about how it will be formulated or who will be on it.  Will the &ldquo;old pals act&rdquo; operate?  Will it be a hand-chosen committee of people who will support, say, the chairman and which will dictate whether Wexford, Roscommon or Dundalk will or will not get some of the high profile races?  Will it enable racecourses owned by the Authority to pick the plums, or ensure that the racecourse owned by the Turf Club will not get the <Col N="1126" /> plums?  Any slant could be put on this, depending on who one is listening to.</P>
    <P>The control of the race programme and what races go where determines the future of many of our racecourses. Although from a financial point of view it may not be tidy to have so many rural racecourses and lopping off six or eight of those which are uneconomic might look better on the annual returns of this semi-State body, each racecourse is critical to the economy of the local rural area that services it and each, given a chance, would have a viable and exciting future. However, if this Authority is of a mind to squeeze out a few of these racecourses it can do so through the race programme committee by ensuring that the programme the racecourses get does not suit the demands of local owners and trainers in the area.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the race programme committee could be used for all the wrong reasons and the only way the Minister can ensure that does not happen is to make the race fixtures committee also a race programme committee &mdash; they do not have to decide everything on the one day.  If the structure set out here under section 19 to establish a race fixtures committee is to work it should be peopled by people in the industry who have the necessary experience and wisdom and who would be quite capable of fairly allocating racing programmes to the different racecourses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We may as well say here what is being said outside.  Given that the Authority will be hand-picked by the Minister and given who will be on it, there is little trust that there will be fairness in allocating race programmes around the country unless the race fixtures committee, details about which are here, are given that function as well.</P>
    <P>Apart from the concerns about fairness and the control and authority exercised in allocating races, it makes little sense to set up a separate committee.  A race fixtures committee could also do the job of a race programme committee rather than creating another layer of bureaucracy under this Authority.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1127" /> to accept my point and accept my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can make out, the Minister's argument for having the text in the way it is or, indeed, in the way in which he proposes to amend it in section 20, is that that is the way it has always been.  That is not a good argument. There must be more behind it than that.  I am more inclined to that view when I look at the Minister's amendment the purpose of which is to take out most of the text which is now in section 20 and remove the specification.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not out of order in saying this, but we are discussing all of these amendments together and far be it for me to criticise the Minister for taking out of the text a chunk of useless bureaucracy &mdash; I am all in favour of that.  However, I would like to know why the Minister is doing that.  One assumes that he must have had some passable reason for including it in the first place.  What led the Minister to lighten up the text of section 20?</P>
      <P>Had the Minister not proposed this amendment I would have asked why it was felt necessary to put in the text of section 20 (4), which solemnly goes to the lengths of providing in legislation that the Authority may regulate the procedure of the race programme committee. It would seem self-evident that any Authority setting up a committee in its own area of competence and under its own aegis has the right, without it having to be specifically enshrined in legislation. to regulate the activities of such a committee. I would have asked the Minister then why he had felt it necessary to provide that members of the race programme committee could include people who are not members of the Authority. If we are setting up an Authority to do the job, is the Minister now saying that the authority will not have the personnel necessary to carry it out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come back to the central point which Deputy Doyle has made time and time again.  Why is it necessary to have these two committees?  The only answer <Col N="1128" /> the Minister has given to that question is that that is the way it has been done up to now.  That is not a good reason for including this in a Bill that is supposed to modernise and streamline the structure that is to look after this industry.  I would like the Minister to tell us why he is now proposing to take chunks out of section 20.  I agree in spirit and by instinct with taking chunks out of legislation like this, but the Minister had a reason for including it in the first place and I would like to know what is his reason for taking it out because, with the best will in the world, I do not believe the Minister has taken it out just to relieve some of the burden this Bill will impose on the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is the logic that compels the Minister to say that these two jobs must be done separately &mdash; the fixing and allocation of race fixtures and the fixing of race programmes &mdash; because at the end of the day the result of the deliberations will end up together and become the date, place, time and activities of a series of race meetings that will be attended by punters, where trainers will bring their horses, where jockeys will go to ride them and owners will go to watch, some with great glee and others with some sadness, if not a streak of despair.  The functions of these two committees are directed at producing the mixture of things that combine to make a race meeting.  Why must there be two committees when one event will be the result of the work of these two committees? Surely it would be better if all this work were done together.</P>
    <P>The business of setting out race programmes is more time consuming and involves more work because the programme consists of a series of races that will take place on a given day at a given fixture.  However, since it is of a piece with the rest of what determines the regulations of that fixture or meeting, they should be done together.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not accept that on the whole it is preferable to have the clarity of knowing that there is one place where a particular set of decisions will be taken rather than several different <Col N="1129" /> places?  Would he agree it would be better to combine the work of the two committees in one sub-committee of the Authority?  I fully recognised it should be done under the aegis of the Authority, but would it not be simpler and more straight-forward for everybody concerned to do the job as a whole?</P>

      <P>On a point of information, Willie Carson won the Derby. He made a perfectly timed challenge in the last furlong.  The Minister's friend, Michael Kinane, had victory snatched from him.  I hope the Minister had not too much money on him.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give the definition of a race programme committee?  Will it decide the type of races to be run at a fixture &mdash; for example, whether maiden hurdles, bumper races or chases will be run?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a logical reason for that.  In recent years the Curragh has had to look closely at the kind of racing it was holding because the punters were not attending.  Bumper races and hurdle races were introduced.  In the dying days of the Phoenix Park racecourse, bumper races and hurdle races were introduced there.  The Pageant Cup, an annual hurdle race, was also run at that track.  There is a need to appoint people who know the industry and the type of races the public demand.  Apparently bumper races are now in vogue and are requested by the punter.  I would not bet on a horse in a bumper race if the Holy Ghost was riding it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even if the Holy Ghost told you to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but these races are very popular.  There is a need for a programme that would attract the most varied card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For time immemorial racetracks have had a grievance about the allocation of plum dates for race fixtures.  County tracks have entertained that grievance <Col N="1130" /> for a long time.  They have witnessed the monopoly enjoyed by the metropolitan tracks, particularly of Sunday racing. While I realise that big tracks must get the plum dates, the survival of many country tracks depends on a fairer allocation of meetings.  There is no doubt that in the next decade some country tracks will close.  There are 39 tracks and the bell is tolling for some of them.  To maintain a racetrack for perhaps eight or ten days racing a year is non-viable.  There is no doubt that racing will become more centralised in coming years.</P>
    <P>A more judicious allocation of meetings is required.  For instance, 12 July, a sensitive date, is particularly suitable for a race meeting in Dundalk.  Some years ago I attended a Sunday meeting there which attracted huge crowds.  Unfortunately the management of that racetrack was not allowed hold a meeting on that attractive date &mdash; I understand there is a meeting this year on 10 July which will have to suffice.  The allocation of meetings is perceived to be unfair by many racetrack managements.</P>
    <P>The promotional aspect of this matter also needs attention.  Perhaps that will be considered by the race programme committees.  Sponsorship has been the means of survival for many smaller tracks and will be increasingly so in coming years.  Unfortunately there is only a certain amount of sponsorship available and because of the glamour associated with Leopardstown and the Curragh, the meetings there tend to get the plum sponsorships and allocations.  The racing authority must consider racing as a whole. While Jim Bolger, Dermot Weld, John Oxx and many others are involved, there are also those at the bottom of the scale and I sometimes wonder where these people find the money to transport a horse to a meeting.  This is a very expensive business and the price of oats is the same for small trainers as it is for the high flyers.</P>
    <P>If racing is to survive and if we are to accommodate the small owner and trainer and the punter, we must facilitate the smaller country tracks, many of which will have to cease racing in the years <Col N="1131" /> to come, as happened in Mullingar and Baldoyle.  There will be casualties and an even-handed approach must be taken by the racing Authority to the entire question of racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the case made by my colleague, Deputy McGahon.  What he said supports the amendments before the House.  It is the format of the selection procedure for members of the race fixtures committee that will ensure fair play in deciding on race programmes and the allocation of various types of races, which are essential to attract the punters and ensure the economic success of a course.  I am somewhat relieved by the Minister's amendment dealing with the race programme committee, but effectively the racing Authority will decide on the race programme committee.  I would not trust the Authority the Minister has in mind to be fair in allocating race programmes, but I would trust the structure of the race fixture committee to be fair in that regard.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Minister went to a lot of trouble to provide that the composition of the race fixture committee is acceptable to those in the industry.  There was much compromise and discussion before arriving at the final formulation of the wording.  To go to the trouble of bringing together these people simply to decide the date and venue, which is all that is involved in race fixtures, seems superfluous if they are not also given the job of race programme committee.  The people who will sit on this sub-committee could perform an excellent job as race programme committee, and any allegations of favouritism would be removed from the Authority in allocating programmes, prize money, high profile races or the mix of races which is so important to the success of a fixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The race fixtures committee and race programme committee, the composition of the Authority and its financing are areas that will make or break the authority, that will ensure its success or otherwise. I ask the Minister to consider giving the functions of a race-programme committee <Col N="1132" /> to the race-fixture committee and remove from the Authority any possible accusation of being unfair to the smaller rural meetings and of being in favour of the bigger meetings in the cities.  Our request is reasonable and Deputy McGahon's argument fully supports the ease for those on the race-fixtures committee to be members of a race-programme committee also.  We need a race-programme committee but the Minister has very competent people on the race-fixtures committee and a method of selection outlined in section 19.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (2) (c) recommends that two representatives of authorised racecourses will be on the race-fixtures committee. There are more than 300 directors of authorised racecourses throughout the country.  Would the Minister be prepared to accept two nominations from the racecourses representative body?  How else will he select two representatives?  He accepts the nomination of that body when it comes to the Authority.  Given the number of representatives of authorised racecourses, the Minister will have to indicate how those two representatives will be selected and I suggest that he might consider accepting the two nominations of the racecourses representative body on the race-fixtures committee.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGahon for bringing us up to date on the outcome of the Derby.  It could be accidental that Tipperary lost its all-Ireland title but I doubt it was through carelessness that it lost the Derby with a jockey such as Kinane who I am sure made every effort.</P>

      <P>The definition of race fixture means the venue and the day.  The race programme means the category of race, the prizes for the race, the conditions and the number of races on the race card.  I accept what has been said, particularly by Deputy Doyle, that this is a key part of the Bill.  Much effort went into achieving consensus and, following exhaustive consultations with the industry, <Col N="1133" /> it was decided that the race-fixtures committee has an extremely important function in that tracks must have good fixtures and appropriate days.  If a particular track is given an unsuitable date it might as well not have any date.</P>
      <P>The programme is extremely important. Many examples can be given of programmes which simply did not suit modern racing and particularly the modern punter.  An example is the Phoenix Park which held many group races that suited a small number of people but, unfortunately, the track was closed.  That track, as well as the track in Baldoyle, was very popular at one time because the type of races held there suited the punters who attended them.</P>
      <P>The matter of fixtures and programmes is the future of racing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because people who own horses want to see them race and there is a great range and variety of races including handicaps, bumpers, hurdles and so on.  The Curragh has a fine track but it is not very well attended, apart from Derby day, it is a disaster.  Not only are there few punters in attendance there are few horses running in races for which there are attractive prizes.</P>
      <P>A great deal of negotiation was involved in this matter.  One of the functions of the race-fixtures committee is to arrange fixtures, dates and venues.  The race-programme committee will have to undertake intensive work to organise various types of races and it must work in an almost semi-executive way.  The business of the race-programme committee is time consuming and officials attend its meetings to ensure that proper programmes are made out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During consultations with all the interests in the industry, owners, trainers, racecourse representatives and so on, it was put to me that the original section 20 was extremely complex and difficult for people to understand.  A simple amendment was suggested &mdash; such as I have proposed in section 19 &mdash; deleting all subsections and leaving a simple <Col N="1134" /> statement that the race-programme committee shall be established by the Authority following consultation with the regulatory body.  That body, of course, provides a secretariat at present.  The Authority and the various racing interests would then proceed and carry out their functions in the interests of the industry they represent without reference to me. If they appoint two members from the racecourse representative body, to which Deputy Doyle referred, I will have no difficulty with that.  They will carry out their functions without reference to the Minister of the day and will be the executive running the industry for the future. They will appoint members to the race-fixtures committee and the race-programmes committee and I expect that if they want to have a viable industry they will appoint the best people available, have fixtures that suit particular locations and programmes which will suit the maximum number of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept an amendment to section 19 (2) (c) on Report Stage to read &ldquo;two representatives of authorised racecourses nominated by the racecourses representative body&rdquo;?  I accept everything the Minister says regarding a race-programme committee, we are not debating the need for that, and the key role it will play in the future of many racecourses. Because of the key role it will play in the future development or demise of racecourses, the race-fixtures committee, the composition of which has the sole function of determining the venue and the date &mdash; a very critical function &mdash; could double as a race-programme committee and carry out the extremely important work of a race-fixtures committee.  I agree with everything the Minister said other than the need to have two separate committees. There is no need for two committees to undertake these two roles.  Of secondary but important interest is that the Minister would accept the amendment that two representatives are nominated by the racecourses representative body.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I can give any further clarification on the matter.  I accept the import of what the Deputies said regarding the importance of fixtures and the content of programmes but having consulted exhaustively with representatives of the industry, it was put to me that the race-fixtures committee would carry out the function of putting the fixtures in place which was one specific job.  The race-programme committee involved a different function because of its complexity.  It <Col N="1136" /> was a semi-executive function and would operate as a working group.  For that reason a separate committee was required but it did not want to be shackled with section 20 as it was originally formulated in the draftsman's office.  I agreed to put down amendment No. 19 at their request and I would be reneging on a commitment to the industry if I did not oppose the amendments.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Owen on Tuesday, 31 May 1994:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to publish this week the Revised National Plan showing clearly each alteration in any paragraph or commitment that is now different from the National Plan Programme originally submitted to Brussels.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising the major contribution to jobs and to Ireland's economic potential arising from the substantial investment to be made with EU structural funds and associated public and private expenditure, supports the strategy and priorities set out in the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i> and notes the success of the Government in ensuring that this strategy and these priorities will be fully reflected in the Community Support Framwork, 1994-1999, final details of which are now being settled.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats supports this motion.  There is little doubt that the National Development Plan, in its revised but as yet unseen form, will bear little resemblance to the <Col N="1167" /> plan launched with great pomp and ceremony at Dublin Castle last October.  With the deadline for publication of the European Commission's approved version of this country's plan breached on 8 April last, it was immediately obvious that the Government had no intention of publishing the plan before the European elections. This is a masterpiece of political cowardice in the face of the forthcoming elections.</P>
      <P>This must come as a relief to all the Fianna Fáil and Labour candidates in the European and by-elections.  The voting will be over before the electorate will be told that many of the spending plans outlined in the National Development Plan are to be rephased, which is the euphemism for butchered.  There is no doubt in my mind that the final plan will differ substantially from the original.  The plan is being scaled down in two ways. Some of the major infrastructural projects will be delayed or severely curtailed and some of the projects not fully outlined in the original plan will be dropped. Of permanent importance to Dublin will be the shortfall affecting vital proposals such as the light rail project for Dublin, with one of the three lines now apparently scheduled to go because there is not enough money to proceed with the three light rail projects.</P>
      <P>Our problems in ascertaining the level of structural funding we would secure in the period 1994-99 have been well documented in this House.  Claiming it had secured funding of £8 billion, the Government proceeded to draw up and publish the original plan even when it knew it would never receive £8 billion from the EU.  This was and continues to be self-delusion on an enormous scale and there is no doubt that public cynicism has never been greater because the Government is unable to come clean with the electorate on the realistic projects that will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure we will receive is closer to £5.9 billion but, by a process of double counting, the Government believes it can get away with claiming that the figure is £7.2 billion.  A review of spending allocations <Col N="1168" /> is proceeding in tandem with negotiations with the EC Commission in Brussels which must approve the plan before it is set down in the Community Support Framework, which will commit EU funding up to 1999.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent cut in the overall £20 billion plan &mdash; when Exchequer and private sector matching funding is taken into account &mdash; will mean substantial cuts across the board or the dropping of some projects.  After the election we will witness an indecent squabble between Labour and Fianna Fáil Ministers about what projects are to be cut.  Inevitably, the later start to some of the projects means that spending on some projects will stretch beyond 1999, the last year of the current batch of funding, but the Government will not be able to say for sure where the money will come from after that date.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the dowry of this partnership Government was the Euro billions.  That is a crude but true statement. It made attractive to Labour what had been inconceivable &mdash; an alliance with the arch enemy, Fianna Fáil.  Now Government Ministers boast constantly in this House of the seamless union between the partners in Government. They should be mortified to say that there is a seamless union between two distinct political parties.  Certainly, the Labour distinctive voice has gone.</P>
    <P>Several fundamental problems instantly come to mind.  In launching the original plan, the Government committed itself to several flagship projects, its criteria for the choice of such a project being the visibility of the project, something to which the Government could point and say, &ldquo;We built that; that is ours&rdquo;.  Coming from a variety of EU schemes there is more potential for the Government to fudge the funding.  EU money, for example, supports a whole range of spending including headage payments to farmers, grants to industry and numerous educational and training programmes. I fully expect the Government to announce that Exchequer funds will make up for the lower than expected <Col N="1169" /> allocations of EU funding.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>One thing the Labour Party loves to do even more than spending money, is announcing that it intends to spend taxpayers' and Euro money.  It announces such plans with great ceremony.  A responsible Government should be embarrassed by such profligate spending. A spirit of prudence and restraint should replace the attitute that we can bankroll every ministerial whim on the back of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The fundamental premise of structural funding is that the EU, the State and the private sector would work as a partnership to improve Ireland's infrastructure, bringing us onto a par with our European counterparts.  The Government's mishandling of the Structural Funds negotiations cannot mean that this economy carries the can for the shortfall in Euro funds.</P>
    <P>In none of the key areas &mdash; agriculture, industry, education and training, would it be desirable or helpful to Government European election candidates that cast iron commitments given by Fianna Fáil and Labour would fail to be met.  A firm commitment of £419 million in headage payments, with a promise of further extensions, was given to the farming community. Spending on industry, with a job creation target set at 200,000 gross jobs, was said to be untouchable.  Education and training programmes catering &mdash; if we were to believe the original programme &mdash; for 1.2 million people by 1999, was secured.  That plan has now been sent back to Brussels for renegotiation and rephasing.</P>
    <P>The Government has a duty to the House to give details of the revisions to the plan that have been discussed with the EU Commission to date.  That should be up front.  Unless we get a clear outline of the annual level of investment from the EU, the Exchequer and the private sector and an indication of the level of alteration in the various programmes outlined in the original plan, Fianna Fáil and Labour candidates in the election are standing on an unsafe platform and are being less than honest.  Elections are <Col N="1170" /> essentially contracts with the electorate. This Government sought and continues to seek a mandate for Europe on the basis of the original plan but this is a false plan, a moveable feast.</P>
    <P>The Government must accept that there is a shortfall in the level of funding and proceed from there.  It cannot continue to pretend that the plan as it exists will stand.  If the Government insists that the plan will be implemented in its entirety then the taxpayer will make up the shortage of almost £2 billion.  The money must come from somewhere.  If the Government is not willing to give details of the negotiations on the plan to the House then it is obvious that it is involved in a ready-up and is not willing to face the electorate on the basis of a massively altered plan.</P>
    <P>The real problem with the debate on these funds is that the investments, while welcome and electorally attractive, will do nothing to address the structural defects in our economy.  The key question is: how will that growth translate into jobs?  We have an economy which, in a textbook fashion, is doing well, yet many people are unemployed and there is an air of gloom about.  The main barrier is the tax wedge and the Progressive Democrats will keep saying this because we believe it is so.  The tax wedge is the difference between what it costs an employer to employ someone and what the employee takes home.</P>
    <P>The culture of dependency is rife.  A generation of young people are being weaned on dependency, on the notion that the State will pay.  If there is one message that any good parent or Government can preach it is that one must be responsible for one's own achievement. The State is there to support individuals in their efforts.  People must be encouraged to make their own way, to prosper and create jobs and wealth.  Profit is still a dirty word in this economy but it is the key to encouraging the natural tendencies of the individual to prosper.  Tax reform is the key to this.  Levels of employment would indicate it is something we are actively trying to discourage rather than promote.  The Government <Col N="1171" /> has done little or nothing to tackle the problem. it has only tinkered with taxation. The 1 per cent income levy and increased RPT are the only major milestones, or should I say, millstones, for which the Government will be remembered, not to mention the inequitable tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>There are certain undeniable facts. Government spending of 17 per cent with inflation running at 3 per cent or less is a major structural defect.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has further compounded the problem.  Why does the Government not spell out targets to bring our debt to GDP ratio down to meet the Maastricht guidelines of 60 per cent? Why does it not adopt the NESC target of 95 per cent debt-GNP by 1996?  More than anything else, why does it not set out clear tax targets?  No targets have been set for a radical reform of the tax system.  The Government is obsessed with pleasing the electorate and seducing people with spending we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>With an overall majority of 35 seats, the largest in the history of the State, the Government had a real opportunity to implement major tax reform which was initiated by the last Government and to put the country on track to succeed in Europe in the next century.  It wasted the opportunity.  Afraid to give the economy the shake-up it needs, the Government is sleep-walking through financial administration and planning.  It lurches from announcement to announcement of spending plans.</P>
    <P>If we do not use this last large Structural Fund injection to address our massive structural difficulties, then the money will have been wasted &mdash; frittered away on a Government wish list.  If this happens it will rank as one of the greatest wasted opportunities in the history of the State.  We need a full debate on the revised or butchered national plan with details of alterations to and expenditure on projects made available to the House. We need a fundamental rethink of the whole premises of the plan.</P>
    <P>With the problems we face as a small economy with a huge unemployment <Col N="1172" /> problem &mdash; a source of national shame to most people &mdash; the Government should be prudent, strict and tough on public expenditure.  It should bend over backwards to support individuals and small businesses to better themselves and create jobs.  I have heard union leaders talk about the constitutional right to work.  The Progressive Democrats is the only party that agrees with this but not in the way Phil Flynn imagines.  He sees it as the role of the State to be the employer.  This is outdated, discredited statism that destroys personal initiative.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believes that instead of the human set-aside of our present dependency culture where people are paid not to work, as promoted by this Government, we should ensure that people work for their dole and contribute to the economic welfare of the nation.  They should liberate themselves from the human set-aside which is long term unemployment.  It is obscene if there is no incentive for a married man with four children to take up a job because he is better off on the dole with all the ancillary supports.  It is anti-job and anti-human.  There is no socialist response to high unemployment except that the State will pay for everything.  The State is you and I and it cannot sustain such high levels of mindless, futureless dependency.</P>
    <P>There is a spirit of enterprise in the country which is stifled by statism. Creative people with great ideas are obstructed at every turn when they try to better themselves and their families. Many emigrate and make their contribution to America and Europe.  They rise to the top of their chosen sectors. We all know them.  We went to college with them.  We know people who are successful in America, even though they just left college, because there is a spirit of enterprise in America which allows people to prosper.  It does not stop them creating jobs.  It allows them take risks and does not hamper them with bureaucracy. People are driven out of this country by high taxation and anti-enterprise policies.  The individual spirit is stifled by bureaucracy and lack of opportunity.  To <Col N="1173" /> employ one person is a bureaucratic nightmare.  Anyone who legitimately employs child care and does not take on someone from the black economy is astounded by the form-filling and bureaucracy involved.  One must get tax advice.</P>
    <P>The Government is proving to be a high tax, big spending Government.  A press release issued from the Tánaiste's office is enveloped in a fantastic, glossy, gold-leafed folder.  This is profligate spending.  When the report of the Kilkenny incest case was announced we were invited to a media launch at the Shelbourne Hotel.  This was a report of a horrific case of incest.  The Government is obsessed with gloss, the media event and pomp and ceremony.  Every event is a big party occasion and involves major spending.  As the days go on, it becomes more incredible.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of the revised plan yet the Minister for Health announced that £7.5 million would be allocated to extend the Castlebar hospital project.  Of course, it is in the month of the election.  We have a sophisticated electorate who will be able to see through these pre-election promises.  Before the 1992 general election many promises were made in my constituency.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, sanctioned a school in Dublin South.  The project was cleared by the Department of Education and it was sanctioned the week before the election.  Immediately after the election a new Government was formed and the project scrapped.  That is the type of double standards and dishonesty people have had to endure since the last election and I have no doubt that they will experience more of the same after the elections on 9 June.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats supports the Fine Gael motion.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his press release that the public had a right to know.  It has a right to know the amount by which the National Development Plan will be butchered.  I hope the electorate is sophisticated and smart enough to see through the lies being told in the run up to the European elections <Col N="1174" /> and the promises being made about spending.  People are beginning to wise up to the Government.</P>

      <P>Is féidir gur chreid siad féin an ráiméis sin ach níor chreid aon duine eile é.  Tá sé soléir go gcaithfidh siad athrú mór a dhéanamh don phlean agus anois, toisc go bhfuil toghchán ag teacht, níl siad in ann a rá linn cad iad na hathraithe a dhéanfar don bplean.</P>
      <P>This entire episode reminds me of Paul Daniels, one of my favourite television performers &mdash; every time I watch him he is able to fool me with his magic.  It is magic how the promised £8 billion decreased to £7.2 billion or £6.2 billion &mdash; I am never sure of the exact amount. Despite this major loss in funding we were repeatedly told by the Government that there was no need to revise the National Development Plan.  It is bad enough to think that we lost £1 billion or £2 billion for silly reasons but it is a gross insult to people's intelligence to suggest that the plan would not have to be revised as a result of this loss of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been continually made to the need for an Ethics in Government Bill, for high standards in office and open Government.  Ethics in Government surely demand that the Government is honest in what it says in this House and does not insult anyone of normal intelligence by pretending that the reduction in EU funding would not lead to the plan being revised.  The Government can hoodwink the public some of the time but it cannot fool it all of the time.  I hope the public realises that after the elections <Col N="1175" /> it will be in for a shock in the context of the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>During the regional news slot on this evening's Six-One news the Minister for Education announced five new schools for Dublin.  Having regard to the points made by Deputy O'Donnell, I hope these schools will not suddenly disappear after the elections.  It is amazing how this announcement can be made almost on the eve of the elections.  I do not suppose any announcement was made about the schools which will not be built.  A few days ago £7.5 million was allocated for the Castlebar hospital.  When one is talking about such large amounts in EU funding that amount is not of any great consequence.  However, it is amazing how this money can be given out almost on the eve of the elections and in advance of the allocation of money from Europe under the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>We do not know what is in the National Development Plan or the amount of funding &mdash; we have not been given any information.  From what I have read in the papers the delay in allocating the funding does not lie in Brussels.  It must, therefore, follow that the delay has been at the request of the Government.  It is shameful that a Government which has continually looked and fought for money from Europe should ask for the funding under the plan to be delayed merely because of the elections.  This election gimmick should backfire on the Government. Many areas which are supposed to benefit under the plan will be shocked to find out after the elections that they will not be getting the amount they thought they would get.  While it will be too late for them to vote against the Government at that stage, if they know in advance that they are in for a shock they will be in a position to do the right thing on voting day.  Regardless of what the Government says, it is not possible to lose £1 billion or £2 billion without making changes to the plan.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to have an open Government.  Yet it will not open the plan to the public, the Opposition or the officials in Brussels until after the <Col N="1176" /> elections.  It must be a source of embarrassment to the Government that it will have to go back on its promise that no changes would be made to the plan.  It is a source of embarrassment to all of us that our Government is the laughing stock of Europe because of the way it has juggled around an application for funding merely for the sake of elections.  I hope this leads to a loss of support for the Government.  We cannot continue to live in a land of make believe where people can say one thing when it suits them and another at a later date.</P>
    <P>We have lost much of our standing in Europe as a result of the debacle over EU funding.  The Government, and not Europe, has to bear responsibility for this.  It is embarrassing to both politicians and the public to realise that Europe thinks so little of Ireland that it declared publicly that one of our Ministers told a lie.  After all that, the Government asked Brussels to delay dealing with the plan until after the elections.  It must be very confusing for those in Brussels to see us acting like beggars looking for money and then asking them to delay dealing with the plan for personal reasons.</P>
    <P>This shows a lack of confidence on the part of the Government, which has the largest majority in the history of the State; it is not confident enough to say to the electorate &ldquo;we have to cut back in certain areas and it is better for you to know the position before the election than to find out afterwards&rdquo;.  This shows a lack of bravery and honesty.  It is bad enough for the Government to make fools of us in Brussels once but to do so twice is indefensible.  I sincerely hope that the Government will publish the revised plan before the election.  If it does so it will help restore some dignity to this House and ensure that people know the true position before the elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fifth debate in the Dáil since last July on the National Development Plan.  As I said when the matter was previously debated, it is important to look at the overall background against which this debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>At the European Council in Edinburgh in December 1992, the Government achieved a major success in the level of resources that the Council agreed should be provided for the four cohesion member states &mdash; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland &mdash; through the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund over the following seven years to 1999. The benefits of the new Cohesion Fund have already been seen in the additional investments in the areas of transport and the environment that became possible in 1993.  This was followed by the further achievement of securing over £7 billion as Ireland's share of these increased resources.  While this is less than had been hoped for as a starting point, it is still a very substantial result and represents easily the largest block of aid ever secured by an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Over the seven-year period concerned Ireland will receive the highest level of EU aid per head of population of any member state.  Aid to Ireland will amount to approximately IR£2,100 per person, compared with approximately IR£1,700 in the case of Greece, IR£1,650 in Portugal and IR£1,400 in Spain.</P>
      <P>I will turn now to the up-to-date position. Discussions are nearing completion with the European Commission on the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> with a view to agreeing the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central objective of the National Development Plan is to ensure the best long term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs.  It is further designed <Col N="1178" /> to reintegrate the long term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming so into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>In the debate yesterday Deputies criticised the lack of consultation in drawing up the plan.  This is far from the case. There were intensive consultations with a wide variety of groups including the subregional review committees, the national social partners &mdash; unions, employers and farmer organisations &mdash; various voluntary and other groups with an interest in the plan such as An Taisce, and the Community Workers' Co-operative as well as groups with an interest in specific aspects such as tourism or education.</P>
    <P>In addition to considering the various detailed submissions I, the Minister of State at my Department, and my officials, met the different groups to discuss their views.  Of course, these views varied enormously and at the end of the day the Government had to make the final decisions about the strategies and balance of investments to be included in the plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan also mentioned cross-Border co-operation.  The development plans North and South were the subject of detailed discussions between Government officials, North and South, with a view to having a strong cross-Border element in both plans.  This is reflected in a chapter common to both plans.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan was prepared and submitted on the basis of a certain projected amount of EU aid under a number of headings &mdash; the Community Support Framework, the Community Initiatives and the Cohesion Fund.  Subsequent to the submission of the plan, on 21 October 1993, the European Commission made decisions on the allocation of resources to member states and specifically on the allocations to the Community Support Frameworks for the Objective 1 regions, including Ireland. The allocation approved for Ireland under its Community Support Framework was 5.62 billion ECUs or IR£4.54 billion.  This amount fell short of the amount which we had included in the <Col N="1179" /> plan in respect of the Community Support Framework element.</P>
    <P>This shortfall was recognised and acknowledged by me and the Government from the outset.  It remains the Government's belief that, over the six-year period to 1999, it will be possible to get additional EU aid over and above the allocations already made.  However, the Community Support Framework has to be agreed now on the basis of the EU aid which has been allocated by the Commission at this stage.  Accordingly, adjustments had to be made to the expenditure allocations to take account of the shortfall in EU aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen suggested yesterday that the Government did not acknowledge the shortfall until February.  As I previously pointed out in the Dáil, at the press conference on 9 December 1993 and on the 1994 Estimates I said:</P>
    <P>The indicative allocation of Structural Fund aid for Ireland for the period 1994-1999 made by the Commission on 21 October is less than the figure on which the National Development Plan was based.</P>
    <P>I also said at that press conference that this shortfall in EC aid, and again I quote:</P>
    <P>...has been taken into account by the Government in settling the 1994 Estimates and Public Capital Programme. The assumption underlying the Public Capital Programme and the Estimates is that Exchequer and EC spending in areas covered by the plan will be £130 million less than the plan projections.</P>
    <P>That dealt with the situation in so far as 1994 was concerned.  At the beginning of March the Government took the necessary decisions to deal with the remaining years.  The Government remained satisfied that the strategy it had hoped in the plan was correct and that the balance of priorities reflected in the plan remained valid.  Accordingly, it decided that the appropriate way to deal with the shortfall in EU aid was to apply a corresponding reduction on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to departmental <Col N="1180" /> allocations.  The reduction was applied to the combined Exchequer and EU aid elements.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to maintaining budgetary discipline and to a fiscal policy set in the framework of the Maastricht convergence criteria.  For this reason, as I already pointed out, adjustments were made in the 1994 Estimates to take account of the shortfall in EU aid.  Further adjustments were then decided to deal with the situation for later years.</P>
    <P>In the 1994 Estimates reductions of £130 million were made to plan expenditure. This was not the full amount of the projected aid shortfall.  It was possible for the Exchequer to meet some £40 million of a cost which the plan envisaged would be met by EU funding.  The Government will look each year at the budget possibilities.  However, the Government would regard it as imprudent to commit itself at this stage to significant further increases in public expenditure, without having regard to the economic and budget position which will apply each year.</P>
    <P>There has been very detailed discussions with the EU Commission on the Community Support Framework.  These discussions have been constructive, with those involved on both sides working to ensure that the end-product is the best possible in terms of achieving the targets of maximising growth and employment through the use of available EU and national resources.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the overall approach and on the major issues of substance was reached fairly quickly and was finalised in April.  Since then the officials have been working through the detailed text and statistical material.  As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has already explained, this process has proved more time-consuming than had earlier been expected on either the Irish or Commission side. This is also the case with other member states.  However, at this stage only the final touches of detail remain to be sorted out.  There are then a number of procedures that the Commission has to go <Col N="1181" /> through, including consultation with the Community level committees that deal with the Structural Funds, before it can publish the Community Support Framework. We can expect publication in about another month or so.</P>
    <P>A National Development Plan was published by the Government last October and a Community Support Framework will be published by the Commission shortly.  The question of the Government publishing a revised plan, as referred to in the motion, does not arise.  There is no question of anybody delaying publication of the Community Support Framework.  Both the Irish and Commission officials involved have been operating throughout on the basis of getting the final document as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil debated this matter in March, I quoted from statements made by Opposition Deputies in 1989 in relation to the previous development plan, in which they forecast that it would not stand up and was likely to be rejected by the EU Commission.  I pointed out that, in the event, the Community Support Framework was successfully negotiated with the EC Commission.  The strategies, priorities and measures put forward in the plan were reflected, with little change, in the Community Support Framework.  Implementation of the Community Support Framework was carried through extremely successfully, as is now universally acknowledged.  It has been the subject of independent evaluation with very positive results being reported.  The European Commission has also recognised the success of that Community Support Framework.  Despite this, the Opposition again trotted out solemn assurances that the Government's approach on this occasion could not be sustained and that they would be rejected by the EU Commission.  I said in the Dáil on 8 March that the Opposition was proved wrong in 1989.  Unfortunately, we shall have to wait a few years to see them proved wrong again.  The outcome of the discussions with the Commission on the Community Support <Col N="1182" /> Framework show that this indeed has been the case.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the discussions has been very successful from the Government's point of view.  Its development strategy has been accepted.  It has been possible to maintain its approach of <i>pro rata</i> adjustments to allocations in terms of combined Exchequer and EU aid elements, which was the basis of its approach, with very minor adjustments only.  These adjustments related mainly to items which have been agreed by both sides as priorities warranting reinforcement. At the same time, it has been possible to satisfy the Commission in respect of its priorities for the allocation of the EU aid element within the total expenditure areas.  All of the key elements identified by the Government in the plan have been retained.  The shortfall in EU aid will affect only the pace of development.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, because less aid is being allocated than has been sought against certain schemes or projects, an additional cost is being imposed on the Exchequer.  This is not the case. I have already explained how the total expenditure figures have been reduced to take account of the shortfall in EU aid. The net Exchequer contribution is being maintained on a global basis.  While the net Exchequer cost of some schemes or projects may increase, this is compensated for by increasing the EU aid contribution elsewhere.</P>
    <P>All in all, the result represents a considerable success for the Government. We must now move forward to ensure that we maintain our good record in implementation to ensure the maximum long term return from what has been achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time and giving me an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I support the Minister's amendment and I do not understand the negative attitude of the Opposition in this debate.  By any standards £7.2 billion is a phenomenal sum of money and had it not been for the attitude of the Government in the <Col N="1183" /> negotiations we would not have achieved such success.  As the Minister pointed out, we received more per capita than any of the other 11 member states.  We should recognise what has been achieved.  The Minister also said that the objective of the National Development Plan is to ensure the best long term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs. The development of our infrastructure will make a big contribution.</P>
      <P>As the time available to me is brief I will concentrate on roads as part of the infrastructure and the importance of them to the development of the economy. We have got to recognise the contribution by the European Union over the years to primary roads.  The Government should be complimented that this is the first year since we joined the European Union, money has been obtained for county roads.  I sought such assistance some time ago and I am glad it has been made available this year.</P>
      <P>The second INTERREG programme has been agreed and that is welcome.  In the new programme I understand maritime borders will be included.  Will the Minister ensure that the money is spent on the internal borders because much work remains to be done to ensure we have the maximum opportunity to develop our economy.</P>
      <P>Under the previous INTERREG programme the flagship was the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal project joining the Shannon and the Erne making it the longest waterway in Europe for cruising.  That is a marvellous achievement and will be recognised in history as a tribute to the people who believed in it and ensured its completion.  Last weekend, for the first time, at the boat rally there were 150 boats cruising on the Erne, half of which were from the Shannon. I have no doubt that that development will make a major contribution to the Border area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new INTERREG programme is being implemented I ask the Minister to identify a flagship project and on this occasion I suggest a road east to west, north of Dublin, from Dundalk to Sligo.  There is no major road from east to <Col N="1184" /> west, north of the Dublin-Galway road. This is a glorious opportunity for such a flagship project.  A road from Dundalk to Sligo would open up the Border area for the development of the economy in the region.  I suggest the road should extend to Greenore port which has potential for development.</P>
    <P>The money secured through the National Development Plan represents a splendid achievement and the Government is to be complimented on it.  I cannot understand the negative approach of some people to this sum of money, the largest amount ever.  The Minister and the Department will oversee the spending of it and I have no doubt it will be well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time and allowing me to make a short contribution to the debate.  Due to the short time available to me I am restricted in regard to the number of matters I can mention.  It is appropriate that I join with my colleague from the neighbouring constituency of Cavan-Monaghan in congratulating the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, on their success in negotiating a huge transfer of resources to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>When we debate the well-being of the economy it would be worthwhile if we reflected on the progress made, particularly since we became members of the European Union.  That progress has much to do with the transfer of resources from Community sources.  While we are a limited resourced economy in the context of the European Union it is important not to lose sight of the fact that we have climatic and other advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One significant point is that project selection will continue during the period of the plan.  That reflects the importance of flexibility in decision-making.  Clearly, during the period of any plan priorities and needs may change.  In regard to infrastructural development work the need is consistent.  Two national primary roads, the N1 and the N2 run through my county.  Any person who traverses either of those roads regularly will quickly realise the urgency and the need for huge investment.  Recently, the Dunleer by-pass, <Col N="1185" /> on which a huge sum of money was spent, was completed.  That new motorway has made a significant impact and, dare I say, led to a reduction in the cost of transporting goods on the N1.  The upgrading of roadways is important.  The sum of money we are talking about will ensure that the process of upgrading will continue apace.</P>
    <P>The full benefit will not be reaped until the entire project is completed.  This roadway which will run from Rosslare to Larne will take a number of years to complete and will form a significant part of the infrastructure along the east coast.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop our commercial ports and fishery harbours along the east coast.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, Greenore port at the tip of the Cooley Peninsula is privately, owned and has never received any transfers of resources from State coffers.  In spite of this it has been successful in developing its own infrastructure, providing invaluable employment in the Cooley Peninsula where farming is the main activity.  As a public representative for the area, I realise the importance and significance of this port to the economy of County Louth.  For various reasons it has been particularly busy in recent times but the need for investment is obvious to ensure it operates to maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>Few commentators realise the importance of the fishing industry to County Louth, the smallest county.  It is of particular importance to the coastal village of Clogherhead where two processing plants make an invaluable contribution to job creation in the area.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural development, there has been a dramatic change in the population structure in recent years; there is movement towards the east coast, particularly the greater Dublin area.  As a consequence rural areas are being depopulated.  I hope that all State Departments and agencies will avail of the resources available under the Leader programme as it is vitally important to maintain the population structure and develop the economies of rural areas to ensure that people will continue to live and rear their families in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me.  I support the amendment and the strategies set out in the National Development Plan.  Like the previous speaker, I welcome the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal which connects the Shannon and the Erne.  This is a marvellous example of North-South co-operation and will benefit both parts of the island, in terms of increased employment and tourism.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the public transport investment programme for Dublin city to which the Labour Party attaches priority. The EU assisted investment programme involving £220 million for the greater Dublin area will enable the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative's recommended strategy to be substantially implemented by 1999.  This includes a sum of up to £200 million for the development of a light rail transit network.  In addition, £36 million will be provided for co-financed traffic management measures.  There will also be investment in bus services, other public transport infrastructure and support measures.</P>
      <P>Road developments will not alleviate the problem of urban congestion and need to be accompanied by the development of public transport passenger systems. The specific objectives for the development of a city wide rail system in Dublin include a reduction in traffic congestion in the inner cordon of the city; the facilitation of matching supply and demand in the labour market in the greater Dublin area; a reduction in commuting times in travelling to and from employment, education, other social, economic and commercial purposes; a reduction in road traffic accident costs and other economic, social and environmental disbenefits associated with road traffic congestion and improved access to city centre business districts and international air and seaports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI in its report recommends the development of a light rail system serving Cabinteely along the old Harcourt Street line, Tallaght and Ballymun.  Further possible light rail links are being evaluated by the DTI, including links to Finglas, Clondalkin, Dublin Airport and Swords.  The full light rail system recommended <Col N="1187" /> by the DTI will cost approximately £300 million but it cannot be constructed within the allocation of EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the National Development Plan.  It will be necessary to complete the network over a longer time frame. Detailed work is in progress to determine the optimium combination of light rail links which should be constructed during the period of the plan and decisions will be taken shortly by the Government.  The Government's decision will be influenced by major factors such as the alleviation of congestion, levels of peak and off-peak demand, social need, ease of construction and financial viability.</P>
    <P>There will be disruption of traffic, particularly in the city centre during the construction of the proposed light rail system.  This will require careful planning and consideration to minimise the disruption caused during construction. Every effort will have to be made to ensure that this is kept to the minimum.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to spend a further £20 million on other non-light rail transport works such as integrated ticketing, enhanced inter-change facilities, DART extensions to Bray and Malahide and the upgrading of existing suburban rail services. I welcome the introduction of the Arrow service to the west of the city towards Kildare.  I understand that this will be extended to include the suburban lines on the north side of the city.  The overall cost of these projects will exceed the level of funding provided in the plan. It is essential that the £220 million is allocated carefully to the most effective projects.</P>

      <P>All good shows stand or fall on <i>denouement.</i>  This Structural Funds saga is one of the few shows in town where the audience must wait until the electoral curtain comes down on 9 June before all is revealed.  It is two years since the funds first made their debut as the icing on the Maastricht cake.  A slightly slimmer version was then served up as an inducement to Labour to sign up for partnership with the man that the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, described as &ldquo;the Taoiseach who <Col N="1188" /> talks about consensus but governs behind closed doors&rdquo;.  The words of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs have come back to haunt him.  Those halcyon days of partnership, programmes and probity are over and the doors are again firmly closed.</P>
      <P>Since July last the Government has engaged in a desperate charade where exchange rates, deflators and base rates are juggled with virtuoso proficiency in an attempt to conceal the missing millions. The begging bowl carried to Brussels by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs returned filled more with caveats than with ECUs. For years Fianna Fáil's policy on Europe was simple &mdash; we will sign up for anything provided the price is right, the Single Market, Maastricht or European Monetary Union, just keep the funds rolling in.  They are now left with an enormous shortfall in the funds and without a policy in respect of making up the shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan was conceived in secrecy and born in deceit.  Calls from this side of the House for full consultation when drawing it up were met with silence broken only by the soothing murmurs of, &ldquo;we will only have one bite at the cherry&rdquo; and &ldquo;we must get it right&rdquo;.  They got it badly wrong.  In the 18 months since the Taoiseach emerged from Edinburgh Castle clutching the phantom £8 billion, the funds have become but a shadow of their former self.  First, they dwindled to £7.8 billion, then skipped to £7.2 billion and following the most recent discussions in Brussels they have shrunk still further.  I have been informed by a reliable authority that total receipts for the period 1993-99 will be £6.7 billion.  That figure was calculated on the basis of data provided by the Department of Finance in respect of Ireland's Community Support Framework as well as our share of the Cohesion Fund and the Community initiatives.  I received that information in answer to Dáil questions put down last month.  Is this House and the public being asked to believe that Government Ministers are not privy to the same information? Do Department of Finance officials know something Ministers do not <Col N="1189" /> know or are they just better at arithmetic?</P>
    <P>I would welcome an explanation from the Minister for Finance as to why the Government persists in the tired myth that the cuts in the national plan will amount to &ldquo;only&rdquo; £800 million?  This Government has managed to mislay more than £1 billion before it is even half way through its term of office.  The Minister for the £8 billion is now the Minister for the £6.7 billion, but that does not have the same ring.  Will she be asked to change her job title again in the coming months?  It appears we will have to wait until 9 June to find out.</P>
    <P>We stand to receive a total of £1.291 billion less in Euro funding than budgeted for in the national plan.  To put it in perspective, the plan's five-year budget for local development amounts to £1.143 billion and the amount of the shortfall is already equivalent to £1.291 billion.  I am informed by reliable sources in the European Commission that the Commission is balking at Government revisions of the plan which still do not take account of the full shortfall.  Apparently the Government has still not got it right.</P>
    <P>Funding, or the lack of it, is not the only problem.  Those &ldquo;mere civil servants&rdquo;&mdash; which is how the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, described them &mdash; whom Ministers blithely dismissed only a few months ago are still cavilling at the plan's failure to conform to the parameters laid down by Brussels.  In particular, they are concerned at the lack of additionality in many of the projects and the over-reliance on schemes rather than on permanent job creation and the sustainable development of local communities.  I understand it will be a miracle if the community employment programme is implemented in the fashion originally proposed.  It is my understanding that it is being obstructed and that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Deputy Quinn, knows it will not be approved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs know they are now in danger of being exposed before an increasingly disillusioned public and have decided to postpone publication of <Col N="1190" /> the national plan's final version until after the European elections.  The electorate is being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  The democratic deficit is alive and kicking.</P>
    <P>We already know that, due to miscalculations in high places, the national plan is undergoing radical surgery &mdash; keyhole surgery.  What we do not know and what this Government is afraid to tell the public is which limbs are being amputated. Two weeks ago, when launching his party's Dublin campaign, the Taoiseach informed startled Dubliners that the capital &ldquo;is flourishing as never before&rdquo;.  As evidence he cited the proposed new light rail network and the Tallaght Hospital, both projects which depend on the national plan.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that these projects remain intact?  Will he provide a firm start-up date for the light rail network? Are these yet more will-o'-the-wisp promises destined to evaporate in the post-election ether of pre-election promises?</P>
    <P>On 9 June voters will be asked to pass judgement on this Government's performance on the European stage.  They will be asked to rate a Government which mislays Euro funds, squanders Ireland's voting rights and bows to the ranchers' lobby on every issue from CAP to GATT.  Voters are being asked to judge a Government whose cavalier attitude towards European legislation has already cost approximately 75,000 women their social welfare entitlements.  Is it any wonder that Fianna Fáil and Labour are seeking to avoid embarrassment at the polls by deferring publication of the postoperative national plan?  We now have the unedifying spectacle of Ministers scrambling to plug a growing gap by selling off State assets.  Their fingers are stuck firmly in the dyke, seeking to stem the rising tide of popular dissent.  The parties who entered office promising to &ldquo;encourage greater openness and participation at all levels&rdquo; have fallen on hard times.  They cannot redeem their IOUs and are thus getting rid of the family's silver.  The Trustee Savings Bank and parts of Telecom Éireann are in line for privatisation.  Passports are being sold at knock-down prices.</P>
    <P>When caught out the invariable reaction <Col N="1191" /> of the Government is stout denial followed by a series of reluctant admissions, but their fingerprints are all over the evidence.  The Structural Funds saga bears all the hallmarks of a Government which consistently confuses appearance and substance, hoping that the public will follow suit.</P>
    <P>In the case of Tallaght Hospital, the question at issue is whether the funds dedicated by the plan will be forthcoming, not whether the hospital will proceed because that is irrevocable now. Where will the £70 million be found in the event of some or any of it being obstructed by the Commission?  We do not have answers in that regard.  I had the pleasure today of attending the second sod turning ceremony in Tallaght. I had to fight my way onto the VIP's bus to attend it because as a local TD for the constituency, I was invited to view it by video in the regional technical college while every member of the Labour Party in Dublin, north, west, south and east were at the site.  There were a few members of Fianna Fáil thrown in but they were sparse.  I was more fortunate than the chairman of the county council who was not invited.  It was a joyous occasion for members of the Labour Party.  It was enjoyable, but the manner in which it was handled has left a bad feeling.  It is a major issue that has not been clarified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Kenny raises the question of the light rail network and talks about it as if it was assured.  I cannot understand how a plan that was predicted on £1,300 million more than is now provided can go ahead as if nothing has happened.  The Minister simply refuses to deal with the question.  What his script merely says is that he has explained how the total expenditure figures have been reduced to take account of the shortfall in European Union aid but that the net Exchequer contribution is being maintained on a global basis; that while the net Exchequer costs of some schemes may increase, this is being compensated for by increasing the European Union aid contribution elsewhere.  It is a huge task to make up a deficit of £1,300 million and in all the circumstances we are entitled to know <Col N="1192" /> where the money will come from or, alternatively, what projects are at risk.  I have complaints about the entire balancing of what I can anticipate in the Community Support Framework in regard to the amount that will go to industry. I understand that the community employment programme in its present form is at risk as well as real jobs in TEAM Aer Lingus.  There are 700 or 800 workers from TEAM Aer Lingus outside the gates of Leinster House tonight.  This recently established project enjoyed some spectacular success and employs almost 2,000 people, many of them highly skilled, who left secure employment on the understanding that TEAM Aer Lingus had a very bright future; but they now find themselves staring into the abyss.  The position is that unless they agree to a set of demands by 8 June, the entire TEAM Aer Lingus project is in danger of being closed down.  I understand that the demands include a cut in pay of 16 per cent, an increase in the working week to 48 hours and permission to bring in contract workers from Eastern Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In this indigenous enterprise at the leading edge of technology agreement may not be reached, for whatever reason, to secure its future.  The Government is the shareholder and the issue is whether the capital will be provided.  Great sacrifices were made by the workers in Aer Lingus and I am quite sure the unions will adopt a reasonable approach provided the shareholder is prepared to play its part.  There is no indication that is about to happen.  Will the Minister address that question seriously before we in Dublin are presented with a disaster three times the size of Digital over the next couple of weeks?  This should not be allowed happen.  I believe that if the Minister for Finance was still Minister for Labour, it would not have reached the edge it has now reached and it ought to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I plead with the Minister to see to it that TEAM Aer Lingus is not allowed to go over the brink.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  It was the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, on the urging of the then Deputy McCartin, who instigated the project. Were it not for the £6 million from the IFI which was a direct result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, this project might not have been possible.  It is good to see such a united effort by both jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will the overall cutback of 8.5 per cent affect agriculture?  What impact will it have on the extension of severely handicapped areas or the reclassification of areas not already classified?  For instance, vast areas of hills and bogs in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan are still excluded, whereas the total areas of Counties Galway, Roscommon and Longford are classified.  My constituency colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, mentioned that European funding can be spent on county roads, but unfortunately in my county, Cavan County Council in its wisdom used what little money was available in last year's budget on regional roads.  Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the Sligo to Dundalk road.  If we are trying to bridge the gap between North and South, there should be some red line on this map to show that we are prepared to help to build roads across the Border, with the exception of the one to Belfast. We were promised that £60 million would be spent-on the M2 before the &ldquo;£8 billion&rdquo;, or whatever the figure will be at the end of the day, was negotiated.  We had to employ consultants to ensure that the job could be done, but now that the consultancy has been completed on the by-pass for Carrickmacross and Castleblayney we are told that no funds will be available.  That project would have been a major benefit to the infrastructure of the Monaghan region.  There is no funding available for the major road through County Cavan, yet there are plans for a road from Dundalk to Sligo. <Col N="1194" /> It just shows that they are prepared to bring the people from north Donegal down to Sligo and Longford and that raises questions about the ideas behind the plan.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Leader and INTERREG programmes.  The INTERREG programme is already stretched to the limit, having been extended into Longford, Roscommon and Meath. It is proposed to extend the Leader programme throughout the country; even though a larger sum will be available, it will be spread over a longer period and may lose its impact.  If ports are to be included in the INTERREG programme, it will mean that very little funding will be available to the Border region for which it was intended originally.  Will the Minister for Finance give serious consideration to the Border regions, an area that has been devastated, and ensure that the moneys allocated to it from Europe are spent in them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  The Minister in his speech referred to the fact that this is just one of the many occasions since last July that we have debated the National Development Plan.  The point of this debate is a focused one, namely: why the Government has failed to publish the Community Support Framework before polling day on Thursday, 9 June? The Government failed to publish the programme simply because it will reveal that the expenditure programmes will not be able to match those set out in the plan. It wishes to deliberately avoid the wrath of voters on 9 June because it knows the National Plan is a work of economic fiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are clear.  I have checked the Official Report meticulously.  We were told by the Minister that in April European Commission officials reached agreement with the Government on the major components of the Community Support Framework.  More than a dozen detailed operational programmes were submitted that month.  The European regulations state that the member state and the Commission shall reach agreement on the Structural Funds within six months of the plan being submitted.  Our plan was <Col N="1195" /> submitted last October.  There is no logical administrative reason why the Community Support Framework should not have been published before 9 June.  No amount of proof reading, validation of statistics or textual adjustments can explain this delay.  The explanation is that this publication will expose the Government to further humiliation as projects will have to be dropped or rescheduled. We know that the human resources and training area of the plan, which involve a figure of more than £3.1 billion have been questioned.  Many projects, including the Tallaght Hospital, the light rail project and the turf burning generating station in the Midlands, have been seriously questioned, as has the funding for county roads.  The Government is deliberately concealing from the public the final outcome of those projects by keeping them in the dark until well after the count is over.  The taxpayer will be asked to pay for the Government's vanity by making up the shortfall in European co-finance.  The only constant factor in the Government's handling of this sorry saga has been its false claims, deceit and an attempt to manipulate the facts. Voters should be highly sceptical of the Government's silence on this issue.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the Minister's comments about the publication date on 1 March in reply to five Private Notice Questions. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework, when agreed, will be published. In the case of the development plan [published in July 1993] discussions on the Irish Community Support Framework are well advanced by reference to progress of the Community Support Frameworks generally and I expect them to be concluded over the next month or so.  Discussions on the operational programmes are proceeding in parallel with those of the Community Support Framework with a view to having the programmes approved at the same time or shortly after the adoption of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>Discussions were expected to be concluded a month or so after 1 March, but <Col N="1196" /> 1 April and 1 May have come and gone and today is 1 June.  I was canvassing for the by-elections this morning and was not here last night, but I dug out of the Minister of State's speech the reason for the delay.  It states that the final items, relating to matters such as completion of the list of development indicators to be included, verification of some statistics and fine tuning of the text, are being wrapped up.  If ever I saw weak subterfuge, that is it.  Some statistics and development indicators appear to be holding it up for three months, but this has been home and hosed.  The projects to be axed are known by the Minister and the officials of the Department of Finance.  The rescheduling of the programmes is known, but it is being kept under wraps deliberately by a mushroom policy for the public &mdash; feeding it manure and keeping it in the dark so that it will not know what will happen.  That is the culmination of the sorry saga of the Government's handling of the matter.</P>
    <P>I will briefly go through the potted history of this matter.  In May 1992, during the Maastricht campaign, the Taoiseach promised £6 billion over four and a half years.  At the December 1992 Summit in Edinburgh the Taoiseach, who was on the rack, having lost more than ten seats and facing annihilation and his political demise, said he had £8 billion over seven years in the bag.  He repeated that on 16 December in the Dáil.  In May and June 1993 the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste promised to use a veto if Ireland did not get the £8 billion.  In January 1993 there was an 8 per cent devaluation, which should have topped up the funds, as we will be paid in ECUs.  The Minister for Finance might forget that fateful night on 20 July on the tenth floor of the Berlaymont building, when Jacques Delors was totally confused about whether the meetings were on or off and reality began to dawn.  The next day on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Tánaiste announced an agreement of £7.84 billion over seven years.  On 11 October the National Plan was published, which assumes a figure of £8 billion.  The moment of truth came on 21 October. The Commission announced the allocation of £7.2 billion and the Taoiseach <Col N="1197" /> and the Tánaiste continually claim the Government will draw down more than £8 billion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, denied the need to adjust the plan to take account of the shortfall of £800 million.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, accused EU officials of being mere civil servants and dressed down Mr. Landeburu.  In February the Minister for Finance denied there was a problem with the plan and the Taoiseach said a new plan was not required.  On 1 March we heard the first admission that the plan would have to be adjusted by way of dropping programmes.</P>
    <P>That is the sad and sorry history of this matter.  The public will not know the fallout of the Government's incompetence until after the polls have closed. The Government should have done the decent thing.  It is good at lining up press conferences, getting the logo in the background, the soft fade shot, getting out the glossy brochures, turning the sod, getting the shiny shovel, cutting the tape and making the nice sweetheart announcement time after time.  It was very significant, even in the run up to this election, that it was left to backbenchers like Deputy Seán Kenny to make announcements about the light rail project for Dublin.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, has not cut a tape for it. The sod has not been turned for the turf burning station, because the project will not go ahead as it has not been paid for.</P>
    <P>Let us put this matter in terms people will understand.  The Minister was right when he said the shortfall this year was £130 million, equivalent to one year's proceeds of the 1 per cent income levy. The Minister cannot have it both ways. The Minister said tonight that it has been suggested that because less aid is being allocated to certain schemes or projects, an additional cost is being imposed on the Exchequer.  He said that is not the case.  He went on to say that there would be no reduction in expenditure.  It is not possible to perform the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  If there is a shortfall of £800 million &mdash; some people have said £1,200 million &mdash; the Government cannot <Col N="1198" /> impose a charge on the Exchequer.  The Taoiseach has said the plan will not be watered down so it is magic money.</P>
    <P>Where will the axe fall?  During the debate Deputies said incorrectly &mdash; and it is a common misconception &mdash; that we are getting more money than ever before. That is not true.  In 1993 our money peaked at £100 million less then £1.2 billion a year.  Unlike the Spanish, who got their figure in writing, and the Portuguese, who got their plan fully approved, the Irish made a mess of it. The Government succeeded in snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.  It added insult to injury in respect of the Irish public, who will be asked not only to pay for the shortfall and will get only key projects, but it will not know the deliberate damage caused, because information will be concealed until after polling day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this matter and the Minister for coming into the House to reply.  This is an important issue for a small number of people but that does not mean it is not relevant to this House. Students doing radiography courses in Jordanstown, Belfast, must go on placement during the summer months to various hospitals in the North, including the Royal Victoria Hospital.  This is part of their course and they do not have a choice in this matter.  Although Northern Ireland students who are on local authority grants for the rest of the year get a placement grant to do this course, students attending from the Republic of Ireland do not.  It does not make any difference that students are on county council grants for the rest of the year, they still get no placement grant for the summer.  How are these students expected to live?  They do not get paid for their work in the hospitals because it is part of their course.  They cannot take <Col N="1199" /> up a summer job to earn some money because they have to be on placement.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious situation for these young students, many of whom go to the North to study because, coming from middle income families, they are not eligible for grants in the South.  They take the opportunity of free tuition in the North in order to be educated.  If, instead of going on to third level education, they went on the dole queue here, they would be supported and given what help they needed.  If they took a flat in a town they would also get support towards paying the rent.  It is difficult to understand, therefore, how some mechanism cannot be found to help this small number of young people who are making every effort to further their own education. They should be supported for the small amount of money it would cost.  We spoke for hours about the billions that come from Europe and many millions of pounds are spent on education.  If it were not for the support they get towards their tuition in the North many of these students would not be in college.  I ask, therefore, that funds be provided for placement grants such as those which their counterparts in the North get. Otherwise there will be extraordinary pressure on some low and middle income families.  That is not fair and should not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond to the Deputy on this matter though I have more experience of responding to him on other matters.  I would initially like to state that there is no provision under our student support schemes for the payment of placement grants irrespective of where the course is being undertaken.  If such a provision were to be introduced in our student support schemes it would have to be made available to all our recipients of student grant-aid, not just those in a particular category such as those pursuing courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials have been in contact with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to obtain information on the placement grants referred to by <Col N="1200" /> the Deputy.  However, in the time available it has not been possible to ascertain the nature of the entitlements in question, which agency pays them or how they relate to the student support system in Northern Ireland.  The Department will be continuing its inquiries.</P>
    <P>Equity demands that the grant holders referred to by the Deputy be in receipt of the same level of grants as their counterparts who are studying in the Republic and the Deputy can be assured that this is the case.  Clearly it could not be the objective of our student support schemes to assist students from the Republic who are studying in the North on the basis of the student support schemes which apply to students from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general principles applied by the Department when dealing with applications from students who wish to qualify for continued grant-aid while involved in off-campus work is as follows.  Where students are required, as an integral part of their course, to go on placement for further training-work experience, the Department in general allows payment of maintenance grant-aid to continue where the placement is short-term &mdash; up to two terms duration.  Where placement exceeds two terms the Department would decide whether to continue grant-aid on the basis of the type of course in question, whether the student remained registered in college, the amount and source, if any, of any remuneration outside the grants schemes.</P>
    <P>The amount of the annual maintenance grants payable to individual students under the third level student support schemes cannot in any circumstances exceed the maximum set out in the schemes.  For administrative reason the maintenance grant is paid in three equal instalments by the local authorities &mdash; vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I trust that the foregoing explains the position satisfactorily to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There are further inquiries under way to ascertain the position that obtains in Northern Ireland and I am sure the Department of Education will be in contact with the Deputy on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 June 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 27 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Government has consistently and forcefully condemned human rights abuses in East Timor and we have used all avenues open to us to bring this concern to the attention of the Indonesian authorities and to see action at international level.</P>
      <P>Bilaterally we have conveyed our concerns directly to the Indonesian Government. I have written to the Indonesian Foreign Minister.  My Department has taken up the matter with representatives of the Indonesian Embassy.  Officials of my Department have frequently met with individuals and representatives of groups concerned with the human rights situation in East Timor.  Most recently Ireland's Ambassador to Indonesia, who is resident in Canberra, has visited Djakarta and has made further representations directly to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry.  In addition, I maintain close contact with my colleague the Foreign Minister of Portugal who is engaged in discussions with his Indonesian counterpart under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General.</P>
      <P>At the international level Ireland has been active at the UN Commission on Human Rights and within the European Union in pressing for action to improve the human rights situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the most recent meeting on 6 May between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers the UN Secretary-General said that he was encouraged that there will be increased access to East Timor for the United Nations, for human rights and humanitarian organisations, as well as for journalists.  The two Ministers agreed <Col N="1060" /> that such access and visits should be continued and further expanded.</P>
    <P>In the light of the actions I have just outlined the Indonesian Government can be in no doubt about the deep concern of the Irish Government and people at the situation in East Timor.  We will continue to press the Indonesian authorities to co-operate with the international community and to allow improved access to East Timor.  I have no plans at the moment to send a delegation from Ireland to East Timor but I am considering a visit there by an official from our Embassy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the Government decided that personal assistants and special advisers in Ministers' offices were free to engage in political activity and stand for election. This has remained the position since.</P>
      <P>Programme managers who are not established civil servants are regarded as special advisers for these purposes and as such are free to engage in such activity and to stand for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> This has been the policy of successive Governments and there is no need to change the Ethics in Public Office Bill to accommodate this arrangement.</P>
    <P>As regards possible conflicts of interest, the Ethics in Public Office Bill provides for full disclosure, on an annual basis, by senior special advisers of their own interests and those of a spouse or child which could materially affect them in the performance of their functions.  In the case of their own interests, a statement of these would be laid before both Houses, while any relevant interests of a spouse or child would be furnished to the independent Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition, a special adviser about to perform a function in respect of which he or she or any connected person (e.g. a spouse or child or close relative or business partner etc.) had a material interest, would have to disclose that fact and would be prohibited from performing that function unless there were compelling reasons requiring this.  These compelling reasons would have to be explained in writing to the independent Commission.</P>
    <P>In other words any actual potential conflict of interest would have to be disclosed and the matter could then be resolved in a way which would safeguard the public interest.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that any special adviser who failed to meet any of the requirements which I have described would be in breach of the terms of his or her employment, and appropriate sanctions could be invoked against such a person.</P>
    <P>With these arrangements in place, I am confident that any conflict of interest situation arising could be identified and resolved.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Sargent's question, the Ethics in Public Office Bill makes provision for the confidential disclosure by the holders of designated directorships and positions of employment in public bodies, including health boards, harbour authorities and vocational education committees, of their own interests and those of spouses and children and other connected persons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 28 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>In its strategy plan for Irish aid the Government recognised that once a democratic government had been established in South Africa, there would be an urgent need for expanded support, especially in the fields of education and public administration.  Now that the elections have taken place we are stepping up the level of assistance to South Africa. A planning mission was undertaken by officials of the Irish aid programme in April and it has been decided to assist South Africa in the following ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-Governmental Organisations: Increased funding will be made available to the NGOs, including missionaries, who have been doing vital work at the grassroots level among the black population. Projects to be assisted include the <Col N="1064" /> improvement of community facilities in the townships, support for clinics and housing in Soweto, and assistance with schools equipment and buildings.</P>
    <P>Training: I am happy to report that, following consultations with the ANC to identify suitable candidates for a training programme in Ireland for administrators, 30 trainees will come to Ireland later this month for a course in public administration and management at the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>Third level education: We will support efforts to improve the access of black people to university education.  In particular we will assist the University of the North, provide support for the Independent Examinations Board and offer a number of bursaries to facilitate the enrolment of black students from deprived areas.</P>
    <P>Local Government: Irish aid has been asked to assist in the establishment of the new provincial administrations in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The cost of this programme of assistance, which will be administered through our Embassy in Pretoria, is likely to be of the order of a half million pounds in 1994.  In addition, Ireland has played its part fully in supporting the process of democratisation through the sending of election observers and other forms of assistance.</P>
    <P>I believe that the projects we are undertaking offer appropriate support for the transition to non-racial, democratic Government in South Africa, and I am satisfied that this support is directed where it is most needed: to enable the black majority to recover from its heavily disadvantaged position under the apartheid regime and to up-grade living conditions among the poorest sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The allocation for this year is, of course, a medium rather than a long term measure designed to support the transition to democratic government which is currently under way.  A longer term programme for South Africa will be considered in co-operation with the new democratic Government of South Africa.</P>

      <P>Ireland is following closely the situation in Mozambique in the run-up to the elections, scheduled to take place on 28-29 October next.  We recognise that Mozambique, as one of the poorest countries in the world, is in need of immediate assistance during the rehabilitation period and of longer-term development aid.  The Government of Mozambique have particular needs at the present time because of the requirement to finance elections and to demobilise troops.  The contribution which Ireland and our partners in the European Union will make to the electoral process in Mozambique is under active consideration.</P>
      <P>In so far as development co-operation assistance is concerned, the Irish Aid Strategy Plan published in July 1993 identified Mozambique as a country in particular need of rehabilitation and development in which the possibility of establishing a full co-operation programme in the coming years should be examined.  In the meantime, a budget of £600,000 has been allocated for 1994 to enable Ireland to participate in the international rehabilitation programme in Mozambique this year.</P>
      <P>Following a visit to Mozambique in March by an Irish aid planning mission, this money has now been committed to five projects in the following areas; rural water supply, health training, rural development, de-mining and small scale fisheries.  These projects will enable us to extend immediate assistance during the rehabilitation period.  We will examine at a later stage the question of longer-term development aid for Mozambique.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 45 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Sudan remains serious and continues to be a matter of concern to the Irish Government and to our partners in the European Union.  Civil war continues unabated in the southern part of the country despite the efforts underway to try to bring an end to the fighting.</P>
      <P>The Heads of State of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, under the mandate given to them at the Inter-Government Authority on Drought and Development, IGADD, Summit in September 1993, are seeking a negotiated and lasting solution to the conflict in Sudan.  Under the IGADD initiative, a series of talks have been held between the Government of Sudan and the southern factions.  The latest round of talks took place on 19 and 20 May in Nairobi and talks will resume again on 18 July.  The European Union has expressed its full support for the initiative.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to monitor the political situation in Sudan closely and will, together with our European Union partners, continue to lend our support to any initiative that could bring peace to Sudan.  The Government is gravely concerned at the humanitarian situation in Sudan and an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs visited the region in March to assess the situation at first hand. In the light of the conclusions of the official level mission, the Government decided to disburse £515,000 from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund in support of applications received from both Irish and international aid agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far this year the Government has received a total of six appeals for emergency funding in Sudan.  All of these appeals have been evaluated by my officials and positive funding decisions have been recommended in all six cases.  The <Col N="1068" /> funding has been channelled through Irish voluntary agencies such as GOAL, Trócaire and Christian Aid for their respective emergency health and feeding programmes.  In addition, we have channelled assistance to World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Red Cross for their relief efforts in the context of Operation Lifeline Sudan.  The Government continues to monitor the humanitarian situation in Sudan closely and will sympathetically consider further appeals for emergency funding.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing humanitarian assistance and food aid, Ireland has had a bilaterial aid programme in Sudan since 1975.  The projects within this programme are focused on addressing the basic development needs of rural villagers in the central state region.  Assistance is being provided in such areas as primary health care, water supply, renovation of schools, clinics and hospitals, and community forestry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>China has been a member of the United Nations since the foundation of the organisation in 1945.  Up to 1971 it was represented by the Nationalist Government in Taipei.  Since then, following the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 2758, the Government <Col N="1069" /> of the People's Republic of China has been the sole occupant of China's seat.</P>
    <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 we recognised the Government of the PRC as the sole legal Government of China.  There are no proposals under consideration to change these agreements.</P>
    <P>We welcome the application from the People's Republic of China and from Taiwan for membership of GATT. Working parties are currently examining these applications with a view to negotiating with the applicants the terms of conditions of membership.  European Union policy, which Ireland supports, is aimed at processing the applications for China and Taiwan in parallel, with China acceding first.  We recognise the importance of both China and Taiwan to international trade and look forward to an early completion of the negotiations which will result in their membership of GATT and of the new World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>The economic contribution that can be made by Taiwan on an international level is being recognised by the PRC's acceptance that Taiwan will accede to GATT following the PRC's own accession.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The cost of a standard 10 year Irish passport is IR£45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible, in the time available, to complete a general international <Col N="1070" /> survey of standard passport fees.  The costs in EU member states are set out in the following tabular statement.  As the validity period of standard passports varies between member states, this is also indicated.  The ECU equivalents quoted are calculated on the basis of the exchange rates applicable on 27 May 1994.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of variations in the passport validity periods between member states, the Irish passport ranks fifth in the cost of standard passports issued in the EU.  It should be noted, however, in the case of Italy, that in addition to the standard passport fee of L8,800, ecu 4.72, there is also a government tax of L60,000, ecu 32.15, per year which must be paid for travel outside the EU.</P>

      <P>Representations have been and will continue to be made to the Chinese authorities by Ireland and our EU partners concerning Tibet and the human rights situation there, including <Col N="1071" /> the compelling of political prisoners to carry out hard labour whatever the state of their health.</P>
      <P>One year ago EU Ambassadors in Beijing, including the Irish Ambassador, visited Tibet and raised these issues on that occasion.  They presented lists of Tibetan political prisoners to the authorities in Tibet including the cases of three Tibetans who were arrested shortly before the Ambassadors' arrival.  Those three individuals have since been released but I must express deep concern at continuing reports of the arrest and imprisonment of Tibetans in recent months.</P>
      <P>During the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights earlier this year, we together with our EU partners once again declared our concern at the reports of widespread violations of human rights and restrictions of fundamental freedoms in China including Tibet.  We and our partners proposed a draft resolution expressing concern at human rights violations in China as well as inadequate protection of the distinct cultural, religious and ethnic identity of the Tibetans but China was successful in moving a no action motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland was an original signatory, in 1981, of the Convention on &ldquo;prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects&rdquo;.  The Government strongly supports its provisions, while recognising that the convention needs to be updated to remove certain loopholes.  The convention <Col N="1072" /> prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.</P>
      <P>A review conference on the convention will take place in 1995, and Ireland recently participated as a signatory state at the Preparatory Commission in Geneva, which is preparing for the review conference.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with several of our partners, is taking steps to ratify the convention, and it is my hope that we will be in a position to participate in the review conference next year, as a state party to the convention.</P>
      <P>Ireland has recently made available £300,000 to speed up the process of demining in Cambodia.  This funding will be channelled through Concern and will be used for removing mines in the Pursat region where Concern has a number of development projects.</P>
      <P>Like all the Members of this House, I deplore the totally unnecessary pain, suffering and loss of life caused by these devices.  Ireland's position on the question of land mines was made clear in the UN General Assembly in 1993, where we co-sponsored all three resolutions on the issue: (i) General Assembly Resolution 48/7, an initiative of the European Union, adopted unanimously by the Plenary of the General Assembly on 19 October 1993.  This highlighted the importance of UN co-ordination of activities related to mine clearing, and called on the Secretary General to submit a comprehensive report on the problems caused by mines and other unexploded devices; (ii) Resolution 48/75K, which called on all states to introduce a moratorium on the export of land mines; and (iii) Resolution 48/79, which supported the convening of a Review Conference to strengthen the &ldquo;Inhumane Weapons Convention&rdquo;.</P>

      <Quest>in regard to the Taoiseach's speech at the dinner of the Institute of European Affairs on 14 April 1994, the proposals, if any, the Government intends to put forward regarding altered voting rights and other institutional changes in an enlarged European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Taoiseach's speech to the Institute of European Affairs referred to possible future institutional changes in the European Union which will be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of the member states in 1996.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting at Corfu later this month will agree to the establishment of a reflection group of representatives of Foreign Ministers to prepare the agenda for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  This group will begin its work in mid 1995 after the completion of a report on the operation of the Maastricht Treaty prepared by the Council together with the Commission and the European Parliament.  The report will serve as an input into the work of the Reflection Group.</P>
      <P>Among the institutional issues to be considered by the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference are the weighting of votes in the Council and the threshold required for the achievement of a qualified majority; the powers and the future size of the European parliament and the number of members of the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty is in force for little more than six months and for this reason it would be premature to draw conclusions at this stage as to the detail of future institutional change.  However it is clear that the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference will consider a number of institutional issues including qualified majority voting in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the guiding principles governing Ireland's approach to the voting <Col N="1076" /> issue at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference which was mentioned by the Taoiseach in his speech to the IEA is the preservation of the balance which has been struck between the large and small member states in the institutions of the Union.  This balance, unique among groupings of states, has played a very important part in the development of first, the European Community and now of the European Union.</P>
    <P>A Union which continues to operate efficiently is in Ireland's interest. However any adaptations to the institutions which may have to be made in 1996 in the interests of efficiency in an enlarged Union should not in our view call this balance into question.</P>

      <P>Ireland's expenditure on overseas development assistance amounted to £53.5 million in 1993 which was equivalent to 0.19 per cent of GNP.  Expenditure in 1994 is expected to amount to £70 million which will be equivalent to 0.24 per cent of forecast GNP.  Details of the distribution of ODA are set out in the attached table.  In 1993 approximately 66 per cent of ODA came from the Vote for International Co-operation and in 1994 it will be around 73 per cent.  ODA also includes expenditure from Central Funds and from Votes of other Departments.</P>
      <P>Of the total of £53.5 million devoted to ODA in 1993, £27 million went to Multilateral Assistance and £26.5 million to the bilateral assistance programme.  In 1994, Multilateral Assistance accounted for £30.3 million and Bilateral Assistance for £39.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's bilateral aid programme, concentrates on six priority countries; <Col N="1077" /> Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda.  Ethiopia and Uganda were added to the list of priority countries in 1994.  The programmes cover such diverse activities as rural development, agriculture, forestry, income generation, institution building and the provision of basic needs such as water, sanitation, primary health care and primary education.  Individual project details are available in the report, &ldquo;Ireland's Official Development Assistance&rdquo; which is published annually by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Government has allocated a total of £437,500 from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund to UNICEF since May 1992: £152,500 in 1992, £235,000 in 1993 and £50,000 to date in 1994.  A more detailed breakdown of the emergency projects funded over this period of 24 months is set out below.</P>
      <P>In September 1992 £100,000 was allocated to UNICEF Ireland to assist an emergency feeding programme with malnourished children in Somalia.  In December 1992 £52,500 was given to UNICEF's emergency programme in Mozambique, and their emergency health and nutrition programme in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1993 £100,000 was given to UNICEF health, nutrition and water project as part of Operation LIFELINE Sudan (OLS).  In December 1993 a further £95,000 was disbursed to UNICEF for a primary health care and vaccination programme for refugee children in the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia &mdash; as part of the ECU 300,000 pledged at the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992 &mdash; and £40,000 was given to assist the UNICEF emergency <Col N="1078" /> programme for displaced children in Armenia.</P>
    <P>In March 1994, the Government allocated £50,000 to UNICEF Ireland to assist their ongoing health and nutrition relief programme in Southern Sudan in the context of the United Nations Operation LIFELINE Sudan (OLS).</P>
    <P>The Government does not require UNICEF to submit specific progress reports of the emergency projects which we part-fund with other donor countries. UNICEF submit general reports of their global operations and we are confident that the emergency assistance channelled to UNICEF in both Africa and the former Yugoslavia Republics has reached children in need.</P>

      <P>Passport issuing time varies depending on whether the application is by post or in person and on a number of other factors, including for example the degree of urgency involved. Prior to the introduction of the new computer system in the Passport Office in September 1993 many of the processes involved in issuing a passport were manually based and the detailed statistics necessary to respond acurately to the Deputy's question were not maintained. It would not be practicable, having regard to the time available and the inordinate commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved, to compile the information requested at this stage.</P>

      <P>The term of office of the members of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union expires on 20 September 1994. Under the European Community Treaty, the Council acting unanimously appoints the members of the committee for a four year term.  The process of consultation on the nomination of the Irish candidates is in progress with a view to presenting the list of candidates and alternates to the Council.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in selecting candidates is to ensure that they are broadly representative of the economic and social sectors in Irish society in keeping with the terms of the Treaty.  Under the present arrangements, three members nominated by the trade union movement represent labour, three represent employers and are nominated by the employers' bodies, two represent agriculture and are nominated by the farmers' organisations, one represents the social sector, nominated by Muintir na Tíre.</P>
      <P>The Treaty provides that the members of the committee may not be bound by any mandatory instructions and shall be completely independent in the performance of their duties.  To demand that the Irish members should be accountable for their actions on the committee would both undermine the independence of the committee and be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty.</P>

In the Head Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes there are five specialist inspectors dedicated to anti-avoidance work and 16 Investigation Branch Inspectors dedicated to anti-fraud work.  Because of the volume and size of cases the work of these officers primarily relates to the Dublin area.  In addition, there are 150 inspectors and 103 others also engaged on audit and compliance outdoor operations in the Dublin area.  Their functions include identifying and dealing with tax avoidance and fraudulent tax evasion in that area.</P>

      <P>Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 requires that an endorsement on a driving licence must remain during a continuous period of not less than three years, or a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years during which a person has lawfully held a driving licence.  This person held a provisional licence from 13 May 1991 to 12 May 1993, but did not surrender it for endorsement until 15 August 1991, and did not renew it until 13 July 1993.  He acquired a full licence on 14 April 1994.  Under current law, therefore, he would not be eligible for a licence clear of endorsement until July 1996.  However, the Road Traffic Act, 1994 which was enacted on 20 April 1994 will change the law to provide for a period of three years endorsement in the case of either continuous or discontinuous periods during which a person has held a valid licence.  The effect of this in the present case would be that this person would be entitled to a licence clear of endorsement in October 1994.  I will commence the relevant provisions of the 1994 Act as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has received a request for a shared remedial teacher from the school in question.  This request was considered in connection with the allocation of an additional 100 remedial posts for primary schools, which will bring the total in place to 1,133.</P>
      <P>The posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's Primary Inspectorate. Unfortunately, the school mentioned by the Deputy was not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>However, I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint a substantial number of additional teachers in the coming years.</P>

      <P>My Department sanctioned a grant in September 1992 in respect of the replacement of decayed windows and doors at Kilmuckridge national school, County Wexford.  This grant was not availed of by the school authorities, who were seeking an increase in the grant approved in order to replace all of the windows at the school.  My Department considered that the remaining windows were in a satisfactory state of repair and <Col N="1100" /> did not require replacement at that juncture. My Department is however awaiting a further report from its local professional advisers on the present condition of these windows and when this has been received and considered a decision in the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The school authorities also applied under Circular 8/93 issued April 1993, for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socioeconomic criteria.</P>
      <P>Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of the Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools.</P>
      <P>As I recently announced in the context of the 1994 education budget, I intend that a further 50 primary schools will be designated as disadvantaged for capitation grant purposes in the current year.</P>
      <P>The case for this school, together with all other applicant schools, will be considered in this context.</P>
