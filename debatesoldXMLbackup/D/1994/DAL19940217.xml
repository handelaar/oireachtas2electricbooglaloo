      <P>Will it be possible for the House to provide a period to deal with the Committee Stage specifically? There is not a specific provision here and it is quite possible that the Second Stage debate may take up the whole time.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for offical registration of stillbirths.  There are more than 300 stillbirths each year in Ireland, or about six in every 1,000 births. A stillbirth can have a very powerful impact on the lives of the parents involved.  It is an event which can create great loneliness and shock.  There is ample testimony of the trauma and sense of loss which parents can experience following a stillbirth.  In some cases, parents can experience long term suffering as a result of the stillbirth.</P>
    <P>One of the significant developments in psychology in recent years has been recognition of the need to grieve as part of the healing process.  Research evidence is accumulating which concludes that an important facet of the process of coming to terms with, or adapting to, any loss involves recognition and acknowledgement of the person who has died. This acknowledgement facilitates appropriate grieving after the loss.  It is associated with more positive adaptation to the loss and far better long term psychological outcomes.</P>
    <P>The parents of stillborn children here receive no official recognition of the existence of their stillborn child.  There is some form of civil registration of stillbirths in most, if not all, other European Union countries.  In Ireland, there have been calls from many quarters for the establishment of a stillbirths register. Bereaved parents, and in particular the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, ISANDS, has been campaigning on this issue for some time.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women also recommended that a stillbirths register be established.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a stillbirths register, as proposed in the Bill, will not only bring this country into line with other European Union countries but, more importantly, will provide tangible evidence for parents of the existence of their stillborn child.  The register will thus serve as a focus for the memories of bereaved parents and help them to come to terms with their loss.</P>
    <P>My approach to this Bill has been shaped by two considerations.  On the <Col N="11" /> one hand, the rationale for stillbirths registration is essentially therapeutic. Stillbirths registration is primarily intended to comfort grieving parents rather than to serve an evidential or statistical purpose.  Statistics on stillbirths are already compiled by the Central Statistics Office and by the Department of Health. Given its therapeutic rationale, the stillbirths registration system should not be unduly bureaucratic or impose additional burdens on bereaved parents. On the other hand, if an official register is to be created, some procedural formality is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the information recorded.  The Bill aims to combine sensitivity to the needs of bereaved parents with the formality appropriate to a part of the civil registration system.</P>
    <P>I have given considerable thought to the definition of a stillbirth to be included in the Bill.  A stillborn child is a child born dead but viable outside the womb. There is, however, no universally accepted medical definition of what constitutes viability.  In some countries the demarcation between a miscarriage and a stillbirth is based on gestational age. The gestational age used was typically 28 weeks, but because of advances in medical care this has been reducing. Twenty-four weeks is now the threshold for stillbirths registration in the UK. Other countries base their definition on the weight of the child, 500 grammes being the normal weight used.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for either criterion. Weight is regarded as more definitive than gestational age, which can be difficult to assess.  Weight is also the World Health Organisation's preferred criterion. On the other hand, gestational age reflects parents' expectations about the outcome of pregnancy more accurately than weight, which is typically unknown.  My view is that since the main reason for establishing a register is to comfort grieving parents, the definition of a stillbirth in the Bill should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms.  I have therefore provided in section 1 that the Bill will apply to a <Col N="12" /> child which is born dead and which either weighs a minimum of 500 grammes or has a minimum gestational age of 24 weeks.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the Bill is about registration of stillbirths and that the registration of miscarriages is not within its scope.  There is an acknowledged difference between a stillbirth, which is a child born dead but viable outside the womb, and a miscarriage, where the pregnancy ends before viability is reached.  The registration systems in other European Union countries draw a line between a stillbirth, which is registrable, and a miscarriage, which is not. While I recognise that a miscarriage can be a source of distress and disappointment to the parents involved, this Bill is dealing with the question of stillbirths registration.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the registration of stillbirths within the existing organisational framework for registration of births, deaths and marriages. In other words, responsibility for the registration of stillbirths would be assumed by the Registrar-General, superintendent-registrars and the 300 local registrars.  A stillbirth will therefore be registered at local level as is a birth or death.</P>
    <P>As the stillbirths register is an official one and as certificates will be provided to parents, it is important the information held on the register be accurate.  I have therefore provided in section 5 that where the parents of the stillborn child are not married to each other, the procedural formalities for recording the father's name on the register will be the same as for a live birth.  These procedures are set out in section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880, as amended by section 49 of the Status of Children Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that registration will be compulsory in the case of stillbirths which occur on or after the commencement of this Bill.  Compulsory registration of stillbirths is the norm in other jurisdictions.  By making registration compulsory I believe that we assert the offical character and status of the register and thereby reinforce the <Col N="13" /> reality of the stillborn child, particularly as perceived from the parents' point of view.  I recognise, however, that it would not be appropriate to add to the grief of the parents by imposing a duty on them to inform the registrar of a stillbirth or by pursuing them for failure to do so. Section 6 provides an option for the parents to inform the registrar of the stillbirth if they wish.  If the parents do not choose to inform the local registrar themselves within a specified period, then the duty to inform the registrar will fall to the relevant hospital or, where no hospital is involved, to the relevant medical practitioner.  This procedure will ensure that registration is comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision, in section 7, for retrospective registration of stillbirths. A stillbirth which occurred at any time before the commencement of the Bill may be registered at the request of either parent and subject to the production of satisfactory supporting documentation. This degree of retrospection is unusual in legislation but I am conscious of the fact that the suffering of bereaved parents of stillborn children can last for a long time, even for decades. In the absence of retrospection this Bill would come too late for many people.  I believe that a compassionate approach requires that we facilitate those who want official recognition of past stillbirths. Such retrospective registration will, of course, be entirely voluntary as it would be neither practical nor desirable to make registration of past stillbirths compulsory.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with stillbirths registers.  Information held on these registers will not be accessible to the public.  This differs from the position in relation to birth and death certificates, where any member of the public is entitled to search indexes of registers and is entitled to obtain any certificate simply by paying the required fee.  In the case of stillbirths no public interest would be served by having the information on the registers open to the public and, given the relatively small number of stillbirths each year, an openly accessible register <Col N="14" /> could be seen as an invasion of the privacy of the person concerned.  The registers of stillbirths here, like those in the UK and Northern Ireland, will be private.</P>
    <P>A certificate of a stillbirth will be available to the parents of the stillborn child, either at registration, if the parents choose to notify the registrar themselves, or subsequently, subject to verification of the parents' identity.  Stillbirth certificates will otherwise be made available only at the discretion of the Registrar-General. The fee will be the same as for a birth certificate.  The format of the stillbirth certificate, which is detailed in the Schedule to the Bill, will resemble that of a birth certificate but will include information on the weight and gestational age of the the child together with information on both the mother's and the father's occupation and other personal details in line with the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  This format will be the same for all stillbirths regardless of when they occurred.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will be received positively in the House.  The campaign for a register of stillbirths has been in train for some considerable time.  I am very pleased to be able to introduce this measure and I look forward to constructive contributions to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concluded his remarks by saying that he hopes this Bill will be received positively in the House.  I am sure that will be the case. When the Bill was debated in the Seanad the Minister's proposals were warmly welcomed by all parties.  I wish to be associated with the comments made in the Seanad, where the Minister was complimented on introducing this important legislation.  For ten years or so groups such as ISANDS &mdash; the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society &mdash; have been lobbying to have legislation introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for stating that retrospective registration will not be compulsory under the legislation.  This will be welcomed by many hundreds of <Col N="15" /> people throughout the country and the Minister deserves our praise for it.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that it has taken so long to bring this legislation before the House.  While it is a case of better late than never, it would make one wonder about the speed of reaction of the Oireachtas to problems in society.  There has been a welcome response at Oireachtas level to demands for progressive social legislation.  I hope the generous response the Minister got in the Seanad and which he will get here today will encourage him to bring forward further progressive legislation in the social field.</P>
    <P>We must first pay tribute to those people in the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society.  In the past decade they have lobbied Government Departments and every Oireachtas Member, making their heartfelt pleas by way of personal representations and by letter.  They have been successful and are to be commended for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stressed that the Bill is therapeutic rather than statistical.  I welcome his giving parents the option of either registering the birth themselves or leaving the task to the hospital authorities. Medical professionals and psychologists are agreed on the importance of grieving over the death of a person of any age, including that of a child who is stillborn.  This proposed register is one of the many ways in which the grieving process can be helped.  We in this House must not underestimate the importance to parents of having a birth certificate and a death certificate for their child in the months and years following a stillbirth, particularly at the anniversary of the birth each year.  Recognition by the State that they had a real child is most important for the parents and the brothers and sisters of a stillborn child. This is one aspect of the grieving process. It is disappointing that this measure, introduced almost 40 years ago in the UK. is only now being introduced here, but it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to mention the progress <Col N="16" /> made in maternity hospitals to help parents come to terms with the loss of a child.  I congratulate hospital personnel who have been the leaders in that process. The State has been a little tardy but medical personnel have not.  It has been common practice for quite some time to facilitate parents who wish to hold the remains of their baby, to have the child photographed and keep the identity bracelet and, indeed, to have a postmortem carried out to discover the cause of death.  At Oireachtas level we are finally responding.</P>
    <P>We are often critical of the churches and of their views in particular fields of social legislation.  In this area the churches, particularly the Catholic Church, have made great progress.  The days are long gone when stillborn children were refused baptism and a place in consecrated graveyards.  Nowadays funeral services are arranged and hospital chaplains have greatly assisted not just the parents but the hospital personnel in progressing these matters.  In a sense this Bill is a tool for helping the hospitals and the churches to console and help parents and others who are bereaved.</P>
    <P>There is some difficulty about the definition.  However, the Minister is being as generous as he can in extending the definition rather than restricting it. No matter what limit is provided for, there will always be the hard case that is slightly under the limit.  That is something we will discuss in more detail on Committee Stage.  I would find it difficult to improve on what the Minister has provided here and I take the points he has already made in the Seanad.  I would stress, however, that improvements in medical science and technology mean that a child at 24 weeks gestation can be viable.  There will be ongoing medical improvements in this area and I presume that as a result of those improvements the Minister will keep in mind the possibility of changing the definition.  I understand that the World Health Organisation is considering the possibility of stating a 450 gramme limit for a viable child.  Perhaps that is something we can debate further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> It is important to have a register of stillbirths for international comparison of statistics which will help medical researchers to make progress in determining the causes of stillbirths.  The main reason for the Bill is therapeutic, but the statistical angle is important.  Anything we can do to reduce the number of grieving parents in the future must be welcomed as progress.</P>
    <P>We are informed that the rate of stillbirths among unemployed people and among the more disadvantaged in our society is much higher than the rate among the professional and salaried groups.  We must ask ourselves why.  We must look at it from a socio-economic point of view and see what we can do to improve the situation.  With a figure of almost 18 per cent at one end of the socio-economic spectrum and 5 per cent at the other end questions must be asked and solutions found.</P>
    <P>Recent findings show that of 319 girls in the Dundalk area who attended St. Vincent's secondary school in the fifties, five had stillbirths later in life and, even more alarmingly, 161 had miscarriages. The implications of this report are that many of these stillbirths and miscarriages were caused by radiation from the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.  We cannot make any judgment on that allegation but it points to the necessity for proper statistics that could be used in making a case where we feel health and safety are at risk.  Although it is outside the scope of this Bill, I hope that in the future we will see this Minister bringing forward proposals for the registration of miscarriages and an examination of the causes of both miscarriages and stillbirths.</P>
    <P>I expect that the compassion which prompted the bringing forward of this legislation and which will ensure that it will be passed unanimously by the House will also cause us to look in more detail at the miscarriage figures and set up some kind of registration system in that regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Schedule to the Bill are a significant step forward in that they provide for the inclusion of the mother's forename, surname, maiden <Col N="18" /> name, where applicable, and occupation. At present the requirements for a typical birth certificate simply seek statistics in relation to the father's name, occupation and so on.  Hopefully, this reaffirmation of the equality of the mother will be repeated in other areas.  The proposed register is a significant improvement on the more established registers of births and deaths and I hope, in the context of the current review of the system of registration, that anomaly will be rectified.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for accepting the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in regard to a register of stillbirths and I ask him to campaign at Cabinet level for additional funding to provide adequate care for mothers of stillborn babies.  I am sure nobody would contest the seriousness of the trauma suffered by such mothers.  Additional funding is necessary for counselling and I hope the Minister will succeed in convincing his Cabinet colleagues of the need in that regard.  It is important that sufficient funding for counselling purposes is available in maternity hospitals and at local health centres.  In most cases, ongoing counselling is essential and that can be provided only if the necessary funding is in place.  I know the Minister will endeavour to make progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear traumatic stories of mothers of stillborn babies being subjected to the torture of having to remain in a ward with mothers of healthy, newborn babies.  That is a difficult position for the mothers of stillborn babies and the only way to improve that position is to ensure that sufficient funding is available for allocating private rooms in maternity hospitals to all mothers of stillborn children, regardless of means.  The VHI or private wealth should not be taken into account in that regard.  We should send out a message from this House this morning that all mothers of stillborn babies should have access to private rooms in maternity hospitals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my party support it.  On Committee Stage we will <Col N="19" /> examine the details.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this long awaited legislation.</P>

      <P>This a rare day in Irish political life, an occasion when politicians of opposing parties put aside their cut and thrust, put up their swords, turn their backs on the hurly burly frequently a feature of this House and combine to put their weight behind this welcome legislation. In so doing we are giving recognition to the role the State can play in helping in some way to confront one of the great mysteries of life, namely, the matter of stillbirth.</P>
      <P>This legislation is very welcome.  Its introduction was long sought by members of the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society.  For ten years members of that society battled bravely for its introduction. Their campaign was both courageous and coherent and touched not alone the heads, but the hearts, of all those they lobbied.  Their memorial quilt, a patchwork of poignant memories put together by grief -stricken parents, was a most eloquent plank in their argument. It was a living testimony to the desire of parents to put in place their form of offical register in the absence of an official State register.  That was eloquent proof that parents of stillborn babies wanted them to be accorded a status and not forgotten.  It is important that such parents keep the memory of their children alive in their hearts and in the hearts of members of their families.  That was an impressive statement by the parents of stillborn babies.</P>
      <P>The campaign involved both women and men, and correctly so.  It is wrong to assume that only mothers suffer in the case of a stillbirth.  It is inevitable that mothers who have borne and nurtured the child suffer most, but fathers and other family members also suffer and we should not lose sight of that fact.  While men were involved in the campaign, women were the major driving force behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the campaign those people pointed challengingly to the fact <Col N="20" /> that in Great Britain a register of stillbirths has been in existence for approximately 40 years and in Northern Ireland there has been a similar register for approximately 30 years.  This is one of the last countries in the EU in which a register of stillbirths remains to be put in place.  People made compelling arguments but failed to get results until the legislation before us today was drafted. Fulsome tribute is due to the Minister for his generosity in initiating this Bill in the Seanad and bringing it into this House today.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I congratulate him.  He is approximately one year in office and has introduced a number of things in that time, but if anything stands out as a testimony to his sense of humanity, it will be the speed with which he confronted the introduction of this Bill.  I also want to acknowledge the part played by the Council for the Status of Women in supporting the campaign spearheaded by ISANDS.  I note with satisfaction that many of the council's recommendations are incorporated in this legislation and, accordingly, it is much better legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a sensitive and caring legislative measure.  Its enactment will be an enormous source of comfort and consolation to bereaved parents.  Meeting that requirement is the main motivation behind the legislation and in the course of introducing it in the Seanad the Minister stated that, in essence the legislation would have a major therapeutic effect and he acknowledged that as significant in its own right.  However, the benefits of the legislation will go far beyond that single, though crucial, concern.  The proposed register will be of considerable importance to the medical profession because it will provide accurate and detailed statistics which were not always available in the past.  Moreover, it will encourage further research into the cause of stillbirth and miscarriage.  That is something from which only good can flow in the future.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible for those of us who have been fortunate enough to escape the experience of stillbirth to appreciate fully the anguish and desolation <Col N="21" /> of a parent when a pregnancy ends in a stillbirth.  A dream is shattered, a hope unrealised and potential life is cruelly quenched.  It is hard for people to come to terms with that.  I described it earlier as a mystery.  Death is the antithesis of life.  It is a cruel irony when the anticipated experience of birth is finally cut off.  Inevitably that experience leaves a deep scar.  It is one of the most difficult situations with which people may be confronted. Death is never easy.  Despite the grief we experience, we are culturally conditioned to accept the deaths of older people and of our parents.  However, our culture does not condition us to accept the death of young life so cruelly and poignantly cut short.</P>
    <P>Psychologists will confirm that the register proposed in the Bill will go some way towards helping people cope with the grief and to come to terms with the tragedy.  It is important that at last politicians have recognised that position. There is no point condemning the failures of the past.  Today we must rejoice in the achievement of the present and that the register is about to be put in place.</P>
    <P>This Bill has received not only all party support but a generous response from the public.  The issue has already been debated in the Seanad and a number of amendments which I considered tabling were fully debated in the Seanad.  Some ideas, particularly those put forward by Senator Henry, who has a higher level of medical experience and expertise than the lay person, were taken on board by the Minister.  Therefore, there is no merit in tabling further amendments and prolonging the debate.  The Bill should be passed and enacted as quickly as possible and the machinery put in place in respect of the registration centres.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 1, I am sure the Minister has given much thought and time to defining what is meant by a viable child eligible for registration.  The final decision is a good one, which I support. As Deputy Bradford said, medical science is now advancing at a greater rate. This legislation can be amended if at some time in the future new insights emerge as to a different understanding <Col N="22" /> in terms of weight or gestation period. However, the Minister has struck the right balance in regard to the definition of what constitutes viability in the light of current insights, medical understanding, the experience of other countries and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 3, the Minister's decision to give the provisions of the Bill a retrospective effect is praiseworthy. Seldom if ever are provisions in respect of new legislation given retrospective effect.  I welcome that measure.  It is important that parents who have suffered the experience of stillbirth in the past will be given the option to register the deaths of their children.  People who battled long and hard to bring this about can now benefit.  Parents who suffered from the trauma of stillbirths in the past can benefit from this provision as well as future parents.  That provision is an enlightened one.  The manner in which the details of the registration process have been set out is also welcome.  The procedure is similar to the existing provision for registration of children who live after birth.  That provision will help meet the emotional and psychological needs of parents who suffer the trauma of stillbirth.</P>
    <P>As a result of this legislation and the discussion it has generated both in this House and the Upper House, there is an enhanced awareness among public representatives of the difficulties with which parents confronted with this mystery have to cope.  There must be a renewed commitment to provide funding for proper counselling for parents who have to cope with stillbirths.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford said that maternity hospitals have improved greatly in recent times in this regard.  All maternity hospitals adopt a most compassionate and open approach to this issue, which is an advance on the attitude which prevailed up to ten years ago.  There is a grave need for a follow-through counselling service.  The situation is not resolved while the mother is in the hospital; that grieving period is just the start of parents coming to terms with the tragedy and the impact of the sense of loss.  That grieving process continues for a <Col N="23" /> long time.  Mothers, parents and families need counselling specifically targeted at this area for a long time after the tragedy. It is important that such counselling, funded by the State, be provided.  When counselling services are provided the objectives of the Bill will be met.</P>
    <P>My party is not tabling any amendments to the Bill.  We agree with its provisions. If new insights emerge in future years or faults are found in the procedures, the Bill can be amended as appropriate.  However, the Bill as it stands is a good one and it meets all the requirements.  I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left welcomes the publication of the Stillbirths Registration Bill.  The desire of parents of stillbirths to have a legal record of the birth of their child is one that has been long felt.  However, it is only relatively recently that we as a society acknowledged not just that desire but the pain and suffering stillbirth brings.  I would like to pay tribute to ISANDS for its tenacity and dedication over the years in raising our consciousness in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the past failure to understand the experience of having a stillbirth led to great misunderstanding and unhappiness. Hospital policy was very restrictive in the case of stillbirth.  The sense of loss, particularly for the mother, in many cases was not officially or unofficially acknowledged.  In recent years, because of a growing awareness, the position has changed and nowadays hospitals provide much greater understanding and flexibility. It is now the norm to provide a photograph.  It is also possible for a mother to hold her baby after if has been born dead, and counselling is available. These factors help in a bereavement. Under this Bill parents are provided with formal recognition of the experience that they have gone through.  The registration of stillbirths is official acknowledgment that these births have taken place and that for the individual family they have deep and long-lasting significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that one in <Col N="24" /> four potential births end in miscarriage. We know that miscarriages can cause much grieving.  A stillbirth, because of its very nature, deepens that loss.  It is worth noting that many women and men know the grief of losing a potential child.  I welcome the reduction of the length of gestation to 24 weeks or 500 grammes weight.  The approach outlined in this Bill is the correct one.  It provides an option for parents to notify the local registar of the stillbirth, but it places a duty on a hospital or relevant medical practitioner to notify the local registrar.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Bill allows for retrospective registration.  I have met many parents who, years after their stillbirth, wish to have an official record of the experience.  Many mothers in particular have said they wished to be able to have an official certificate which in itself would help to ameliorate their sense of loss.  Some have even made the point that an official record of the registration of a stillbirth brings home to children of the family what has happened and makes the event more comprehensible.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant features has been the consistent decline in the numbers of stillbirths in Ireland, along with neonatal and perinatal mortality. However, it is worth noting that the perinatal mortality rate is still the third highest in Europe after Portugal and Greece, and the reasons for this need to be understood.  Much media coverage was given to a recent report which stated that Ireland is the safest place in the world to have a baby.  However, the perinatal mortality rate in Ireland is one that we must take very seriously as it is very high.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Irish birth rate is dropping so dramatically we need to look at the causes of perinatal mortality to find ways of reducing its rate as far as is possible.  The factors determining the level of perinatal mortality include birth rate, parity, mother's age, poverty, and type of antenatal care, as well as many other variables.  The most significant factor is that of class and social status. The rate of stillbirths is significantly higher among families where the father <Col N="25" /> is unemployed than where the father has a professional occupation, is an employer or a salaried employee.  The figures show that the stillbirth rate for 1990 was 14.9 per cent &mdash; only 3.5 per cent among higher professionals and 1.4 per cent among lower professionals.  This is a huge disparity and is a clear statement of how socio-economic factors impinge on the health and welfare of our people.</P>
    <P>The right to life has been promoted by many groups and organisations. However, one of the simplest ways to ensure the right to life in many cases would be to narrow the gap between rich and poor, to create jobs and to combat poverty and deprivation in our communities. Quality in health has more to do with socio-economic factors than it has to do with medical treatment.  This applies not only to stillbirths but right across the board in many of the killer diseases, whether they be cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, suicide or respiratory diseases.</P>
    <P>Class is a major element in health, yet this is something that has not been faced up to in health policy in the past.  In our publication of a national health strategy, Democratic Left has made a strong case to the Minister for Health to put the issue of equality central in his national health strategy: If he does so, the strategy that he adopts will have the greatest chance of success.  By focusing on those most at risk he would be increasing the general welfare and health of the nation at large. In the same way if perinatal health policy is focused on those at risk of a higher rate of stillbirth, that is those affected by unemployment, we would have the best chance of increasing our rate of live births and reducing our perinatal mortality rate, including stillbirths.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there are 300 stillbirths each year.  In his Bill there is an implicit presumption that all these take place in hospital or with the attendance of a medical practitioner.  However, he has neglected to include the small number of home births that occur in Ireland every year.  Last year there were 200 home births, and this kind of domicilliary care is normally the responsibility <Col N="26" /> of midwives rather than medical practitioners who have got out of the business of home deliveries.  Midwives carry responsibility to notify a senior medical officer of a stillbirth, but there is no obligation on them in this Bill and that must be redressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill offers us an opportunity to extend the information collected in a stillbirths register.  I note that the Minister in his Seanad speech and again today made the point that the rationale for registration is essentially therapeutic and that a stillbirth registration is primarily intended to comfort grieving parents rather than to serve as an evidential or statistical purpose.  While I fully recognise the value of registration for parents, it would be a pity if the Minister did not use the opportunity to provide statistical information that would be useful in health policy and planning information which could help to reduce the numbers of stillbirths, and also provide information on birth defects which would be immensely useful.</P>
    <P>The provision of a birth defects register would give an overview as to the extent of birth defects and any geographic preponderance that they might display.  For example, in the town of Arklow, a study has been carried out by local people to assess the level of birth defects, and the information, which is compiled on a voluntary basis, shows a preponderance of birth defects which is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>The fact that statistical information is not available on a national scale to assess the rate of birth defects and where they are located is something that should be addressed and is a matter of public health policy.  Very little statistical research generally is carried out in Ireland and statistical collation of information creates major problems for devising health policy.  This is a deficiency that can be at least partially addressed in this Bill if the Minister were to accept its value as a statistical gathering tool and extend it to the provision of a birth defects register.</P>
    <P>At present we are participating in a study of congenital malformation, a study which has been ongoing since 1980, but it relates only to the cities of Galway and <Col N="27" /> Dublin.  We need a national register to ensure that we know the precise position with regard to birth defects nationally.  In my own county of Wicklow there appears to be a number of children with hand defects; other cases have arisen in other parts of Ireland and in Britain.  This has resulted in an analysis by the London Office of Population Censuses and Surveys of the records to see if there is cause for concern.  Surely we in Ireland should carry out an investigation also.  I appreciate that this is a matter for the Minister for Health, but a stillbirths register is an opportunity to at least look at a narrow cohort where birth defects occur, that is in stillbirths.  This registration Bill offers an opportunity to provide that information. At the moment, families in Arklow and other towns in Ireland do not know if what they have experienced is part of a normal phenomenon or whether it has specific causes that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There have been other matters of concern, particularly in south Wicklow and in County Louth relating to a high incidence of cancer.  In County Louth, Dr. Patricia Sheehan carried out a study in relation to birth defects and stillbirths. She raised the question of whether there are environmental factors in relation to these cases.  All mothers in the study of the St. Louis secondary school suffered severe influenza at the same time as the nuclear reactor in Windscale went on fire, sending out a cloud of radiation across the Irish Sea.  At a time when BNFL are planning to proceed with the THORP development, we should not miss any opportunity to garner information that may be revealing and may point to the impact or otherwise of Sellafield on those living on the east coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a study underway at the Boyne Research Institute in Drogheda on the incidence of miscarriages, stillbirths and birth defects along the north-east coast.  It surely would be advisable for a stillbirths register to be linked with the Department of Health to provide information on the rate of stillbirths and the numbers of birth defects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> All of us live in the shadow of Sellafield and unless significant action is taken by the Irish Government we will all soon be living in the shadow of THORP.  It is not a prospect about which Irish people are either confident or happy.  The question marks over the impact of Sellafield on the health of our people will continue unless clear evidence is found that Sellafield is safe.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill has been presented by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, which puts a different emphasis on its importance.  If it had been presented by the Minister for Health I believe the emphasis would have been put on the provision of hard medical research which would be of value not just to the parents of stillborn children but also to future parents and future children who might be protected from the possible environmental effects of radiation or other environmental factors about which we are unaware.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which will meet the deeply held desire of many women and men to have their stillborn children registered. However, its potential for good will not be fully realised unless it is expanded to provide information and evidence which will enlighten public health policy.  Stillbirth is a tragic fact.  There will always be stillbirths, but there are also clearly preventable causes of stillbirth which should not always be with us.  There is a certain irony in the fact that, at a time when the most extraordinary experiments are being carried out in reproduction and when women well over the age of menopause are giving birth, unemployed families in Ireland are still experiencing a far higher rate of stillbirths than better off families.  The question of social class is a major determinant in the level of stillbirths and perinatal mortality.  Environmental factors may also be major factors &mdash; we simply do not know.  However, we know about the relevance of class and unemployment on this issue.  I hope the Minister will take on board my Committee Stage amendments which deal with home births, statistical information and birth defects and which would add to what is a <Col N="29" /> very limited pool of research and statistical information on health.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to social welfare. At present maternity benefit is paid to women who have delivered a baby at a minimum of 28 weeks gestation.  This payment is made whether the baby is dead or alive.  In view of the fact that the Bill specifies that a baby born at 24 weeks gestation or weighing 500 grammes, is defined as a stillbirth and not simply a miscarriage, I suggest it would be appropriate to alter the regulations governing social welfare payments to ensure consistency. I do not think one Department can recognise that stillbirths occur at 24 weeks while the Department of Social Welfare applies different rules, does not recognise stillbirths and does not deem the mother to be eligible for maternity benefit.  If it is acknowledged in law, through this Bill, that a stillbirth can occur from 24 weeks onwards, surely it makes no sense to deny a woman who delivers a dead child at 24 weeks the right to maternity benefit.</P>
    <P>I have put down some minor Committee Stage amendments which would considerably improve the Bill and deal with one particular anomaly in it.  Overall, Democratic Left welcomes this Bill which is an important breakthrough for all parents of stillborn children, particularly those in ISANDS who have fought so long and so consistently for recognition in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I join with other speakers in paying tribute to the members of the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society.  This is an historic and joyful day for them in the sense that their years of campaigning have at long last borne fruit.  Deputy Quill referred to the patchwork memorial quilt put together by the parents of stillborn children.  These parents managed to get their message across to public representatives in a non-controversial but very effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year in my capacity as Lord Mayor of the city of Cork I was very touched to have been invited to officiate at a number of memorial services both at St. Finbar's <Col N="30" /> Cemetery and St. Catherine's Cemetery, Kilcully.  One could only be struck at those services by the depth of feeling and sincerity of the members of ISANDS and by the sense of loss felt by parents whose children have been stillborn.  More than letters or any other correspondence, those services brought home to me the absolute necessity for the Legislature to respond to a genuine need in society.  I stongly support the emphasis placed by the Minister on the therapeutic rather than the statistical dimension of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation proves that the appointment of programme managers by the Government has been a success.  The programme managers in both the Department of Health and the Department of Equality and Law Reform have had a major role to play. This is one of the best illustrations so far of the success of the programme managers concept.  Their appointment received much adverse publicity and criticism but it must be remembered that until then the only official response to the parents of stillborn children was that they must wait until an overall reform of the death register was carried out before their request for a stillbirths register could be considered.  It was not until I approached the programme manager in the Department of Health and other people approached the programme manager in the Department of Equality and Law Reform that any efforts were made to establish a stillbirths register.  They acted as catalysts and facilitators and ensured that this matter was dealt with in a non-bureaucratic and very responsible way.  I want to place on record my appreciation of their efforts.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this House is seen to be responsive to the needs of people who have a grievance and want action.  For many years members of ISANDS felt they were up against a brick wall and were making absolutely no progress. I commend the Minister and the Government for recognising that need at long last and for putting in place the legislative measure which will establish a stillbirths register.  In many ways it was the decision to take the matter out of the <Col N="31" /> Department of Health and put it into the Department of Equality and Law Reform which broke the logjam.  If the matter had remained in the Department of Health I suspect that we would not be discussing this Bill.  That point should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Equality and Law Reform was established principally to try to meet the needs of the many groups in society who feel marginalised and who believe their grievances are not getting the ear of the people in power.  Over the years there has been a breakdown in communication between groups in society and those in power.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform can play a very useful role in dealing with many of these issues and breaking down bureaucratic logjams etc.  This is why I so wholeheartedly welcome the establishment of a stillbirths register.  I hope to see further examples of such progress in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As a result of this development, I have become a convert to the notion of a Department with specific responsibility for equality and law reform issues.  I would be the first to admit that I was somewhat sceptical about the concept of such a Department when it was put forward at the time of the formation of the Government.  However, from my experience of this issue, this Department has proven to be a very effective agent in expediting urgently needed legislation.</P>
    <P>I support the fact that the effect of this Bill will be therapeutic and aims to respond to the needs of parents of stillborn babies.  We must be careful with the compilation of statistical evidence in relation to stillbirth and any other defects relating to childbirth.  People in the medical profession deal cautiously with such statistics.  Obviously the mere existence now of a stillbirths register will have some significance in relation to the compilation of statistics.  I accept the valid points made by Deputy McManus but we must examine that issue in a more uniform way from the State's point of view.  We need to have a greater capacity to compile statistics, particularly in the health area. <Col N="32" /> The Department of Health should become involved in this area because there is nothing worse than ignorance, misinformation and people being unsure about an issue.  That generates a greater degree of anxiety.  The compilation of statistics is important because it will help to allay fears in this area.  However, in the context of this Bill, the motivation behind it was to give official recognition to stillborn babies.  For many years the parents of stillborn children felt that their babies' short lives went unrecognised by many people but the most distressing factor was that they went unrecognised by the State.</P>
    <P>The prime purpose of this Bill is to right a wrong that existed for many years. That is why the retrospective dimension of the Bill is so important; it makes some effort to undo the harm of neglect in this area for so many years.  All those who campaigned for this register will also benefit from the enactment of the Bill and derive some satisfaction from the retrospective recognition that will be given to stillborn babies.</P>
    <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister.  The Bill is a compassionate one and his opening statement married a sense of compassion with the formality that is necessary for registration purposes and for the compilation of statistics.  It is unfortunate that the legislation was not ready before Christmas to mark the tenth anniversary of ISANDS but no doubt the anniversary itself proved to be a major catalyst in pushing the legislation forward.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the whole issue of the democratic process responding to the demands of people.  There are few Exchequer costs associated with this measure and there are virtually no staffing implications.  We must all ask ourselves why this legislation was not brought forward earlier and we must remember there are other equally important issues requiring legislation that could also be brought forward quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not intend repeating what other Members have said.  I am delighted with the Bill, I congratulate the Minister on an historic breakthrough which will have <Col N="33" /> implications for many people in this area and I wish him well in bringing forward further legislation in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin my contribution by congratulating the Minister and, indeed, his officials for introducing this legislation.  However, it begs the question as to why it was not introduced earlier but if the Minister can market the mechanism he used to get this legislation through, there would be a great demand for it.  It is quite extraordinary that the Minister has managed to bring forward this legislation despite the fact that the Minister initially &mdash; and other Ministers in the past &mdash; indicated they could not do this until an overall review of registration took place.  The Minister has succeeded and, as has been said by everyone in the House today, sincere congratulations are due to him.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister also has the appreciation of ISANDS who have campaigned for so long for this stillbirths register.  I regret that they had to put so much time and energy into seeking to have this register established when it could have been done so much sooner. As Deputy Martin said, it raises questions about the responsiveness of the democratic process to the demands that are often made by lobbying groups outside this House.  I hope the reforms that are underway in this House will ensure that we can be more responsive in future to issues such as this because the establishment of this register will bring great comfort and encouragement to parents of stillborn babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This register will help parents who, at a time of great crisis, feel isolated and lonely and it will give recognition to their baby, something which is very important to them.  The fact that we are discussing this legislation is an indication of a greater understanding in dealing with matters relating to pregnancy and childbirth in this country.  However, it is clear from the two recent cases involving abandoned babies that much work remains to be done, particularly in the area of education, before we can be satisfied that pregnant women receive the type of care, <Col N="34" /> counselling, support services and information they need to help them cope and to give babies the best chance of survival.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation and the all-party support which the Minister is receiving is important. Before I was elected to the Dáil I lobbied, as chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women, for this legislation and I was part of a commission that also recommended such legislation. The people involved both on the commission and the council will be pleased with the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I remember clearly when the first papers were published on this area, outlining what was happening to parents who experienced stillbirths and the hospital procedures which needed improvement. Great credit is due to the hospitals who responded quickly to that research information which highlighted that our hospital procedures and the way we were dealing with parents who had experienced stillbirths were inadequate. Indeed, there have been enormous improvements in this area on the part of the medical profession and hospitals generally and every effort is now being made to ensure that the trauma of stillbirths is reduced.  The statistical information that will be gathered as a result of this Bill is important and I hope it will be put to good use.  The Bill will encourage further research into this area.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned miscarriages. Although the Bill does not deal with this, it is important that we encourage research into the area of miscarriage. Miscarriage is very common and again is an isolating experience.  At a time when medical technology has improved so much, parents are often surprised by the fact that they have had a miscarriage.  If this Bill also encourages research into the area of miscarriage, it will prove helpful to many families in the country.</P>
    <P>The statistical information already available to us in relation to stillbirths raises serious questions which need further examination. Once again they highlight the connection between social class, employment status and health and <Col N="35" /> I agree fully with Deputy McManus &mdash; and I believe this was also highlighted in the Seanad debate &mdash; that we must continue to examine the impact of social and economic factors on the health of our people.  There are very deep connections and we have not begun to address them sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the retrospective provisions in this Bill which will be very helpful to people who experienced difficulties and traumas in the past. Although I am sure parents never really get over the trauma of a stillbirth I hope this Bill will help to complete the process of grieving involved, as I am sure it will at least for some.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has introduced the Bill and I congratulate the many agencies, particularly the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, on the amount of energy they invested in its production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I should like to share my time with Deputy de Valera.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, but particularly as a member of the Labour Party, I am pleased that we have this Bill before us and that its provisions will obtain in a very sensitive area, one which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform addressed with a certain amount of enthusiasm when the matter was brought to his attention.  He has treated this matter with the compassion and sympathy appropriate to the post he holds in Government, particularly working from the base of equality. Deputy McManus felt the matter should have been dealt with by another Minister but, if ever there was inequality in any area, it was in this one in that to date we had refused to register stillbirths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There had always been unanimity among political parties in both Houses on this issue.  However, were it not for the commitment of the Government to follow that sentiment through with the necessary legislation, which does not cost very much, the position might well have remained unchanged.  There was a need to point out that this matter should be <Col N="36" /> addressed so that the Government would respond to the representations made to all of us by ISANDS.  That society has been magnificent in its passion, as was the Council for the Status of Women and other agencies, who brought this matter to our attention over the years.  They had a great input into the provisions of this Bill.  Once the Government agreed to legislate in this area the Whips responded to ensure that this Bill would be dealt with adequately in the Seanad, where it was initiated, and could be debated beyond the hurly-burly of this Chamber where, as Deputy Quill said, we tend to be more involved in the cut and thrust of politics.  Indeed, the moment the Seanad passed the Bill the party Whips agreed that, once it had been introduced in the Dáil, we would give it the priority it warranted. It was agreed to deal with it on one sitting day so that it could be signed by the President and take its rightful place on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that six in every 1,000 births may be stillbirths and many Members, including myself, have family members who have been touched by the trauma associated with stillbirths. It is only when one is directly confronted with the attendant trauma one realises just how sensitive an area this is and one which needed to be addressed by our legislators.  Very few traumas can compare with parents' grief on the death of a child.  All too often we see the tragic loss of young life resulting from accident, illness, terrorism or war.  Daily on our televisions screens we see pictures of children starving, dying or being killed.  How can a person console those parents? There is very little anybody can say which would relieve their trauma or sadness. Neither can anybody answer the question these parents ask daily, why did this have to happen to them?</P>
    <P>When children are sick, terminally ill, awaiting donation of various organs or whatever, they receive tremendous support. Parents whose children die while still in the womb grieve in an even deeper manner than other parents who have had the experience of having had a child with them for some period after birth.  They <Col N="37" /> mourn the children they never knew.  It is a very sensitive area and I am glad we as legislators responded to the representations made.</P>
    <P>To date the lack of appropriate legislation rendered parents' anguish all the greater because, in the case of stillborn babies, of the failure to acknowledge that that tiny person ever existed.  Nobody was obliged to record their all too brief existence.  Their parents were grief-striken, heart-broken but, as far as the law was concerned to date, nothing had ever happened.  The law, in its silence, said there was no birth and no death. Recently staff in neonatal, gynaecological hospitals and maternity units realised the damage being done to parents in treating stillborn babies in this way.  Many changes were effected to help comfort such families.  Even the Roman Catholic Church responded by their ceremonies, celebrating a Mass of the Angels and by way of other sensitive responses, at least demonstrating sympathy to the parents concerned.  For example, hospitals have been known to assist them in taking photographs, as Deputy Bradford said, which tend to be cherished forever by the parents. Hospitals handle such tragedies with compassion.  I am glad such changes took place.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues mentioned by other Members do not require legislation but rather should be handled by the Minister, with the authority to involve other ministries. I am referring to counselling and treatment after the event, particularly for mothers.</P>
    <P>The underlying problem remained, the lack of a formal acknowledgment of stillborn births.  Following the passing of this Bill it will be possible to register stillbirths.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for introducing this Bill.  The register comprises one strand of an overall review of the registration of births, marriages and deaths.  I have been successful, not alone in having this Bill introduced &mdash; I have been engaged in this campaign since first elected &mdash; but also in initiating changes in the registration certificates, in the <Col N="38" /> national registration authority.  Up to the time of that change it was not possible to issue a certificate, even in the event of the first certificate being issued in error, without getting involved in an extraordinary amount of bureaucracy.  I am glad there is now the possibility of having a proper registration and recognition of genuine errors made in the past.  We must remember that many births were not registered, which is an offence.  I am aware of Members' concerns in this area. From what was said in this debate it appears that other Members are concerned.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of this Bill a stillbirth certificate will be available to bereaved parents, lending formality and legal status to their loss.  Indeed it will serve as a focus point for their memories of the dead child and help them come to terms with the attendant grief.  I note that the register will not be open to public inspection.  I agree that this data should be confidential to protect the families concerned.  Legal provision is already in place to allow for the recording of fathers' names on registers even in the case of parents who were unmarried.</P>
    <P>The Minister has identified a child weighing 500 grammes or more, or having a minimum gestation age of 24 weeks, who shows no sign of life at birth, to be classified as a stillbirth.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives parents an opportunity to notify the local registrar of the stillbirth if they choose to do so.  If we are to have registration it must be obligatory and I am glad the Minister is placing the obligation on the hospital or the medical practitioner, possibly in consultation with the midwife, to register the stillbirth.  The retrospective element in the Bill will give consolation to those who have been trying to get this legislation for the past decade in that they will now be able to have the stillbirth registered.  This has been welcomed by ISANDS and the Minister is to be congratulated.  He will be thanked by parents and by those who have experienced the trauma of a stillbirth.  In the past we ignored the life that ended in the womb.  I am pleased <Col N="39" /> that the Government responded to our requests in this sensitive area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ferris for being kind enough to share his time with me.  I welcome this Bill as it will help many to come to terms with their grief, not just the mother but the father and siblings.  I take this opportunity, like other Members, to congratulate ISANDS and all those who, over the past decade, had a tough time campaigning to bring the stillbirths register into being.</P>
      <P>Many studies have been compiled on this issue, not least one by Therese Brady <i>et al</i> which found that a mother's reactions to a stillbirth were consistent with the recognised stages of the grieving process &mdash; numbness, anger, futility, guilt, blame, sadness and even a sense of failure. This study identified, as did many subsequent ones, a number of practices which ignored the reality of the loss and which the women perceived as a failure to accord to them the status of a mother and to their stillborn the status of a real baby.  Some mothers even felt a sense of shame due to the apparent lack of importance attached to their loss.  In some ways it was as if their loss was disregarded.</P>
      <P>Support at such a time from relatives and friends is vital for both parents and siblings.  The lack of such support has been shown to exacerbate the impact of stress.  Through the Bill, the State can help to alleviate some of the grief for the family involved by the formal recognition and confirmation of the existence of the stillborn through compulsory certification. This was one of the recommendations of the study by Therese Brady <i>et al.</i></P>
      <P>The stillbirths register will give tangible acknowledgment and identity to the stillborn.  The State will no longer fail to recognise the existence of the stillborn, which has compounded the grief of mothers and families who have suffered such a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there are a number of areas in the management of stillbirths.  These include the level of communication <Col N="40" /> between hospital staff and the parents, sensitivity to parents' needs, the involvement of both parents together in a total experience and the nature of the burial arrangements.  The tangible recognition of the stillbirth by registration is concrete and practical.  I am glad that the Bill will put this into immediate effect.  My only regret is that this Bill did not come to fruition many years ago.  Most, if not all, the EU countries have such a register.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be much discussion about the definition of a stillbirth and whether the medical and legal definition would be in conflict.  I hope the definition will be as wide and inclusive as possible. In common with other Deputies I welcome the Minister's proposals in this regard because I understand he has been as flexible as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the fact that retrospective registration on a voluntary basis is provided for in the Bill.  Many psychologists and psychiatrists could tell the House that there have been cases where the stillbirth took place more than 30 years ago and yet that deep anxiety, sense of loss and real grief has still to be worked out.  This underlines the mother's and the family's sense of expectation turning to a total sense of emptiness and loss.  I am pleased to note that the retrospective provision has no antecedent time limit.</P>
    <P>This registration will not only be a focus for the memory of the bereaved but will also encourage research into stillbirth and the causes of miscarriage.  Such statistical information is essential for research.  Such research need not just be of assistance in the world of medicine. As legislators, we should note that the stillbirth rate among unemployed and unskilled manual workers is much higher than that among professional or salaried employees.  I hope the Minister, following on from this Bill, can ensure adequate counselling through the health boards or in other ways to deal with the very real experience of grief for parents and siblings.</P>
    <P>I welcome and wholeheartedly support the principle of the Bill which will have cross-party support.  I look forward to its <Col N="41" /> early implementation and congratulate the Minister for dealing expeditiously with this very serious and sensitive matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend the congratulations of this side of the House to the Minister for acting on this matter.  I wish to share the time available to me with Deputy Doyle.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which has been promised for some time.  I am delighted the Minister when bringing forward the legislation decided not to do so in the context of an overall review of the legislation pertaining to births, deaths and marriages which, I understand, is at present in the course of preparation in his Department.  I welcome the fact that he isolated this legislation and was able to proceed with it because of the importance of dealing with the matter at the earliest opportunity.  Over the past ten years people have been lobbying successive Ministers for Health on the importance of a change in legislation.  It is regrettable that in the course of that time we have had almost 4,000 stillborn babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a measure of relief and comfort that will be available to parents following the emotional trauma of a stillbirth.  It is important that accurate statistics be available.  The statistics of less than 300 stillborn babies on an annual basis may not be accurate. The fact that this register will be available to the Department will be of enormous importance from a research point of view in so far as it will enable various studies to take place against a background of accurate information.  This is extremely important when dealing with clusters of stillbirths and malformed babies which we have been hearing so much about in recent days.  Although this legislation has been introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, close contact should be maintained with the Department of Health.  If we are to identify parts of the country where there is a higher than average number of stillborn or deformed babies, it is important that the statistical information <Col N="42" /> be available.  The register will help in many respects.  The memory of the event for parents of stillborn babies is extremely important.  Reference has already been made to that aspect by other speakers.</P>
    <P>It is for the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to deal with the extraordinary fact that, although Ireland is the safest country in Europe and among the safest in the world to have a baby, nevertheless the stark reality remains that so far as perinatal deaths are concerned we rank third highest in the European Union.  I do not know why that is the case.  I do not know why, in the course of the first week of infancy, more babies die in this country than the European average.  I hope the Department of Health can ensure that research is carried out to identify the reason.  We must look at the maternity services and see what improvements can be made to ensure that our figures are accurate and that there is no neglect.</P>
    <P>It is important not to ignore the whole area of miscarriage.  I realise it is not relevant to this legislation but the next step must be to develop a register of miscarriages.  While there may be up to 300 stillborn babies annually, the number of miscarriages must be tens of thousands. I doubt whether there is any statistical information on the numbers involved.  If we were to have a register for miscarriages it could be of great assistance to the development of research.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of the Bill provide for a register of stillbirths the back-up counselling services are of tremendous importance.  I regret that when replying to this debate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will not be in a position to advise as to the level of counselling services as they are not within the domain of his Department. I stress the need for communication and liaison between the Minister's Department and the Department of Health.  The availability of a counselling service in each health board area is extremely important.  There is no point in having this register unless it is accompanied by <Col N="43" /> an appropriate counselling service provided by the State.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society is the group which prompted the legislation before the House today.  I am delighted we have changed the emphasis in the way we treat stillborn babies.  Until recently, in many instances, the mother never saw the baby.  Parents had absolutely no say in the disposal of the remains of the baby.  I am delighted that has changed.</P>
    <P>It is important that separate hospital accommodation be provided for mothers in hospital at the time of a stillbirth or miscarriage.  This is a time of tremendous trauma and anxiety.  A modicum of comfort and private accommodation should be available.  The provisions of the Bill allow for the issue of a certificate which will provide a lasting recognition.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one point in the Bill to which I hope the Minister will refer in his reply.  There is no reference to a midwife in section 6, which deals with the notification and registration of stillbirths occurring after the commencement date.  Why does the legislation require the medical certificate to be signed by a registered practitioner? What is the role of the midwife in all of this?  Would it not be acceptable that the registration take place and be witnessed by a registered midwife?  During recent years there has been a downgrading by the State, the Department of Health and the health services, of the position of the midwife in the community.  That is wrong.  It is regrettable that we have not encouraged our midwifery services so as to allow the midwife play a greater role.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage where pregnancy is regarded as a medical condition and doctors have to be involved at all stages.  Pregnancy is a natural condition and should not be regarded as an illness. This unnecessary involvement of the medical profession is continued in this legislation where the Minister requires a registered medical practitioner to be involved rather than a midwife who might do the job better.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> I pay tribute to the committee members and the many committed members of the ISANDS group who, I am sure, are delighted with the Minister's action following ten years of continuous campaigning on a matter that is of extreme importance to them.  It is noteworthy that this legislation is welcomed by every Member of every party in this House.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time with me.  My function is not to repeat what has been said on one of the few Bills on which there will be no conflict in this House and that is as it should be.  On behalf of Wexford ISANDS I thank the Government and the Minister for bringing to a conclusion a ten-year quest for a stillbirths register. It is hard for many of us to appreciate how important this Bill, small in terms of the panoply of legislation with which we have to deal, is for parents and families who have been through the trauma of a stillbirth.</P>
      <P>The Wexford group was formed only last September having been encouraged by the matron and nurses of Wexford General Hospital to give support to and share experiences with parents who had been through this trauma.  I thank Jean Wafer, Mary Delaney, Catherine Howard, Brenda Murphy, Margaret Dempsey, Eileen Hughes, Kathy White and all the active members of Wexford's ISANDS.  I know what they did in Wexford reflects what other groups have done throughout the country to ensure that the message was heard and understood by the Minister so that legislation could be brought forward quickly, without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers I thank national ISANDS and individuals who communicated with Deputies to keep the problem to the forefront.  Deputies desks are piled with various problems but there was a concerted campaign which was always kept at a level which did justice to the cause, to keep the problem to the forefront.  Deputies, both men and women whether married or single, or whether they had contact with people <Col N="45" /> who had been through this trauma, understood exactly where ISANDS were coming from.  I pay tribute to them for the level on which they conducted the campaign which has been most effective. I also thank the Minister for his rapid response.  I also thank hospital chaplains, midwives, nurses and people who throughout the country kept pushing this cause in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The chaplain from Wexford General Hospital wrote to me last October to make me aware of his support for a stillbirths register and pointed out than an important aspect of his work as chaplain was to comfort parents grieving the sudden loss of an infant.  He pointed out how precious were the few memories of the child and said that he felt that a stillbirths register would provide parents with a lasting memory of their child.  He pointed out that we must realise the very real hopes and aspirations these parents had for their children which had been cruelly dashed and that no amount of words could explain the importance of a certificate in the hands of a bereaved mother or father as the years go by.  In a few simple sentences Father Browne and all the others who contacted us explained the need for the stillbirths register.</P>
    <P>I will not parse and analyse the Bill before me.  Other Deputies have questioned legal and medical definitions to make sure that this will not be a lawyer's charter down the line to keep people busy fighting technical issues.  I trust the Minister's experience in that area to ensure that Deputies doubts are erased before Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>The ISANDS campaign is an example to other groups of how to achieve an end and how to make a case to keep it in the public eye and in front of politicians. Would that many other pressure groups would learn how so much can be achieved by tackling a case properly.  I thank those at the head of national ISANDS as well as the constituency groups for the way they conducted their campaign and for their achievement.  That group more than any other can, perhaps, really understand what it means to have a stillbirths register and legal acceptance of the child that has <Col N="46" /> been lost.  Another point made to me is that the change in the gestation period in terms of recognising a stillbirth is extremely welcome and I also thank the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>Most of what needs to be said has been said but it would be remiss of me not to thank the Minister on behalf of the Wexford branch of ISANDS and on behalf of my constituents, many of whom still perhaps do not know of the existence of ISANDS but who have been through this traumatic experience.  Most of us will never understand what this Bill will mean to parents who have suffered this trauma.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Pat Gallagher.  Like previous speakers, I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I, too, pay tribute to ISANDS for their commitment and dedication over many years in support of the families who have experienced stillbirth.</P>
      <P>My first experience in this area was a number of years ago when Father Frank Buckley, the chaplain to families of stillborn children in Cork came to me about the need for facilities at St. Finbar's Cemetery in Cork.  I was glad that the city manager and Cork Corporation acted positively on that occasion and today a suitable part of the cemetery is set aside for stillborn children.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the members of Cork ISANDS for their commitment and dedication. They are here today for this occasion which is very special to them. The passage of this Bill shows that minority groups are catered for and that we do not care only about the large vote catching issues.  I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this long overdue legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for the formal registration of stillborn infants.  The Bill has been drafted in a sensitive manner to give recognition to the infant while at the same time minimising the level of intrusion into the family at a time of great loss and grief.  Not surprisingly we tend to avoid the subject of death as much as possible as it brings to mind the loss of loved family members, friends and <Col N="47" /> members of the community.  It also reminds us of our mortality.  Whether we like it or not we are likely to have to cope with the death of a family member or a close friend during our lifetimes.</P>
    <P>One must go through various stages of reaction and grief following the death of a loved one and there are various ways to make bereavement more bearable.  We need the support and sympathy of others and we have happy memories of shared time and experiences and the healing power of time.  Without such consolations it can be extremely difficult to recover from bereavement.  The family trying to cope with the loss of a stillborn infant must deal with all the emotions experienced from other deaths but they have two further obstacles to overcome.  After all the months of happy expectation they must suddenly adjust to the fact that the infant has been lost.  Once the family have begun to deal with their grief a second problem often emerges.  It can be devastating for a family that their infant should be without formal identity because of the nature of death.  While this problem may not be acute in the period immediately after the loss, it can grow with time and become a source of great distress to the parents.  There is simply no record that the infant ever existed.  The primary intention of the Bill is to allow for official acknowledgment of the infant.  Ultimately the responsibility for the task of registering the birth lies with the relevant medical personnel, though the parents may register the stillbirth if they wish.  The facility that allows for retrospective registration is very welcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill poses a challenge to every one of us.  The Bill provides a procedure through which stillborn infants are rightfully acknowledged and their identity confirmed.  This will provide some degree of support to bereaved families. However, I believe that society in general needs to become far more sensitive to the special needs of such families.  There is a lack of ritual in the case of stillbirths and the community may not have a formal opportunity to express their support for <Col N="48" /> the bereaved family.  As a result many people may find it difficult to communicate their deep sympathy to the bereaved friends and consequently a breach may develop.  The family may mistake the lack of communication for a certain degree of indifference or uncaring but for their part friends may feel frustrated at their inability to find an appropriate way to express solidarity with the infant's bereaved family.  A stillbirth causes the same degree of distress as the loss of an infant in the early stages of life. The pain is as acute and the need for care and support is equal.</P>
    <P>We need to heighten awareness of the special needs of the bereaved.  This needs to be dealt with during a person's formal education.  Young adults should be made aware of the reality of stillbirth when pursuing subjects such as civics, and social and scientific studies.  Because of the central role of the medical and nursing professions during the pregnancy and particularly at birth, it is especially important that the intensity of grief associated with stillbirths should be fully acknowledged in the formal training of doctors and nurses.  Full provision must also be made to ensure that specialist counselling support is available to the bereaved families as required.  ISANDS continues to do a tremendous job with the families with whom it is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff have shown great sensitivity in drafting this Bill and I hope it will remove one cause of heart-ache for affected families.  The contributions to the debate have been wide ranging but I have attempted to deal with the main points instead of the medicolegal area.  This is a good day's work and certainly it is a very good day for ISANDS.  I strongly support this Bill.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill in the Seanad and also on the sensitive and sensible approach to the drafting of the Bill demonstrated in his opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> It is worth bearing in mind that there are 300 stillbirths each year.  That is a significant number and each one is as important as any other case of birth or death.  The Bill before us today gives practical effect to the oft quoted adage that all the children of the nation shall be treated equally.  I wholeheartedly support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the grief and trauma suffered by affected families was exacerbated by the lack of official recognition. I am delighted that our law is coming into line with changes in understanding and practices in the area of stillbirth.  Greater recognition and sensitivity is shown to the needs of parents who experience a stillbirth by the medical profession and the Church.  I join with other speakers in paying a wholehearted tribute to ISANDS for its diligent work over many years.  I also wish to acknowledge the effort of many individuals who live in areas where ISANDS is not organised but who have quietly made people like me aware of the need to change the law in this area.  I am sure this will be a day of satisfaction to them.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill proves beyond doubt the importance of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Many commentators questioned the necessity of establishing such a Department but it is evident that many changes affecting what might be termed as small groups in society were left in abeyance.  It was also important to separate the civil and criminal law reform functions of the Government and to promote equality, a task which had been neglected by successive Governments.  I thank the Minister for taking this on board, together with the other Bills he has brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I will take this opportunity to outline the examples of the sensitivity shown in the Minister's approach.  He has stressed that this Bill is very much a therapeutic measure for the parents of stillborn children and a means of alleviating the grief of parents.  I welcome the emphasis he has placed on the process of registration which he stressed should not be overly bureaucratic and that sensitivity will be <Col N="50" /> shown to parents.  At the same time, however, the Minister has stressed that this is an official register.  The registration of these children will have the same legal standing as the registration of any other child and this is very important for the parents concerned, particularly in subsequent years.  I welcome the fact that he has accepted a very wide definition of stillbirth.  In his opening address he said that some countries in the European Union relate it to gestational age whereas others relate it to the birth weight.  It is right that he has taken both approaches. I welcome the fact he has decided the definition should cover both and I am sure it will be applied with the utmost sensitivity.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that stillbirths will be registred, as in the case of births or deaths, at local offices; in other words, no special procedures will have to be followed.  This is important.  I am sure the staff in those offices will show the necessary degree of compassion and understanding in registering these births. While it is important that registration be compulsory it is wise to allow stillbirths be registered in a number of ways.  For example, this can be done by the parents, the medical practitioner or the relevant hospital.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is provision for retrospective registration.  It is often the case that there is a difficulty with the concept of retrospection but I am sure that will not be the position on this occasion.  As the Minister said, in the absence of retrospection this Bill would come too late for many parents.  I am glad that those parents who suffered the trauma of a stillbirth when people were less sensitve will now have an opportunity to have that birth registered by the State.</P>
    <P>Registration should remain a private affair between the parents and the registrar and the personal details on the certificate should be in line with the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials, in conjunction with other Government Departments, particularly the Department of Health, following the passing of this Bill <Col N="51" /> should examine how information on this much needed change in the law can be disseminated in a sensitive but effective way.  The organisation, ISANDS, the hospitals, their staff, hospital chaplains and the health boards would be willing to play their part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to congratulate the Minister &mdash; we rarely do this &mdash; on introducing this long awaited legislation. I also congratulate the members of the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society who have worked long and hard and who must be glad to see this legislation being put through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Speaking as a mother, I have never suffered the trauma these parents experienced; I have experienced the joy of having children.  I realise all too well the trauma suffered on the death of a child. However, one finds that people tend to minimise the trauma experienced by the parents of a stillborn child: it is a most distressing time.  What made it even more distressing was the fact that it was not recognised.  My primary concern is to acknowledge that at last parents will be able to have a stillbirth registered.</P>
      <P>I hope that those who find themselves in this sad position will be able to avail of counselling services as recommended by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I am glad the Minister has followed its lead and given this issue priority.  I commend Members for their support of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will follow up many other aspects of the commission's report quickly.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this legislation passes through the House and I am happy that I was given an opportunity to welcome it.  It will be a great source of comfort for many mothers and fathers who have experienced this trauma.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this long overdue Bill.  No parent forgets the experience of a stillbirth.  There is nothing more traumatic for parents, particularly the mother who has borne a child to full term, to find <Col N="52" /> that it has been born dead.  Parents will never forget a child who dies before they get an opportunity to get to know him or her.  Each individual will have to find their own way of coming to terms with this great loss but it is also important that there be recognition by the State of the person who has died.  As Members are aware, there was no register up to now.</P>
      <P>The Church authorities have been a source of great help and comfort for parents of a stillborn child by their participation in the burial rites and the provision of general advice.  I hope the State services will be expanded to help parents when a child is born dead.</P>
      <P>The rationale for the proposed register is essentially therapeutic.  While it is not necessary to have a name inserted in a register to ensure that a child is remembered it is important that it is recognised in law, particularly for the younger members of a family.  It is nice to think that they will be able to see the birth certificate of a brother or sister who was stillborn.</P>
      <P>I commend ISANDS for the work it has done during the years.  I am glad that this issue is being brought to a successful conclusion today.  I applaud the Minister for introducing this legislation quickly and hope that we will see further improvements in this area.  As we are aware, the Minister has given a commitment to improve services for those in need.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will go through and be signed as quickly as possible by the President.  I am especially delighted to see a provision for registering stillbirths which took place prior to the introduction of the Bill, because it gives those parents who have had stillborn children in the last ten, 15 or 20 years an opportunity to have their children registered.  That is an unusual provision in a Bill but it is a compassionate and considerate approach and I commend the Minister for including that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of previous speakers congratulating the Minister, Deputy <Col N="53" /> Taylor for bringing forward this very important and caring social legislation. We must ask ourselves why it has taken so long in view of the campaign that has been waged over the past ten years to bring in what is essentially simple legislation; and how we might expedite the introduction of legislation that is sought by sections of our community, is not controversial and, generally speaking, is supported by the vast majority of Deputies. We might well deal with other legislation which, although important only to a small number of people, is neverthelsss capable of being brought before the House and being passed into legislation without much delay.  It is an example to allow us that in the short time Minister Taylor has been in office he has managed to bring this important legislation to a number of people who were, perhaps, feeling somewhat left behind.</P>
      <P>In the short time that I was in the Department of Health, with some responsibility for child welfare, I was turning my attention to this issue.  I was personally disappointed to find that it was not high on the list of legislative priorities within the Department.  I was hoping to become personally involved in bringing it forward as quickly as possible in view of the representations I had received from colleagues in this House and representatives of the various associations which have been referred to during the debate.</P>
      <P>There are about 300 stillbirths in this country every year, each representing great personal loss and tragedy not only for the mother and father but also the extended families.  Unfortunately these have, to a large extent, gone unrecorded with no opportunity for people affected by such tragedies to record the permanency of the fact that a stillbirth took place.  This legislation meets the objective of parents, extended families and communities affected by such tragedies who can now have an official record of such stillbirth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind that most other European Union countries have a stillbirth register already in place, I am disappointed that we have delayed so long <Col N="54" /> in meeting the legitimate requirements of those in our society affected by stillbirths. We should bear that in mind in relation to other areas where legislation may have a beneficial effect on those directly affected, even though they are numerically small.  That certainly should not be the cause of leaving certain legislation on the sideline.</P>
    <P>Minister Taylor also referred to the therapeutic effect of the legislation.  I agree with that approach and also with the views expressed by contributors to the debate not just in the Houses of the Oireachtas but in the community generally about the necessity for making professional help and advice more readily available to those directly affected by stillbirths.  Our health service has not been structured to meet needs which often arise at short notice and are very intense for a short period.  I hope the Minister for Health will try to improve such facilities for people who need them.</P>
    <P>I want to touch briefly on some sections of the legislation.  I understand the Minister is adopting the World Health Organisation's position in regard to the definition of a stillborn child.  That is fair enough; one has to have certain parameters. However, complications may arise because there will always be the possibility of the weight not being achieved or the gestation period of 24 weeks not being reached and a parent or parents may be aggrieved at not being able to have the birth defined as a stillbirth and have the registration process take place.  Would it be possible to vary that section to allow the views of the parent or parents to be taken into account, because this will not in any way affect society or the community?  It is important to parents to have a stillbirth defined as such and have it registered.  I know the Minister will try to take account of this, notwithstanding the difficulties.</P>
    <P>In section 6, the Minister is not compelling parents to register a stillbirth but is compelling hospitals and medical practitioners to do so.  There may well be occasions when a parent or parents decide that they wish this matter to be private within their own family and do <Col N="55" /> not wish a registration to take place.  I am not saying that will happen, but the possibility is there and it might be appropriate, because of the caring social approach of this legislation to take account of this fact in it.  Not every parent may wish to have a stillbirth registered. If that is not the case, I accept that section 6 should not be altered.  I acccept that the compulsion gives it a certain statutory strength.  I just wonder can the legislation be modified to take account of the wishes of parents who do not wish a registration to take place.  That may have wider implications for the strength and vigour of the legislation.  If it does, I certainly accept that section 6 should remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that under section 8 the register will not be accessible to the public.  Currently, one can obtain a copy of a birth or death certificate on payment of a fee.  Stillbirths are very personal to the parent or parents and the immediate family.  Therefore, I am glad to see that any member of the public cannot simply wander in, pay a fee, and obtain a copy of the certificate concerned.</P>
    <P>This is part of the Minister's wider brief in equality and law reform.  Bearing in mind his record to date, if this is an indication of how he intends to proceed in the area of equality and law reform, the future augurs well for dealing with a number of major issues which are likely to arise in the lifetime of this Government. The Minister has an important date with the people later in the year, when other important matters will be dealt with.  The decision of this Government when taking up office to put in place a Department, which at the time may have been criticised, has proved beneficial. The Minister's Department is the engine of law and social reform here and I hope that at the end of the lifetime of this Government the Minister, Deputy Taylor, will have achieved a great deal in bringing forward necessary long overdue legislation which, in many cases, affects a large number of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister on introducing <Col N="56" /> it.  It has been requested by parents, members of the medical profession, members of ISANDS and others for some time.  The Minister tried to satisfy everybody by giving a broad definition of the word &ldquo;stillbirth&rdquo;, namely, a foetus born dead at a gestational age of 24 weeks or more or weighing 500 grammes or more.  Some may quibble with that definition and prefer the one used by the World Health Organisation, but I am satisfied with the definition in the Bill.  I also welcome the provision in regard to retrospective registration.</P>
      <P>This legislation is important from a number of viewpoints, for example, the therapeutic parental aspect, the statistical aspect and the fact that it brings us into line with other EU countries in regard to legislation on stillbirths.  From an obstetrical point of view, the legislation will highlight recent advances in perintology and neonatology especially having regard to the viability of foetuses from the gestational period of 24 weeks or more.  The recent remarks by Dr. Mortimer of Galway University College Hospital about the possible linkage of stillbirths to the sudden infant death syndrome should be noted.  A stillbirth certificate and a photograph of a stillborn baby will help parents, families and relatives in their time of grief.  Great strides have been made by nurses, doctors and the religious to assist parents during the grieving process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a statistical point of view, it is important for medical and sociological researchers to ascertain the total number of stillbirths per annum and if there are any aetiological factors present.  In the majority of cases the cause may not be ascertainable, but many factors were alluded to this morning, for example, the rhesus haemolytic disease, preventable anoxia, folic acid deficiency which has been associated with neural tube defects and perhaps an encephaly.  Environmental factors, especially radiation, were also alluded to and, in that regard, particular reference was made to County Louth and the investigations carried out there by Dr. Sheehan.  Deputy McManus <Col N="57" /> also mentioned some sociological and economic factors.</P>
    <P>Recent advances in obstetrics, that of ultrasound, placental biopsy, amniocentesis, blood gas analyses and genetic screening may also prove helpful in elucidating the causative factors in stillbirths. The recent finding of Dr. Mortimer in UCG hospital of the possibility of an association aethiologically between stillbirth and the sudden infant death syndrome should be noted.  He has carried out research in that area for the past 20 years and I hope worthwhile results will be forthcoming in the near future.  Nevertheless, that is a ray of hope from an aetiological point of view in respect of stillbirths and sudden infant death syndrome.</P>
    <P>In general, Irish families have become smaller and information on stillbirths is crucial to parents, obstetricians, the nursing profession and so on.  The recognition given to stillbirths in this legislation will go some way in helping parents to deal with the tragedy of a stillbirth.  I thank ISANDS for highlighting the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the debate on this legislation which has universal agreement from all sides of the House.  I compliment the Minister on doing a very good job and we in Opposition are always willing to acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that this legislation was introduced following a ten-year campaign by those who suffered the trauma of stillbirth.  I compliment them on their persistence and resilience in the matter.  Many speakers referred to the trauma and effects of a stillbirth on a family.  Female Members of the House who have had children can empathise with the trauma of childbirth, in particular, the birth of a child that is already dead.  It is difficult enough to have a child that is born alive but giving birth to a stillborn baby is much more traumatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ISANDS campaigned for the setting up of a register of stillbirths which will give a certain dignity to the parents involved.  Many parents of stillborn babies have told me that the sense of <Col N="58" /> isolation and loss is similar to that suffered by the parents of a child who dies at a young age.  Up to now, the attitude of society was that a stillborn child did not exist, in other words, it should be a forgotten period in the lives of the parents. I am glad that such parents persisted in their campaign and I am sure the Minister is well aware of their trauma.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill regarding the availability of a register and the many other issues to which Members referred. Deputy McManus has tabled some amendments which we will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not segregate people who have gone through the trauma of stillbirth into a certain class. Therefore, the provisions of the legislation must be, as far as possible, similar to those which apply following the death of a human being.  In that respect the Minister has included a provision in regard to a compulsory register for the certification of stillborn babies, amending the Birth and Deaths Registration Act, 1863.</P>
    <P>Siblings of stillborn children must also be considered.  They may be teenagers or young children at the time of the stillbirth and would have a sense of family and understanding of the trauma their parents have suffered, particularly their mother.  The registration proposed in the Bill will assist in recognising the trauma which families experience and will help teenage or younger children to understand they had a brother or sister who did not survive full term in the womb or was born dead.  They too can share in the grieving and loving process which they would have had for the child had he or she lived.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by Deputy de Valera's contribution, which I heard outside the Chamber.  This issue has been raised by the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, Deputy Theresa Ahearn, and other Members.  Deputy Bradford has highlighted this issue for a number of years.  This unites the humanity of Members of the House.  We have awaited it for a long time.  I commend the Minister for introducing this <Col N="59" /> Bill and, indeed, this type of legislation which has been outstanding on the Statute Book for many years.  I hope the Minister will continue to make necessary changes as quickly as possible so that people can live their lives in dignity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive and sympathetic response to the Bill and their kind remarks.  The concern of Deputies who spoke on this Bill this morning is not one that arose today or yesterday.  Since my appointment I have received representations and am in consultation with Deputies on all sides of the House in regard to this issue.  That indicates the finest tribute to the democratic traditions of our society.  Like other Deputies, I pay tribute to ISANDS, both at national and local level.  I have met many local groups.  They have always been most helpful and constructive in the ongoing consultations my Department and I have had with them.  As a result of that participation we have produced the type of legislation which meets the wishes of Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill is introduced primarily to afford comfort to the bereaved parents. A stillbirth is an event which has a profound impact on all those involved.  Since my Department assumed responsibility for this area I have spoken to many parents of stillborn children.  They told me of their strong feelings of grief and loneliness following the stillbirth.  They emphasised the importance of official acknowledgment of the stillbirth.  They consider that the absence of official validation devalues the significance of the stillbirth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of my constituency colleague, Deputy Flood, regarding whether the registration should be compulsory or voluntary was the subject of the intense discussion with ISANDS and within my Department.  It was decided that registration must be compulsory to underscore the official character, the status of the register and emphasise the tangible nature of the stillbirth.  The registration procedure is in line with that <Col N="60" /> which applies to the registration of live births.  I am sympathetic to Deputy Flood's question regarding the privacy some families may require at such a time. The information on the register will not be open to public scrutiny.  The stillbirth must be registered, but the privacy of the parents is safeguarded by the introduction of the provision that it will not be open for public inspection.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the possibility of registering miscarriages.  A stillborn child is a child born dead who has reached viability outside the womb.  A miscarriage takes place before the child is capable of being born alive.  There is an important difference, which is recognised both medically and legally.  It is standard international practice to draw a line between a stillbirth which is registerable and a miscarriage which is not.</P>
    <P>The campaign for the registration of stillbirths has been ongoing for many years.  I am glad to have been associated with this measure which will give the bereaved parents the official recognition they have sought.  Under section 13 (3) the Act will come into effect by order on a specified date.  While it will take some time to put in place the administrative arrangements for the implementation of the Act, I intend to bring it into force at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to counselling and other important issues which they acknowledged are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I assure Members I will bring all those issues to his attention and I am sure he will take the necessary steps within his power to deal effectively with those issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of the World Health Organisation's gestational age definition.  There will always be borderline cases and so on.  Ideally one would wish to be in the position to alter those criteria as time passes, taking account of developments in medical science by the simple procedure of ministerial order.  Unfortunately, I was advised that such an alternation in a matter of substantive law would not be appropriate to secondary legislation and would have to be the subject of an <Col N="61" /> amendment of the Act in due course.  The constitutionality of deciding that matter by ministerial order would not be appropriate and I must accept that advice. However, I assure the House that as and when developments take place and if it is considered appropriate to amend that provision, I will have no hesitation in doing so.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their courteous and sensitive contributions and look forward to teasing out issues which arise on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1994. - Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994   [Seanad]:  Committee and Final Stages.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 2, to delete &ldquo;forty-two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sixty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not seek an extension of the period for trivial reasons.  Birth is a major event in a woman's life and in normal circumstances the impact of that experience continues for some time.  That is recognised internationally, even in legislation on infanticide.  The Church also recognises that period after birth.  In cases of stillbirth we should be particularly sensitive to the fact that women need a certain time to recover from the physical experience and to come to terms with the fact that the child is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable length of time may be involved in that process and I am a little concerned that the provision of 42 days would limit the opportunity for parents to come to terms with the stillbirth and take the step of registering it.  While registration will occur anyway, the fact that parents take that step themselves is significant in the process of coming to terms with their grief.  Considering that a three month period is provided for, if necessary, <Col N="62" /> the extension of the 42 days to 60 days would not interfere with the process. Perhaps the Minister would allow for that slightly longer period to accommodate parents in their grief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support the amendment.  As Deputy McManus outlined, people suffer great trauma after a still birth.  In some instances the stillbirth may have taken place outside the country and the parents may wish to come back to Ireland after the event.  In these circumstances people should not be rushed.  The Bill provides for retrospective registration and the whole purpose of it is to help people.  To provide for 60 days rather than 42 days would in no way interfere with the process. It would be a sympathetic gesture and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On balance, I support this amendment.  How did the Minister arrive at the 42 days?  I am sure there is some medical or other basis for it.  I do not know what the requirement is in relation to registration of live births, but perhaps the Minister's intention was to bring it into line with the requirement in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case I freely acknowledge that there is merit in doing that.  As I said on Second Stage, the principle of trying to eliminate the difference between the requirements for live births and stillbirths is a good one.  Part of the principle of the Bill is to apply the mechanism to stillbirths which at present applies to live births and I welcome that. As that is the Minister's reasoning for the provision, I can understand the rationale behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is merit in Deputy McManus's amendment.  It is difficult for people who have not experienced the enormous trauma of stillbirth to even begin to understand the impact it has on women.  It may be that the 42-day requirement is too restrictive in that a <Col N="63" /> woman may not be able to face up to the issue in 42 days, she may be too shattered to confront this procedure.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to carefully consider the amendment.  It would in no way take from the central thrust of the Bill.  If it results in a better, more compassionate Bill, I appeal to the Minister to be more open about the matter.</P>
    <P>By extending the time we may help women, especially those who are particularly badly affected by stillbirths.  All women who experience stillbirths are affected very deeply, but the recovery rate may be faster in some cases.  This may be due to a number of factors such as family support, the age of the woman or the fact that the mother may have other children.  In such cases the healing may be at a more rapid pace.  However, in the case of some mothers, the stillbirth may be the first or only child, or perhaps the woman does not have a great deal of family or community support.  In those cases women cannot reasonably be expected to heal at the same pace.  For those reasons I support the amendment tabled by Deputy McManus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position regarding stillbirths which occur in another jurisdiction?  If my reading of the Bill is correct, the information specified in the section must be given within 42 days to the registrar in the district in which the stillbirth occurs.  If the stillbirth occurs outside the country to whom is the information given?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tease out this issue a little further?  Very often it is difficult to say when a stillbirth will occur. Obviously when something goes wrong in a pregnancy the woman could have a <Col N="64" /> spontaneous miscarriage.  Is the Minister saying that a family will not be able to register the fact that a child is born dead if the child is born while they are on holidays in Spain or elsewhere?  Will the treatment of people in these circumstances be different than if their child had been born in Ireland?  Will the Minister consider that matter?</P>
      <P>I accept that the requiremennts in regard to stillbirths should be along the lines of those that apply to live births.  It is interesting that maternity leave is paid for a great deal longer than 42 days.  Most women tend to take the bulk of their maternity leave after the child is born which means there is time for bonding between the mother and child.  I have sympathy for the sentiments in this amendment.  After all 60 days is less than two calendar months and we should take into account that two months is a very short time to get over the trauma of a normal birth.  It must be even more difficult to get over the trauma of a stillbirth, particularly when the woman knows that the baby she is carrying will be born dead. In those cases it may take longer to get over the trauma.  Therefore, there is merit in this amendment and perhaps the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the legislation puts the obligation on the State to register the birth.  There is no obligation on the parents to register the birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is no obligation on them to register the birth.  The obligation rests with the State.  Of course, parents will have the opportunity voluntarily to register the stillbirth during the period proposed.  If the legislation is to mean anything it must put an obligation on someone to register the stillbirth.  In the initial stages that obligation will rest with the State.  The signing of the register by the parents in the presence of the registrar is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Will the Minister refer to stillbirths outside this jurisdiction?  Most countries have met their responsibilities in this area but there may be some jurisdictions, even within the EU, which do not have a register of stillbirths.  This issue needs to be addressed as parents will suffer a sense of loss if the stillbirth occurs in a jurisdiction where there is no such register.  As in the case of a live birth, the initial responsibility for the registration of stillbirths will correctly rest with the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of a live birth, if a stillbirth takes place outside this jurisdiction it cannot be registered in Ireland.  Births are registered in the country where they occur, and the same applies to stillbirths.  I understand that most, if not all, EU countries have had stillbirths registers in operation for some time.  Registration of a stillbirth would have to take place in the country in which it occurred.  It would be totally alien to the entire registration scheme if an event which took place outside this jurisdiction could be registered here.  The registration system applies to events which occur within the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>With regard to timing, the Bill provides for a period of six weeks within which the registrar has to be notified of a stillbirth. That is the same as the time within which an ordinary birth has to be registered.  As Deputy Owen correctly said, it is my intention to keep the registration system for stillbirths as close as possible in all respects to the normal registration principles which apply.  I would make two points in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the registration is not effected by the parents within the 42-day period does not mean that the birth is not registered.  The birth is still registered through the hospital or medical practitioner procedure.  The registration will take place in any event and it will be possible at any time thereafter for either parent to obtain a certificate of that registration when it has gone through the procedures provided for at the instance of the medical people.  Second, the registration does not have to be done by the <Col N="66" /> mother.  The birth can be registered by either parent; it is also open to the father to effect the registration.</P>
    <P>Taking all those factors into account, I think that the normal 42-day period within which either parent can effect the registration is reasonable.  Even if the parents do not register the birth within that period it will still be registered.  As Deputy Ferris correctly said, the obligation is on the medical people to register the birth.  If the parents are minded to effect the registration, which I imagine the vast majority of them would be anxious to do, it will be arranged in the hospital in the same way as for live births &mdash; I think the hospital authorities consult with the parents and the registration is effected in that way.  Once the register is established those procedures will apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the Minister's inflexible approach to this issue.  I accept that the process for the registration of stillbirths should be as close as possible to the process for the registration of live births.  However, no one can say that a live birth and a stillbirth are similar &mdash; they are totally different. It is a great pity that the Minister will not make this very simple alteration to the Bill to acknowledge that while the registration of a live baby is a positive action which many parents simply carry out as a matter of course, the registration of a dead baby is a very significant and traumatic action for parents.  They are officially stating that their baby is dead and are recognising this formally.  This act will be healing in itself if people are allowed to do it when they are ready.  If they are not able to register the birth they will bitterly regret it and if they register it in a rush they may be emotionally damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not prepared to accept the very simple modification proposed in my amendment.  I do not think it would have any effect on the Bill other than to enable mothers to register their stillbirths.  Many mothers are not married.  We are all aware of the huge increase in the number of single mothers who end up carrying the <Col N="67" /> responsibility for pregnancy and birth and, tragically, for stillbirth.  Will the Minister look again at my proposals for a very minor change, which I believe is still in keeping with the overall thrust of the Bill?  While the registration of stillbirths should be as close as possible to the registration of live births, we should recognise that there is a difference between the two and provide for this in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the registration of births in another jurisdiction, it has been pointed out to me that there may be a rather obscure provision for registering live births in Ireland in such cases.  I must admit that I was not aware of that point when I made my earlier comments.  I will look further at this provision in the context of stillbirths which take place in other jurisdictions and of the overall review of the registration system.  It may be possible to make some provision in those cases.  I would think that the numbers involved would be very few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to timing, I do not think an additional 18 days will make all that much difference to the basics of the system and the provision in the Bill in that regard is satisfactory, given that either parent has the option within six weeks to register the stillbirth. The overwhelming majority of cases will be taken care of in the hospital through the normal procedures which apply there.  Even if the parents decide not to proceed with the registration themselves or do not register the stillbirth for whatever reason within that period, the registration still takes place on an automatic compulsory basis at the instance of the medical people.  I regard this procedure as satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 9, after &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or registered midwife&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell on this matter but it involves a practical consideration in view of the fact that a small number of births occur at home and, obviously, a smaller number of stillbirths, that would have the attention solely of a midwife. It is fair to say that doctors generally disapprove of home births and would prefer women to go into hospital to give birth.  However, a minority of women choose to have their babies at home and in this case it is primarily midwives who attend to them.  In relation to this Bill we should include registered midwives to cover the rare cases in which they are involved.</P>
      <P>At present, my understanding is that if a stillbirth occurs and a midwife is in attendance, she or he has a responsibility to report it to the senior medical officer. There is not the same involvement of the registered midwife in regard to this Bill and the intention of my amendment is to include that aspect of birth where a registered midwife is involved rather than the normal practice of hospital care.</P>

      <P>I fully understand Deputy McManus' point in tabling this amendment but I am concerned about it.  The registration of any death, irrespective of the circumstances, is carried out by a medical practitioner.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to this amendment; perhaps he will be able to make an exception in this case. However, I would be concerned about a change in this area that might create a precedent in regard to other forms of death where somebody other than a medical practitioner was present.  In the event of a home birth assisted by a registered midwife, it stands to reason that in all practical circumstances a doctor would be present.  The Minister may approve a joint signature on the certificate to indicate <Col N="69" /> the death was as a result of a stillbirth which was attended by a registered midwife. I do not wish to ignore the valuable work carried out by midwives but I am concerned about this amendment and we will not be supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>During my Second Stages speech I was not aware that Deputy McManus had tabled this amendment but I did refer to it.  Perhaps the Minister might consider making what is a minor amendment which will affect only a small number of people.  In the context of home births, with particular reference to the Health Act, section 62, states specifically that a women is entitled to receive free midwifery services at home, we must decide whether we intend to encourage women to have home births.  I am aware of the difficulties that have been mentioned by Deputy McManus and my colleague, Deputy Owen, but if we are to give women the opportunity to give birth at home, it is important that due recognition is given by the State to the status of the midwife.</P>
      <P>I referred to this on Second Stage and I did not realise we would be dealing with the matter again on Committee Stage as I had not seen the amendment, but as a State we have grossly underplayed the function and importance of the midwife within the health services to such an extent that the natural process of giving birth is almost equated now to being an illness.  In other words, the medical practitioner must be involved from beginning to end.  I wonder is that necessary.  If we accorded sufficient status to the role of the midwife, we would not have as much regard for the close involvement of the medical practitioner.  This issue could be considered in an overall review of maternity services and the manner in which we deal with those services.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy McManus' amendment will be minor.  It obviously concerns a small number of people and because of that it is worthy of consideration, notwithstanding the concerns of my colleagues on this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the importance of the midwife and I am aware of how active midwives are, in country areas in particular.  They serve a useful purpose but as I understand it the Minister is placing the responsibility of registering this occurrence on a certain category of people.  While we would all hope that the majority of births would be normal, stillbirths have a particular connotation in that there is a responsibility &mdash; as with any death &mdash; on somebody of the category of a general practitioner or hospital doctor to register the death.</P>
      <P>When I first saw Deputy McManus's amendment I wondered whether a midwife should have the responsibility to register this type of tragic occurrence, even if it took place at home.  I am prepared to listen to the Minister's response and I have an open mind on this matter. However, special cases do arise and I doubt if a midwife would act in isolation without some consultation with a medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>Although Deputy McManus indicated that most doctors prefer births to take place in maternity hospitals, for insurance purposes and so on, that does not remove the right of parents to opt for home births.  However, in so doing, they should consult with their local general practitioner, which would result in consultation between the midwife and the general practitioner in any event.  If that is what takes place at present, there is no need for this amendment.  However, I am prepared to listen to the Minister's reply in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask for further brief clarification as perhaps I did not make clear one of my main concerns about this amendment.  Section 6 (2) refers to a medical certificate signed by a <Col N="71" /> registered medical practitioner.  I take it that medical certificate certifies death but that is not actually stated in the Bill.  It states that it must contain certain information where applicable, but if that refers to a death certificate, my concern would be that including a registered midwife in the category of people who could sign death certificates is an issue that would have to be examined further.  For example, in geriatric nursing homes and other similar institutions, people can die in the presence of a nurse but there is no provision in any of our laws that a nurse can sign a death certificate; only a medical practitioner can do this.  I would like the Minister's clarification on this.  I assumed that the certificate to be signed by a medical practitioner was a death certificate and that was why there was need for the presence of a medical practitioner.  If that is not the case, then I have no problem.  This amendment should be accepted.  It was creating the precedent of anybody other than a medical practitioner certifying death that was my concern.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the possibility of including a registered midwife so that the register would show that it was a registered midwife who attended at that birth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether we are not confusing the issue here between the presence of a midwife in the case of a normal delivery and the delivery of a stillbirth in that, in the case of normal deliveries, there has to be combined care which is stipulated by the health boards. Certain criteria must be met before home births can be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Owen, the stillbirth certificate does and is intended to operate on the same principle as a death certificate; that has to be understood.  As Deputy McManus rightly pointed out, the number of home births is extremely small.  In fact, according to the latest statistics the number would be less than <Col N="72" /> 1 per cent of births, and of those, the number of stillbirths would be infinitesimal. Even in the case of a stillbirth at home &mdash; where no medical practitioner was present at the birth &mdash; a medical practitioner will examine the body and produce the required certificate as in the case of a death certificate.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus's amendment would affect not only section 6 (2) but would have implications for other subsections of that section.  In other words, if the midwife was unable to produce a certificate it would follow that the duty to notify would have to be extended to the midwife also.  I did consider that option but decided that this important statutory duty should be confined to registered medical practitioners.  However, I do not want to detract in any way from the excellent and important work undertaken by registered midwives; on the contrary, I pay tribute to their work.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter carefully and consulted, where appropriate, I came to the conclusion that the provisions should remain in place, having regard to the similarity of the death certificate and it is appropriate that a certificate should be signed by a medical practitioner.  I am prepared to consider this question and, indeed, all aspects of the operation of the Bill in the light of practical experience of its operation.  If amendments on this or any other issue are found to be necessary, they can and will be taken into account within the context of the wider review of the births, marriages and deaths procedures in the Department.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I regret I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing to withdraw my amendment following on what the Minister said.  From my reading of the Bill it is not a death certificate that is being sought, but rather, as is stipulated in section 6 (2):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>..... a medical certificate signed by a registered medical practitioner who has attended the birth or has examined the child, stating, in the <Col N="73" /> opinion of the medical practitioner, the weight and gestational age of the child and, naming, where applicable, the hospital in which the birth occurred or which had care of the mother following the birth.</P>
    <P>That is not my understanding of a death certificate.  There is no conflict between the original point I made and the responsibility of medical practitioners to sign death certificates.  That is a separate question.</P>

      <P>This Bill offers us an opportunity to collate information that is badly needed in that we are very deficient here at collecting important health statistics.  The whole question of birth defects has been of concern to people for quite some time. A certain amount of information has been collated but in Dublin and Galway, or the greater Dublin region, only.  This Bill affords us an opportunity to at least include evidence of birth defects.  Many birth defects do not become evident for quite a while after birth and inevitably there would be a certain amount of information not available because of the child having been dead.  Some information could be collated in this register.  We have an opportunity to do so and we should grasp it.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  We have a very low data base on genetics here.  I am not sure that we have more than one or two practising genetic experts here; there may be one in private practice but I know there is nobody working in genetics for the State.  Acceptance of this amendment is very important, not merely for the collation of statistics but also to have such information available for family members of the baby that was stillborn. Very often such information may not be available to a brother or sister of the stillborn child which could have some effect on their lives if they knew a specific defect was present in a stillborn sibling. This amendment has great merit.  Indeed, I am surprised that this data was not stipulated in the list included in the Schedule.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>There is great merit in raising this issue in this debate.  On Second Stage I said that one of the beneficial by-products of the putting in place of the register would be that information will now become available to medical people which, when they correctly collate the facts, will enable them to undertake research.  They may not have had that type of informational base heretofore.  If any information becomes available as a result of the putting in place of this register it is important that maximum use be made of it.  Indeed, if that information could be put to use in bringing about circumstances in which some future stillbirths could be averted, when medical <Col N="75" /> science would benefit from such information, that would be a major advantage.</P>
      <P>The issue being raised could be pursued with greater advantage perhaps by the Minister for Health and his Department. The most we can expect the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to do is to note this, to incorporate the substance and spirit of what has been requested in this amendment in the Bill and, more fundamentally, to bring it to the notice of the Minister for Health so that there will be clear, productive communication between the two Departments. This would mean that the information could be put to maximum good use in health practice and in public policy in the area of health in the future. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the purpose of this Bill is therapeutic and not statistical.  Statistics on stillbirths, including the cause of stillbirths, are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and by the Department of Health.  I would take the view, therefore, that the inclusion of details of birth defects on the register and on the certificate is not necessary.  I have to take account of the very likely fact that the recording of such details in many cases could be extremely distressing to the parents. In cases where, tragically, there are defects in live births these are not recorded on the register or on the birth certificate and I am sure we would all agree it would be inappropriate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill and the register and certificate is to bring comfort to people, not cause them distress.  For <Col N="76" /> these reasons I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister underestimates how difficult it is to get accurate information.  Under the international programme, EUROCAT, there are concerns about getting the full picture in relation to congenital malformation.</P>
      <P>The register will be private and will not be open to public persual.  The importance of collating this information is equally valid in relation to live births and should be extended to it.  It would be therapeutic for parents of stillborn children to feel that, in their own small way, they were helping to ensure that the level of stillbirths was reduced because there was greater information available which would show why stillbirths and deformities occurred.  We cannot discover what causes these unless we have information. This register affords us a good opportunity to obtain such information particularly as it is a private register.  We can ensure that this information, which is badly needed in relation to the formation of health policy, can be obtained in a sensitive way which is in tune with the needs of the parents involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which would be made available may prove to be the only information which would assist years hence in the medical treatment of a relative of a stillborn child.  How often do doctors ask if there is an incidence of heart disease or whatever in a family in order to assist them in their diagnosis and treatment of patients?  I agree with Deputy McManus that perhaps this kind of information should be available in relation to live births.  I do not know what my grandfather or grandmother might have suffered from.  Such information could well assist in the medical treatment of a future relative of a stillborn child. We are not looking for this information in order to be prurient, cause distress or for the sake of statistics, but because it may assist some future relative of the stillborn child.  That is one of the reasons why I think this is a good amendment.</P>

      <P>There are records of stillbirths in the CSO.  We are entering into an extremely sensitive area.  We have gone down the road that the parents of stillborn children asked us to.  If such information is registered, it will appear on the certificate which is not what the parents of stillborn children wanted. They did not want this on the certificate but just to have the stillbirth recorded. Provision could be made to keep statistics by way of ministerial order to ensure that information is available for medical purposes, but the information should not appear on the register or on the certificate. I understood the Minister to respond in that way.</P>

      <P>We cannot understate the rationale behind the Bill which is therapeutic rather than statistical.  I accept the validity of the amendment in that there is a statistical deficit in this area.  We need a far more comprehensive data base particularly in the health area.  While I accept the need for it, I am doubtful whether this Bill is the correct mechanism by which to deal with it.  I am unsure of the precise nature of the statistics which are presently compiled by the CSO and the Department of Health on stillbirths. It would be helpful if we had an exact idea of the nature of the statistics.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Owen's point, there are medical records available in relation to all of us, particularly at birth. There is a process by which people go through gynaecologists, GPs and so on. It is in that general area that the matter should be looked at.  The Minister for Health should bring forward specific proposals in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the motive behind the amendment and sympathise, up to a point, with the comments made by Deputy Owen.  The data we are talking about is already collected and collated by the Department of Health.  In their publication, <i>Perinatal Statistics 1990</i>, table 46 gives the cause of death of stillbirths, early neonatal deaths and mortality rates.  It lists the various defects and conditions that have caused them with analysis, numbers, percentages and so on.  That information is already collated and given there.  Many parents who would look at these certificates from time to time to bring back memories would be reminded of a particular defect in the child.  This would be entirely counter to the objective of this Bill which is to provide comfort for these people.  The cause of the condition is a matter on which they will be consulting with the hospital and with their doctor.  That is family information in so far as it may be relevant.  I would not regard it as appropriate to record details of defects in the case of a live birth; neither would I consider it appropriate in the case of a stillbirth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the element of comfort which this Bill will provide for parents.  I would not wish that any amendment of mine would damage that and I do not believe my amendment would have that effect.  Deputy Martin said he was not certain about the position. A cancer register has recently been established, not because there was no information in the country but because it was not collated and the overall picture was not clear.  The stillbirths register will be a national register which can provide the grounds for carrying out research and also for making improvements or changes in health policy which may ensure that babies can live.  That is a point that would bring comfort to parents.  Perhaps it is the Minister for Health who should be here today.  I welcome the fact that this Bill was introduced by the Minister for <Col N="79" /> Equality and Law Reform but there are medical implications and we cannot pretend otherwise.</P>

If you are somebody who has been fortunate to have children and never had a stillbirth it is difficult to imagine the pain involved.

In fact the chairman of the company said in the most recent annual report that it regularly considers such alliances.  Given developments which are unfolding in the industry internationally, it would be surprising if Telecom Éireann was not engaging in exploratory contacts of this kind.</P>
      <P>The question of acquisition of equity in Telecom Éireann by a third party is a matter for me and for the Government. The present position of the Government on the issue is stated clearly in the Programme for Government, which says that the Government will guarantee that the main strategic utilities and enterprises remain in the ownership of the Irish people, while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private and co-operative sectors.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that talks are going on with the UK company and that the trade union representatives have been in touch with both the Minister and Telecom with regard to their reservations in this regard and whether the Minister will encourage the company to contact French Telecom, which has indicted that it is particularly interested in an Irish joint venture?</P>

      <P>I have replied to the question and stated clearly that I would find it surprising if Telecom was not in exploratory talks with a number of prospective partners if it was in its strategic interest to do so.  It is clear from the developments in the industry worldwide and in Europe that this is taking place in a range of utilities in other countries.  The Government and my Department have not been party to any such talks.  Until a proposal comes to me I am not in a position to speculate one way or another.

For the first time Ireland has security of supply in the event of a disruption to our supplies from the Celtic Sea.  The interconnector pipeline also provides us with an alternative source of supply when supplies from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields begin to tail off from 1997 onwards and run out early in the next decade.</P>
      <P>When this project was first being considered a comprehensive feasibility study of the project was undertaken.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious deterioration of the postal services to, from and within Dublin in recent weeks; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to restore the national postal service to normal standards; if he has had any consultations with An Post; and if he has satisfied himself that An Post is capable of carrying out its statutory obligations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of its recovery measures designed to reduce costs and improve profitability, An Post recently implemented a programme of changes in the arrangements for distribution and <Col N="85" /> delivery of mail.  The changes affected operations in Dublin and in country areas and were fully agreed with the appropriate trade unions before implementation. The recovery measures are part of a major programme to make An Post more cost efficient &mdash; they are expected to show savings of £8 million to £9 million a year &mdash; while maintaining standards to all customers.  They were developed against a background of accumulated losses of £14 million in An Post in recent years and the prospect of further losses in the future.</P>
      <P>The changes in Dublin were the most far reaching since the introduction of postal services in the last century.  They involved the start of operations at the new Dublin Mails Centre with the transfer of over 400 staff from the old Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street, the opening of new Dublin 1 and Dublin 2 Mails Offices with the transfer of a further 200 staff from Sheriff Street and revised delivery arrangements involving single delivery in Dublin postal districts.</P>
      <P>The initial period of this changeover saw delays in some Dublin postal districts, in particular in Dublin 1, 2 and 4. The scope and complexity of the change made it unavoidable that there would be some disruption to services until the new operational arrangements were beddedin. An Post took remedial action by way of additional deliveries and other measures and I am informed that next day deliveries are now back to normal. I understand that some customers are unhappy with the time at which mail is currently being delivered and An Post is endeavouring to see that customers' needs in this regard are met to the greatest extent possible under the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that within recent weeks it has taken as <Col N="86" /> long as five days for a letter posted in Dublin to be delivered in Limerick and <i>vice versa</i>, that that applies not just to Limerick but to various other provincial cities and centres and that this is simply unacceptable in this day and age, when it has been discovered by some people that if they had letters delivered by Pony Express, as was done 100 or 150 years ago, they would arrive at their destination more rapidly?  Will the Minister give an assurance that the postal system will get back to what it used to be when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs ran it and it seemed to work smoothly and reliably?  Next day delivery is a fiction as this applies only to a small proportion of letters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the greatest rate of change in the postal delivery services this century.  An Post and everybody concerned had signalled there would be teething problems, as there are in any new arrangements.  I am satisfied that matters have been brought back to normal.  There were difficulties and the Deputy and others will be able to give individual instances, but we have to try to avoid the flippant remark.  Major changes involving economies have been made with the agreement of all and between £8 million and £9 million will be cut from their operational costs per annum.  We have heard in the past from the same quarter from which complaints are coming that commercial semi-State bodies must be cost efficient and pay their way.  As a result of these agreed changes being implemented that prospect is open to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were difficulties and An Post, both management and staff, would regard as unacceptable the length of time that Deputy O'Malley referred to in a number of instances for a letter to go from Dublin to Limerick.  That would be unacceptable to any company which is serious about its business and it certainly would be unacceptable to An Post.  It is doing all it can to get over the teething problems.  The company is addressing them and is seeking to address any outstanding needs for customers over the <Col N="87" /> next couple of weeks.  Credit should be given where it is due as well as highlighting the inadequacies which were predictable.</P>

      <P>While it is very commendable to save £8 million to £9 million a year in excess costs, is there much point in saving this amount if the price of saving it is a very serious deterioration in postal services generally?  The Minister says that these four and five day delays will come to an end but can he say whether people in Dublin, particularly businesses in the centre city, will in future get deliveries of post at reasonable hours and not at 12 noon, 12.30 p.m. and 1 p.m. as has been the case over the past three weeks?  This makes it impossible for them to run a business in any reasonable way.</P>

      <P>The changes that have been brought about have not been for the purpose of a serious deterioration in services.  There have been temporary problems which have been addressed and alleviated significantly over the past couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>On the question of customers being unhappy at the time the post is delivered, An Post is working on this problem and expects to see further improvements in the next two to three weeks.  It has to be said, nevertheless, that it will not be possible to effect all deliveries at the same hour and An Post proposes to make available a collection facility for customers who wish to avail of it.  It will not be possible for everybody throughout the city to get post at 10 a.m. but it will ensure that single deliveries will work to the best possible extent and the quality of the service will be maintained.  The company is very anxious to maintain the quality of service.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he is considering an application from the ESB to increase electricity charges; when he will make a decision on this matter; and the policy framework in which this decision will be taken.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, the ESB has applied for an increase in electricity prices primarily to finance its proposed capital expenditure programme.</P>
      <P>The Culliton and Moriarty reports and the recently published <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> all emphasise the necessity of minimising energy costs as a vital element in maintaining a competitive edge for Irish businesses.  If our energy costs escalate, economic growth could be adversely affected.  This is the policy framework within which the need for an electricity price increase is being assessed.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that the ESB's cost base and capital expenditure programme must be examined in detail before taking a decision on the price increase application.  The review of the ESB will concentrate on how ESB costs compare with international best practice and will establish international benchmarks against which future ESB costs and performance can be monitored.</P>
      <P>No decision will be taken about an electricity price increase until I am satisfied that all opportunities have been exhausted to maintain the existing price levels through greater efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there will be a further delay in arriving at a decision on the price increase sought by the ESB.  Will he confirm that the ESB has sought a 5 per cent increase in charges up to 1997?  This should have been taken into account in the calculations used by the Minister for Finance when he was negotiating the new agreement with the trade unions.  Did the Minister take account of inputs to the consumer price index when the negotiations were taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1992 the ESB submitted a request for a price increase equal to inflation over a five year period. The main reason is to cover the cost of the <Col N="89" /> proposed capital investment programme. This programme will depend on future directions for the electricity sector.  No price increase has yet been approved and the matter is still under consideration.  In the company's corporate plan, submitted in May 1993 the board of the ESB stated it wished to proceed with the price increase.</P>
      <P>A number of issues is involved.  There is a need to assess the very significant capital investment programme proposed by the board which is in the region of £1,300 million and will obviously have a major impact on future price levels. There is also the question of interest charges and the capital structure of the company with the cost that imposes.  Fuel costs have been more to the ESB's advantage in recent times than heretofore.  In terms of predicting the ESB's requirements there is a need to benchmark the company in terms of best international practice and to address precisely the needs of the company in terms of its capital investment programme.  There is also the question of increasing plant availability, which would reduce the need for capital investment as soon as might otherwise be predicted.  There are assumptions in all areas of the corporate plan which have to be addressed and monitored and then the Department will take decisions.  I believe we should look at this in a co-operative way and come up with solutions so that a price mechanism that is acceptable to everybody can be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that his own or his Department's indecisiveness in assessing the ESB's request is harmful to consumers and to the employees of the ESB?  He has to face up to the problem now.  The ESB has lodged its corporate plan but no decision is forthcoming from the Minister who is using international market forces to arrive at a conclusion.  Would he accept that this indecisiveness is harmful all round?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused of many things during the past 12 months <Col N="90" /> but this is the first time I have been accused of being indecisive.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of factors have to be taken into account by my Department in deciding whether a price increase is necessary and, if so, the level. A framework is being put in place to allow us reach conclusions in a co-operative manner.  A cost study has been initiated to assess the company against international benchmarks.  The intention, in keeping with its mission statement agreed with all the staff, is to have an excellent electricity company which can compare with any in the world. Before we reach any conclusion, to protect the consumer and ensure a price increase is warranted we will look at its capital investment programme to see if it can be made more efficient.  It is prudent to do this.  I am not being indecisive.  We are putting a framework in place within which those decisions will be made and proceeding on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 11, 17, 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Our Government is fully committed to the promotion of appropriate forms of renewable energy and has requested the ESB, in consultation with our Department, to prepare a competition to contract for supplies of up to an additional 75 MW of installed capacity from alternatives sources by 1997.  Details of this competition are in the final stages of preparation and I expect to be able to announce them fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect the further development of wind energy to be a significant part of this initiative.  Such development will be encouraged by the success of the Bellacorick wind project in County Mayo, where 21 turbines with a combined capacity of 6.45 MW were installed in late 1992.  This project has exceeded expectations and produced 15.6 million <Col N="92" /> units of electricity in its first year of operation. The location of new projects will, however, be a matter for individual developers.  I can also confirm that it is proposed to monitor the performance of the successful projects with a view, <i>inter alia</i>, to developing future strategy in this important area.  I believe that it would be premature at this stage to set further targets, pending a detailed review of the results of the forthcoming competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the present targets.  The Minister of State used the words &ldquo;alternative sources&rdquo;. Did he mean renewable energy, because nuclear power could be considered as an alternative source?  I thought the issue of Carnsore Point had been dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to renewable energy and I assume that this is what the Minister of State means when he refers to alternative sources, but I would like to know this for certain.  Is the Minister of State aware that Ireland is lagging behind other countries with less potential when it comes to wind and wave power?  Does he propose to encourage the private sector or, indeed, individuals to supply electricity from renewable sources by increasing the unit cost payable in line with the unit cost payable to the ESB to suppliers who use fossil fuels, most of which are imported?  The figures make interesting reading.  If the Minister of State examines them he will find that the unit cost payable to suppliers who use renewable sources is lower than the unit cost payable to suppliers who use fossil fuels.</P>

      <P>That is your loss.  It must be acknowledged that alternative energy technologies are not yet competitive with traditional sources for electicity generation.  Nevertheless, it is desirable to develop these technologies with a view to job creation as well as diversifying our sources and maximising indigenous resources in a way that contributes to environmental improvement. The costs thus arising will however have to be reasonable and met by the ESB.</P>

      <P>I have not yet been given the answer I am seeking.  I asked the Minister of State to compare the unit cost payable to suppliers of energy from wind power, for example, with the unit cost payable to suppliers of energy from turf fired stations by the ESB.  The Minister <Col N="94" /> of State should consider levelling the playing pitch to ensure that suppliers of energy from renewable sources are paid an equal amount.  This is not the position at present.  The Minister of State says he is committed to present policy but we have yet to see this put into practice.</P>

That led to an upsurge of renewable energy in Germany which would not otherwise have taken place.  The payment there is 15 pfennigs per unit, equivalent to about 6p, which would make the production of renewable energy viable in this country which it is not at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister confining the target to 75 megawatts from renewable sources?  This is very modest given that <Col N="96" /> our existing installed capacity is in excess of 2,500 megawatts.</P>

      <P>There are two different federal programmes in Germany.  The target to be met by 1995 is 250 megawatts of installed wind energy capacity, and 2,250 photo-voltic installations of between one and five kilowatts each.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and the decision he has made in principle but let me express the hope that it will happen on the ground.  Is the Minister aware that during December and January senior executives of Aer Lingus visited Swissair in Zurich on four separate occasions asking them not to go on with their application to provide this service?  Does the Minister agree that has shades of Aer Lingus' approach some years ago to KLM when they illegally paid £500,000 to KLM not to provide a service between Ireland and Amsterdam? Will the Minister ensure that Aer Lingus' efforts will not be successful this time and that the Swissair service to Dublin will go ahead?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of what the Deputy is talking about, nor does it concern me.  Crossair has not yet been formally designated on the route by the Swiss authorities.  We have written to them conveying approval in principle for the proposed service asking them to have the Swiss authorities formally designate them in accordance with Article 1.b of the Bilateral Air Transport Agreement between Ireland and Switzerland.  We have also requested from them a copy of their authorisation to operate air services issued by the Swiss authorities, evidence of insurance and fares filing indicating the fares available on the route and associated rules.  I am simply dealing with the applications on their merits.</P>

      <Col N="99" /> It is Government policy, to promote the orderly development of the mineral resources of the country, where this can be done in an environmentally acceptable way.  Our objective is to achieve a sensible pragmatic basis, on which to balance the needs of job and wealth creation with those of the environment and also to ensure a proper return to the State from the development of our mineral resources.  I am sure that with modern extractive methods this can be achieved. We are, therefore, committed to the favourable consideration of applications, for the development of both of these projects, provided that the applicants can demonstrate that they have the necessary financial, technical and other resources, to bring the respective deposits into production, in an acceptable fashion.  This is, of course, subject to full planning permission and other necessary permits having been obtained and to our full consideration of any objections received following the advertising procedures, required by section 18 of the Minerals Development Act, 1979.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Gilmore was listening.  I gave a very clear answer about the procedures that must be followed before a State mining lease or licence can be given to any body.  I said previously in this House that we received an application regarding Galmoy on 13 January 1993.  This is subject to certain conditions, one of which is planning permission.  Planning permission has not been granted and when that is granted further consideration will be given to the application.  That is public knowledge and one does not need to ask a parliamentary question to discover that.  I am bound to obey and uphold the law and ensure that we perform within the law just like anybody else, including all applicants.</P>
      <P>In regard to royalties, I cannot comment on matters in which I was not involved in the past, some of which are the subject of court proceedings at present.  Suffice it to say that all mineral development to date has made a return to the Exchequer.

      <Quest>when mining companies will commence prospecting for coal in view of the fact that exploration licences were granted in October 1993; the reasons for the unusual delay by his Department in confirming commencement of coal prospecting to the mining companies involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Slieveardagh Coalfield, County Tipperary where a prospecting licence authorising the licensee to prospect for coal was granted to Boulea Resources Limited, following a competition for prospecting licences available in the coalfield held last year.  The licence is valid for a period of two years from 11 October, 1993.  The exploration programme proposed by the company over the period of the licence was agreed by my Department prior to the issue of the licence.  It is a matter for the company involved to decide when to commence prospecting under the licence provided they comply with the terms under which they were granted the licence, that is that <Col N="103" /> they complete the agreed work programme within the two year term of the licence.</P>
      <P>An application for a further prospecting licence for coal in the coalfield from WYG Limited is currently being processed by my Department and I expect to be in a position to issue this licence shortly when all the necessary requirements have been complied with by the company.</P>
      <P>Other interested parties have also been in contact with my Department about other areas of the coalfield and I am hopeful that these will lead to further prospecting and mining operations in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 49 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>These questions are primarily related to competition policy.  This is a matter in which I have no function; the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for competition policy.</P>
      <P>However, by way of information, I would refer the Deputy to the findings of the Director of Consumer Affairs, who reported on this matter to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1990.  The director found that the ESB was not operating unfairly to the detriment of its competitors in using the billing system as a means of collecting repayments on credit purchases of retail goods.</P>
      <P>In view of the director's findings, the ESB's use of the billing system in their retailing activities is not currently under consideration.  If further independent examination of the matter by the relevant competition agencies were to find to the contrary, then the matter could be addressed in that context.</P>
      <P>I consider that measures already introduced, including a new invoicing system and confining the promotion of electrical appliance sale to three billing periods annually, represent a reasonable balance between the needs of consumers, who appear satisfied with the present arrangements, and other appliance retailers.</P>

It is not unfair that small businesses who are paying their taxes and finding it difficult to survive should subvent the body that is trying to put them out of business?

      <P>The ESB has been involved in the sale of retail appliances for the past 60 years.  Should any further independent examination of the position provide evidence to the contrary under the competition Acts, that can be dealt with.  I am not in charge of competition and I have no function in that regard.  A study was carried out in 1990 and its findings published.  Should an independent examination in the future come up with findings to the contrary, the matter can be dealt with in the context to which I referred.</P>

      <P>The Minister should take an active interest in the affairs of small retailers nationally.  To date, he has ignored their plight.  Will the Minister not agree that there is concern among many retailers and that it might be worthwhile for his Department, on receiving such evidence, to contact the ESB and the Director of Consumer Affairs about the lack of competition, as small retailers see it?  He should at least try to address current difficulties in this area.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Question Time is to impart information based on <Col N="107" /> the question tabled.  I have given a full answer to the question.  If there are concerns about how this practice is impacting on other retailers, that matter can be taken up with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The small business task force received a number of representations in this regard.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, contacted me in that regard and I subsequently passed those representations to the ESB.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, who has consistently shown his independence, examined this matter without the influence of any vested interests and arrived at conclusions. The Deputy will be aware that it has been suggested that an amendment to the Competition Act will allow people to submit complaints to the relevant competition authorities.  The basis of those complaints may allow those authorities to examine the matter further, for example, if further evidence is provided which was not available in 1990. That is the way this matter should proceed.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: As a sensible Member of the House, will the Minister accept that a small electric shop in Carlow, Tullamore or Galway cannot compete with a monopoly, such as the ESB who have many outlets?  He should have a personal view as to whether that is fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to another sensible Member of the House, I am just as aware of complaints from the electrical industry in Offaly as he is of those in Carlow.  The ESB does not have a monopoly in this area because electrical shops are also selling white and brown goods.  I am aware of the nature of their complaints. I have told the House how best they can proceed with their complaints. Up until 1990 the basis of their complaints was not upheld by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If subsequent information is presented, they should proceed on that basis.  Proposed amendments <Col N="108" /> to the Competition Act announced by the responsible Minister may enable them to proceed with a greater degree of success than in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with its strategy of competing in all segments of the market, Aer Lingus has indicated its intention to develop the concept of a low fare-low cost carrier, separately branded as Aer Lingus Express, to compete mainly in those segments of the UK market which are purely cost driven.</P>
      <P>The formulation of plans for and the timing of the establishment of Aer Lingus Express are matters, in the first instance, for the management and board of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the proposal to establish the Aer Lingus Express service was an integral part of the plan for Aer Lingus which the Minister presented to the House?  Will he agree that the conditions set down by the EU Commission in respect of the Cahill plan, specifically the Dublin-London route, whereby there has been a cap on the number of passengers, effectively means that the proposal to establish Aer Lingus Express has been dropped by Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Those conditions do not effectively mean that.  The conditions imposed by the Commission do not in any way preclude the implementation of recommendations of the Strategy for the Future document which forms the basis of Aer Lingus's restructuring plan.  Apart <Col N="109" /> from that condition, I have indicated that it would be the Government's and my intention that Aer Lingus Express must be a stand alone operation.  It will target a cost driven niche in the market.  There is no point, nor is anyone in Aer Lingus interested, in setting up another subsidiary company that is not a stand alone commercial operation.  In accordance with section 14 of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, Aer Lingus require my prior written approval for the establishment or acquisition of a subsidiary given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It was stated in the plan that it was management's strategy to target all areas of the market.  It realised that there was a prospect of establishing Aer Lingus Express in the low cost market.  I am awaiting detailed proposals regarding its viability as a stand alone commercial operation.  As soon as those proposals from Aer Lingus are to hand I will consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in understanding from the Minister's replies that Aer Lingus has not yet made this proposal and, if not, when does he envisage it will make it?  Will it be in a position to comply with the Commission's conditions which include operating within its existing fleet, not acquiring other aircraft nor increasing the number of seats it offers between Ireland and the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect to say there is a cap on the number of seats on the Ireland-UK routes.  I will go into detail in that regard when replying to another question.  Regarding Aer Lingus Express, the company has initiated a review group on a management-staff basis to examine what is required to set up a commercial stand alone operation in that end of the market.  I await those detailed proposals.  It was stated in the plan that management should target all areas of the market.  The company is required to act commercially.  We are in the business of making profit which in itself is a quota of efficiency.  As soon as detailed proposals in respect of Aer Lingus Express are presented they will <Col N="110" /> receive favourable consideration from me on the basis I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister is familiar with what is required in respect of the operations of Aer Lingus since his intimate involvement with the company during the past year.  Given the extraordinary decision of the EU Commission to limit the number of passengers Aer Lingus may carry on the Dublin-London route and that it may not increase its fleet, does he believe it is possible for Aer Lingus to establish Aer Lingus Express?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not an extraordinary decision.  What was extraordinary about the conditionality attached to the State aid approved by the Commission was that it in no way hinders management from full implementation of the Strategy for the Future.  That resulted from good lobbying, not alone by my Department and I, but by management and staff of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Strategy for the Future he will know that over the period of the plan the conditionality applying to passenger numbers in no way affects the plan.  A further reduction in the cost base is needed to establish a commercially viable Aer Lingus Express service.  The Aer Lingus joint study group is considering those issues to ascertain what will be required to compete in that end of the market.  The condition in respect of the present availability of the fleet in no way denies flexibility to use alternative aircraft once the general number of aircraft in the fleet are kept within the limit set out in the Commission's letter of approval.  It is possible to set up the service. There is nothing to preclude it being set up once a proposal is presented which meets the commercial criteria required.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I always thought he was a spacer but I did not think he was responsible for terrestrial signals and so on.  I am talking about communications.  Surely this Minister is responsible in the event of interference with service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the RTE signal and the Minister with responsibility for RTE is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. However, I will be as helpful as possible. In the clear anticipation that my reply would be regarded as inadequate, even though I am not responsible for this area, I requested an extra note on the matter.</P>
      <P>If the quality of MMDS transmissions was at issue I would have a function in the matter since I am the promoter and regulator of the MMDS scheme and its overall quality as a service is a matter of concern to me.  However, the question relates to RTE 1 and Network 2 reception. Investigation of alleged interference is a matter for RTE in the first instance and that is why it has been handed to the Departments of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  That Department acknowledges its role and is competent to say whether there is interference and where the likely source is.  We are not aware of any such reception problems and therefore cannot speculate on their origin.  The Department would become involved if such interference was established by RTE and if it was shown furthermore that a misuse of the frequency spectrum was involved.  I can be of no more help to the Deputy.  If he puts down the question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht he will receive a more detailed reply.</P>

If the question should have been tabled to the Minister <Col N="113" /> for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, why was I not told and why was it not transferred? What the Minister is saying is not logical.  There has been interference in reception of RTE 1 and Network 2 and in the operation of videos in this locality since the change-over from the cable system to the MMDS system, which was carried out by Cork Communications.  I find it very difficult to believe that the Minister is not aware of the local anger at the interference in reception.  Surely complaints have been made to his Department in this regard.</P>

      <P>There is a more general question on this matter in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe.  As a result of a number of technical and other examinations of this matter, I found that this was the only system available to us for the purposes of providing a nationwide multi-channel system within available frequencies under international treaties. It is proposed to introduce the system in Donegal, west Cork and other areas. Illegal retransmission systems are in operation which provide a service in their localities but they do not provide the prospect of a nationwide service. Because the systems are illegal and use frequencies required for the proper development of the Irish broadcasting service, it is not a tenable argument that they should continue.  The implementation of the MMDS system throughout the country is a priority for the Department.</P>

What ongoing scrutiny is the Department undertaking of the various licensed companies?  Cork Communications has, to say the least, a very cavalier attitude to planning permissions and to their operation of the entire service.  People who wish to make complaints about the service cannot get through to the company; the only reply is by way of answering machine.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 22 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I am generally happy with the rate of progress of the multipoint microwave distribution system, known as MMDS, throughout the country.  I am aware, however, that from time to time criticism is expressed regarding delays in the provision of the service.  I have no reason to believe that these delays are unreasonable having regard to the scale of the project.  Complaints made to my Department about the service provided by MMDS operators are investigated and the matter is dealt with in liaison with the licensee.</P>
      <P>My main concern with regard to the provision of MMDS is the continued existence of illegal retransmission systems which make it very difficult for the licensed operators to penetrate large areas of the country.  This, of course, results in delays in the provision of the service for subscribers in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy well knows, community TV is a euphemism for the illegal retransmission of TV signals and I have dealt with this issue on a number of occasions in this House, as have my predecessors. I want to take this opportunity to state again that I have no intention of licensing such systems now or in the future for the reasons given in my reply of 2 November 1993 &mdash; columns 587-590 of the Official Report of that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had meetings with public representatives <Col N="118" /> concerning the operation of illegal TV retransmission systems.  I have no plans to meet with those directly involved in such systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Countries such as Switzerland receive a rebeaming service from France, Germany, Italy and Austria. If this can be done in Switzerland, why can we not have a similar service here rather than a monopoly MMDS service? I know a person who applied for the MMDS service and paid a deposit but who decided when he had received no reply two months later to send a registered letter cancelling his application and seeking a refund of his deposit.  This person has heard nothing since then, five or six weeks later.  Does the Minister regard this as a reasonable service by a supplier who has a monopoly in my area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy on a number of occasions &mdash; he raised this matter a number of times &mdash; the basic problem with the deflector system is that it operates in a part of the ultra high frequency band which has been allocated to Ireland for television news by the Stockholm Treaty, 1961.  There is simply not enough frequency space available under this allocation to enable a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements, such as the two RTE channels, a possible independent third channel and the proposed Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Those who are calling for the licensing of illegal deflector systems are, in effect, asking me to close off options for the future development of domestic television services, something I will not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to delays in the provision of the service, I would point out to the Deputy that there has been no unreasonable delay in areas of the country where co-operation has been forthcoming from illegal retransmission systems which are required to terminate their services.  I can cite these cases.  If the illegal retransmission system were to agree to go off the air for a certain period this would allow other companies to set up their <Col N="119" /> systems in what essentially would be a green field.  This has been done in some parts of the country.  However, if those operating the illegal retransmission systems refuse to co-operate, those who have the legal franchise can take legal action.  People in my part of the country were deprived of a service until such time as the new system was set up because there was no co-operation from the illegal retransmission system.  There are two ways of providing a service, the easy way and the difficult way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the charge against me is that I have spearheaded a campaign to license community television in accordance with promises made prior to the last general election then I plead guilty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge for the service in Dublin is £70-80 per year. However, because the MMDS operator in Cork enjoys a monopoly I understand the charge in my area is £140 per year.  I understand that the Labour Party set up a parliamentary committee to examine this issue with a view to promoting the licensing of community television.  Has the Minister told the committee that he has no intention of licensing community television or is there a possibility that community television will be licensed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessors and I have enunciated Government policy to the Deputy and other Deputies on request and explained why it is not technically feasible to allow deflector systems in Ireland &mdash; it has to do with the limited number of frequency bands on the UHF system &mdash; and at the same time provide <Col N="120" /> for the ordered development of Irish broadcasting services.  People do not seem to realise that this is a technical problem which must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>With regard to costs, of course the costs vary in different areas.  I would point out that those who hold the legal franchise for the MMDS system must pay VAT and royalties while the illegal retransmission systems do not have any of those outlays.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I make my brief contribution, I also wish to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, for bringing this legislation before the House.  It is long overdue and will certainly impact on many people who deal with institutions in one form or another.</P>
      <P>Most people have to obtain credit facilities at some stage in their lives. Newly married couples have a particular need for supplementary finance to purchase a home, furniture, or car.  Later in life a family may require a loan to fund items such as house extensions, higher education for teenage children and unexpected financial burdens.  Consequently, a very large proportion of our community has some degree of dependency on credit-giving institutions or individuals.  It is, of course, vital that our legislation provides the maximum possible degree of protection to such people and prevents their abuse in any way.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome this comprehensive Bill which fulfils at least three distinct functions.  Initially, it unifies all existing legislation regarding consumers' rights in the area of credit agreements.  Second, by incorporating the objectives of the European Union's twin directives of 1986 and 1990, it allows us to benefit from the advances made by our European partners in this area.  Finally, it incorporates a number of added features which complement existing national and European laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, this is an extensive Bill incorporating 121 sections. Later, I intend to comment briefly on the vital need to have the necessary mechanisms put in place to ensure that consumers are made aware of the many benefits bestowed on them by the Bill. Without such mechanisms it is obvious <Col N="147" /> that the value of the legislation will not be fully exploited.  Initially I would like to consider briefly some elements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions which deal with licensing those who supply credit to consumers.  They deal comprehensively with both primary and secondary lenders. It is vital that the procedures in place to provide licences be fully effective.  This is particularly true in the case of moneylending. When a licence holder has been found to abuse his or her position, it is important that this matter is taken into account when any further licence application is being processed.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome sections 16, 77 and 82 which prevent the lender from enforcing a credit agreement under certain circumstances.  Section 82, for example, should ensure that moneylending is carried out in an open and businesslike manner by properly licensed individuals.</P>
    <P>Provisions to protect the consumer from unethical pressures are quite comprehensive. The nature and place of contact between lender and client are limited by sections such as 43 and 44.  Thus written communication must be properly directed to the consumer while time and location restrictions are placed on person to person contact.  I have a degree of concern in this regard in the case of section 44 where a lender seems to be allowed to visit and telephone a client at his or her place of work when &ldquo;...all reasonable efforts to make contact with him have failed&rdquo;.  While the intention of this clause is obviously reasonable, it may be open to a certain degree of abuse by a determined lender.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps inevitable that a certain percentage of credit agreements will become the source of dispute between the two parties.  While the lender may have legitimate cause for complaint in some such cases, it is nevertheless vital that he or she deals with any problems within both the letter and spirit of the law.  In many cases the consumer is very vulnerable and may be open to exploitation. <Col N="148" /> Section 49 provides a useful protection to such consumers in the case of agreements which may not be enforced under the Bill.  While some unfortunate people may ultimately have to accept the confiscation of disputed goods or property, it is heartening that section 55 will help to ensure the total values recovered are limited to the consumer's debt.</P>
    <P>The increasing use of computer technology in the financial institutions has contributed to a certain distance emerging between management and client.  This can often lead to unnecessary embarrassment and upset for consumers in the operation of their credit accounts, especially in the case of overdraft facilities. The dilemma created by placing computer technology between manager and consumer cannot be solved by legislation alone.  It is but a symptom of a wider problem facing modern society regarding the proper role of such technology. The provisions of section 33 should at least help to ensure that a consumer is made aware at all times of the specific nature of his or her credit limit with any financial institution.  The provisions of the Bill deal at length with the need to ensure that the consumer is informed to the greatest possible extent before entering into any credit agreement. I particularly welcome the emphasis on ensuring that correct interest rates are displayed in any advertisements by financial institutions.  In their haste to obtain the necessary funds, all too often customers rush into agreements carrying totally uncompetitive rates of interest, realising their mistake only when it is too late.  The need clearly to warn prospective clients of the dangers associated with failing to honour a credit agreement is also covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>While a number of other sections contain provisions likely to render life easier for many hard-pressed consumers in the future, I stress the importance of section 46 which allows for legal redress in the event of excessive interest charges being levied.  This will provide a much needed safety net for those who have entered into grossly unfair credit agreements.</P>
    <P>A problem in a detailed Bill of this <Col N="149" /> nature is that, while carefully planned and compassionate provisions may be enacted, intended beneficiaries are often partially or totally unaware of their value to them.  This gap between the potential value of excellent laws and a population not sufficiently informed of their rights must receive increasing attention in the future.  In the case of consumer protection I am of the firm belief that a summary bill of rights should be handed over to a consumer by any lender prior to the completion of credit agreement between the two parties.  Such a bill of rights could easily be extracted from the detailed provisions of this Bill.  Our educational system, especially at second-level, should concentrate more on ensuring that each school leaver is aware of the basics of dealing with personal finances and balancing their individual budgets.  Too often people incur large debts through lack of elementary financial planning.  The consequences can be disastrous for the individual and family involved.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the importance of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will take note of the points which I believe would enhance the Bill and ensure that those most in need of its protection will benefit fully from the work undertaken by the Minister and Members of this House in this respect.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for his very thoughtful and well-researched contribution.  I commend all those who contributed to the Second Stage debate, Deputies Richard Bruton, Quill, Rabbitte, Upton, Ó Cuív, de Valera, Flood and Wallace, all of whom are to be lauded for the research they undertook in preparing their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee system allows a complex and challenging Bill such as this, embodying 121 sections, to be fully dealt with.  Participants on Committee Stage deal with the meat of legislation, as distinct from its philosophical thrust.  Committee Stage of this Bill will be considered by the Select Committee on Security and <Col N="150" /> Legislation when each of the 121 sections will be gone through with a fine comb.  I have already had such experience in the case of the Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Bill, 1993 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Bill, 1993 and I know the committee system is well suited to intense scrutiny.  While I applaud that system, we have tended to leave that entire operation to those committees. Therefore, I was very pleased to note the very fine contributions made on Second Stage and to have had the opportunity to hear all of them.</P>
    <P>I will briefly answer some points raised by Members and allay some fears expressed.  Deputy Richard Bruton, the Fine Gael spokesperson, highlighted the lack of a prohibition on banks charging excessive interest rates.  We have gone further than the relevant directive required in this respect in the provisions of section 46, in that there is not a corresponding provision in the relevant directive. When implementing EU Directives in primary legislation one has the right to go beyond the remit of that directive in line with what the Government in a particular member state may want.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 47 give a court power to re-open credit agreements where the court has found, by virtue of section 46, that the charge is excessive. Section 82 gives the Director of Consumer Affairs power to request any undertaking.  Deputies Richard Bruton and Rabbitte also expressed concern that the Director of Consumer Affairs only can take action under these sections.  I have already considered this matter.  I have come to the conclusion that, as the Director of Consumer Affairs will have an overview of the system through his licensing role, it is in the consumer's interest that he should have such pivotal role.  For consumers to attempt in court to seek redress might cost them a lot more than they would have had to pay to clear the agreement.  It will be of enormous help to consumers that they will have a champion such as the Director of Consumer Affairs to take up their case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton also mentioned the criminal provisions in section <Col N="151" /> 12.  I am grateful to him for bringing this matter to my attention and it will be further examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill, the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, contended very strongly that the Director of Consumer Affairs under this Bill had no right to pursue illegal moneylenders and said she would be tabling an amendment.  It is not my intention to demand of the Director of Consumer Affairs that he pursue illegal moneylenders.  The people to pursue and bring to justice persons involved in illegal moneylending are the Garda who have such powers of pursuit. This will be followed through.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Quill and Rabbitte on the importance of bringing licensed moneylenders into respectability in law.  When introducing Second Stage I made the point that one of the prime provisions of the Bill was to put beyond the pale unlicensed, illegal moneylenders and give authority and coherence to the operations of licensed moneylenders. Each Member who contributed acknowledged that whether we like it or not, licensed moneylenders have a role to play.  We want to draw a clear distinction between the two.  Moneylending always will be with us.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to accept that fact and to establish high standards of moneylending. I am also aware of the anxiety on the part of Deputy Quill and others that, if we render it impossible for licensed moneylenders to operate, those who rely on them for credit will be driven into the very area from which we seek to protect them.  It is a point which was put to me not alone by those in the legal field but also by groups who serve the disadvantaged such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Combat Poverty Agency.  They impressed on me that I was not to fall into the trap of pivoting the legislation in such a way that it would drive people into the hands of illegal moneylenders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill sought provision for a review of the penalties by regulation.  I understand the Department of Justice plan to introduce legislation to update <Col N="152" /> fines.  However, I will examine the matter further in order to decide on the most suitable course of action on that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, spokesperson for Democratic Left, complained that the Bill did not allow for individuals to challenge the granting of a moneylender's licence.  I assure the Deputy this has not been omitted.  I considered the ways in which moneylending could be licensed and controlled and decided this might best be done by giving the Director of Consumer Affairs appropriate powers in that area.  I considered the options regarding the rights of concerned individuals or bodies to contest the granting of such licences and decided it would serve the interests of the legislation if such contests were channelled through the Director of Consumer Affairs as the licensor.  After all, he has taken the place of the court in this function.  I would refer the Deputy to section 48 (1) (a) which reveals the whole process in action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton is the official spokesperson for the Labour Party on consumer matters so I was very glad to hear his contribution.  He has a strong interest in this area and has always served the consumer.  He made a very good and, at times, witty speech.  His remarks were pointed and acute.  He pointed out clearly the complexities of advertising a credit product and the number of choices.  Not all advertising is complex &mdash; there is some simple, straightforward advertising of credit products.  Sometimes complexity leads to confusion.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that consumers are best served by choice but they are not best served if the choice is a confusing one, if the language is confusing, if the images painted are too glamorous, or if he or she stumbles unknowingly into a credit arrangement with insufficient resources or does not understand what they are entering into.  The Deputy made a valuable contribution in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív spoke about the way credit unions serve their local catchment areas.  He would know a good deal about this because he operates in the Connemara Gaeltacht and the western seaboard area where credit unions, co-ops <Col N="153" /> and self-help groups are a strong feature of life.  The scattered nature of the communities encourages them to seek credit from a source which is easily accessible and provides friendly advice.  Historically, the credit union movement has strong links with the flowering of Irish independence, giving people the feeling that they could control their own affairs and could make credit arrangements which would best suit their local communities. The Deputy's words of praise for the credit unions were well taken. He spoke, too, about moneylending and emphasised the need to have clear differentiation between legal and illegal moneylenders.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, armed with knowledge, made a well researched contribution based on the operations in her constituency of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Combat Poverty Agency, both of which were among the large number of groups I spoke with in relation to this legislation.  I pay tribute to the Minister and to the Department of Social Welfare for the special arrangements they have whereby personnel in the Department give special budgetary advice and advance moneys to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other similar parish based organisations and groups.  They meet people, talk through their difficulties with them and try to give a helping hand not just in a financial sense but in a psychological sense. They act as mentor and help people out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The groups I spoke with were the Consumers' Association of Ireland, other consumer interests &mdash; the banks, the building societies, finance houses, the insurance industry, insurance brokers, moneylenders, IBEC, the Incorporated Law Society, the Irish Centre for European Law and those representing the disadvantaged and vulnerable in society &mdash; the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Combat Poverty Agency and money, advice and budgeting service officers in the Department of Social Welfare.  I have paid tribute on radio to the Munster representatives of the Department of Social Welfare in that regard.  I met some of <Col N="154" /> them when I was in Cork and learned of the sound advice they give people.</P>
    <P>This legislation is one of provision and prohibition.  We must have regard to what causes people to get into difficulty and to vulnerable people who go down the road of illegal moneylending.  They endure harassment, all kinds of indignities and physical danger in many cases simply because, through no fault of their own, they did not have knowledge of what they were getting into.  Life is at the wire everyday.  Bills have to be paid and people find they cannot cope.</P>
    <P>Again, I commend the Minister for Social Welfare and his Department.  In 1988 I was in Cabinet when the Minister put forward his ideas on what might be done.  He fought for these kinds of measures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood echoed what Deputy Rabbitte said.  They spoke about legal and illegal moneylenders and how loan sharks prey on people's vulnerability and the immediacy of their difficulties.  His contribution was clearly based on knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace made a reasoned, knowledgeable submission to the House. He has spoken to me outside the House about provisions in the Bill which he would wish to see amended and I will look at his submission.</P>
    <P>The Bill now goes to Committee Stage and that is where we will taste the meat. There are 121 sections.  I do not believe that every Bill that is brought before Parliament is perfect, otherwise what would be the point of introducing it, what would be the point of legislation or democratic debate if everybody simply nodded their heads and went home?</P>
    <P>The purpose of Committee Stage is to hear the views of Members and to consider the amendments put forward. Nobody is saying that my officials or I have all the wisdom in this area even though we have consulted extensively and have started on the second wave of consultations.  We are prepared to consider amendments.  I am not saying every <Col N="155" /> amendment will be accepted &mdash; that would be foolish &mdash; but every amendment will be considered and I am sure some will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this toing and froing in debating legislation is to gain the wisdom of other people.  Members engage in extensive constituency work.  That is one of the reasons I have always said that elected Deputies should not only be legislators. We read articles from time to time by learned political commentators &mdash; I do not mean journalists &mdash; who say elected representatives should only be legislators, that they should concentrate on legislation and leave everything else to county and urban councillors.  All Members when they return to this House on a Tuesday bring with them the thoughts and concerns of the people they meet during the previous weekend.  All measures which come before the House are infused with thought by those who engage in the proper democratic process with constituents who bring their cares and concerns to us.  Rather than be seen, as some people would like to paint us, as trying to get favours from people for which they are not eligible, I often find, through the concerns expressed to me &mdash; I am sure every Deputy has the same experience &mdash; an omission in a particular bureaucratic administration or in legislation or a thought that I can store and put forward to my colleagues in other Departments or in my Department to help the legislative process.</P>
    <P>If we were to cocoon ourselves here and never meet constituents we would be arid and non-productive as legislators.  It was evident from the contributions on Second Stage that people knew clearly what they were talking about.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Members as I bring the Second Stage debate on the Bill to a conclusion.  I look forward with interest and anticipation to Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the decision to review the cases of 3,500 bachelors aged over 75 years who are in receipt of non-contributory old age pension.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position because I understand it may be those pension entitlements will be reviewed.  I understand that social welfare officers are reviewing the entitlement of 600 bachelors, over 75 years of age, on the western seaboard to non-contributory old age pension.  This is a cruel and insensitive exercise.  Most of the people concerned live alone in isolated rural areas, in poor housing conditions and frequently without much support because their relatives live away from home.  In many cases they are dependent on the hospitality of their neighbours for survival and now they are subjected to this totally insensitive attack.</P>
      <P>In the past a bachelor of more than 75 years of age may have accumulated some savings in order to be buried with dignity or in the event of having to spend his final years in a nursing home.  He will now be penalised for saving.  That is most unfair and is very difficult to explain.</P>
      <P>These 600 bachelors, over 75 years of age, face the prospect of a visit from a social welfare officer.  This is a source of worry for them, it will affect their health and result in much stress and tension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I understand that the local officers were requested to measure the savings and to report same to the Department. This calls into question the whole attitude of this Government to those most vulnerable in our society.  It is difficult to explain this measure which follows closely the attempted attack on widows in the past two weeks, on which the Government made a U-turn.  I hope the Government will do likewise on this occasion.  This is a cynical exercise by this Government particularly when one considers the amount of money it is spending on PR, on the employment of programme managers and advisers, on the provision of lavish offices throughout the city and on foreign visits.  I agree some foreign visits are necessary but there appears to be many of them, sometimes with little meaning.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should question the justice and fairness of the Minister's proposal. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw those 600 files.  So far as I am aware some of these cases have been reviewed and a reduction has been made.  Some of the people concerned are unaware of this but no doubt they will be informed by the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to suspend this pilot scheme for the west immediately.  No doubt, if it is successful it will be extended to all pensioners.  This savings exercise is most unfair and is directed at the wrong section of the population, the most vulnerable, those living on the margins.  Most of these pensioners depend on their old age pension to survive. I feel very strongly about this matter and I am sure Members in the Minister's party will bring the matter to his attention in the near future.  On behalf of old age pensioners, the most vulnerable of people, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has got his information on the pilot study a little more accurate and that it is not a question of 3,500 people but a pilot study of up <Col N="158" /> to 600 people.  My Department will be spending £317 million in 1994 providing old age non-contributory pensions to 111,000 people over 66 years of age. Entitlement to this pension is based on a person's means.</P>
      <P>My Department is obliged to ensure that people are paid their correct entitlements. Over two-thirds of old age pensioners are paid at the maximum rate. This indicates that they have little or no means.  However, a pensioner's financial circumstances can change over time, following the initial investigation of the claim.  In some cases pensioners could be due additional pension, while in other circumstances they may be entitled to a lower rate of pension, because of increased income.  With the very large numbers of pensions in payment at any one time, my Department has to be selective in its review work.  The current review is one of many review programmes on various schemes which are normally carried out during the year, as part of an ongoing process.  At any given time there will be groups of social welfare recipients who have not had their means or household circumstances reassessed for many years.</P>
      <P>The review, which involves several hundred pensioners, will indicate to management whether there is a need to extend this work.  The review will identify a number of pensioners who are entitled either to an increase in their rate of pension, or to some additional allowances. My Department will ensure that any such additional payments due to pensioners are given to them with the minimum of delay.  On the other hand some pensioners who have additional means will also be reviewed.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department's field officers are very experienced and will make every effort to complete the individual pension reviews as quickly and in as sympathetic a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has indicated that any savings in this area will be extremely small. <Col N="159" /> That is what one might have expected, but substantial savings from assessing estates are arising, for instance in the region of £2 million from a relatively small number of estates.  It indicates that there are people with more substantial means to be assessed.  My officers are required under the legislation, by the Public Accounts Committee who cross-examine them closely and by the auditor, to ensure that we are paying pensions in relation to means.  In those circumstances they are obliged to establish that means are correct.  It is not a question of small amounts of money.  I expect that experienced <Col N="160" /> officers will be particularly sensitive to the pensioners concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to bachelors.  It appears that the male pensioners have the largest amounts of money and that is why the pilot study is being done in that area. The biggest amount of money is coming up in that area in relation to estates.</P>

      <P>Air Inter, a subsidiary of Groupe Air France, took delivery of an Airbus A330 in December last.  This individual aircraft developed an undercarriage technical problem which occurred on an intermittent basis.  Air Inter decided to ground this particular aircraft &mdash; and only this particular aircraft &mdash; to enable the manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, to fully investigate the problem.</P>
      <P>As of 10 February 1994, the aircraft in question was re-released for commercial service following a full and satisfactory test programme.  There is no reason to presume that this problem would recur on any other aircraft, including those to be delivered to Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 29, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the value added service (VAS) licence issued to ESAT Communications Ltd. are identical to those contained in any other such licence. They are too detailed to go into here but I will arrange for a specimen to be placed in the library of the House for perusal by Deputies.  The ESAT licence issued in December 1992 on payment of the fee of £1,000.</P>
      <P>VAS licence holders are entitled to provide certain telecommunications services that are not within the exclusive privilege of Telecom Éireann.  These include voice services on lines leased from Telecom Éireann as long as these services do not amount to &ldquo;voice telephony&rdquo; within the meaning of the Telecommunications Services Regulations 1992, which transposed Directive 90/387/EEC on the establishment of the internal market for telecommunications services through open network provisions, into Irish law.  Voice telephony so defined remains within the exclusive privilege of Telecom Éireann as set out in S.87 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act of 1983.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the Attorney General's office and with EC Commission officials, I was satisfied that what was proposed by ESAT does not infringe the voice telephony monopoly of Telecom Eireann and I so informed the company.  Telecom Éireann subsequently agreed to provide leased lines to ESAT as required by the terms of the 1992 Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in responding to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report, accepted the recommendations therein and stated <Col N="127" /> that competition across all services and areas of the telecommunications system will be encouraged subject to the imposition of corresponding public service obligations on all service providers to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the possibilities for &ldquo;creaming of&rdquo;, as Deputy Kenny calls it, of the more lucrative aspects of the telecommunications market and I have informed Telecom Éireann that I am open to proposals based on objective criteria to authorise the application of a charge on facilities provided to licence holders in order to help meet the public service obligations contained in S.87 of the 1983 Act.  It is my intention that all players in this market would compete as far as practicable on equal terms and that the public service obligation would be shared equitably between them.</P>
    <P>It is too early to be definitive about the derogation until 2003 from full implementation of the open network provisions.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to bring forward, in due course, for consideration by the Government draft proposals to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932.

The proposals envisage the extension of competition within the passenger road transport area on a regulated, orderly and phased basis.</P>

The investment proposals are under discussion at present with the EU Commission.

      <P>In the context of the completion of trans-European networks the EC Commission has identified, among other things, the need for increased energy transmission capacity, including transmission to the peripheral regions of the Community.</P>
      <P>Three Irish energy related projects have been recognised as being projects of European interest: 1. an electricity interconnector with the UK.  The feasibility of this project is currently under examination; 2. the construction of a gas liquefaction plant to provide peak shaving and backup security to supplies through the Ireland/UK natural gas interconnector; and 3 a North/South high pressure natural gas transmission pipeline from the interconnector connection to the Irish grid link with the planned Northern Ireland/British pipeline.</P>
      <P>The latter two projects are at the planning stage and will be subject to detailed feasibility studies before a decision is made by Bord Gáis and my Department on whether to proceed with either or both of them.</P>
      <P>A working party, under the aegis of the European Commission, will assess each of the projects proposed for the list of projects of European interest before a final decision is made in regard to assistance from the European Union for any particular project.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable an estimate of the number of PAYE employees employed in the building trade in the Dublin area to be provided. Such information could not be obtained without undertaking an enquiry which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Principal contractors are required to complete Form C45 on making payments to sub-contractors who have not been certified by the Revenue Commissioners to receive payments without deduction of tax.  Where such payments are made the principal contractor must deduct tax at 35 per cent of the gross amount of the payment; no reduction is made for <Col N="131" /> expenses or allowances.  Copies of the forms are provided to the subcontractor and to the Revenue Commissioners. There is a tight system of control supported by an outdoor inspection programme which, <i>inter alia,</i> supervises and monitors the system generally and also follows up specific cases where there is attempted or suspected abuse.  As part of their audit programmes the Revenue Commissioners seek to ensure that the C45 system is not used inappropriately.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that contractors are placing employees on the C45 system in situations where the employer/employee rules should apply. This issue was discussed in the context of the negotiations for the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    <P>The C45 system should not be availed of in situations where the employer/ employee rules should apply.  Whether a person undertaking work for a contractor should be dealt with as an employee or as a subcontractor depends on the relationship between both parties.  There are established criteria in law for determining this issue.  A contractor who is in fact an employer must operate the PAYE system and cannot use the C45 system in relation to that employee.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns raised in relation to the C45 system I have asked the Black Economy Monitoring Group to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 scheme and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the scheme generally. Pending the outcome of this review the Revenue Commissioners will take measures to prevent the C45 system being applied where PAYE would be the appropriate system.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this reply, the term &ldquo;public sector pay&rdquo; is taken to mean the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill which covers the cost to the Exchequer of the pay and pensions of civil servants, the defence forces, gardaí and the education sector together with the amounts for pay and pensions included in grants to health boards and other agencies in the health services and to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>The Budget Estimate for Exchequer Pay and Pensions in 1994 is £4,278 million. It is estimated that this amount will need to be increased by a further 2 per cent or £85 million to meet the cost of pay increases provided for in the proposals for a new pay agreement under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, bringing the total estimated requirement for 1994 to £4,363 million.</P>

    <P>The amount shown for 1994 includes the carryover costs of pay increases in 1993 (1.4 per cent), increments and the cost of service improvements, totalling 4.2 per cent, and the estimated cost (2 per cent) of implementing the proposals for a pay agreement in the public service under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    <P>The amounts shown for 1995, 1996 and 1997 cover the estimated costs of implementing the proposals for the new pay agreement only.  These amounts will need to be adjusted in due course by a provision for increments to public servants on incremental pay scales, estimated roughly at 0.8 per cent per annum, and any decisions on service improvements over the period.  As regards service improvements, it is the Government's intention that they be achieved out of extra efficiency rather than by increased numbers of staff.</P>
    <P>The amount shown for 1997 reflects (a) the fact that the proposals for a new pay <Col N="134" /> agreement in the public service span a period of three and a half years and (b) the carryover costs of increases to apply late in 1996.</P>

      <P>In response to these requests from Ireland, and to requests from other member states, the Commission has taken a series of market support measures: 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat was temporarily removed from the market through a scheme of aids to private storage introduced in March 1993; sales of 60,000 tonnes of pigmeat to Eastern Europe were made possible through special export refunds schemes introduced in May and September 1993; and a further special export refunds scheme has just been introduced under which 40,000 tonnes of pigmeat will be sold to Eastern Europe in the coming months.</P>
      <P>In addition, the situation was further improved by the removal, partly funded by the EU budget, from the market of one million pigs due to outbreaks of classical swine fever in Germany and Belgium towards the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor the market situation and will raise at EU level the need for further action as appropriate.</P>
