      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to bring this report before the House.  The debate is particularly timely and I look forward to the views of Deputies as to how to move forward from what I am confident is a well argued, documented and, indeed, historic report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force on small business was a <Col N="490" /> novel venture in a number of ways.  It was the first comprehensive official review of the small business sector undertaken since the foundation of the State.  The fact that so much time elapsed before such a review was undertaken is a testimony to the relative neglect of small business by policy makers until now.</P>
    <P>The task force was unusual also in that its membership was not made up of officials and professional representatives of business associations and interest groups.  All 14 business members of the task force were involved full-time in running and managing a small business.</P>
    <P>I took this decision quite deliberately. I wanted people who were busy, in a hurry to get the job done, and who would bring to our work the qualities of tenacity and single-mindedness that had helped to make them successful in business.  I wanted the authentic voice of small business to be heard, loud and clear.</P>
    <P>A technical group of officials from Government Departments and State agencies was established accordingly to provide information and advice to the task force and to consider and cost its proposals.  The task force also met with senior representatives of the banks, insurance companies and other bodies.</P>
    <P>The fruits of the discussions and exchanges between the business people and officials are, I think, apparent in the report.  The dialogue which took place between the two sides was also, in my view, valuable in itself.  The business people were brought face to face with some of those who drew up and enforced the legislation, regulations and schemes with which they had to comply and cooperate. Officials were brought face to face with some of the people who had to live with the consequences of the regulations and schemes they devised.  Plain, and sometimes strong, speaking was the order of the day.</P>
    <P>Officials learned at first hand of the constraints and problems faced by small business&mdash;constraints and problems that are often less visible or compelling when viewed from the vantage point of a Government Department.  Business people learned of the complexities that <Col N="491" /> officials have to take into account, complexities that are often less visible or compelling when viewed from the vantage point of someone running a small business.</P>
    <P>For the first time, however, the report of the task force gives estimates of such vital indices as the number of businesses in Ireland, the level of start-ups and closures and the proportion of small businesses that go on to become medium-sized or large enterprises.  The estimates for this country are compared extensively throughout the report with figures for both other member states of the European Union, the United States and Japan.</P>
    <P>As Professor Lee pointed out in the debate on the task force report in Seanad Éireann, had we proposed measures on small business a couple of years ago based on assumptions and statistics that have now been shown to be incorrect or suspect, a great deal of effort and resources might have been expended on ill-informed and mis-directed policies.  The resources available to us to help small business are obviously finite.  It is essential that they are applied in an informed and targeted way.</P>
    <P>On the basis of its analyses, the task force concluded that there was considerable scope for small businesses to make a greater contribution to the economy and to employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At present, this country falls between two stools in comparative terms.  We enjoy neither the benefits of the above-average contribution made by large enterprises to employment in the economies of northern Europe nor the above-average contributions made by small enterprises in the economies of southern Europe.</P>
    <P>The critical importance of small business for job creation has been underlined by figures contained in the recently published second annual report of the European Network for SME research.  This found that between 1988 and 1993 SMEs in the European Union generated a net employment increase of 2.6 million jobs. Large firms by contrast although creating <Col N="492" /> a million net new jobs between 1991 actually shed them again in 1992 and 1993.  The most striking finding of all was that the best employment performance was registered by micro-businesses with fewer than ten employees. These showed an annual employment growth of more than 1.5 per cent over the period from 1988 to 1993.  This compares to a growth of under 0.5 per cent per year in enterprises with between ten and 100 employees and a static or declining employment performance in medium-sized and large businesses.</P>
    <P>On the report, there is no better way to get this debate under way and to impress on this House the importance of the issues which this report has highlighted, than to quote the first sentence which is: &ldquo;The moment has come to give small business a central place in the making of public policy in Ireland so that the sector can realise its full potential for contributing to economic development and job creation&rdquo;.  This is what we are seeking to achieve.</P>
    <P>The task force report is a benchmark in that for the first time we have sought to get a &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for what constitutes the small business sector.  In so doing we have established that companies coming within the defination of small businesses &mdash; £3 million turnover and under 50 employees &mdash; are, in fact, the embodiment of enterprise and represent the greatest potential for job growth.  Added encouragement to the potential for employment generation is the fact that 80 per cent of small businesses are engaged in the provision of services which the ESRI mid-term review identified as being the sector with the greatest employment growth potential to the end of the millennium.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the task force was to redress the anti-small business climate that we, by default, have constructed. We need to allow small companies to grow and prosper with resultant employment consequences.  We need to capitalise on the drive and determination of entrepreneurs and to grow more small companies into medium-sized companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Underlying all of that is the admission that we, in Ireland, have never developed and implemented consistent policies supportive of small business.  This is now being addressed as a priority with the report of the task force acting as the agenda for action.</P>
    <P>The Small Business Division in my Department, which I recently set up, will be the driving force behind the preparation of proposals to be put before me, before the Government and before this House.  The division, like the task force, will conduct its affairs in a systematic and reasoned fashion and I look forward to introducing a small companies Bill in the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
    <P>The dynamism of the small business sector must also be reflected in the agenda for action and lines of communication are being kept open to a range of interests and practitioners who will participate in a small business forum. This House should also have a role to play in the process.  The report proposes the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee to &ldquo;small-business proof&rdquo; legislation so as to ensure the legislative burden, once reduced, is not subsequently reimposed.  The committee would also bring more transparency into the system as all the issues hindering the growth of small business could be discussed openly and in detail.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally we must think small. Our competitor economies have consistently prioritised small business development with resultant success.  The case for so doing here is all the more compelling especially as our emphasis must, of necessity, be on small business due to the structure of our economy. We must develop consistent policies.  We have never sought to differentiate between enterprises by way of size but merely differentiated between services and manufacturing.  This must change and with the concentration of policy development for small business and services within a single division in my Department, it will change.  This division will champion the cause of small business and report annually to this House on the state of small business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I wish to record the nation's indebtedness to my fellow task force members and our technical support team who, in delivering this report in such a short time, produced a well argued, concise and indepth look at the state of small business in Ireland.  The report is brimming with almost 100 recommendations some of which are already being implemented while others are being given serious consideration. Action has been a keynote in so far as this task force is concerned and it is my intention that action remains the keynote.  What drives this imperative for action is the realisation that 75 per cent of all new jobs in the EU arise in the small business sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the main thrust of the report's recommendations before the House so that Deputies may have an opportunity to respond.  The problem of raising money is a key concern and I make no apologies for having brought this issue to the fore.  The task force report set the agenda for the debate on this issue, a debate of such importance in which, while only getting underway, both I and my colleagues in Government will be participating closely.</P>
    <P>The task force found that personal savings are the main source of finance for new enterprises and retained profits are a key source of finance for expansion. High personal taxation constrains the ability to save, while low profitability in Irish companies constrains the ability to reinvest.  Though there is no indication of an overall shortage of finance in Ireland, the majority of available funds is channelled towards a limited range of relatively low risk projects.  However, there has been an encouraging increase in the number of funding sources for small business.  There should be a shift away from grants towards loan support as the main form of State aid to small business. There is, perhaps, too a sharp dividing line between enterprises that are eligible for State financial support and others. Eligible firms qualify for the full range of State supports.  Ineligible ones qualify for little or nothing.  A threefold categorisation of eligibility for State supports should be introduced &mdash; noneligible, <Col N="495" /> partially eligible and fully eligible. More service activities should qualify for at least partial eligibility.</P>
    <P>Recommendations in this area include the repeal of section 115 of the Finance Act, 1986.  This section gives the Revenue Commissioners priority of payment over all other creditors.  Banks state that should this section be repealed they would be in a position to increase their lending to small business.  The county enterprise boards were established to stimulate and support enterprise in their local areas, particularly small start-up businesses.  It is recommended that the original allocation for 1994 be reinstated. Greater representation on the boards and evaluation committees of persons with practical business experience should be considered.  The development of more initiatives like First Step and the Enterprise Trust should be encouraged.  These entities provide seed-capital on a commercial basis, but without an emphasis on high rates of return.  A register of investors should be developed which would bring together potential investors and investees.  The huge differential between AAA &mdash; big business &mdash; and AA &mdash; small business &mdash; interest rates requires examination.  At 4 per cent at present, this is a major source of concern. This whole area of differentials plus the bank margins is at present under examination. Banks should introduce a code of practice governing relations with their customers similar to one in operation by the banking institutions in the UK.  Banks should also set up fora for their small business customers which would enable senior bank personnel to meet representative groups of these customers from time to time to discuss matters of mutual concern.  Banks should be encouraged to commit substantial additional resources to lower interest rate schemes. The ICC scheme was a first step in this direction.  They should also be encouraged to remove the family home from the collateral required of small business customers.</P>
    <P>Rewarding risk was a clear message <Col N="496" /> from the task force where the stated preference was for lower taxation rather than increased grants &mdash; entirely consistent with the underlying principle of getting the climate right rather than creating an artificial environment.  Many detailed proposals have already been acted upon in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The task force feels there is a need to shift the balance between risk and reward for small business.  The tax system is the main tool available to the Government to do this.  A number of the taxation proposals in the task force's pre-budget submission were accepted.  For example, the £800 PAYE allowance is to be extended to the children of proprietary directors and the self-employed working full time in the family business.  Wide ranging changes are recommended in the areas of income tax, corporation tax, capital taxation, value-added tax and commercial rates.  Among them are: the development of a scheme whereby employers would be given personal tax credits for additional jobs created by them; the reintroduction of a scheme of dividend relief for small manufacturing and international service companies and the introduction of a small service companies rate of corporation tax of 25 per cent on profits of up to £80,000 for companies with a turnover below £3 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Cash flow is the life blood of all business and the State, as the major purchaser of goods and services from small businesses, has a critical role to play in ensuring that it pays its bills on time.  It is self-defeating for the State, through its development agencies, to assist small business on the one hand while at the same time hindering it through late payments from the State.  Late payment is a serious problem for Irish small business. It causes cash-flow problems, results in additional borrowing and involves a large proportion of scarce management time. Consideration is being given to the introduction of legislation to require public sector bodies to settle their accounts by the end of the month following issue of an invoice.  Should they fail to do so, interest would be payable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The cost of complying with the State's regulatory and administrative requirements is higher for small businesses than for large ones.  The task force felt that the most appropriate methods of reducing the administrative burden on small business would be to introduce new size thresholds or increase existing ones in order to exempt many small enterprises from regulations or requirements, to reduce the frequency of reporting requirements so that a form once required on a monthly basis might be made a bi-monthly, quarterly, bi-annual or annual requirement, to consolidate forms so that, for example, two, three or even more related forms would be redrafted and merged into one and to introduce shorter, simpler versions of forms for small business.</P>
    <P>The task force also recommends that the requirement for a statutory audit should be abolished for companies with a turnover below £100,000 and new small business should be able to avail of a simple, inexpensive procedure for registering as companies during the first two years of their existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from finance, the task force recommended that small business should receive assistance with business information, management skills and access to markets.</P>
    <P>A new business information system should be established to provide basic information and advice on State supports and programmes, official regulations and requirements and funding.  FÁS should take a number of initiatives designed to make training and development programmes more relevant and accessible to the owner managers of small business. Each company negotiating State support should have a single contact point for its dealings with State agencies as a whole. Expansion of market opportunities on the home market should be a critical priority for small business.  In particular, linkage and sub-supply to overseas plants operating in Ireland, public procurement and purchases of goods by private consumers should be addressed.  It recommended that a new, integrated market development programme is needed, to <Col N="498" /> be headed by a results driven company bringing together the resources of both Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála.  The Mentor Programme should be extended. A condition of receiving financial support from the county enterprise boards should be that a mentor is allocated.</P>
    <P>Action by the task force has already resulted in some key decisions by State agencies and we negotiated with both Telecom Éireann and the ESB to drop the requirement for deposits and personal guarantees for start-ups.  I think both bodies for agreeing to my request. In addition, the NSAI agreed reduced rates for small business to achieve ISO 9000, and I also thank that body.</P>
    <P>Systems and structures need to be put in place throughout the policy-making process to ensure that the small business sector is considered in all future Government policy.  It must never again be overlooked as a very crucial sector of the economy, particularly in its potential to create employment.  As well as recommending that a small business division be established within my Department &mdash; now established &mdash; to promote and develop small business the task force recommended that a small business forum comprising small business practitioners should be established to advise Government; a joint Oireachtas committee should be established and Departments and agencies proposing legislative or other measures likely to have a significant effect on small business should be required to undertake a systematic analysis of their impact on small firms before the measures proceed to final consideration and decision.</P>
    <P>In the past, Government may have paid insufficient attention to the specific needs and circumstances of small business, but this is no longer the case.  The establishment of the task force last June was a turning point in this respect.  A number of the recommendations made by the task force in its pre-budget submission have been incorporated in whole or in part in the budget and given effect in the Finance Bill, offering practical testimony of the Government's commitment. I thank the Minister for Finance <Col N="499" /> for readily agreeing to these proposals. They are: interest subsidy of 3 per cent on the ICC small business expansion loan scheme of £100 million, an interest rate of under 7 per cent and loan duration of ten years &mdash; that is now in place; £100 million payment to health boards will help speed up payment to suppliers, thus improving the cash flow position of small firms; £800 PAYE allowance to which I have already referred; employer PRSI contributions reduced from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent on incomes up to £9,000 per annum; VAT thresholds increased from £15,000 to £20,000 for service business and £32,000 to £40,000 for business supplying goods, thus taking a sizeable number of small business out of the VAT net; small business with a turnover of up to £250,000 per annum given the option of acounting for VAT on a cash receipts basis, with consequential benefits for cash flow; rate of capital gains tax reduced from 40 per cent to 27 per cent on the disposal of shares held for at least five years in unquoted Irish companies with a market value below £25 million; new capital acquisitions tax relief involving a reduction in the market value of business assets for the purposes of the tax, making it easier for family businesses to be passed on; single tax registration form for all new business; single tax clearance certificate for all public bodies and ceiling for BES relief for investments by proprietors in own companies to be raised from £150,000 to £250,000.</P>
    <P>The ICC small business expansion loan scheme originated, as I said, as a Government response in the budget to the task force pre-budget submission.  The emphasis of the scheme is on stimulating investment and creating-maintaining jobs in small businesses.  The rationale behind the eligibility criteria relates to the need to maximise the impact of the limited funds available under the scheme. In this context, while there is only £100 million available for this scheme, at the end of April there were some 1,200 inquiries-applications for amounts totalling £210 million and these two figures <Col N="500" /> are still growing.  Clearly the demand is there.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report dialogue has got underway with the banking community on the question of the provision of finance for indigenous industry and in particular for small and medium sized enterprises.  This is a direct follow-on to the task force report wherein the availability of long term finance was seen as a key factor to survival and sustained growth.  The task force was of the view that the availability of fixed rate long term finance would put small business in a position to consolidate and grow on the basis of predictability and certainty.  The ICC scheme, to which I have already referred, is a valuable pilot as the scheme shows that the demand is there and it will encourage, I hope, the development of further products on the part of other leaders.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, the task force directs a range of recommendations at the banks and my Department in seeking to give effect to the recommendations is entering into a series of contacts which will be ongoing, regular and task oriented. Such a dialogue will, of course, be a two-way process with the objective of ensuring a responsive financial regime.</P>
    <P>Having given an overview of the report, I shall now give other Deputies an opportunity to contribute.  In conclusion, I beg the indulgence of Deputies Richard Bruton, Harney and De Rossa as I must leave for a period to attend the funeral Mass for a relative.  I regret this as I had intended to sit through the entire debate but, unfortunately, I must be present at the Mass.  I will get a full report of every point made by the three Deputies opposite in particular.  I apologise for any discourtesy, it is not intended, and I will return as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for listening to my statement on the task force report, about which I am extremely excited.  A number of the items are already in place and if we see through the agenda of over 80 recommendations, we will create a new climate for small business.</P>
    <Col N="501" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this report which addresses a critical issue in Ireland's future economic development.  I welcome the work put into the report by the Minister of State and his team in bringing it forward. However, there is an enormous bias against small business and not sufficient recognition of this area by the Government, in its actions as opposed to words. I will give examples.  On reading the latest IDA figures for grant allocations, the amount given to a foreign company is 66 per cent higher than that given to an Irish company.  The amount given to a large or medium company to create one job is double that given to a small company. We have built into our grant allocations system a huge bias against small business.</P>
      <P>Not only do these businesses create jobs with a much lower level of assistance from Government, if you examine their spending patterns, you will see that those companies purchase Irish materials and are high employment sectors.  They generally do this on very low profit margins, yet they are hit at every level.  They are given less State assistance to start up, they are affected by the bias in the tax system, particularly if they are in the service sector, and by having to comply with Government tax and other regulations.</P>
      <P>These problems are touched on in the report but there is no sense of urgency on the part of the Government in addressing them.  In the past few months a major report was published on the service sector and the need to change the tax and grant regime to promote it.  We now have this report on the small business sector but the Finance Act did not address the fundamental issues.  It skirted the edges of some of the issues but these were essentially trivial items compared to the major issues addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special loan scheme, introduced by the Government to deal with the fact that it had failed to do what had been set out in the Moriarty report, was ignored by the Minister in his statement.  That scheme excluded small to medium enterprise, set a minimum level of £50,000 which excluded many of the small businesses <Col N="502" /> we are trying to support and excluded the service sector which, as the Minister said, constituted 80 per cent of the small businesses from whom we are now supposedly removing the yoke. Other elements have been equally biased and unworkable.  The tax relief introduced in last year's budget, for example, was intended to give new entrepreneurs the opportunity to claim back their tax for the previous three years, thereby giving them a nest egg to start up their business. The latest information is that the number of people who successfully availed of that scheme to set up business was minimal.  It was not a question of people not coming forward; the Department of Finance had strangled the scheme with so many regulations it simply did not work.</P>
    <P>In the past number of weeks the Minister for Enterprise and Employment abolished the enterprise allowance scheme which was designed specifically to assist unemployed people to set up a small business.  Having completed a ten week course on how to set up a business, they could then set up their business and receive a supplement for the first year of operation.  Without any formal announcement the Government abolished the scheme saying the money had run out.  That is no way to treat the small business sector.  Many people had plans to the point where they were about to take advantage of that scheme, only to find that the shutters had been slammed on them.  If a multinational company or a large business had been involved, that would not have been the case.</P>
    <P>We must also examine our competition law.  The point of having good competition law is to remove barriers so that small businesses can be set up.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment made a commitment in the Moriarty report that by the end of 1993 it would bring forward a programme of proposals to relax controls and licences which restrict entry of suitably qualified people or firms into business.  That has not been done and no proposals have emerged.  The Minister occasionally appeals for better competition rules and a proper competition Act but nothing <Col N="503" /> happened.  We have the worst Competition Act in Europe, it contains no enforcement capacity for dealing with third party complaints about abuse of dominant position and there is no capacity for the Competition Authority to investigate cases where unfair barriers to entry are put up against small businesses trying to get off the ground.  There is a Competition Act but it is unworkable and the Government, despite commitments made in the Moriarty report over a year ago, has done nothing to address that.</P>
    <P>The issue of the banks and access to funds is important.  In the Moriarty report the Government stated it intended to promote new arrangements that would bring private equity into small business but it did not.  There has been some slight modification in the business expansion scheme but none of the new arrangements that were promised.</P>
    <P>The lack of seed capital is a huge problem in relation to small business and the banks must also bear some of the responsibility.  The report correctly points out there is a wide gap between the small and prime business rates but there is also a great deal of hypocrisy in the way the Government handled this issue.  It criticised the banks for excessive margins but what did the Government do about that?  It is now offering to take some of the risk from the banks thereby increasing their margins and shunting on to the taxpayer the risks involved in lending to small businesses.  The Government must make up its mind.  It cannot proclaim in banner headlines to the taxpayers that it will go after the banks while it is asking the taxpayers to shoulder the risk element in small business.  What will the return be for the taxpayers?  A three card trick is being played by the Government on this issue and it cannot be divorced from the fact that an election is in the offing.</P>
    <P>There was an opportunity in the Finance Bill to take effective action to promote small enterprise but the Government failed dismally in that regard.  Those who have special deposit <Col N="504" /> accounts pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent.  We expect the service sector, which accounts for 80 per cent of small business, to pay not only 40 per cent corporation profits tax but 21 per cent VAT on what they sell and 21 per cent PRSI when they employ people.  These burdens are killing the goose that has the potential to lay the golden egg.</P>
    <P>I recently spoke to a prominent restaurateur in the city who explained that out of every pound he takes 60p goes to the Government in taxation between PAYE, PRSI, VAT and company tax and 3p comes back to him to keep his business going.  How do we expect to have a thriving small business sector with that kind of tax regime?  We have serious biases against services and employment built into the tax system and these were not addressed.  The two reports provide the basis on which they could be addressed. Bringing in thresholds for company tax is long overdue.  Britain is the prime competitor for the small business sector in the Irish market.  There are substantial thresholds for British businesses before they pay any corporation tax and when they do it is at a low rate.  We have no thresholds and pay a 40 per cent rate.  A recommendation was made in the report but it was not addressed in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The report on the service sector shows where we stand on PRSI.  Even after the change made by the Government in bringing in a 9 per cent rate for the low waged, we pay twice the rate of PRSI at lower levels and, at higher levels, we pay 20 per cent more than our British competitors. Small businesses are put at a competitive disadvantage with their main rivals in Britain.  It is not accidental that we have heard recent reports of companies moving to Britain &mdash; it is largely tax induced.</P>
    <P>A strong recommendation was made on tax on employment in the EU White Paper.  Figures produced showed that by reducing tax on employment by 1 to 2 per cent of GDP we could reduce unemployment by 2 to 4 per cent.  These are clear signals from the EU that there is great capacity to create employment <Col N="505" /> through tax reform measures aimed at reducing taxation on employment.  Sadly, when I raised this with the Taoiseach he would not commit himself to going along with that proposal.  We hear Governments talking about reducing the burden on small businesses but their actions are hopelessly wanting.</P>
    <P>Under recent legislation traders are obliged to have tax clearance before they can continue to trade.  Their licence to trade will be withdrawn if they do not have tax clearance.  This development has not been seriously thought through from the small businesses point of view.  Are they to be told that if their tax is £1,000 in arrears they can no longer trade?  The Revenue Commissioners have been given enormous powers and rightly so to pursue those who do not honour their tax obligations but it is an unhealthy development to say that if one is a few hundred pounds in arrears on their tax payments they will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>The report shows that compliance costs are enormous and I was disappointed that a proper audit of those costs was not carried out.  The only figure given was for PAYE which shows that the cost of compliance is 4 per cent of their liability. That would work out at an additional 2 per cent employment tax for small companies on top of existing PRSI.  It is an additional burden they cannot afford.  It is worse with VAT.  By the sound of it, small businesses must use 5 to 10 per cent of their turnover to comply with Government regulations.  Perhaps a central bureau should be established which would cut the cost of compliance.</P>
    <P>As regards the success of small businesses in recent years the report is slightly misleading.  In October 1993 I asked the Minister the number of small business industrial start-ups in the past five years. The figures are grim and depressing. They have fallen by 50 per cent.  In 1988 there were 305 industrial start-ups but the figure had fallen to 168 in 1992.  There was a continuous uninterrupted slide during those years.  These were the years during which we had the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the National Development Plan.  The <Col N="506" /> Government never answered why those plans failed so dismally and we have only to look at the trade figures to see that they did do so.  According to their targets, the Irish percentage share of EC imports was to be doubled.  It was to go from 1.2 per cent of EC imports to 2.4 per cent but instead the Irish share fell over the years 1988 to 1992.  It was 1.41 per cent at the beginning and declined to 1.39 per cent.  The targets were hopelessly missed.</P>
    <P>There was also a target in relation to the value of sales from Irish owned small and medium enterprises.  They were to increase by £2 billion but they only increased by £600,000.  Not even one-third of the target was met.  Under the new national plan the same amount of money is to be given to trade and marketing and other schemes.  There is no reference to the fact that under the previous plan when it had hundreds of millions of pounds at its disposal the Government failed to achieve the targets it set.  Were small businesses consulted about why things went so wrong or what changes were needed?  It is clear they were not.  We must rethink our policy if we are to give small businesses a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Government policy on the service sector has gone seriously wrong and there is a hint that it recognises this area is not a pariah that should be ostracised, denied any grant or support and given the highest tax burden.  We must look again at this strategy.  During the lifetime of the last national development plan the service sector created four times as many jobs as the industrial sector.  The patterns of market services are very impressive when compared to those of manufacturing. For example, the wages in market services are double those in manufacturing &mdash; in other words, for every pound spent twice as many jobs are created in the service sector as in the manufacturing sector &mdash; and 80 per cent of inputs purchased by market services are scourced in Ireland compared to less than 50 per cent for industry.  The proportion of Irish sourced inputs purchased by foreign industry is much lower. Despite all the talk about linkages, we have not succeeded in building an effective <Col N="507" /> linkage policy for our small businesses. The progress made in increasing the amount of Irish materials purchased by foreign industries has been disappointingly slow, and I have figures to back this up.  We need to look again at the service sector.</P>
    <P>The task force referred to the introduction of a new tax regime for certain elements of the service sector and said that Forbairt, Bord Fáilte and other bodies would select the industries, services and companies which would qualify not only for grants but also for the low tax regime.  Such an approach is fraught with danger, and I question whether it is permissible under EU law to select certain people for preferential treatment. More importantly, it would be unhealthy if administrators in some bureaucracy could decide which companies should be the white horse gladiators and which companies should be left floundering around with all the heavy tax burdens.  I would much prefer the Fine Gael proposal under which the burden on the service sector would be reduced in broad sweeps across the board and not on the basis of an agency deciding who are the winners and who are the losers.  This is a dangerous approach and totally contrary to the recommendation in the Culliton report that we should reduce dependency. We need to make broad, sweeping changes which will reduce the tax burden on key areas of the service sector which clearly have the capacity to realise foreign earnings.  I do not need to go into these in detail as there is an unanswerable case in many areas of the service sector, including tourism, etc., for reducing the differential between the 40 per cent rate for services and the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing and for moving steadily towards a 25 per cent rate for key areas.</P>
    <P>While the decision to set up the county enterprise boards was welcome in that economic power should be devolved to counties and regions, the system designed by the Department is totally wrong &mdash; it is another grant giving, form filling body.  We are back to the old <Col N="508" /> dependency culture which Culliton said was not the future direction for business. Even though the decision-making has been moved from Merrion Street and Wilton House to local level, it is still the same concept of doling out grants to people who meet the requirements of regulations designed by the Department. As a community we have advanced beyond this approach.  We should be telling county enterprise boards that they will have access to funds to support any sensible development plans and they should encourage the investment of local money, sums between £1 and £50,000. Local people should have a share in these developments.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that representative boards of the nature we have designed are the right vehicle for creating enterprise in our communities.  It would be much better to let communities develop their concepts, identify their strengths and encourage the investment of much more loan and equity capital, the approach to enterprise which Culliton said we should foster.  We had a major opportunity to develop this approach under the county enterprise board network, but all we have done is decentralise a culture which will not really transform the performance of small Irish business. The concept of local economic decision-making is very important, but we are not fulfilling the potential in localities and regions by establishing an office which will dole out grants.  We need to move away rapidly from this approach.</P>
    <P>This report contains a very interesting menu of the changes needed to help small business.  The Government must set out a schedule for the implementation of these proposals.  The Moriarty report was welcome in that it secured a commitment from the Government that it would act on various recommendations in the Culliton report.  It set out a schedule for doing this but unfortunately the Government almost totally forgot it once the report was published.  The Government should set out a schedule for the repeal of section 115 of the Finance Act and reform of corporation tax and the system of PRSI for small business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> All the economic indicators suggest that we will have high growth.  However, the Government has totally overlooked the crucial warning in the ESRI report that under present policy long term unemployment will be higher at the end of five years of record economic prosperity than it was at the beginning.  If the Government lets slip through its fingers the opportunity to transform employment performance it will be a major blot on its record.  It must take advantage of low interest rates, EC transfers which, according to today's newspapers, may not survive, and high economic growth to do something worthwhile for small business and people who are unemployed. The Government will be harshly and rightly judged if by 1997 when it again is seeking votes from the public it has failed to take advantage of this opportunity.  Sadly, the indicators are that the Government is not going to reform policy in any radical way during its remaining years in office.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that we are discussing this report as it was my party and I in particular who raised with the Taoiseach the need for such a discussion. It is a pity that neither this House nor committees have an opportunity to discuss the findings of many of the worthwhile reports that are published.  I said recently that we suffer from paralysis of analysis &mdash; we have had so much analysis of the problems that sometimes we have been paralysed into inaction.  One of the key ways to ensure that the Government is forced to respond to the worthwhile work done by the ESRI, by a task force of this kind, is to force a debate in the House, when at least the Minister responsible and the Government in general will examine and consider the recommendations. The report of the Commission on Taxation, a blueprint for the reform of our taxation system, was never discussed in the Dáil or in a committee; it was never formally responded to by the Government.  When enormous amounts of public money, accompanied by the commitment and energy of so many people who have a lot to contribute <Col N="510" /> to the development of public policy, are put aside in that way it casts a poor reflection on legislators and the Oireachtas in general.</P>
      <P>Over the next few years £10 million will be spent on improving facilities in this House &mdash; which I support because they are needed.  Members who operate across the road know how difficult it is to function properly with very inadequate facilities.  However, the most important change we could make in the Oireachtas is in its procedures, the manner in which we conduct our business, making it more relevant.  One cannot get answers to very simple questions in this House.  Likewise no committee of this House acts as a watchdog, scrutinising legislation emanating from Europe and its implications for us and directives or statutory instruments are not discussed in advance.  Since this Dáil was elected there has never been a discussion, even within the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; which in theory has responsibility for monitoring developments at European level &mdash; of such matters, unlike Denmark where the implications of directives affecting them are discussed before votes are taken at the Council of Ministers.  In a small country like ours, with so many politicians, we should put them to work, and I include myself in that.  In so far as a debate is welcome on the Task Force on Small Business it is only the beginning of what needs to be debated throughout the Oireachtas, the various committees, the Dáil and at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two and a half years ago the Culliton report &mdash; established by my predecessor and the former Government to review industrial policy in Ireland &mdash; advanced many fine recommendations. First, it drew attention to the problems for industry and recommended what needed to be done.  One of the strongest recommendations was the need for less bureaucracy and streamlining of Government agencies, so that companies generally &mdash; and entrepreneurs in particular &mdash; would not be constantly dragged down by the plethora of State agencies with which they had to deal.  Instead of implementing the findings of the Culliton <Col N="511" /> report, instead of having fewer State agencies this Government has presided over more bureaucracy and red tape and put more obstacles in the way of business than was the case even before Culliton.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that one of the recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business was that every company should have a senior executive to deal solely with State bureaucracy?  Why would it have felt it necessary to deal with that aspect?  What is our level of bureaucracy? We have Forfás, Forbairt, Forbairt's regional boards and An Bord Tráchtála. We also have An Bord Bia &mdash; which did not even incorporate An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; FAS, the county enterprise boards, the Western Development Agency, the Industrial Credit Corporation and a plethora of other agencies. Recently I heard of a county enterprise board which had never created a job.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we are serious about helping business.  For example, 50 per cent of the jobs in our economy are in the multinational manufacturing sector. Despite being grant aided and the 10 per cent corporation profits tax applicable to them, those companies are mobile and do not necessarily have a strong commitment to Ireland.  With lower wages in Central and Eastern European countries and in the Far East, many of them could transfer their business overnight.  Real growth in this economy in terms of jobs will come from the small business sector and in this connection I agree with many of Deputy Richard Bruton's comments. Ninety per cent of companies here employ fewer than 50 people.  If we really want to provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to generate jobs, business people investing in business will do so. Therefore, all of the aid must go in that direction.</P>
    <P>While the promise by the Minister of State of the introduction of a new small companies Bill later this year is welcome he had very little to say about the climate for enterprise here.  For example, he took on board some of the recommendations about State companies paying on time and <Col N="512" /> so on, with which I agree, but much more needs to be done.  In particular, the attitude to business needs to change.  The Minister of State, when Minister for Education, made a worthwhile suggestion about the possibility of including enterprise in the schools curricula.  I agree, much of the debate on education at present centres on who controls the schools and who does the teaching.  The output of education and what is taught is much more important &mdash; devoting all our time to who does the teaching or controlling would be like Jack Charlton expending all his energy worrying about who will drive the bus to take the football team to the World Cup rather than on the strategy of the play.  Despite the high cost of our education system and its high quality &mdash; academically our students emerge with very high qualifications &mdash; we are not turning out students who are self-reliant, independent-minded or potential entrepreneurs because that culture does not exist at any level in society. The State is much too involved in the economy, and that percolates throughout our society.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business, which I welcome, one of the most fundamental things we need to do in our economy is, first, lessen the number of regulations and bureaucracy with which businesses must deal daily.  When dealing with the compliance costs of PAYE I note that the Task Force on Small Business said that, in the case of companies with 25 employees or fewer, the compliance costs comprised 4 per cent of PAYE liability, whereas in the case of companies with in excess of 400 employees, they comprised 1 per cent. They went on to say, that, in the case of VAT, the position would be even worse.</P>
    <P>Our tax system really hits people in small business very hard.  For example, there is a 20 per cent tax on work, an employer pays over 12 per cent in PRSI and an employee nearly 8 per cent, constituting a 20 per cent tax on every job.  I know some changes were effected recently in the case of those in receipt of a salary of less than £9,000 per annum, <Col N="513" /> but they were so minimal as not to warrant comment.  Indeed a person earning £9,100 is much worse off than someone on a much lower income.</P>
    <P>Unless we tackle the fundamental problems of our anti-work taxation system in so far as it applies to employers and employees, the tax on work, on the number of people employed, we will not generate jobs in our economy.  Donal de Butléir, the former Secretary of the Commission on Taxation said, in the course of an interview about which I read on Sunday last &mdash; which I mentioned in the course of the debate on the ESRI medium-term report &mdash; that if we took the growth figures forecast by the ESRI over the next few years they would generate, in 1994 price terms £950 million in additional revenue.  We could do a number of things with that.  No doubt we could spend it on many worthwhile services, we could control public spending, maintain it at present levels or use it to reduce the burden of taxation.  If we choose to do that we could either reduce tax on work by 25 per cent, that is the standard and higher rates, by a full 25 per cent, or reduce employers' and employees' PRSI by 40 per cent.  Choosing one of those options would do an awful lot more for employment and enterprise and the overall culture of business in our economy than incurring increased public spending.</P>
    <P>As the ESRI and many commentators said, indeed as I maintained, no doubt we could spend Structural Funds on what would be regarded in the short term as worthwhile projects; we could fritter the benefits of the £5.9 billion on worthwhile activities from the short term point of view, or apply it to deal with the structural problems in our economy, which might have less impact in the short term, but a more lasting impact in the medium and long term.  For example, the ESRI referred to the £700 million the Government intend investing in telecommunications from Structural Fund moneys.  Indeed it asked if it would not be better to tackle the fundamental problems confronting Telecom Éireann in that they owe £1 billion, need investment <Col N="514" /> and are grossly over-staffed.  Unless we deal with that fundamental problem now Telecom will make Aer Lingus appear very small in five or six years' time. Rather than deal with these problems, which are adding costs to industry every day, we delay the evil day and hope the problem will go away but it will not. Because Telecom were forced to compete in their foreign business with competition they had no alternative but to reduce their costs.  Instead of looking at the fundamental problem they simply switched those charges to the householder and to the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>Irish business has higher telecommunications charges, higher energy costs and higher postal charges because the State dominates these sectors.  The State is over-manned in many of these companies and expects industry generally, but small industry in particular, to carry the burden of these additional costs.  If we are to encourage the growth and development of our small business sector it has to compete in an ever-competitive world.  One of the opportunities of the Single Market is that it gives us a much bigger market from the business point of view.  We do not have a sustainable internal market in the Irish economy; we have merely 3.5 million people. We need that bigger market that can be so rewarding and can offer so many opportunities.  Our business people will only be able to compete in that market in respect of 70 per cent of our produce if they can keep their costs down.  They will not be able to do that if they have to pay the higher costs of many of the services supplied by the State.  I recommend that Irish business should not have to pay more for energy, telecommunications and postal costs than the average payable throughout the European Union.  That is not an impossible request.</P>
    <P>The tendering procedure is a cause of concern to many business people.  They feel strongly they do not have a fair chance of competing for State work. First, the tendering procedure either for local authority work, semi-State work or Government work is not an open, transparent procedure.  Tenders are not <Col N="515" /> opened in public, they are opened privately. Second, the lowest tender which is not always the best is generally accepted provided they can get a bond.  Many companies tender below cost in order to get the work and make special claims as they go along to make the contract profitable. That is common practice, particularly in the local government service.  I know many efficient privately-run companies who literally cut the tender to the bone and yet were way above the lowest tender awarded on the day.  They knew that that company could not do the work at that price, yet the contract was awarded and as the tender proceeded they made up 40 per cent additional costs.  That is unfair and it is current practice for many public tenders.  I want more transparency and openness and the average tender accepted rather than the lowest.  That is common practice in many EU countries.</P>
    <P>There is much sharp practice in the tendering procedure.  A company which recently owed the Revenue Commissioners £11 million had a C.2 certificate, yet a small bus operator in my constitutency who was running a bus to special schools and owed the Revenue Commissioners £4,000 which he could not pay, has been denied the opportunity of doing State work and no longer has a C.2 certificate.  It is grossly unfair that a small operator, an ordinary man who was made redundant a couple of years ago, put his redundancy money towards the purchase of a small minibus and took students to special schools, should be put out of business simply because he owed £4,000 and was an honest and compliant taxpayer.  He could not raise the money because he had remortgaged his house a few years ago to sustain his business, yet he can read in the newspapers that a large company which owed £11 million had its C.2 certificate and was capable of doing State work.  When he came to visit me he said, &ldquo;This country is not fair, they do not want people like me.  I do not have clout, I cannot get to the Taoiseach or to Ministers and have special concessions granted for my situation&rdquo;.  I feel strongly that many business people do not have <Col N="516" /> fair play and a fair chance to compete because the State is so dominant in this economy.</P>
    <P>I can give another example.  A company signed a contract in January with a private operator to do the freight for two years.  The State said it would buy certain products from the company over the next two years provided the company cancelled the contract with the private operator and gave the business to the State. The man in that business won his case in court and will be compensated for the cancellation of that contract.  That is not the point.  The State came in with all its might, all its purchasing power and all its clout, put that small operator aside and had a contract, signed in January, cancelled by a private sector company on the basis that the State would buy an enormous amount of products from them over the next two years.  I do not intend to name the company in question, although I intend to table questions about it as soon as the litigation is completed.</P>
    <P>Many State companies are engaging in unfair competition.  I take the view that they should not be involved in any of these sectors.  I see the role of the State as a last resort.  The State should provide the services which nobody else can provide but should not be involved in activities which can be provided by the private sector.  Many State companies involved in freight and activities of that nature use their enormous marketing budgets to put small companies out of business.  If one looks at the advertising campaigns of some of the State companies one wonders how any small operator could respond. One cannot run a commuter bus service in Dublin unless it is a State service.  No matter how good one is at transport you do not have the opportunity to provide that service because the State does not allow it.  Is that sensible in 1994?</P>
    <P>We need to ask ourselves a number of fundamental questions about the role of the State in the economy.  The State must be the servant of the people, not as their master.  It is there to serve us.  If it is not doing so we should be quick to disengage the State from many areas of activity where it is no longer necessary and is <Col N="517" /> adding costs through over-staffing and inefficiency.  People may smile when I say that but it is a fact.  Many local authorities who have contracted out the provision of services have found that the services can be provided to the householder more efficiently and rapidly and at a lesser cost. We need to examine all these areas if we want to create a dynamic economy where small business can flourish and generate the necessary jobs.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton who referred to the different tax rates which apply to the manufacturing sector and the service sector.  Many of the multinational manufacturing companies have come to Ireland mainly because of the tax regime, not necessarily because of the grant aid. The 10 per cent corporation profits tax is a major incentive to locate in Ireland.  It is interesting to note that the service area where the 10 per cent tax rate applies has been successful.  The International Financial Services Centre, which is subject to a 10 per cent corporation tax, is extremely successful.  Many of the software developments which have been subjected to a 10 per cent tax have been successful.  Where a low tax regime applies to corporation profits tax, companies will locate here.  It is an old fashioned concept to have such a difference between the corporation profits tax rates that apply to the manufacturing and the service sector.</P>
    <P>In the report the task force recommends that there should be a 25 per cent rate of corporation tax on profits of up to £80,000 and that it should be phased in over three years.  If such a rate was introduced on profits of up to £100,000 it would cost approximately £9.3 million in year one and £28 million when fully in force.  It is interesting to note that in the United Kingdom a rate of 25 per cent will apply from this year to small firms in the service sector on profits of up to £300,000 with marginal relief on profits of up to £1.5 million.  As our companies have to compete with these firms we need to reconsider the rate of corporation profits tax that applies to the service sector. A lower rate would encourage many new <Col N="518" /> service companies &mdash; like the many multinational manufacturing companies &mdash; to locate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not a great believer in the grant-aid philosophy but it is interesting to note the differences between Irish and foreign entrepreneurs for this purpose.  An Irish entrepreneur will have to provide more equity, pay back the money he receives from the IDA over a shorter period and is considered to be a second class citizen. According to a recent commentary, he will also receive up to £4,000 less per job than his foreign counterpart.  What is the reason for this?  We believe we need to do this as the multinationals have to be attracted while it is assumed the Irish person has no alternative but to locate here.  This is not fair.  This is not the kind of grant-aid philosophy which convinces people in business that they are wanted or appreciated.</P>
    <P>Patrick Campbell said recently that the Revenue authorities have more powers to deal with business people than the Garda Síochána has to deal with criminals and drug pushers.  He wondered whether business people are considered the real suspects in the Ireland of today. He stated:</P>
    <P>The Government is over managing the economy through the introduction of restrictive regulations.  This has undermined competitiveness and draconian measures have caused many ordinary business people to feel threatened and alarmed.  Today in Ireland the Revenue have more powers of entry and search than the gardaí have to fight criminals and drug dealers. Today in Ireland the self-employed taxpayer is the suspect.</P>
    <P>Many people in business believe that they are not being encouraged or rewarded. Labour law, and the manner in which pay bargaining is conducted, does not suit those involved in business.  During the currency crisis it was evident that smaller companies which where very exposed were not able to meet the commitments contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in terms of pay increases.  Shortly before the Government <Col N="519" /> decided to devalue our currency one firm agreed a 10 per cent decrease in salaries with its workforce in order to maintain jobs.</P>
    <P>Our system of central pay bargaining does not allow for the flexibility that is commonplace in any free market, such as the United States and Japan and many of the most successful economies in the world.  There is a 2 per cent level of unemployment in Japan and 6 per cent in America and they are worried.  In many parts of the world people work for much less than what some of our social welfare recipients receive.  Many Members would say that they are being discriminated against and exploited but I do not take that view.  Many people in those countries, in the Far East for example, would not give up their job or salary to become a social welfare recipient in Ireland as they have hope, dignity and self-esteem and an opportunity to participate.  They believe they have some worth and value and this is very important to every citizen. Many people here do not have this and do not believe they have a contribution to make.  What is the reason for this?  We say to them that because they cannot get a job at the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> level which the Government negotiated with the social partners &mdash; only the employers and the trade unions who represent the employed were represented; the unemployed were not at the table &mdash; they cannot be given a job as they might be exploited.</P>
    <P>We need to change the way we deal with pay and taxation policy.  In the past two budgets the Government increased spending by 17 per cent.  If this money had been used to fund tax reductions we would have done much more to generate employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations made in the report I wish to make the following recommendations which may help small business.  On the question of the corporation tax regime, I strongly believe we need to deal with the differentiation between the manufacturing and service sectors for this purpose.  We also need to develop a more neutral corporate <Col N="520" /> tax regime so that the combined corporate and personal tax on company dividends does not exceed the equivalent tax on income.  We need to do this urgently if we want people to invest in their company.</P>
    <P>We need to deal with the conflict between the county enterprise boards and the regional offices of Forbairt in promoting and monitoring indigenous company employment growth.  This is causing confusion for many people in business.  Business needs assistance in kind rather than in cash.  Many smaller companies need premises.  The IDA, for example, does not have any suitable premises for industry in the Dublin area. They need expertise in marketing, preparing business plans, language skills and quality consultancy services rather than grant aid.</P>
    <P>The payment of grant aid should be linked with the number of jobs created and not with capital invested.  The people involved in Government agencies responsible for job creation should receive a significant bonus linked to the realisation of job creation targets.  The conflict between the roles of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála in providing business support for indigenous industry remains unresolved and must be tackled as a matter of urgency.  In relation to the BES, the size of the fund should be linked to the number of jobs created within two years and retained for five years.</P>
    <P>The monopoly suppliers of infrastructural services, such as telecommunications and postal services, should provide their goods and services at a cost which is not above the average in other European Union countries. Enterprise units need to be developed, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The organisations which operate such units should obtain the same taxation benefits as those involved in initiatives such as Enterprise Trust and First Step.  On leases for industrial premises, there should be a five year opt out clause, particularly in designated areas where developers already have more than sufficient incentives.</P>
    <P>Our labour law acts as a major disincentive <Col N="521" /> for employers to increase employment.  They should be given special training and information on matters relating to labour law.  On the question of the burden of proof, the task force made certain recommendations and I support what it had to say in that regard.</P>
    <P>We should allow for greater flexibility and encourage new company development, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The high level of crime and the perception of certain areas make it more difficult to attract industry and for small business to operate.  Estate agencies, which have the power to acquire land, should be allowed to offer additional incentives to encourage enterprising people to locate in those aeras.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship schemes should be widened to provide training for production technicians and operators who are required by high-tech manufacturing and service industries.  If we implement the fine recommendations contained in the report of the task force &mdash; some of which I mentioned &mdash; we will do much to help small business but we need to adopt an attitude that respects those who take risks and invest in business rather than leaving their money in financial institutions which may often be more beneficial for many people.</P>
    <P>I did not deal with the banks but I support much of what has been said about them.  Our interest rates are higher than those in other European Union countries. The State must use its powers, through the Competition Authority and the Central Bank, to ensure there is no collusion between the big two in relation to the interest rates and the rates they apply to business people and ordinary consumers.</P>

      <P>The report of the Task Force on Small Business is an impressive and comprehensive treatment of a complex subject.  Traditionally, a low policy priority has been given to small business, although there has been a high level of verbal support for what is referred to as the &ldquo;small man&rdquo;, in other words, the small business.  Consequently, statistics on small enterprise are available <Col N="522" /> only on a limited and piecemeal basis. The report states that, &ldquo;it is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate policy for the small business sector in the absence of the proper data base on matters such as the number of small businesses, their sectoral distribution, their employment levels and their start-up and failure rates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The interest shown in small business at official level is comparatively recent.  In reviewing the position in other countries the report notes that policies for small business have been in existence for decades in other countries.  Since the beginning of the 1990s in the countries of the European Union only businesses with fewer than ten employees have proved capable of additional employment creation, the majority of which are in the building industry, trade and services.  It is those micro-enterprises which have registered the strongest growth in employment in the last four years and it is now estimated they account for approximately 27 million jobs.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, enterprises in which fewer than 10 persons are engaged comprise more than 90 per cent of the total number of businesses and enterprises with fewer than 50 persons comprise more than 98 per cent of the total.  The report highlights that contrary to popular belief there is no evidence to suggest that the level of new business start-ups here is markedly below that in other countries. If anything, it has been above the average for European Union states over the past decade.  However, the number of business closures has been high in the same period.  By 1992, 40 per cent of new grant-aided manufacturing and international service establishments set up in 1983 were still in existence.  It appears that the rate of business failure tends towards the higher end of the EU range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that, on a comparative basis, there is not an innate lack of enterprise among people here.  Many people are prepared to take risks but, as the report highlights, there is no room for complacency. While our performance is about average, our need for additional enterprise and increased employment is <Col N="523" /> well above average.  We badly need a higher rate of business success and a greater number of fast growth enterprises. The recommendations of the task force are grouped based on three main pillars, namely, raising money, rewarding risks and reducing burdens.  It is clear that much can be done in the area of public policy development and institutional reform which would do much to improve the environment for the small business sector.</P>
    <P>The recently published ESRI Medium Term Review 1994-2000 paints a bright prospect for our economy over the next few years.  There is potential for growth and job creation and, obviously, the small business sector could play a dynamic role in this process, but this potential must be turned into actuality.  In its concluding summary the ESRI warns that &ldquo;solutions will not be found if the economy is left on autopilot&rdquo;.  There is no evidence so far that the Government has either the imagination or vision to grasp the nettle of reform in this area, despite the excitement this morning of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, at the contents of the report.</P>
    <P>Four years ago the NESC in its report, A Strategy for the Nineties, concluded that while Ireland had put in place credible macroeconomic and incomes policies, this was not yet true for development policy to promote structural adjustment and enterprise.  Such a deficiency might have been made good by the rigorous implementation of the Culliton report, but it is now obvious that key elements of that report have been buried.  In his preface to the report, Culliton argued &ldquo;we need to foster a spirit of self-reliance and determination to take charge of our future&rdquo;.  Unemployment is the major social crisis of our times and it cannot be tackled by leaving the economy on autopilot.  Neither does the solution lie in the artificial creation of workfare schemes.  The fostering and development of enterprises which are likely to survive, prosper and create wealth and employment is essential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> The task force is correct in indicating that if it were ever realistic to depend exclusively on large firms for the amelioration of our unemployment problem, that is certainly no longer so.  The small business sector must get the recognition it deserves.  There is no such thing as a typical small business; they can be involved in manufacturing or in services, traded or non-traded.  They can be involved in low-tech manufacturing for small niche markets or high-tech industries using the latest methods of computer-aided design.  If small business is to flourish it needs the right infrastructure. At the developmental stage there is often a need for seed capital so the venture can be properly investigated and planned.  If more seed capital was available from a variety of sources it would do much to reduce the overall levels of business failure.</P>
    <P>The provision of start-up capital in sufficient amounts and at reasonable terms is vital for the small business sector.  The provision of long term loan finance at affordable rates needs to be greatly extended.  The task force believes that relations between the main banks and the small business sector need to be dramatically improved.  Instead of the somewhat adversarial relations that exist at present, banking and business should be brought together so they can develop a more fruitful partnership.  That could be done through the creation of local development forums.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the subject of taxation looms large in the report.  The task force believes there is an over-riding need to give greater recognition and reward under the tax system to those who take the risk and show the enterprise involved in setting up a new business or expanding an existing one.  It is acknowledged that most of those tax proposals would involve a cost to the Exchequer.  While I would not agree with all of the proposals, it is time to make some bold and radical moves on the taxation front.  The task force is correct in believing that the long term stimulus to the economy that properly targeted tax reform would provide would justify the short term costs.  It <Col N="525" /> is time the Government took risks to get greater rewards in terms of the number of people who could be back at work.</P>
    <P>What is poorly understood at Government level &mdash; or perhaps it is understood and ignored &mdash; is how the tax system functions as a system of incentives and disincentives.  It is vital that the incentive structure of taxation is geared towards the attainment of the needs of society and how effectively tax revenue is spent. Ireland has fallen down badly in terms of using the tax system as a way of encouraging certain types of activity while discouraging others.  Professor Kieran Kennedy of the ESRI cited previous research which identified a plethora of tax incentives to investment in housing, property and financial assets.  The difficulty is that those are essentially rent-seeking activities which encourage the redistribution of wealth rather than its creation.  Professor Kennedy believes that a decisive approach needs to be taken to reducing the range of tax and other incentives applying to that type of rent-seeking activities.</P>
    <P>We need to have a more dynamic vision of the role of the small business sector.  New information and computer-aided design technologies enable Irish enterprises to compete internationally and deliver a product that will be in demand.  It is now possible for small Irish firms located virtually anywhere in the country to link up with major companies abroad and carry out specific tasks.  With the development of information networks it is possible for people to remain in their communities and carry out high quality work.</P>
    <P>We hear much about the importance of competition for a flourishing market economy, but there must also be a recognition of the value of an enhanced form of co-operation which can exist alongside competition.  Small firms can and should be encouraged to pool resources to help each other where possible.  That type of approach has created flourishing regional economies, based on small scale enterprises, in the central regions of Italy. Those companies concentrate on their areas of excellence and by assisting companies <Col N="526" /> in related fields, which have other spheres of excellence, they produce products capable of competing in bigger markets.</P>
    <P>There is a strong argument that the small business sector needs a more powerful voice in Government.  A Minister of State for small business should be appointed.  The recommendation to establish users councils in the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the Companies Registration Office should be implemented.  It would provide a means of consultation on the regulatory and administrative requirements to be met by small firms.</P>
    <P>I had some experience in the small business sector.  Before I became a TD, I managed a small family firm and I was able to increase the number of jobs in it from six to 20.  People involved in small business know that one may work 18 to 20 hours a day, but that input will not have an appreciable effect on its profitability and success unless the work is structured and enhances the quality of the product and the capacity of the company to produce goods that can be sold. Given the current emphasis on the importance of small business, it is equally important to bear in mind that small businesses other than the one man or one woman business depend on their employees.  Without the goodwill of employees who are willing to work it is unlikely a business will succeed.  Too many owners of small businesses seem to view their employees as instruments to be used in pursuit of their goals.  They fail to recognise that if proper working conditions, including, wages and social protection are not provided they will not get the participation and co-operation from their employees needed to make the business a success.  That is as important as removing some of the restraints placed on businesses to ensure that small businesses are enabled to comply with environmental legislation and provide for their employees in terms of PRSI, redundancy, health and so on.  There is no value in creating a small business sector based on the exploitation of labour.  Such exploitation creates an underclass of low <Col N="527" /> paid who are not provided for in terms of health, safety at work, waste disposal etc.  Far too many small businesses consider the way to make a success of their business is to find ways to get around the laws protecting the community, environment and people who work for a living. It would be preferable if small companies were assisted to meet the necessary requirements in those areas rather than pursuing policies which encourage some companies to seek ways around the law and put others out of business.</P>
    <P>A number of areas need to be addressed in the small business sector. Credit is one of the main difficulties for small companies as they inevitably have a small capital base.  Regardless of the relationship between a small business person and his or her bank manager, borrowing money is expensive.  Some means of assisting small companies to overcome the gap between their small capital base and the credit they need would help ensure their survival.  That would help companies who have business deals with other companies which go bust.  An outstanding amount of £20,000 is merely a pinprick to companies like Superquinn or Quinnsworth, but it could cause a small company to go out of business. Steps should be taken to offer protection against such loss.  I accept it is not possible to provide total protection, but the implementation of imaginative initiatives to deal with the problem, such as tax write-offs and cheap insurance, should be considered.</P>
    <P>The development of one's business is another area of difficulty.  It may be difficult to gain access to research and time constraints may pose problems in investigating new developments.  State agencies and others insist on being paid for the services they provide for small businesses. It costs a company to have its product tested in the market.  If we are serious about enabling existing companies to expand we must find ways to facilitate them to do that without crippling them financially.</P>
    <P>In promoting small businesses we must create a new culture to encourage enterprise <Col N="528" /> and avoid putting obstacles in their way.  We must promote a new philosophy among those who seek to establish small businesses by assuring them they can make a success of their business without the need to exploit their employees. There is too much exploitation of employees.  There cannot be real co-operation between employees and new entrepreneurs if a good relationship does not exist between them and protection is not afforded to the employee, whose only benefit from the company is the wage he or she receives at the end of the week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this excellent and timely report.  The Minister and his team have comprehensively examined the problems facing small enterprises.  The early adoption of many of the task force's recommendations by Minister Ahern in his 1994 budget has been a source of great encouragement to everyone with an interest in the welfare of small businesses.  Overall management in this area is a clear reflection of the urgent priority being given by the Goverment to the need for indigenous business development.  Highly competent bodies are being established to analyse the situation and their considered opinions are subsequently being given prompt attention so that policy change is almost immediate.  It is vital that such development in the formulation and implementation of policy be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn to some aspects of the report which I find particularly interesting. The rate of start-up businesses here is equivalent to that of many of our European Union partners which illustrates that a large number of our people are willing to take the risk of setting up their own enterprise and that there is no shortage of creative thinking among the Irish population.  However, it is equally important to note two less encouraging aspects of small business.  There is evidence to suggest that over half of all newly established small businesses may fail or disappear over a ten year period. These statistics may be the result of formidable challenges facing any new enterprise in the current highly competitive <Col N="529" /> marketplace.  This should not, however, be simply accepted as a fact of life. Rather a far greater amount of research should be carried out into the reasons behind business failures.  Feedback on the reasons for failure can be as important as feedback on success as such feedback indicates the pitfalls to be avoided. I have no doubt that many researchers are currently working in this area, but there is a need for greater co-ordination of existing research.  Key findings from such research should be circulated directly or indirectly to those involved in the promotion of indigenous small industry. If we do not learn from our failures we are doomed to repeat them.</P>
    <P>Another key observation in the report is that only a small percentage of our small businesses develop into substantial enterprises in the medium to long term. If Irish owned industry is to develop into a serious force in the international marketplace, it is vital that we overcome this problem.  A breakthrough in this regard is certain to require substantial effort over a number of years.  However, it is possible to identify certain conditions which are likely to influence a company's potential for substantial growth.  The initial enterprise must be based on sound and realistic plans from the outset.  As the business grows it is vital that the owner make every effort to complement his or her own skills by employing people with specialist knowledge in areas such as planning, management, marketing and financial control.  Similarly it is vital that the developing enterprise critically assess both its overall strategy and its detailed operation on a regular basis.  Then, when an opportunity arises, consideration can be given to becoming involved in a favourable merger.  This is only likely to occur when the business owner maintains close contact with fellow entrepreneurs. Too often the small business owner becomes totally absorbed in his or her own enterprise and opportunities for expansion are either missed or ignored.</P>
    <P>Raising finance is, without doubt, a major problem for small buiness owners. A number of factors militate against the easy availability of venture or equity capital <Col N="530" /> funding for the unproven business. Personal savings are limited and conservatively invested.  Similarly indigenous industry works on a very small profit margin.  In this regard the gap between the 24 per cent profit earned by overseas companies and the estimated 4 per cent reported for Irish owned enterprises is worth noting.  Although practices such as transfer pricing probably exert a major influence on this difference, they also indicate a certain scope for more effective trading by our indigenous sector.  The ICC bank's £100 million small business expansion loan scheme is certain to make a major difference to a number of our companies as they strive to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>The low rate of take-up of tax refunds under the new enterprise scheme, with only six applications approved in the first six months, is worrying.  Comments in the report regarding excessive red tape should be noted and heeded across the range of official administrative services. It is important that the capital needs of the county enterprise boards be met to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>There are three basic requirements for the success of new job creation structures. The objectives must be clearly defined and realistic, the operational procedures to be adopted must be explicitly clear, and adequate funding must be available.  Limitations in any of these areas will only lead to futile recriminations later.  Private sector initiatives such as the First Step programme and the Enterprise Trust are to be welcomed. However, we have few genuine venture capital finance houses.  From time to time a promising venture capital facility is launched.  Frequently, however, one sees an increasing tendency towards more secure conservative investments once some early successes have been achieved and openness to the smaller riskier business sector disappears.  Our ongoing programme of tax reform may be able to make a positive contribution in this regard.</P>
    <P>The report explores other elements of fund raising which affect small businesses. I note in particular its support <Col N="531" /> for so called campus companies located within universities and other third level education institutions.  I strongly support the development of such enterprises since they have three particular contributions to make: they help establish a much needed bridge between the world of business and commerce and the third level education sector; they provide invaluable business experience to the participants in our leading educational institutions; and they have the potential to seed succesful and significant mainstream industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>I also strongly support the idea of encouraging individuals to purchase equity in our smaller indigenous companies. The more resources invested in our energetic entrepreneurs the more likely we are to create a substantial number of secure new jobs for our young population.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that there is significant room for improvement in the level of support to new business by the banking sector.  For too long much of the risk-taking has been outside this country while most of the profits have been earned on the domestic market.  This is not acceptable and should not continue. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that there has been an increased willingness on the part of the banks to provide a certain level of unsecured lending on the home market. If this trend continues and keener interest rates are made available to the most vulnerable businesses, the banks will regain their rightful position as a key element in the development of our national economy. The responsible behaviour of many banks during the currency problems last year must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that emphasis be placed on identifying the common interests of the banking and small business sectors. We can then develop legislation and guidelines which will help exploit in a positive manner such common interests. It may be possible to structure taxes or levies on banks in such a manner as to encourage a greater degree of participation by these institutions in the <Col N="532" /> funding of small ventures.  Similarly our corporate laws should minimise the scope for individuals to walk away from substantial bank debt accumulated through abuses of limited companies.  Such practices ultimately penalise the upright, hard working small business owner since the banks, both at central and local policy levels, inevitably respond to such bad experiences by adopting more conservative lending policies.</P>
    <P>I agree in principle with the report's observation that the tax system should reward the risk-taker.  The report acknowledges that many of its recommendations will involve increased State expenditure.  Nevertheless it anticipates that such money should be recovered to a certain degree as a result of increased revenue from expanding and healthier companies.  It also accepts the need to phase in certain proposals over a reasonable period of time in order to avoid the requirement for a major once-off State investment.</P>
    <P>The authors make a strong case for improving certain aspects of PAYE regulations for those involved in small privately owned businesses.  The recommendation to further expand the PAYE concession to directors and participating spouses deserves consideration. Similarly the anomaly regarding PRSI payments also seems worth reconsidering.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the recommended tax credit in the area of job creation.  There is the danger that the introduction of a range of competing incentives might result in confusion for the potential creator of jobs.  It is probably desirable that the support made available to such people is channelled through a modest number of pathways which allow for a high degree of control and audit.  A diverse range of incentives and grants to small businesses may be neither in the interest of such enterprises nor of the State.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations on reintroducing the scheme of dividend relief and reducing small service companies' rate of corporation tax also have merit since their implementation would <Col N="533" /> increase such companies' ability to retain profits to a far greater degree than is currently the case.</P>
    <P>While the report does acknowledge the substantial improvement in capital gains tax introduced by the Minister, Deputy Ahern, in the 1994 budget, it recommends further concessions in this regard along with major changes in the capital acquisitions tax for family owned businesses. These extra demands may be excessive.  They tend to ignore to a certain degree the fact that successful small businesses must make a fair contribution to the funding of State services, as does the individual PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>In our anxiety to provide maximum incentives to a very promising sector in our economy, we cannot totally ignore the rights and needs of the rest of society. However, there is merit in the report's proposals on the timing of VAT payments, instalment payment of tax for the self-employed and some reform in the operation of withholding and relevant contracts taxes.</P>
    <P>On face value there seems to be grounds to support the abolition of the surcharge on undistributed income. Small businesses cannot expand without building some cash reserves.  While I have some reservations on the linking of commerical rate changes with the consumer price index without taking into account possible improvements in services, the proposed two year exemption for start-up companies is a small but practical way to encourage such enterprises at a time of maximum scarcity of resources in their life cycle.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that delayed payments is one of the most serious problems faced by the small business owner. The rarely diagnosed but frequently experienced cheque in the post syndrome has resulted in many beds being filled in coronary care units throughout the country.  It is fair to expect State and semi-State organisations to give a lead in this regard.  It must be accepted that the importance of this problem has been increasingly recognised in recent times. Major improvements will be difficult to achieve without a major corresponding <Col N="534" /> effort on the part of the private sector. However, there will always be conflicting needs between receiving timely payments and maintaining a customer's trade. Small business owners can contribute to an overall improvement in this regard by developing more effective credit procedures internally while making every effort to treat their own creditors fairly. Timely payment is above all a two-way process.</P>
    <P>Under its recommendations entitled &ldquo;Reducing Burdens&rdquo;, the task force has come up with a number of sensible proposals, some of which have been adopted by the Minister.  Useful proposals include the raising of the VAT threshold to £40,000 for both goods and services, less frequent VAT and PAYE/PRSI payments, minimal tax account requirements for very small businesses and removing the needs of a compulsory audit in very small firms.  Some of these suggestions should benefit the small business owner and the State.  I welcome in particular the proposal regarding tax accounts for very small businesses since the current situation does not seem to be cost beneficial to either party.  The proposals to rationalise and simplify tax forms also seem sensible.</P>
    <P>I would have strong reservations about any adjustments in labour legislation which would reduce the level of protection given to part-time workers.  In particular the recommendations that only those working 18 hours or more per week should receive full protection does not seem equitable.  One must keep in mind that 18-22 hours can constitute a full working week for those involved in some professions.  Why should someone working such hours in an unskilled or semiskilled job not receive camparable protection?</P>
    <P>There are a number of other excellent proposals in this report which I welcome &mdash; the provision of a comprehensive business information system is an excellent and promising suggestion.  In general I warmly welcome this excellent report.  I commend the Minister and his team on their major contribution to the future wellbeing of small industry.  The receptive <Col N="535" /> response of the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Ahern, must be acknowledged.  I hope that every person directly or indirectly involved in the development of our small business sector reads this report and finds substantial encouragement in its recommendations. On a practical level, each of us can contribute as consumers by making every effort to support our vital indigenous business sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are three Ministers in the Department of Enterprise and Employment I am surprised none of them is here for this debate.  That is symptomatic of what is wrong at the heart of Government.  For years I favoured the idea of a Department of Employment, yet the biggest disappointment since this Government was formed is the Department of Enterprise and Employment and, not surprisingly, unemployment remains at an extraordinary high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bureaucracy and lethargy which I have experienced with the Department is appalling.  I have had communication in the past year or so from three or four small business people in my constituency who were less than pleased with their reception by the Department.  On one occasion when I telephoned the Department it took seven minutes to get a reply. Meanwhile my secretary telephoned the Department on the GTN service.  Both calls were answered at the same time and we both asked for the Assistant Secretary in charge of job creation.  I was put through to the Office of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, and my secretary was put through to another office, neither of which was responsible for job creation.  In fact, there was nobody in the Department of Enterprise and Employment responsible for job creation.  There is no senior person to whom a public representative or, more importantly, an entrepreneur can go to discuss the various problems that must be overcome before a business can be set up and jobs created.  There is no one-stop shop.  In <Col N="536" /> fact, the bureaucracy is now worse because the Department is too large.</P>
    <P>A Department of Employment should have a one-stop shop where those interested in creating or maintaining jobs can have all their concerns dealt with in one office.  I had hoped the Department of Enterprise and Employment would ensure that all the disincentives and barriers to employment would be removed. For years I have asked questions in this House of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Labour but there was no Minister to whom I could put questions concerning the distortions in the labour market arising from the totality of Government policies. Questions were ruled out of order or parts of questions were transferred to various Ministers.  That highlighted the confusion in Government policy and the fact that it was, unknowingly, creating unemployment because of conflicts in its policy.  I hoped the solution to those problems would be the creation of a Department of Employment but I was wrong and I am bitterly disappointed.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 we have had sustained, favourable economic indicators, low inflation, low interest rates, a balance of trade surplus, a balance of payments surplus and general economic growth, but we continue to have 300,000 people unemployed.  No one in Government seems to realise the effect of overall Government policy.  A person with more than two children earning the average industrial wage is worse off than they would be on the dole.  How does that happen?  It happens because of a series of unconnected Government policies. Employers here have a mark-up of approximately 35 per cent over gross pay to cover, for example, public liability insurance, sick pay, holiday pay, the supply of protective clothing, canteen costs, maternity pay and, of course, the 12.5 per cent employers' PRSI.  I understand that Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Office, and our Central Statistics Office accept that the mark-up in Ireland is approximately 35 per cent above gross pay.  It costs an employer <Col N="537" /> £378 to pay an employee £280 a week gross.  For the employee, however, that £280 quickly melts away because of excessive income tax, 7.5 per cent PRSI and pension contributions.  Also, there is no tax allowance for a child dependant and employees must also pay for transport to work, etc.  An employee earning an average industrial wage of £280 gross has less than £180 a week net.</P>
    <P>The problem for the employee is that on an income of £180 he may have a few pounds more than he would have on the dole, but he loses his medical card, higher education grants, civil legal aid, etc. because all means testing is based on one's gross income, not take home pay. These distortions make it impossible to create jobs because employers cannot afford to offer the salary that would entice a person to take up that job.  No man or woman who is already badly off on the dole can be expected to take up employment if they are going to be worse off as a result but that is what we are asking of them.  I have referred only to the average industrial wage but we all know that tens of thousands of jobs pay much less than the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>Virtually no progress has been made in this respect over the past number of years.  Last year, the first Fianna Fáil/Labour budget imposed a 1 per cent levy on income which worsened the poverty trap.  The whole economy is caught in that poverty trap and in addition, throughout the European Union, there are extraordinary rigidities in the labour market compared to, say, the United States.  We have the highest unemployment level in the European Union. Spain is catching up on us but it does not have distortions to the same extent that we have, for example, in regard to people over 55 years of age, those on FÁS schemes, etc.</P>
    <P>The reality is that our unemployment level is close to 20 per cent; the average for the European Union is 12 per cent; the figure in the United States is 6 per cent.  The EU average, therefore, is twice that of the United States and the Irish average is more than three times that of <Col N="538" /> the United States, despite the fact that EU countries in general, and Ireland in particular, have better underlying economic indicators than the United States, they have better trade figures, better interest rates and lower inflation.  It is obvious that we have a problem here.  If that problem is not addressed, sustained economic growth will not be followed as it used to be, by sustained growth in employment because Government policies will have taxed jobs out of existence.</P>
    <P>The Government does not seem to understand how its policies are affecting the labour market, yet this is the biggest issue facing the country.  Apart from Northern Ireland, no other issue is more serious.  Unemployment is causing misery in many homes, young people are forced to emigrate and those who stay at home have no hope in the future.  Fathers and mothers long term unemployed feel they have no stake in society, they have no hope and nothing to get up for each morning.</P>
    <P>Why has the Government no sense of urgency to change these obvious impediments? Why was a Department of Enterprise and Employment established if, after 18 months, there is negligible improvement in the unemployment figures? Every day we are told the economy is booming but 300,000 families are not enjoying the benefits of that boom.  They feel completely excluded from its benefits and are oblivious to any sense of improvement or well being.  The Government has failed these people.</P>
    <P>I have been a colleague of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, in politics in this city for the past 20 years.  As far as I am concerned, he is the biggest disappointment of this Government because he is stifling enterprise. The Casual Trading Bill, for example, which is currently before this House, is an attack on the very people who, rather than rely on social welfare, have tried to create jobs for themselves.  The poor women in Moore Street, Thomas Street, Meath Street, Camden Street and Henry Street go out in rain, hail and sunshine to earn a wage and provide a reasonable <Col N="539" /> standard of living for their children but they are being clobbered by the proposals in the Casual Trading Bill.  That Bill is symptomatic of the endemic anti-enterprise culture which is the hallmark of the Labour Party.  It is destroying any hope of job creation.  In Dublin city, which the Minister, Deputy Quinn and I have the honour to serve, the industrial base has been reduced by 24 per cent and it is meaningless to talk about services unless there is an industrial base to serve.  We must restore such a base to the city where the most profound social problems exist.</P>
    <P>We need to do a number of things to alter the climate.  There should be a dramatic reduction in income tax and this calls for much more progress to be made than the minor steps taken in the budget. Most of the changes were to cancel the 1 per cent levy brought in last year, but I favour a significant carbon or energy tax, the proceeds of which could be used to dramatically reduce income tax.  It would also help the environment and employment.</P>
    <P>It is not sensible to have a 20 per cent PRSI levy when 20 per cent of the population are unemployed and 12 per cent of those in the EU are unemployed.  There are many young children in the Gallery and I hope this debate and my contribution will lead to changes which will improve their job prospects in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>We should move from a payroll base for PRSI.  CIE employs 13,000 people and pays £35 million in PRSI.  Another company with a bigger turnover employes 120 people put pays £333,000 in PRSI.  Capital intensive industries remain under-taxed while labour intensive industries are over-taxed.  I understand that if we try to change it, capital intensive industries will move to other countries. However, we should seek a co-ordinated change at EU level and if I am elected to the EU Parliament I will continue to press for that.</P>
    <P>The third change in Government <Col N="540" /> policy relates to the assessment of means, which should be disposable income, not gross pay.  Such a policy change was made in the UK in 1984 and when one applies for a State grant or benefit take home pay is assessed.  Many of those earning an average industrial wage here fail to get a medical card because their gross pay is £20 over the limit while their take home pay is £20 or £30 under it.  The same applies to higher education grants. Such a policy change ought to be made in the interests of social justice and removing one major contributor to the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>A person drawing the dole receives between £10 and £14 per week per child but in the case of those who work there is no tax allowance for dependent children which creates another distortion and poverty trap.  A person with more than two children will be worse off working for the average industrial wage or less compared with those on the dole.  For three children you receive £42 and £56 for four children. Those who work do not receive anything for their children even though they may be paying fees for them at third level institutions.  A child tax free allowance for the employed must be considered.  I know it will be a costly exercise but some way must be found to fund it otherwise distortions of the labour market deriving from Government policy will continue and there will not be a pay-off in terms of jobs from sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>High income tax, a silly PRSI base, means testing of gross pay rather than take home pay and no child tax allowance, are distortions which have led to the success of a manager being gauged in terms of how he can reduce the work-force. Every senior manager I know whether in CIE, Bord Telecom, Guinness, Gouldings, Jacobs or Aer Lingus is in the buiness of shedding labour rapidly. Why?  It is as a result of Government policy.  We need to change those policies dramatically.  I would consider having an Irish peerage to honour those who create jobs.  No recognition is given to them, on the contrary we impede their efforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I welcome the debate and the report. I have been in the House for over 20 years and I have seen many such reports. Unemployment has increased and successive budgets have made the position worse.  This is not done deliberately &mdash; but Governments fail to comprehend the effects of their policy.  There is no overview of the effect of Government policy and that was my hope for the Department of Enterprise and Employment. However, it is disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1960s and 1970s multinational companies were given grants irrespective of the purpose for which they were required.  As we found out later, many of these grants were invested in the development of technology which was used to replace workers.  It was some time before it was recognised that there had to be a change in policy so as to assist job creation in industry.  The report of the task force refers to the need to focus on projects which were ignored in the past because it was thought they could not create jobs. It is acknowledged that the small business sector is more likely than large multinationals to create the greatest number of jobs.</P>
      <P>Multinational companies tend to have little regard for this country or their obligation to create jobs.  Those companies, and native industries, told successive Governments they would have to create the proper climate to boost employment. I remember being regularly told that if the Government acceded to the demands of industry there would be a significant increase in employment and improvements in the market place.  However, while the right climate has been created the unemployment rate has remained high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we understand the nature of business.  The first priority for any business is to make a profit.  One cannot rely on those in the market place to create jobs; they do not regard this as their role and we cannot expect them to do so.  Those who say that the elimination of restrictions and increased intervention <Col N="542" /> by the Government will boost job creation in industry should remember that the very opposite may be the case &mdash; most businesses will employ the least number of people possible to do the work.  They say they cannot make an adequate profit or hope to increase it to the level they expect if they do not operate in this way.  Today in many businesses one employee is doing the job previously done by many people.  They are trying to do what they can with no assistance and any assistance given is usually through the employment of part-time workers who can be dispensed with easily.  These factors must be taken into account in the debate on this report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the time the Labour Party, in Government with Fine Gael, advocated the establishment of the National Development Corporation, a proposal which led to great friction between the two parties.  The establishment of a power house for the creation of jobs was central to Labour Party policy, and many of our ideas are now contained in this report.  The Deputy said the Government was responsible for the decrease in employment in the Dublin area.  Our entry to the then EC led to the demise of many small Dublin businesses, some of which were involved in the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>When we voted to enter the then EC we knew we would be facing increased competition and that some native industries would be pushed aside.  A substantial number of people voted in favour of membership knowing that this would be the case and also in the belief that the opportunites available would more than outweigh the losses.  While they were correct to a certain extent, they did not realise the extent of the changes which were about to take place.  Even as far back as the middle ages Ireland was not able to support its population &mdash; since the 1800s we have exported more people than anything else.  We have never succeeded in devising a formula which would enable this country to support its population. This factor must be taken into <Col N="543" /> account in any debate about the inadequate level of development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace referred to the carrying out of surveys among small businesses. We do not have sufficient information to enable us to determine the problems and needs of small businesses. This sector would also be able to advise us on the stages which should be taken to assist many industries.  Deputy Harney said there should be a cut in State expenditure. During the debate on telephone charges she said that costs to ordinary consumers could be reduced by shedding 2,000 jobs in Telecom.  I could not agree with such a proposal.  Rather we must maintain and expand employment in both the semi-State and private sectors and, if possible, promote the expansion of Telecom into other projocts.  I am opposed to the Progressive Democrats proposal that there should be less State intervention and we should be left to the whims of market forces.  Intervention by the State is important from the point of view of job creation and in this respect the State can benefit from this report, particularly as regards intervention in the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The £100 million fund will go a long way in assisting the new enterprises we hope will be set up.  The special interest rates and tax refunds are very important for small business.  Recently the banks were mentioned as constituting an important force in the overall equation, a matter which must be addressed.  While that may comprise another agenda, nonetheless it is linked closely to the report, thereby ensuring a link with the debate on banks and their role in society.</P>
    <P>It is said that Irish people incur too many risks in comparison with their counterparts in other countries.  For example, a bank that requests the deeds of a family home in addition to an applicant's life savings as collateral against a business proposal is asking far too much. This level of collateral should be examined and, if possible, regulations introduced to eliminate such requirements.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are an important part of the overall scene and <Col N="544" /> were debated in the House under another heading.  Nonetheless, I emphasise that their work will be of enormous importance to the creation of small businesses. Here I might refer to the the objective of getting Tallaght working effectively with the relevant county enterprise board, recognising the small job creation units established by a combination of incubator units, operated by the &ldquo;Get Tallaght Working&rdquo; group, in conjunction with the expertise and support of the county enterprise boards which is certain to lead to increased employment in the area.  Indeed, natives of Tallaght have always had good ideas, so I have no doubt we will see it projecting itself back into employment.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this report is the rewarding of risks, tax credits being one of the incentives mentioned, and granting PAYE allowances for family members participating in businesses.  Indeed, the rewarding of job creation through the tax credit system should be extended wherever necessary for the creation of employment.  Value added tax on receipts instead of invoices constitutes another major step forward, the £40,000 limit for VAT returns helping many people.  Being paid on time is another important element in ensuring that small businesses succeed.  We have had plenty of evidence and experience in and outside this House of conglomerates withholding payments and extracting greater concessions from small businesses resulting from the latter's dependence on the former.  The State must intervene in the marketplace to ensure fair play for small businesses, ensuring that large companies do not exert undue influence over smaller ones, or interfere in their internal affairs because of the nonpayment of accounts, thereby creating distortion in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the Task Force on Small Business is the reduction of the administrative burden on people participating in job creation in the small business sector, through the one-stop-shop agency, ensuring that the minimum amount of time is devoted to compliance with State requirements.  That one-stop-shop <Col N="545" /> agency, which is becoming very popular in many other areas of business and development, should be utilised if possible for the benefit of the smallest groups in the self-employed sector.  It is enormously difficult to set up a business on one's own, whereas the advice and assistance available from such one-stop-shops would be of enormous benefit in the early stages.  A business information system, or network, is another matter that must be given serious consideration, recognising that large companies will have under the one roof all their business requirements, such as secretarial, telephone, fax services, typing pool and so on.  We should assist small industries and businesses to avail of such services whenever sharing is feasible, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplication.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to an area in which I was directly involved and have first-hand experience, through teaching, before being elected to this House.  I was involved in Pearse College in south County Dublin when people on the dole were given an opportunity to avail of second chance education courses.  One of my tasks was to get an enterprise business scheme going, demonstrating job creation which would take people off the live register.  As part of that scheme we established a small shop in the college, giving participants practical, day to day experience in selling goods to the remaining pupils in the college, in conjunction with my task on advertising, marketing and display.  We discovered that a huge number of those pupils who had been on the dole had fantastic abilities to fulfil most business requirements.  Given a small opportunity and scope for development. Accompanied by practical experience, they were given the confidence to consider going out to find work in the marketplace, to create their own employment opportunities or reintegrate with the employment sector.  That afforded young people an opportunity to learn not theory or the academic aspects of business but to acquire expertise and skills in the practical aspects of business. I have no doubt that many young people who participated in such courses at that <Col N="546" /> college are now in gainful employment. Indeed.  I know many have established successful businesses.  This is an area on which the task force might focus greater attention, linking such courses with existing small businesses and occasionally allowing an interrelationship between them, so that people could be transferred from their small business enterprise into such colleges to participate in evening or one-day courses, thereby gaining the requisite expertise and skills as the work to expand their businesses.</P>
    <P>We should give serious consideration to the future development of the Task Force on Small Business.  For example, we must continue to monitor developments in the marketplace and keep a watchful eye on changes as we move to greater integration within the European Union.  Not enough attention is paid to European languages.  If small businesses are to be successful, for example allowing for expansion into the European Union greater area, we must devise a system that would give them access to the Continent without having to bear the full brunt of the cost themselves.  We should consider the establishment of an agency here that would enable our small business people to have a representative on the Continent, in France, Germany, Spain and other countries, where their business interests might lie.  I have in mind students on summer vacation who could act as agents for small companies interested in entering into negotiations with their counterparts on the Continent, or establishing contact with some institution there.  We should enable those students to establish such contact and use their language skills on the Continent for the benefit of our small businesses.  After that possibilities could be explored in a more formal manner, establishing formal contact points.  This would mean small businesses could avail of the services of young students who remain on the Continent who will be able to identify routes, contacts and expertise to assist small native industries and businesses who could not afford to make regular visits there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most useful, constructive debate on a thought provoking report of the Task Force on Small Business.  As it said in its introduction, it is unique in that it brought together small business people to establish, from their personal experience, what needed to be done.</P>
      <P>The key issues raised in the report related, first, to raising money.  As the House is aware, discussions are taking place with the banks.  The whole idea of a third banking force, contained in the Programme for Government, is geared to the need to provide adequate loan finance to small, starter businesses, an area in which the two major banking groups here, until very recently, have been fairly remiss.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that the Government was contemplating taking over the risk aspect from the main banking groups but that is not the case.  We are discussing how we can ensure there is a proper sharing of the risk and that the banks and financial institutions play their full part in facilitating small and start-up businesses.</P>
      <P>I am always struck by the short sightedness of the major banks in not supporting small business development.  If the banks control 80 per cent of the financial market they stand to gain a great deal from a climate which encourages more business development and growth. I have come across companies with guaranteed orders from blue chip customers who have been unable to get hold of the working capital they need to get on with their business.  That is suicidal behaviour by our main banking groups. It is important that the dialogue continues and that we establish a strong third banking force, as a counterweight to the two main banks.  We need one which serves the needs of small business and ensures that the two main banking groups also play their part in facilitating small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key aspect in the report was that of paperwork.  As one who employs a person to mind my daughter at home after school I understand the difficulties <Col N="548" /> faced by a person like Zoe Baird who took the paperless route.  Certainly, the volume of paperwork and transactions, particularly by those employing one or two people or somebody in the home, are a major deterrent.  I do a long day's work and I do not want to be faced with a great deal of paperwork at home to keep my affairs in order.  I sympathise with the difficulties faced by small businesses in this regard.  A number of practical suggestions in this regard were made by the task force.  I am pursuing this issue vigorously with the Revenue Commissioners. As a consumer of some of this paperwork I have some practical suggestions to make.</P>
    <P>The third main feature identified in the report is that of &ldquo;mentoring&rdquo;.  This has been one of the great successes of the IDA programme now run by Forbairt. Under it the county enterprise boards can mobilise the experience of people who have been in business and those who are in senior business posts.  In many partnership companies the involvement of people with business expertise which facilitates small business and start-up business in disadvantaged communities has been of enormous benefit.  Senior management in major companies see it as a major benefit to their management team to share that expertise and to apply knowledge and skills gained to the problems of small business.</P>
    <P>Cashflow is identified in the report as one of the major problems facing any small business.  I wish to sound a note of caution on the recommendation because we should not apply a different standard from what we expect the public and private sector buyers to do.  There were difficulties concerning people who had supplied the health boards.  I am pleased we have been able to deal with the cashflow problems of the suppliers by late payment through the restructuring of the cash position of health boards.  That is welcomed as a positive move by the Government.  It would be a retrograde step if we were to assist a two tiered approach in the rules applied to public buyers and private sector buyers.  The payment time is extraordinarily long and <Col N="549" /> can cause great hardship for a small company supplying a few outlets, especially if one of those outlets becomes involved in the Phoenix syndrome, refuses to pay and starts up under a different name.  If the payment period was shortened and there was a uniform approach that would be an improvement on the recommendation of the task force.</P>
    <P>The task force made recommendations on the taxation system.  In evaluating them we must bear in mind that the task force was almost entirely composed of people in small businesses so that a degree of special pleading should be understood.  Many practical steps were taken in the budget to implement key recommendations, particularly on raising the thresholds for VAT and so on.  A very sensible change is that the PAYE allowance should be given to children of people working in the business.  The task force suggests that the self employed and small businesses should receive the full PRSI allowance and we want to move on that recommendation.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to continue to act on the proposals in the report.  It is notable that many of the practical suggestions in it have been acted on.  I am not anxious to see reports simply gathering dust on shelves.  The speed with which the task force produced it deserves equal speed in terms of a Government response.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to set up a unit in the Department of Enterprise and Employment to not only implement the recommendations in the report but to advise the sectors concerned.  The role of the Oireachtas was referred to by Deputy Harney.  The point was well made that what we are proposing is a joint committee on small business which would help ensure that the report does not gather dust but that its recommendations would be implemented, depending on resources.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious that small business has major potential to deliver jobs here.  If we can encourage small business and start-up businesses we will grow bigger businesses.  One of the most striking statistics in the report is that while <Col N="550" /> Ireland has roughly the same number of small businesses as other countries 98 per cent of our enterprises could be classified as small businesses.  We have fewer fast track businesses that grow from small businesses to medium or larger businesses, and we have fewer businesses who make the breakthrough to medium and large size.  The small business in Ireland tends to remain small.  If every small business which is employing two people were to employ one extra person we would do a great deal to eliminate the problem of unemployment.  We now have a very good economic environment and the economic forecasts are good.  Those producing for the home market have a buoyant market and interest rates are at an all time low.  That is good news for people who intend to borrow and invest in their businesses.  Low interest rates is one of the key factors in encouraging investment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the highest savings ratios in the European Union.  However, we are bad at translating those savings into investment.  We need to ensure that the banks who are charged with taking care of the savings of the nation are also interested in genuine investment that will increase the productive capacity of this economy.  Provision has been made in the National Development Plan for considerable investment in business and industry to increase growth in the economy and to make it cheaper to do business in Ireland.  It is up to the other actors in the economy, particularly the lending institutions, to match this investment to unlock the potential of small business.</P>
    <P>The task force makes the point in its report that small business is reluctant to accept equity finance.  The point was made in the Culliton report that we tend to rely far too much on grant aid and far too little on equity and loan finance. Small business should be prepared to spread the risk and accept equity finance and thereby reach its potential.  Sometimes people who have an excellent business idea find it difficult to gain access to finance because they want to maintain 100 per cent control.  They ask others to share the risk but not the rewards.  The <Col N="551" /> unwillingness to dilute control may be one of the reasons the growth of small business is being inhibited.</P>
    <P>The report contains many valuable recommendations drawn from practical experience.  The Government has made a good start in the budget and the 1994 Finance Act in implementing some of the key recommendations.  Through the institutional arrangements that have been made which involve the Oireachtas and the Department of Enterprise and Employment I hope we will do more to create an environment in which people with business ideas can flourish and prosper and create the employment that is so badly needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 5, 11, 25, 28, 35 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>Seventeen sections of the Child Care Act have been commenced to date, including most of the preventative and service-delivery provisions contained in Part II of the legislation.  The provisions that are now in force apply to children up to the age of 18 years.  The remaining 52 sections of the Act will be brought into operation by the end of 1996 in acordance with the timescale determined by the Government.  I want to emphasise that this is the shortest possible period within which the legislation in its entirety can be implemented having regard to the scale of the infrastructure required to underpin the legislation.</P>
      <P>As part of a structured programme for the implementation of the Act, priority is being accorded to the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the duties and powers of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the gardaí to intervene effectively in relation to child abuse.  The need for the early implementation of these key provisions was underlined in the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation.  When this has been achieved, arrangements will then be made for the implementation of the other outstanding provisions, including Part VII, which deals with the supervision of pre-school services, and Part VIII, which deals with the registration of children's residential centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to remind the House of the fact that, for the Act to be effective, it must be properly resourced. It is absolutely essential that the necessary services, facilities and staffing required to underpin the legislation are put in place; otherwise it will fail the vulnerable children and families it is intended to assist.  This Government will not be found wanting in that regard. Since we came into office, unprecedented levels of funding have been made available for the development of child care <Col N="554" /> and family support services which will enable the health boards to carry out their various statutory responsibilities under the Act.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a sum of £5 million was provided for new service developments in the child care area.  The important new initiatives funded from this allocation include: more than 100 new posts of social worker and child care worker; Three new consultant staffed child and adolescent psychiatric services; 20 new posts in child psychology; the expansion of the home maker and home help services; the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of health boards; increased financial support for pre-school services in disadvantaged areas, and 30 additional hostel places for homeless children.</P>
    <P>This year an additional £15 million is available for child care.  This will meet the full year costs of the various initiatives begun in 1993 and will enable a further round of new service developments to be launched during this year.  The child care policy unit of my Department is currently finalising proposals for a package of major developments in each health board area.  I intend to announce details of these developments in the next week.</P>
    <P>These allocations represent the largest ever investment of resources in the child care area and demonstrate my determination, and that of my colleagues in Government, to ensure that this Act is not simply implemented on paper, but that there is a real and tangible improvement in the level and quality of services and supports to assist children and families in need.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions require new regulations to give full effect to them.  In this context, I might mention that two working groups have been established under the aegis of the child care policy unit of my Department to prepare the initial drafts of the new foster care and residential care regulations.  These groups include representatives of the health boards and the relevant interest groups as well as of my Department, and their work will help to expedite the competition of the preparatory work that <Col N="555" /> has to be undertaken before the next segment of the legislation can be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>In the development of services in the child welfare area, particular emphasis is being placed on strengthening the community based child protection teams. These multi-disciplinary teams play a key role in the identification, investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse.  I am committed to increasing the number of social workers, child care workers, child psychologists and other specialist professional staff in the community in order to enhance the capacity of the health boards to intervene effectively on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the substantial number of new posts which I approved in 1993; I shall shortly be announcing the creation of a significant number of further posts.</P>
    <P>As regards the detailed arrangements for pursuing allegations of child abuse, the procedures followed by the health boards are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987. All the boards are taking steps to improve existing arrangements for the reporting and management of child abuse, with particular importance being attached to co-operation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care services of each health board.  This is being done in response to a recommendation in the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation.</P>
    <P>The detailed information sought by Deputies Durkan and Dukes is not readily available in my Department However, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of suspected cases of child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, reported to health boards.  The boards now deal with some 4,000 new cases of child abuse annually. For example, in the latest year for which full details are available &mdash; the number of reports was more than 3,800 of which some 1,500 cases were confirmed, including more than 500 cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Considerable progress has been made in the last 12 months in building up child care and family support services and in strengthening the capacity of the health services to respond to the needs of deprived children, particularly those who are not receiving adequate care and protection. At the same time, I accept that much more remains to be done in this area.  It is my firm intention that the momentum of the past 12 months will be sustained and that all necessary arrangements will be put in place to ensure, in so far as is humanly possible, that children are protected from abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there are glaring gaps in the services so far as the protection and care of children is concerned, which have been highlighted in the past number of years? Notwithstanding the lengthy and helpful reply he has read out to the House, those gaps will remain because, even where a problem has been identified, there appears to be difficulties in follow-up procedures. Will the Minister assure the House that follow-up procedures will not be found wanting in the future?</P>

      <P>I accept the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation which highlighted a number of deficiencies in the support services for vulnerable families. I brought these proposals to the Government who accepted them.  We are working on proposals to implement the provisions of the Child Care Act in full in the timeframe I outlined and the Government has provided me with the necessary resources to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>I have established a child care policy unit in my Department whose specific objective is to implement all the initiatives I have outlined, to work in co-operation with child care units in the health boards and ensure we attain the desired objective of a proper infrastructure of support for families and vulnerable children as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure no one would doubt the Minister's intentions in this <Col N="557" /> regard but I am concerned about the delivery of services.  It is approximately one year since the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation was published.  Has the Minister received a breakdown of health board requirements in respect of resources, staffing, funding, etc., to meet the provisions of the Child Care Act? Has he planned precisely how he intends to meet these requirements?</P>
      <P>A section of the Child Care Act provides that children will be catered for up to the age of 18 years.  Will the Minister guarantee these provisions are in place? I note he is quick to nod his head.  I have evidence of a girl who was allegedly sexually abused since the age of seven. Through her teacher she approached the health board when she was 17 but was told that because she was over 16 years the service she required could not be provided.  Are all health boards providing services for all children up to the age of 18?</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Act which deals with accommodation was implemented relatively early.  It was reported last week that there are still children under the age of 16 years in bed and breakfast accommodation. Will the Minister indicate why that is the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the framework within which we are working in what I thought was a comprehensive reply. Those sections of the legislation which are in force relate to children up to the age of 18.  If the Deputy wishes me to examine a particular case, I will be pleased to do so.  Other sections of the Act will come into force next year and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware there are homeless children on the streets.  The Government is very concerned about that.  It is hoped to deal <Col N="558" /> with the problem by way of the infrastructural build up of resources and personnel I have outlined.  I said on many occasions that I could implement all sections of the Act by statutory instrument by applying my signature but I will not do that until I am confident that the infrastructure in terms of places, supports and personnel are in place.  That is my determination in the time frame I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he has identified the reasons for a lack of a follow-up procedure in a number of cases in the past few years?  Will that problem be addressed in his proposals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Every case is considered on its merits.  Unfortunately, now and again horrific cases of child abuse arise. I treat each case as a serious matter to be investigated in its own right and we learn from them.  I said previously that no matter what resources are available, neither I nor anyone else could guarantee that no child will be abused in the future. It is my determination that, as far as possible, the support mechanisms will be in place to ensure the follow-up of every case of child abuse reported to the health services which needs monitoring or support and that every family recognised as being vulnerable will receive the resources and support it needs.</P>

      <P>In response to my earlier question the Minister said he would not implement sections of the Act unless he could guarantee they could be delivered. Is this not what is happening in relation to section 5 which deals with accommodation?  The Minister has not provided the spaces and, if anything the problem is worsening, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region.  Young children are staying in bed and breakfast accommodation which the Minister acknowledges is inappropriate accommodation. Is he not doing what he has undertaken not to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard bed and breakfast accommodation as suitable for children.  The problem of homelessness is not confined to Dublin, nor is it confined to Ireland.  Youth homelessness is a new phenomenon that needs to be addressed.  It is a more serious problem than simply providing accommodation. We need to analyse why children are on the streets.  Sometimes they are driven from their homes by violence or abuse. We need to put in place the support mechanisms to support families so that children will not have to resort to taking to the streets or looking for accommodation provided by a local authority or a health board.  I am determined to put this mechanism in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="562" /> Nos. 2, 31, 49, 53, 57, 64, 70, 77, 78, 79, 82, 96, 98 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C arising from the national blood screening programme is being provided at the following hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>Special consultant staffed clinics have been set up in these hospitals and the number of patients who have been referred to these clinics is 371.  The number of patients who have attended at one of the six designated hospitals is 316. A total of 296 patients have been referred to have liver biopsy and the number who have undergone a liver biopsy is 180.  It is not possible at this early stage to give a general statement on the results of these biopsies.</P>
      <P>It is alleged that some years ago a person died from a fulminant hepatitis which, it is alleged, was related to a blood transfusion.  Medical opinion strongly indicates that this would not, in all likelihood, have been due to hepatitis C but I am having the matter fully investigated. If the Deputy has any further information on any particular case, I would be glad if he would send me whatever details he has, and I will be in touch with the Deputy in due course.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, any treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C arising from the national blood screening programme is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.  The length of time that a patient will be on treatment for hepatitis C is a matter for clinical decision in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the VHI on 17 May announced its decision to provide cover towards the costs of private hospital accommodation and consultants' charges for members who test positive for hepatitis C arising from the national blood screening programme.  My Department will continue to cover the costs of any drugs and medicines prescribed by clinicians <Col N="563" /> for all patients including VHI subscribers who opt for private care.</P>
    <P>Screening of children and partners of women who test positive for hepatitis C is under way.  I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that as at 23 May 1994, 535 children and 167 partners had been screened for hepatitis C.  I understand that up to today six children and one partner have tested RIBA positive and further investigations are under way in these cases.  There are three stages of testing, namely, the Eliza, the RIBA and the PCR.  These people are being notified by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>I am aware that an action group has been formed for women who test positive for hepatitis C arising from the screening programme.  I have received a request to meet with representatives of this group and I have written to the group indicating that I will meet with them in the near future.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has undertaken to provide assistance in terms of expertise and information to any support group or individual.</P>
    <P>Counselling is being provided at the Blood Transfusion Service Board's headquarters in Dublin and at the regional centre in Cork for people who have tested positive for hepatitis C.  Counselling is provided by the Blood Transfusion Service Board medical consultants and by doctors employed specifically to provide this service.  General practitioners throughout the country are also providing a counselling service.  In addition, arrangements have been made for counselling to be provided by other health professionals where this is deemed to be appropriate.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board will continue to see people on an individual basis at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and in addition are initiating a programme whereby people will be given the opportunity to participate in a series of up to three group sessions.  These sessions will comprise 12 women coming together to meet with a hepatitis C specialist and a specialist in stress-anxiety management for a presentation <Col N="564" /> on hepatitis C and a question and answer session.</P>
    <P>No consideration has been given at this stage to the question of compensation.</P>
    <P>While public health doctors were involved in counselling of recipients of anti-D at the outset of the screening programme, at this stage, public health doctors are not involved in the screening, counselling and treatment programmes in relation to hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Consultants employed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board have collected considerable information from experts in other countries on hepatitis C.  Relevant information gathered from experts has been made available to health professionals and the general public through conferences, leaflets and during counselling with individual patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that women who have sought counselling have been disappointed with the level of counselling available.  Information does not seem to be available to the counsellors. Does the Minister propose to address the problem and, if so, how soon?  Will compensation be considered and, if so, when?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My first preoccupation is to identify any person who might have contracted hepatitis C.  The focus, therefore, has been on the national screening programme which has screened tens of thousands of women.  The next priority is to ensure that those who have proved to have hepatitis C are properly treated, counselled and supported.  The issue of compensation will arise in due course and will have to be addressed.  As to the disappointment expressed by some women, I am aware that in some cases counselling was not as comprehensive as one would like.  Consider the extent of this screening programme and the need to introduce it as speedily as possible.  If we were planning a screening programme of this volume it would normally have taken a year to do it.  It was necessary to do it quickly and there have been gaps in the system.  I am determined that, as far as is practicable, proper counselling, support <Col N="565" /> mechanisms and help will be available to all women who have the worry of hepatitis C.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987, the health boards and the Garda Síochána regularly exchange information in suspected cases of child abuse.  My Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, has prepared a document proposing improved procedures for the notification of cases between the two agencies.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the procedure is to ensure closer co-ordination between the Garda and the health boards in the investigation and management of suspected cases of abuse in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure revolves around a standardised form for the reporting of suspected physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect of children under the age of 18 years.  The document clarifies the circumstances in which such cases are to be referred and provides guidance on <Col N="566" /> the consultations that should take place between a health board and the Garda following such a referral.</P>
    <P>The draft procedure is currently being operated on a pilot basis in a number of selected areas and, subject to any refinement that might be needed, I expect that it will be introduced nationally before the end of the year.  The implementation of this new procedure on a national basis will give effect to a major recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny investigation.  This measure is part of a comprehensive review of current arrangements for the reporting of suspected child abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the child abuse guidelines operating in his Department have no legal basis? Does he think the draft procedure currently being operated on a pilot basis in unspecified parts of the country is adequate, given that one of the main recommendations of the Kilkenny incest case report was that there should be adequate and clear procedures for interaction between the Garda Síochána and the health boards in cases of alleged sexual abuse?  For the Minister to say he is at the drafting and consultation stage is an outrage.  Will he agree that protection postponed is protection denied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Words like &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; trip too readily from the Deputy's lips.  As to the guidelines and their legal effect, the agencies involved, the Garda Síochána and the health boards, act in unison in the better interests of the people they serve and there is a working relationship that does not require statutory provision. My objective on the guidelines, the reporting mechanisms and the follow through is to achieve the best practice.  I feel it is best to pilot them in unspecified areas.  The areas being piloted include Dublin, Limerick and Galway.  I expect the pilot programme to end this month and I will be in a position to make the final decisions on national procedures and guidelines this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree <Col N="567" /> that to put such a standardised procedure in place is not a question of providing money but of having the political will and that the Garda Commissioner could put regulations in force tomorrow to ensure that such co-operation exists between the Garda and the health boards?  Will he further agree and confirm to the House that at the moment there is no obligation on the Garda to inform a health board about a case of alleged sexual abuse and that neither is there an obligation on the health boards to inform the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective is the best treatment of people who present to the health services.  I do not want to frighten people away from the health services.  It is not the best practice if a young teenager who is pregnant feels that her underage boyfriend might be prosecuted if she presents herself at a health centre and instead hides somewhere.  The guidelines must be worked out carefully.  We are doing that on a pilot basis to arrive as quickly as possible at the best framework to protect vulnerable children.  That is my objective and it will remain so.  The guidelines are not simple, there are pages and pages and the Garda and the health boards at every level are fully committed to co-operation in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>What action does the Minister intend to take to resolve the problem where there are so many acting rather than permanently employed doctors?  Surely it would be to the betterment of the services, would improve confidence in the services and boost job satisfaction for the people concerned if they were given permanent appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>An integral part of the strategy I published for the health services was the creation of departments of public health medicine.  The reason no permanent position was filled in recent times is that it was agreed by everybody that public health medicine needed to be restructured.  We have broad agreement with the representative bodies of the doctors involved in public health medicine. The one outstanding matter is the level of pay.  There is a considerable gap <Col N="569" /> between the current rates of remuneration for directors of community care and senior area medical officers and the rates for the new positions as directors of public health medicine and specialists in public health medicine.  The expectations of those who would possible fill the new positions are greater than the capacity of the Department of Health or of the taxpayer to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear how fast the Minister spoke when reading out those figures.  I am sure he will agree that the proportion of permanent as against acting appointments is incredible. Is the Minister aware that this has a serious effect on the service, with large numbers of people filling in posts for a considerable time?  It leads to uncertainty and insecurity and has led to a serious dispute with the Department.  Will the Minister agree that as the role of director of community care is an important one, it is unacceptable that this dispute has developed?  I recently received a letter from the director of community care in my area stating that she simply cannot deal with all the cases I bring to her attention.  That position has arisen due to failure by the Department to plan and make decisions.  Will the Minister ensure that people are permanently appointed to these positions so that they can get on with their very important work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reverse is the case; the reason for the dispute is probably that we planned so well.  For the first time an infrastructure of public health medicine is clearly laid out and the Government has approved of its putting in place. There is no lack of planning.  There is broad agreement on the structure.  For years people have talked about departments of public health medicine and I hope I will get the full co-operation of all involved to put them in place as speedily as possible.  There is only one outstanding matter, that is the issue of money.  I am not in a position to meet the demands of the IMO on the salary structures for the new directors of public health medicine and to pay them at the level of senior <Col N="570" /> consultant, up to £65,000 a year, which is virtually a doubling of their existing salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>Alzheimer's disease, first described in 1908 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, is a degenerative, terminal disease of the brain cells which causes memory loss and gradual mental and physical deterioration. Its cause is unknown and as yet there is no effective cure for the 20,000 to 30,000 people in Ireland who have this disease.</P>
      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>, stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose-built accommodation.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Between 1909 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families. The investment by boards is additional to support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 funding is being made available <Col N="571" /> to provide specialist services for those with dementia in south-east Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  It is hoped that these services will be in operation before the end of the year or early next year.  My Department is also considering a request for funding from the Alzheimer Society towards the development of the valuable services of the society.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September 1993, widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.</P>
    <P>The report, Caring without Limits, which was published by the Alzheimer Society in July last year provides an important insight into the lives of those who bear the brunt of Alzheimer's disease &mdash; the carers.  I was pleased that my Department allocated a grant to the Alzheimer Society to enable this important research to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Government has expanded the eligibility criteria for the carer's allowance in recognition of the burden on relatives of caring for dependent elderly people such as those with dementia.  As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes, and I will continue to encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.</P>
    <P>Research on Alzheimer's disease being carried out in Ireland includes scientific research on the causes of the disease using animal models in Trinity College, Dublin, which was recently published in an international journal.  The Mercer's Institute, St. James's Hospital is examining early diagnosis of dementia and the quality of life and burden for care givers of dementia sufferers.  It is also involved in a longitudinal follow up study on dementia.  The North Dublin Psychiatry <Col N="572" /> of Old Age Service has carried out research on service provision available for dementia sufferers in the community. It has also examined the referral of dementia sufferers to general hospitals and abuse of dementia sufferers.</P>
    <P>Regarding comparison with services available in other European Union countries, my observation since I became Minister for Health is that services for the elderly in this country compare favourably with those provided elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that all research is being made available to the Alzheimer Society and to the friends and relatives of people with the disease?  Have contributory causes been put forward over the years?  If so, to what extent has an advance been made in recent times on those factors and will such information be made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the information on research.  There is very close liaison with the research institutes and the Alzheimer Society and also between my Department and that society, whose work is greatly valued by us.  I am anxious that any information required by the society will be made available to it.  It initiates its own research and I am happy to fund that research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When talking about carers, in the main we are talking about women.  Is the Minister taking action to review means testing of the carer's allowance to such an extent that it will make a difference and so that women whose husbands have means and are thereby disallowed support will get the support they need, not only in terms of money but also by way of respite care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to support carers to the best of my ability.  I acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of carers are women.  The carer's allowance is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and I know he shares my concerns in this matter.  It is much more desirable to treat, support and help <Col N="573" /> people who suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's disease in their homes rather than institutionalise them and that is a policy we will be working towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that Alzheimer's disease is a particularly distressing condition and it is difficult to care for people with this disease.  To assist people living on low incomes who care for those with Alzheimer's disease, will the Minister consider providing grant aid for facilities such as central heating, wheelchairs and so on?  It is not easy to provide that kind of physical support because there is no specific provision for these facilities.  I am sure the Minister will agree that such assistance would make a big difference to people caring for those with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to trespass on the area of responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare who is responsible for income maintenance.  I hope, by agreement, to transfer all income supports, including disabled person's maintenance allowance, to the Department of Social Welfare.  I am mindful of the points made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing as people live longer.  That will have to be borne in mind if we are to achieve the objective of caring for people in the home setting for which I have expressed my support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider setting up specialised long stay and respite units to cater for people with this disease?  With one or two exceptions there are no such units to cater for this problem and they would be of great benefit to patients and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many geriatric facilities now have Alzheimer units, several of which I have visited.  Those units will become part of the general provision for the elderly.  People who can no longer be supported in the home setting will require a degree of support greater than that <Col N="574" /> normally given to people in geriatric facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department, since it does not become involved in every case.  Under the terms of the circular governing the referral abroad scheme, the chief executive officer of the referring health board can approve cases without reference to my Department where the total costs involved are less than £10,000.</P>
      <P>Figures available to my Department for numbers referred abroad for treatment are as follows: 1986, not available; 1987, 102; 1988, 114; 1989, not available; 1990, 223; 1991, not available; 1992, not available and 1993, 158.</P>
      <P>Patients are referred abroad for a wide range of specialised procedures, the most expensive of which would be bone marrow transplants, heart-lung transplants and liver transplants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to bone marrow transplants, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that additional resources have been provided in recent years to allow upgrading of the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin, and work is now well underway on the new Oncology-Haematology-Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at St. James's Hospital.  These developments when completed will allow the national centre <Col N="575" /> at the two hospitals to deal with most cases arising here.</P>
    <P>On liver transplants, the national centre for adults at St. Vincent's Hospital was fully established last year and has achieved a high success rate.  This followed a considerable investment in services and staff training in co-operation with the Liver Unit at Kings College Hospital, London.  The children's Liver Unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin is still under development and additional funds have been allocated this year to enable it to be operational as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Developments such as these will allow Irish patients to be treated nearer to home and avoid serious disruptions associated with travel abroad for such treatment.  It must be accepted, however, that it will not be possible to provide the resources and expertise necessary for all of the highly sophisticated procedures for which patients need to be referred abroad and a limited number of such cases will arise annually.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, therefore, to continue to refer patients abroad for treatment in some cases.  The position regarding referrals abroad is kept under regular review in my Department and improvements to specialist services will continue to be made as resources permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are the figures for some years not available?  If figures are available for some years, they should be available for all because the one procedure must be used to compile those figures.  Are patients from the Cork area, the Southern Health Board, included in those figures and if so will the Minister elaborate on the necessity to send those people outside the jurisdiction for treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the comprehensive figures are not available for each year.  They are not routinely collected by my Department and there would be a number of referrals under £10,000 with which I would not be familiar. In the timeframe between the <Col N="576" /> tabling of a question and the reply, it is not possible to obtain a full picture but I will endeavour to do that for the Deputy and pass the information to him in due course.</P>
      <P>On hip replacement surgery provided for Cork patients last year, I am pleased that every patient transferred to Belfast transferred voluntarily.  The scheme has been successful and one that I would not be averse to repeating, although my preference is to provide services within the jurisdiction and as close to the patient's home as possible.</P>

Would the Department of Health pay for that woman to travel to another jurisdiction to have a termination?</P>

Without exception, all of those who received treatment and hip replacements in Belfast &mdash; and I invite the Deputy to visit them in Cork &mdash; were delighted with the treatments they received there.  They received treatments that would not have been provided otherwise and the people of Cork, and the Southern Health Board, applauded that action.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10. 34 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, the sexual assault treatment unit is at the Rotunda Hospital.  The management of the sexual assault treatment unit is a matter for the Rotunda Hospital in the first instance.  My Department has recently had discussions with the Rotunda Hospital on the early implementation of an agreed framework on the future development of the unit which is aimed at enhancing the level of service provided by the unit.  In this context, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital is currently having discussions with the general practitioners associated with the unit.  The threatened withdrawal of services has now been deferred and I am confident that issues raised by the general practitioners will be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other health board areas, immediate <Col N="582" /> medical examination and treatment of victims of rape and sexual abuse are provided through either general practitioner or general hospital serices.  Follow-up counselling is available through multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals from the health boards and from the voluntary rape crisis centres.  The Deputy will be aware that earlier this year I announced an increase of over 77 per cent in funding in 1994 for rape crisis centres throughout the country.  Some £458,000 was allocated compared with £258,500 in 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister consult with the staff working at the rape crisis centres before making the allocation? Did he consult with those involved in providing the service?  Was he informed of the impending difficulties?  Have the problems been addressed?  My information is that they have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had discussions with some rape crisis centres and I received submissions from others.  Their views were taken into account in assessing the substantial increase in funding made available this year.</P>
      <P>As regards the specifics of the Rotunda Hospital, I am not involved in the management of every unit in every hospital but my Department was in touch with the Master of the hospital who has responsibility in this matter.  I have said I hope the outstanding issues can be resolved as I am anxious to enure that the facilities of the unit will continue to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a danger when the Minister delegates responsibility for the provision of services, such as the provision of a sexual assault unit and the provision of refuge accommodation, that there would be different levels of services?  Does he agree that his Department should play a central role in formulating strategy in order to achieve uniformity of service?  It would be on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis if left to individual health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="583" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  A central tenet of the national health strategy is that policy would be formulated by the new health boards. Health executives will carry out the policy against the backdrop of national policy determined by the Department and approved by the Oireachtas.  It is impossible for a small policy driven unit to have a hands on approach to every unit.  That was counter-productive in the past.  The areas of health care are multifaceted and range from birth to death. We must have a supervisory role to ensure adequate provision of service throughout each health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Minister but there is a problem with the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda. The number of doctors has reduced from 12 to four.  Doctors on call there are paid £1.04 per hour.  The doctors have threatened to withdraw their services, much against their inclination because it goes against the grain for any doctor to threaten to withdraw service.  If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by the doctors, staff and hospital, will the Minister intervene to ensure the service is continued at an appropriate level and that staffing levels are adequate to meet the unit's requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has changed since the unit was established.  Initially it looked after children.  The review of the working group in 1987, on which the doctors were represented by Dr. Maura Woods, decided it was not an appropriate location for the treatment of victims of child sex abuse.  Consequently two new child sexual abuse units were opened in Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  The workload has changed during that time and much of the counselling is now carried out by the rape crisis centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of payment, it is important for me to allow the discussions between the hospital and staff to reach a conclusion and not to intervene in them. Approximately 260 persons attend the unit each year, approximately five per <Col N="584" /> week, and of that number approximately 140 are acute cases, that is cases involving recent sexual assault or rape.  The increase of 36 per cent for staff on call from Monday to Friday was rejected.  I will give the Deputy the actual figures because sometimes percentages distort the picture.  The proposed on-call fee from Monday to Friday is £34 per day while the proposed fee for weekends and bank holidays is £40, an increase of 33 per cent.  The proposed initial call out fee is £34 and £17 for each subsequent visit. The discussions are ongoing and I hope a satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be suggesting that the need for the Rotunda unit is no longer as clear as it was.  Does he recall his response to my Adjournment Debate matter on 30 March last when he suggested that this was the subject of some considerable exaggeration, outlandish claims etc., most of which have, unfortunately, come true in the meantime?  Will he agree that I was right on that occasion and he was obviously wrong?  Events have proved that I was correct.  How does he propose to deal with the matter other than by hoping it will go away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the structure of the unit.  All these matters need to be dealt with.  I am very supportive of the unit, which now provides a different mix of service.  I have received observations from a variety of groups, including the Rape Crisis Centre, which is now included in the mix, on the best type of service.  The staff have a genuine grievance. <Col N="585" /> The rates of pay have not been increased for some years and this needs to be addressed.  I have outlined my views on this matter to the hospital.</P>
      <P>On the structure of the unit, I hope a resolution can be arrived at.  The threat to withdraw services has been removed and the service is available.  I hope that this matter will be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 149 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board regards the provision of a new 27 bed unit at St. Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan as a priority.  I am making available a <Col N="587" /> sum of £100,000 this year to the South-Eastern Health Board for the planning of this unit.  The Deputies will be aware that in recent days I visited St. Joseph's to see the facilities at first hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike some other Deputies, I appreciate what the Minister is doing for Dungarvan, County Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give me more information about the 27 bed unit to which he referred in his reply?  I have not seen any press statement about the Minister's intentions in this area, but I presume it is proposed to transfer patients from the upper part of the premises to the ground level as the upper part is quite dangerous.  It is a fire hazard and poses difficulties for staff and patients when they are moving around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the facility and share the Deputy's concerns about it.  This is why I immediately approved the planning of a new 27 bed unit which will enable patients to be transferred from the upper part of the premises.  The planning will cost approximately £100,000 which I have made available, and I hope to provide a capital allocation for construction as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an approximate timescale for the completion <Col N="588" /> of this unit?  I greatly appreciate what he proposes to do but can he say if the work will be completed in 1995 or 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a timescale until I have received the complete proposals from the South Eastern Health Board, which has to put this development into context with the other capital demands it will present me with for next year.  Once I have discussed my bubgetary position with my Cabinet colleagues I will be in a position to know what exactly I can fund.  I want the planning completed and the capital works to get underway as soon as possible.  The question of when that happens will be decided in the context of the allocation of resources and priority demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that the work might drag on and may not be completed within the next year or two.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The management organisation and provision of the health services referred to by the Deputies are the responsibility of the various health agencies involved in the delivery of such services, that is, health boards, voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies.  This necessarily involves the identification of staffing <Col N="595" /> requirements and deployment of staff having regard to the particular service needs and within the overall context of the budgetary and employment constraints which apply.</P>
    <P>Under existing procedures, it is a matter for each agency to identify and submit to my Department, on a monthly basis, prioritised applications for the filling on a permanent basis of all new and replacement posts.  My Department's review of the proposals is undertaken bearing in mind the service and personnel criteria, with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to staffing levels generally in the health service, the following table, based on information extracted from the annual Health Service Personnel Census, shows the growth in health sector employment arising from the controlled implementation of Government approved health service initiatives between 1988 and 1992.</P>

    <P>*With effect from 1991, the inclusion in the Census of employment in commercial and noncommercial state bodies (1,124 in 1991 and 1,154 in 1992) under the aegis of the Department of Health ceased.</P>
    <P>The December 1993 census is currently being compiled.  It is anticipated that, when completed, it will reflect over 1,200 additional posts arising from approved development, across a range of services, including acute hospital services, child care services, services for the elderly and the mentally handicapped, dental services and implementation of EC Directives on student nursing and on food hygiene.  This developmental process and enhancement of existing service will continue this year and, it is expected, will result in a further growth in health service employment in excess of 1,600 posts.</P>

      <P>The Minister reminds me of a parent who tells children in midsummer what they will receive at Christmas if they are very good.  Does he accept that the position in relation to staffing in special hospitals &mdash; whether they be long-stay geriatric, or many mental institutions, those still operating as psychiatric institutions is totally unsatisfactory? Does he accept that the staff-patient ratios all fall short of what they should be and that there is grave danger of a serious problem as a result? Although the Minister may dress it up as much as he likes will he accept that concern has been expressed by people working in those services?  Will he indicate how he proposes to deal with that problem?</P>

No doubt the Deputy will be able to admonish his colleague, Deputy Yates, the next time he accuses me of being a spendthrift, and points out that he wants a £200 million cut in public expenditure. Indeed Fine Gael policy depends on which Member is on the Opposition benches and which Minister is answering. Deputy Durkan referred to services for the mentally handicapped.  He is aware that the additional resources allocated to those services this year will be £25 million over and above the figure available when I assumed office.  That was the commitment my party and the Government gave in advance of the election and I am glad it has been acted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a continuous process of integrating psychiatric patients in the community as far as possible which is supported by Government.  I hope to continue it and include all those patients capable of being integrated so that we will have the best, most humane form of <Col N="597" /> treatment for all those in need of our health services.</P>

Will he confirm that there are glaring gaps in those services and that it is up to him to address them? The Minister reciting a long history of what occurred since he assumed office is of no benefit to this House, or to patients in those institutions.  Will he now address the serious problem of patients at present in institutions who may not be transferred to community care?  I refer to those in special hospitals and to mentally handicapped people.

    <P>I realise it is of great concern to patients.  I have been glad to visit health institutions all over the country to hear the concerns not only of patients but of staff over the past 16 months.

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy McManus &mdash; the implications for Irish adoptions of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case; (2)  Deputy Jim Mitchell &mdash; the payment of higher education grants in November or December each year instead of September; and the unfairness of the covenant and grant system to those just above the threshold for higher education grants; and (3)  Deputy Shatter &mdash; the need for the Government to take all essential steps to ensure that no difficulties will arise in completing proposed adoptions as a result of the decision in the matter by the European Court of Human Rights; and the implications of the judgment for the validity of existing adoptions.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by the following Deputies McManus, Shatter and Jim Mitchell have been selected for discussion.</P>
      <P>As the matters raised by Deputies McManus and Shatter are quite similar, it is suggested that each Deputy should first make his or her five minute statement, after which the Minister for Health will reply to both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision by the European Court of Human Rights <Col N="682" /> to uphold the case of the unmarried father, Joseph Keegan, who presented his case that he should have an automatic right to be consulted in the event of his child being adopted and that his consent should have been obtained before placement of the child.</P>
      <P>This landmark decision has major implications not only for the adoption laws of this State but for the role, rights and obligations of unmarried fathers. Despite the fact that illegitimacy of children has been abolished the reality for unmarried fathers has been that under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, a married father is automatically the guardian of his children while an unmarried father is not.</P>
      <P>In the case of Mr. Keegan, the High Court ruled that the natural father had a right to be a guardian.  However, the Supreme Court overruled that decision in 1989 and clearly stated that the rights of unmarried fathers varied greatly depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Human Rights has now upheld that this is a breach of human rights and has vindicated the rights of all unmarried fathers to be consulted in the case of adoption of their child.</P>
      <P>We live in a time of growing awareness of the importance of the role of fathers in a child's physical and mental health. We also live in a time of changing family patterns where far greater numbers of unmarried people are having children. Yet our laws have not adapted to keep pace with these changes.  The unmarried father, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1994, does not have the automatic right to be a guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the response earlier today from the Minister for Finance that no legislation was being considered as a result of this particular milestone decision.  I hope that this view has been altered by the Government following thoughtful consideration.  The Law Reform Commission in its report on illegitimacy in 1982 recommended that <Col N="683" /> the mother and the father of a non-marital child should automatically be joint guardians of their child.</P>
    <P>However, the Government of the day did not see fit to accept this recommendation. It is important that, if there is a serious effort to bring about equality, the present injustice be addressed.</P>
    <P>The rights of the non-marital child are surely equivalent to those born within a marriage.  Why should we, as legislators, presume that a child of a marriage should have two joint guardians while a non-marital child must make do with only one?  Surely, a child has the right to the automatic guardianship of his or her father unless there are good grounds for denying that right.</P>
    <P>At a time when marital breakdown is occurring at a significant rate and where many children are born in non-marital relationships we have to look at the legislation in place.  For example, the Status of Children Act, 1987 states that a father includes a male adopter under an adoption order but does not include the father of an infant who is not married to that infant's mother.</P>
    <P>The Act also states that the mother while living shall alone be the guardian of the infant unless an order is enforced under section 6 (a).  That means that the relationship between a natural father and his child begins with no legal recognition of parentage.  This is automatically guaranteed to a father of a child within marriage.  It is time this anomaly was abolished.</P>
    <P>We must encourage fathers to take their role as parents seriously.  We must recognise their right as fathers to exercise their role as parents and that requires that attention be paid to the Law Reform Commission's proposal.  I welcome the fact that the Adoption Board revised its arrangements with regard to unmarried fathers.  That does not obviate the need for legislators to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of unmarried fathers be recognised in law.  There are, as has <Col N="684" /> been stated, arguments in the Law Reform Commission report against this proposal:</P>
    <P>In our view the principle of equality remains that no distinction should be made in the legal rights of guardianship on the basis of marital status and accordingly we recommend that both parents of children should be the joint guardians of the children whether they are born within or outside marriage.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the spirit of the European Court decision is such and, in the interest of equality and in recognition of the reality of modern Irish life which is that we have a sizeable proportion of non-marital children, we should follow up on the implications of this decision.  The Government should set its house in order to ensure there is no further breach of human rights relating to the unmarried father.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we are talking about a large number of children. The number of births outside marriage has more than doubled in the ten years up to 1992 and is now the third highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the Irish family, for many children that means a non-marital family.  The failure to recognise the role of the unmarried father as guardian is a failure which must be addressed to meet the demands of equality but, more important, for the thousands of children today whose needs are central to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our adoption laws, the father of a child born outside marriage has no legal right to be consulted prior to his child being placed for adoption by the child's mother.  There is also no legal obligation imposed on the Adoption Board to afford the natural father a hearing prior to determining an adoption application.  Under our adoption laws the local parish priest is given greater legal recognition than is the role of the natural father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> In the vast majority of cases where a child born outside marriage is placed for adoption by a natural mother, the natural father has shown little or no interest in his child's future and has not sought to intervene.  There have been instances of children being placed for adoption, having been born to a couple outside marriage, where the couple have had a stable relationship but whose relationship had collapsed prior to or shortly after the birth of a child.  This is the factual background to the case determined today by the European Court.</P>
    <P>The law is open to abuse to the extent that a mother can secretly place her child for adoption without the natural father being given any say in the matter and subsequent legal intervention by the natural father can prove futile, in circumstances where his child has formed bonds of attachment to adopters with whom it has been placed.  The law is unfair both to natural fathers and to adopters.  Any change in the law must preserve balance so as to ensure that the best interests and welfare of children are fully and properly protected.  It must also ensure that mothers are not placed in an invidious position by fathers who are unwilling to accept their responsibilities but who merely wish to use the law and the legal system to make the lives of the mothers more difficult and to impose on them a greater burden in circumstances where they believe it is in their child's interest that he or she be placed for adoption.</P>
    <P>The European Court today held our laws to be in breach of Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention.  It held that the fact that Irish law permitted the secret placement of a child for adoption, without a father's knowledge or consent, leading to the bonding of the child with the proposed adopters and the subsequent making of an adoption order, amounted to an interference with the father's right to respect for family life.  It emphasised that a fair balance had to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community <Col N="686" /> as a whole.  It accepted the view of the European Commission that the obstacles under Irish law to a natural father establishing a relationship with his child constitute a lack of respect for family life and a violation of democratic principles.</P>
    <P>It also held that the fact that a natural father had no specific legal right under our adoption laws to challenge the placement of a child for adoption, either before the Adoption Board or the courts and the fact that he was denied any standing in the adoption process generally, was in breach of a father's civil right to a fair and public hearing on a matter of such importance.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the court's decision appears to distinguish between the legal position of the natural father in circumstances where a child is born of a casual relationship and that of the natural father in circumstances where a child is born as a result of a stable ongoing relationship.  This judgment has profound implications for our adoption laws.</P>
    <P>It is clear, if we are to comply with the European Convention, that urgent reform is required.  Under the Treaty on European Union we have an international and constitutional obligation to respect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Any changes made by the Adoption Board by the issue of non-statutory guidelines to adoption societies do not affect our legal obligations as a result of this judgment.  They do not affect the need for new urgent legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health immediately to take all essential steps to ensure that no difficulties arise in completing adoptions currently being processed as a result of today's decision and to ensure they are not open to legal challenge following finalisation.  I ask him to reassure those who have completed adoptions that today's decision, about which there is a great deal of public unease, will not affect their validity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> The Minister should ensure that in future our laws and adoption procedures comply fully with the criteria laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights in accordance with our international and constitutional obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.  I have only just received a copy of the judgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg earlier today in the case brought against the State by the father of a child born outside marriage who was adopted against his wishes.  I hope the Deputies will appreciate that, pending a detailed examination of that judgment, I am not in a position to comment on the implications for our domestic adoption laws and procedures.  The issues raised by the European Court ruling require careful consideration and I shall be consulting the Attorney General in relation to them.  As the European Convention on Human Rights is not part of our domestic law, there is no question of today's judgment having any direct effect on the validity of adoptions completed to date.  I am anxious to stress this point in order to allay any fears adoptive parents may have in the matter.</P>
      <P>It would appear, from a preliminary reading of the judgment, that the essential problem which the court identified with existing Irish law is that it permits a child to be placed for adoption without the knowledge or consent of the father. In the light of this finding, it will be necessary to consider what changes need to be made to give fathers of children born outside marriage a greater say in the adoption process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of important developments have taken place in adoption practice since the case in question was finally determined by the High Court early in 1990.  A comprehensive memorandum issued by the Adoption Board to the adoption agencies in April 1990 deals specifically with the position of the natural father of a child who is being placed <Col N="688" /> for adoption.  That memorandum stresses the desirability of ascertaining from the mother and, where practicable, the father himself, the attitude of the father towards the proposed adoption.  Where an adoption agency is given an indication by the father that he opposes the proposed placement of the child for adoption, the Adoption Board advises that the agency should consider the prudence of delaying the placement for a period. The board's circular also makes it clear that where a father has applied to court for legal rights in respect of the child, under no circumstances should the child be placed for adoption pending the determination of the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Adoption Board issued a further circular to the adoption agencies advising them of new procedures in relation to natural fathers.  These require an adoption agency, in any case where the father is named on the child's birth certificate and is in a continuous relationship with the mother, to notify the father &mdash; if he is not already aware &mdash; of the application to adopt his child and to offer him a hearing by the Adoption Board itself on the application.</P>
    <P>These measures have helped to promote a greater awareness among the adoption agencies of the position of the natural father in the adoption process.  I am pleased to note that these developments in our domestic adoption practice are acknowledged by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment.</P>
    <P>The question of whether these procedures need to be extended is one of the matters about which I shall be consulting the Attorney General in the context of a full and careful examination of today's ruling by the European Court.  In the meantime, I want to reassure adoptive parents that today's ruling has no direct effect on the validity of their adoptions.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for giving me the opportunity to <Col N="689" /> raise this important issue.  The position is that students do not receive third level grants until November or December each year.  This causes great hardship both for them and their families.  Will the Minister for Health, who I presume has been briefed on behalf of the Minister for Education, indicate the steps that are being taken to ensure that grants are paid on time, that is, at the beginning of the academic year?</P>
      <P>Under the covenant system &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; a parent can covenant up to 5 per cent of their income for education purposes.  This favours the very rich.  Someone on an income of £300,000 or £400,000 a year &mdash; there are a few in the Law Library &mdash; can easily covenant 5 per cent of his income; 5 per cent of £300,000 is £15,000 whereas 5 per cent of £16,000, which would place a person above the threshold for third level grants, is £800.  The rich get richer under the covenant system.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week I tabled questions to the Ministers for Education and Finance. The Minister for Finance indicated in reply that the total cost involved under the covenant system in a full year is £37.4 million while the Minister for Education indicated that the total amount paid in fees by students is £45 million.  If we were to scrap the covenant system, for an extra £7.6 million per annum we could have free education. This would greatly help those families who are just above the threshold, in particular those families with a second child at third level and in receipt of no assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Middle income families are being clobbered from every side.  They are paying for everything and getting nothing. Under the grant system those under the threshold are given grants and under the covenant system the well off are given a major and costly concession.  Middle income families who pay property tax, mortgages and income tax and do not qualify for a medical card, do not receive <Col N="690" /> any grants or benefit to any significant degree under the covenant system.</P>
    <P>The time has come to phase out covenants. As covenants have a maximum lifespan of seven years, if a decision in principle was taken now they would be phased out over that period.  The point I am trying to make is that no new covenants should be granted and third level fees should be phased out.  This would provide relief for many middle income and working class families.  It is distressing that bright students from middle income and working class families who have the required number of points cannot go to university because their families cannot meet the fees or maintenance costs.  Even if the fees were abolished they would still have to meet the maintenance costs and many bright students from working class families would have the chance to go to third level.  What is extraordinary is that it would only cost the Exchequer £7.6 million per year.  The Government should consider this without further delay.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the late payment of higher education grants in November or December each year instead of September and the unfairness of the covenant system, and I am happy to respond on behalf of the Minister for Education.  This matter has been of grave concern to her.  It was for this reason that she announced on 22 February that she was arranging with officials of her Department to have the grant schemes issued to the local authorities by 1 May.  The Deputy may not be aware that this deadline has been met and with a closing date for the receipt of applications of 30 June, the local authorities will have two months to process grant applications before CAO offers of places are received.  I expect this will speed up the payment of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to the Deputy's reference to the relationship between the covenant system and the grant system. Covenants are a function of the tax code, <Col N="691" /> and relate to issues broader than third level education and are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the grant threshold for higher education grants, however, the Deputy will be aware of the Minister's ongoing concern to increase the income eligibility limits within the resources available to her.  As she announced on 22 February the income eligibility limits this year have been increased in line with the increase in the average industrial wage. <Col N="692" /> The actual percentage increase is 5.4 per cent, this is on top of the 3.4 per cent increase in the limits last year.</P>
    <P>One always has the greatest of sympathy for those whose incomes are just above the income limits, but this would happen irrespective of how high the limits were set.  It is however an issue that will be kept under examination in the context of the annual ongoing review of the student support arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 May 1994.</P>

I have been advised by the Board that it was decided not to cover the revised accident and emergency charge introduced with effect from 1 March 1994 on the basis that the payment applies only in cases of patient self-referral and is intended to discourage inappropriate use of hospital facilities.  The Board stress that general practitioner costs continue to be covered under the VHI out-patient scheme on the normal basis.  As the Deputy will be aware the £6 out-patient charge was abolished with effect from 1 March 1994.</P>

    <P>Two years ago one of my predecessors as Minister for Health established an inter-departmental working group to look at the problems then arising from the rapid increase in medical indemnity <Col N="602" /> costs.  The group has been looking at possible alternatives to the existing arrangements for providing medical indemnity cover.  As a result of some of its interim recommendations, the medical indemnity scheme for non-consultant hospital doctors was introduced in 1992 which stabilised the cost of providing cover for that group.  The group has appointed actuarial advisers who are about to complete a study on the Irish liabilities of the medical defence organisations. I would hope to have the final report of the working group in early 1995.</P>

    <P>The incidence of AIDS amongst risk categories <Col N="603" /> in each member state of the European Union varies greatly and individual member states therefore, have to develop policies which represent the best response to their individual needs.  In Ireland 48 per cent of AIDS cases are IV drug misuse related and my Department's AIDS Strategy takes account of that fact.</P>
    <P>The broad headings under which specific action has been taken are in accordance with the areas identified by the National AIDS Strategy Committee, as follows: prevention; care and management; HIV/AIDS surveillance; and anti-discrimination.</P>
    <P>The strategies for dealing with HIV/AIDS and drug abuse are closely interlinked.  Since 1992 substantial funding has been allocated to these areas, particularly in the greater Dublin area where the majority of drug abusers reside.  This funding has allowed for the development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which, together with the Drug Treatment Centre and voluntary organisations, provides a comprehensive treatment network for drug abusers.  It is intended to further develop these services during 1994 and I have allocated specific funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's strategies on HIV/AIDS and drug abuse, methadone maintenance, i.e. a synthetic drug provided as a heroin substitute, is made available by the Eastern Health Board and also by the Drug Treatment Centre.  The rationale is that by availing themselves of this free &ldquo;safe&rdquo; drug, addicts are less likely to indulge in high risk needle-sharing and other anti-social behaviour.  This helps prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases as well as bringing addicts into contact with the range of services, treatment and otherwise, available for them.  It is important to point out that once the addict's behaviour is stabilised a range of treatment options is offered including assistance towards a drug-free lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Part of the strategy for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS involves targeting <Col N="604" /> particular at-risk groups including homosexuals as well as drug abusers.  To this end I have allocated funding to a number of health boards to implement outreach projects in association with voluntary organisations aimed at reducing the spread of the infection amongst the homosexual community.  In addition services have been provided at secondary and tertiary care levels to care for and manage persons who have contracted HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>I have secured the provision of substantial additional funding to give effect to the most important recommendations of the National Strategy Committee.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a total amount of £4.96 million was made available, in addition to the normal allocations for health agencies, to fund the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and in 1994 a further £3.4 million has been made available to continue the development of services in this area.</P>
    <P>Progress with the implementation of the recommendations under these headings is reviewed on a regular basis and a meeting of the National AIDS Strategy Committee under my chairmanship was held recently.  This meeting reviewed recent relevant issues in the HIV/AIDS area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in developing programmes and services to respond to the problem of HIV/AIDS and that the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee will continue to provide an appropriate response to the evolving epidemiology of the disease in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 55, 141, 144 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on previous occasions, I regard the provision of refuges and other services for victims of domestic violence as an important component of the network of child care and family support services being developed under the Child Care Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health Boards have, for a number of years, provided financial and other assistance <Col N="606" /> to voluntary agencies who provide services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>There are a total of 16 centres providing refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence nationally and I am having a table giving details of this accommodation by health board area circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The level of financial support provided by the health boards to women's refuges nationally is about £800,000 which represents almost 90 per cent of the total amount spent on women's refuges.</P>
    <P>Last year I approved the provision of additional resources for victims of domestic violence and for the appointment of additional social workers and child care workers to provide support to families in difficulty.  This included the provision of a capital grant of £60,000 for the purchase of a premises in Letterkenny for use as a women's refuge.  It also included the development of a new service providing accommodation for victims of domestic violence to be located at Castlebar.</P>
    <P>However, I remain concerned about the adequacy of services and supports available for victims of domestic violence and it is my intention that further improvements will be made this year in services for this particularly vulnerable group from the additional moneys set aside for the implementation of the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>Finally I might mention that my colleague Ms Joan Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare has arranged a seminar for 26 and 27 May to provide an opportunity for representatives of the various refuges to meet to discuss matters of mutual concern.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that VHI is appropriately structured to meet the challenges which will be posed by the forthcoming introduction throughout the European Union of the Single Market in health insurance.  I have therefore appointed, in December 1993, a VHI Review Group, chaired by Prof. David Kennedy, whose terms of reference include the provision of recommendations to me on the management structure which might be appropriate to VHI in the future.  I anticipate having the recommendations of the group before the end of June and I shall be discussing these with the board at that time.  In the discussions I shall be concerned to satisfy myself that the future management arrangements within VHI will be appropriate to the new environment in which it will operate and continue to equip VHI to provide its members with comprehensive and cost effective health insurance.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>At present in Ireland, mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women.  In order to be referred for mammography, it is only necessary for a woman to approach her general practitioner or consultant. Diagnostic mammography services are provided at 17 hospitals throughout <Col N="612" /> the country.  Most routine referrals and all urgent referrals are seen without undue delay and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.  Breast cancer survival rates are an important indicator of the effectiveness of treatment of breast cancer.  The newly established National Cancer Register will provide information which will assist in the evaluation of breast cancer survival rates.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, lays emphasis on the need for clinical audit.  This provides for a systematic review of the manner in which health care is provided from the individual's first point of contact with the service through to an assessment of the outcome of care which she or he has received.  The development of guidelines and protocols for the treatment of breast cancer by health professionals is an important facet of this process.</P>

      <P>This country is fortunate in having a first class hospital service staffed by highly trained professionals.  While the quality of care and treatment provided are already of a high standard, improvements continue to be made in the delivery of services to patients.</P>
      <P>A fundamental objective of Government policy is to ensure equitable access to necessary care.  This objective is being pursued first, through the operation of controlled admission arrangements and second, through the waiting list initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> The Deputy will also be aware that the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients was published to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of individual patients and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.  I am satisfied in general with the way in which health boards and hospitals have implemented the provisions of the Charter.  In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the Government undertook to review the effectiveness of the Charter so as to make any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patients' rights.  This work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I am committed to progress the whole area of service quality, from clinical outcome to patient satisfaction generally. In the new National Health Strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, I have brought forward a range of proposals to promote quality in all aspects of our health and personal social services.</P>
    <P>Three principles underpin the entire strategy: equity, quality of service and accountability.  As I have said, we enjoy a first rate hospital service which continues to improve.  It is important, however, to demonstrate effectiveness and value for money.  The strategy emphasises the constant measurement and evaluation of quality through clinical audit and consumer surveys and sets out new arrangements for improved legal and financial accountability.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, the Director of Value For Money Audit will be conducting two value for money audit projects in the health boards and health agencies.  I have appointed a liaison officer within my Department to facilitate and assist the Director in his investigations.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that elderly people receive the highest quality of health care available.  The objectives of health policy, towards the elderly are set out in the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i></P>
      <P>They are to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when elderly people can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities for service development at present are to strengthen community care services for elderly persons and their carers at home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals and to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to develop services for the elderly and their carers.  This extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine of the elderly in general hospitals, to increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists in the community and to develop services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>
      <P>The progress achieved in developing the health services for the elderly in line with the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> will be maintained.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government we will be developing a health service of the highest quality so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well looked after should they need medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> In the recently published Health Strategy, one of the priorities in relation to the elderly will be to strengthen the role of the general practitioner, the public health nurse, the home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people and their carers who live at home.  The target will be to ensure that not less than 90 per cent of those over 75 years of age continue to live at home.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September, 1993 is proving beneficial to elderly people in need of nursing home care. The Act has two principal objectives. First, it aims to ensure that all nursing homes which care for dependent elderly people will have a high standard of accommodation and care.  Second, it will assist financially dependent persons who need nursing home care and who cannot afford to pay nursing home fees.  The implementation of the Act is also another important step in honouring the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons in this country will be well cared for.</P>

      <P>The number of patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital is 1,510 as at 25 May, 1994.  The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned and is solely based on the patient's condition.  There are 110 patients on the &ldquo;very urgent&rdquo; waiting list and I have been informed by the Mater Hospital that these patients <Col N="619" /> usually undergo cardiac surgery within two months.</P>
      <P>The National Cardiac Surgery Unit does not operate a separate waiting list for private patients.  All cardiac surgery patients are treated as public patients at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit and are admitted in accordance with their medical condition.</P>
      <P>Patients may opt to attend a cardiothoracic consultant in a private capacity in a private hospital.  Private out-patient services are arranged by the consultant concerned outside of public commitment under the Common Contract.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital.  In addition, in 1993, I provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200-400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>The major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre is ongoing.  I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development which is nearing completion includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
      <P>This development, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of open heart surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends, in the course of the introduction of legislation to update the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to ensure an improvement in the standard of care and attention available to those suffering from mental illnesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper on the development services for the mentally ill and new mental health legislation was published in June 1992 and was circulated widely to provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views.  Approximately 100 submissions were received and have been examined by my Department to establish the broadest possible degree of consensus in relation to proposals for a new mental health Act.  It is my intention to publish a White Paper detailing the Government's decisions in relation to new legislation later this year.  My primary concern when drawing up this new legislation is to ensure that it will encompass the range of issues which will facilitate and promote the development of a modern, comprehensive health care system for the mentally ill.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper proposed that new legislation would oblige the Minister for Health to prepare and publish a code of practice for the psychiatric service.  The code which would be prepared in consultation with interested parties, would provide guidance in relation to the admission of patients with mental disorder to hospital and on good practice in the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorder.  The code would not have the force of law but it would establish what is recognised as good practice in the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the inspectorate of mental hospitals is a crucial part in the delivery of the psychiatric service.  Its annual report provides an objective account of the standards of accommodation and care provided in our mental health services.  Its reports have already been a major catalyst <Col N="623" /> in the improvement of standards of care with simultaneous advances in the quality of life of patients.  Under the new legislation I consider that the role of the inspectorate should be retained and expanded.  I would see it having the power to visit every place in which mentally ill persons are cared for &mdash; hostels, day centres as well as hospitals.  I would see other professions &mdash; psychiatric nurses, social workers, psychologists &mdash; playing a part in the inspectorate team.</P>
    <P>The recently published strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> includes important commitments in relation to the further development of the mental health services.  These include the provision over the next four years of a further nine acute departments of psychiatry attached to general hospitals and to integrate mental health and primary health services in particular through strengthening the role of general practitioners in the care of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>A Charter of Rights already exists for patients attending general hospitals setting out what patients have a right to expect when they receive treatment.  It is my intention to produce a similar charter for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>With the aim of evaluating the delivery of care to the mentally ill, my Department intends to support research on the effectiveness of health-care to those with long term mental illness.  The study will be conducted simultaneously in a number of countries of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Legal considerations include procedures to deal with the small proportion of people with mental illness who need to be admitted involuntarily for treatment by the psychiatric services.  Many issues are involved including a review of every decision to detain a patient for treatment, the criteria and procedures to be followed in detaining a mentally ill person, the length of such detention and safeguards to protect the right of mentally ill patients to give informed consent to treatment.</P>

Future policy in relation to the provision of a comprehensive family planning service has been addressed in the health strategy document &mdash;<i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i>  The strategy specifies that an accessible and comprehensive family planning service will be developed in each health board area on a phased basis by the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>The views of the various interests, including those of the association, will be taken into account in finalising the details of the plans.  However, all plans will have regard to the fact that the effective implementation of a comprehensive family planning service requires the involvement of the statutory and non-statutory sectors, in particular general practitioners who will continue to play a central role in the provision of family planning services at their centres of practice. Collaboration between all sectors is fundamental to the effective provision of comprehensive family planning services, and to provide choice of service provider for couples.</P>

      <P>The home help service is provided by health boards under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, which allows that health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance of people in their own homes.  By and large, the service is operated as a good neighbour scheme and is provided by volunteers who work on a part-time basis.  There are approximately 9,500 home helps operating in the health board areas as follows: Eastern Health Board, 2,920; Midland Health Board, 630; Mid-Western Health Board, 710; North-Eastern Health Board, 980; North-Western Health Board, 540; South-Eastern Health Board, 1,100; <Col N="628" /> Southern Health Board, 1,680; Western Health Board, 1,030.</P>

      <P>In recent years, an additional £9 million was made available to health boards to develop services for the elderly and their carers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in discussion with St. Vincent's Hospital regarding the development of the hospital's breast clinic facilities.  The further development of breast clinic services nationally is a matter for each individual health agency in the first instance, having regard to its competing priorities for development and the resources available.</P>
      <P>I have received no proposals from St. Vincent's Hospital regarding a national screening programme for breast cancer. The Deputies will be interested to learn, that my Department is supporting a major breast cancer screening programme underway at the Mater Foundation. This programme, the Eccles Breast Screening Programme, is part of a network of regional pilot schemes on breast cancer screening underway within the European Community.  The other countries are Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  The Irish study is being carried out in a defined catchment area i.e. north Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan representing both urban and rural populations.  All women in the catchment areas aged between 50 to 64 are eligible to attend.  Two screening units were established &mdash; one mobile &mdash; with the state-of-the-art equipment and staff trained specifically in mammography.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Eccles Breast Screening Programme are: to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women, to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women, and to compare the specificity, sensitivity and predictive value of the mammography screening programme with that reported internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The screened group will be compared <Col N="630" /> with a similar unscreened group from the Southern Health Board using information from the former Southern Tumour Registry &mdash; now the National Cancer Register.  The second round of screening is expected to be concluded by the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>The Eccles Breast Screening Programme is the first of its kind undertaken in this country.  As indicated in the new health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, national policy to be followed in this area will be guided and influenced by the experience gained through the pilot programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>In discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation in the context of the GMS review it was agreed that, in common with other developed countries, medicines are not always prescribed in the most effective manner in this country and that, accordingly, there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
      <P>Each doctor was, accordingly, encouraged to examine his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any available opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for all his-her patients.  To assist in this process doctors were provided with indicative drug targets which had been constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted on the basis of age and sex.</P>
      <P>The duty and obligation of individual doctors to provide the most appropriate management for each patient who presented and, in so doing, to utilise resources available for the optimum care of patients individually and collectively was emphasised by all parties to the scheme.  In this context the right of the doctor to prescribe as he-she considers necessary remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he-she can choose to prescribe.  As an incentive to doctors to embark on this review process the scheme provided that 50 per cent of all savings made by GPs on his-her target expenditure would be returned to the GPs for investment in agreed practice development.</P>
      <P>The end of year figures for expenditure on drugs and medicines in the GMS scheme in 1993 showed that expenditure in 1993 increased over the 1992 outturn figure by just 2.64 per cent, a significant improvement on the trend increase of an average of 11 per cent per annum which had been evidenced over the previous five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> The operation of the indicative target scheme resulted in savings amounting to £5.4 million being achieved by 645 doctors.  The amount of money involved means that on average savings of £8,000 were achieved by those doctors who were under budget.  Although this is just an average and the level of savings achieved by individual doctors varied enormously I am not aware of any individual practice in the Eastern Health Board area with savings of the order mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the scheme, half the savings made will be made available to the individual doctors concerned for practice development projects which receive the prior approval of the health board.  This resource will be allocated towards improving facilities within general practice for the purposes of providing a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.</P>
    <P>The operation of the indicative drug target scheme will be examined in the context of the forthcoming GMS review. The applicability of withholding tax to particular payments in this regard is a matter for determination by the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department has been in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners who have indicated that withholding tax will not apply to grants made under this scheme which adhere to guidelines which my Department has issued to all health boards.</P>

      <P>The reorientation which will be brought about by the health strategy is, clearly, a long term process which will affect the health services for many years to come.  Its implementation will begin immediately and I would expect major progress to be made within the four year period in terms of improving the overall effectiveness of the services.  The measures set out in the second part of the strategy document, i.e. the four year action plan, are specifically geared towards achievement in the 1994-1997 period.  I fully expect these measures to be implemented within that timeframe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of ear, nose and throat beds available in publicly funded acute hospitals at 31 December 1993 was 245.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the number of beds available for this specialty is sufficient to meet the needs of the population and that ENT facilities generally are sufficient to maintain the high level of throughput at present achieved within our hospital service.</P>
      <P>In relation to routine out-patient appointments for children to see ear, nose and throat surgeons in children's hospitals in Dublin, the position is that waiting times can very from approximately four months to 11 months.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of appointments is a matter for the consultant in the first instance.  However, I am informed by all the hospitals concerned that urgent cases are always accorded priority.</P>
      <P>My Department does not collect information in relation to waiting times for children attending consultants privately.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the Government's £20 million Waiting List Initiative in 1993 a sum of £3.32 million was specifically allocated in respect of ENT procedures.  Overall, an additional 5,120 ENT procedures were carried out countrywide.  This has resulted in a very significant reduction in the overall numbers of patients on ENT waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is also aware, a further £10 million has been provided in 1994 for a continuation of the Waiting List Initiative.  I am confident that significant progress will be made in 1994 in further <Col N="635" /> reducing the waiting times for ENT procedures for both adults and children.</P>

      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A policy for the Elderly</i> is the first official report to recommend comprehensive measures relating to the provision of respite places for the elderly.  The report emphasised the importance of additional day care places and respite facilities to offer carers a break from caring during the day or for short and regular periods of time.</P>
      <P>The overriding consideration in applying charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long term residential or respite care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. The statutory basis for the charges is provided by the Institutional Assistance Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards base the charges for respite care on the person's income.  In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to a person's individual circumstances.  Allowance is made for any commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left <Col N="638" /> to cover the person's needs.  Charges vary between health boards.  Obviously, any hardship arising from hospital charges are examined and are waived where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I might add that the whole area of long stay charges is presently under review. The recently published Health Strategy states that the legislation governing these changes will be amended to provide a clearer and fairer basis for these contributions towards the cost of long term maintenance.</P>

      <Col N="639" /> As the Deputy is aware, further funding has been provided in 1994 for a Waiting List Initiative and the Western Health Board has bid for additional funding in 1994 under this initiative.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present no official statistics on the prevalence of myasthenia gravis, which is not a notifiable disease.  I accept the need for priority to be given to the development of epidemiological data on <Col N="640" /> health needs in general, and this is one of the elements of the health strategy which I published recently.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses and there are no plans to extend the number of illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provides assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
      <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements meet the needs of persons who incur significant expenditure on drugs and medicines.</P>

      <P>I can, however, indicate that from a preliminary examination of the results of the 1993 indicative drug target scheme, it appears that savings by doctors were effected through a variety of measures. Most obviously, information available from the GMS payments board has indicated that there was a significant shift in prescribing towards an increased use of generic and less costly versions of drugs over the course of 1993.</P>

      <P>The child abuse prevention programme known as &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; is currently being introduced in national schools around the country with the active support of my Department, the Department of Education and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation process in individual schools involves three stages &mdash; teacher training, parent education and classroom lessons.  I understand from the organisers of the programme that 99.8 per cent of national schools in the country have availed of the offer of teacher training. Some 20,000 teachers took part in these training sessions.  It is estimated that by the end of the current school year over 75 per cent of schools will have held parent education meetings.  The programme has already been taught in approximately 50 per cent of schools nationwide.  In the Eastern Health Board area where the programme was introduced a year earlier than in other regions, <Col N="649" /> about 80 per cent of schools have used the Stay Safe lessons.</P>
    <P>The programme has been of enormous practical benefit in teaching children coping skills in the classroom context and in increasing community awareness generally of the problem of child abuse. While there has been some opposition to the programme, both my colleague, the Minister for Education, and myself are fully supportive of the programme.  We regard it as an important strategy for protecting children from all forms of abuse, including bullying by other children.</P>

      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his or her spouse.</P>
      <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled persons maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare and of the Ombudsman's views in this regard.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of disabled people living at home with their parents where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am, however, concerned that assessment of spouse's earnings is less favourable under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  My Department is currently examining the cost implications of bringing the method of assessing a spouse's earnings under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme into line with arrangements that apply to social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The C45 scheme for sub-contractors was introduced in 1970 to counter tax evasion in the building industry.  The sub-contract system has always been a feature of the building industry.  The 1970 legislation recognised this and sought to ensure that tax due from the sub-contracting section of the industry would be collected.  Forms C45 are completed by principal contractors on making payment to uncertified sub-contractors.  Where such payments are made the principal contractor must deduct tax at 35 per cent on the gross amount of the payment.</P>
      <P>The C45 system should not be availed of in situations where the employer/ employee rules should apply.  As part of their audit programmes the Revenue Commissioners seek to ensure that the C45 system is not used inappropriately. In view of recent concerns about the operation of the C45 scheme, the Revenue Commissioners have been more vigilant to ensure that there is no abuse of the system.  The Revenue Commissioners have also been asked to take measures to ensure that the system is applied only to genuine sub-contract situations and are having discussions with the Department of Social Welfare to see if procedures can be strengthened further.</P>

    <P>Arising from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> I have asked the black economy monitoring group &mdash; composed of employer, trade union, Revenue and Social Welfare representatives &mdash; to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system, to make recommendations on action to curb any abuses and to improve the system generally. <Col N="653" /> The group is due to report in July this year.  It would be inappropriate to introduce legislative changes dealing with C45s in advance of the black economy monitoring group's report.  Any legislative action should be based on full knowledge.  The group's recommendations will provide this knowledge following an in-depth review of the entire system.  Arising out of the review further consideration will be given to the need for legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>Protected status for the seal species is provided for in national, European and international legislation.  At national level the seal species is protected under the 1976 Wildlife Act and Dáil Éireann in affording that protection recognised the general status nationally of the species and the degree to which its conservation status was endangered or under threat.  As stated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 90 on 20 April 1994 &mdash; Volume 441 No. 6 columns 1341-1342 &mdash; it is unlawful to hunt, capture or kill such species except in accordance with licences or permissions issued under the 1976 Act.  I outlined the remedy available to fishermen where seals are causing damage to their nets.  Fishermen may apply for permission to kill seals which are causing damage at or to their nets and any such application will receive prompt attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, seal species are classified as protected fauna under Appendix III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the Berne Convention, which this country <Col N="654" /> ratified in 1982.  Under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Habitats Directive, seals are one of a number of species of Community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation, Annex II, and whose taking in the wild and exploitation may be subject to management measures, Annex V.</P>

      <P>Consultants were commissioned by the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council in February of this year to carry out a study on the conservation of the natural heritage in north west Mayo.  They have been asked to indicate whether part of that area would merit the status of national park as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.  Because of the scale of the area involved and the need for proper consultation with all the interested parties the study will take twelve months to complete. I, therefore, expect the consultants report to be ready by February 1995. A decision on the boundaries and the classification of the park in County Mayo will then be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works National Parks and Wildlife Service already owns approximately 5,000 hectares in this part of Mayo.  In addition to this and in parallel with the national park study, my officials are considering offers by landowners in north west Mayo to sell over 10,000 hectares of land for conservation <Col N="655" /> to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. A decision on the offer of these substantial holdings will be made shortly when the available finances have been reviewed.</P>

      <P>The site to which I believe the Deputy refers was held on lease by a limited company.  This company was dissolved on 17 January 1989.  In consequence the interest of the dissolved company vested in the Minister for Finance by virtue of the provisions of the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>The lease granted to the company was subject to the payment of a rent of £212 per annum.  The company had made subleases which in aggregate yielded almost £212 per annum.  In effect, therefore, the company collected the rents from the sub-leases and paid them to its landlord. In these circumstances I have waived the State's interest in the lease formerly held by the company in favour of the lessor, landlord.  Accordingly, the site referred to in this question does not now vest in the State.</P>

      <P>From April 1994, the social employment scheme, SES; the community employment development programme, CEDP; and the teamwork scheme were replaced by a new FÁS programme called community employment. Prior to the introduction of the community employment programme, participants in a social employment scheme could receive a rent or mortgage allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA; however, all the person's income was assessable.  This could result in loss of supplement on the basis of the person's means.</P>
      <P>Under the new community employment programme participants are entitled to receive secondary benefits and the higher rates of payment under the programme will not affect their entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Dublin area, that the person concerned went on to a social employment scheme in October 1993 and mortgage supplementation ceased because of the additional income from participation in that scheme.  I have asked the Eastern Health Board to review the applicant's entitlement to a <Col N="658" /> mortgage interest supplement under the conditions applying to the new community employment programme and to advise the applicant of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Kitchen porters employed in hotels and catering establishments outside of the County Borough of Dublin &mdash; i.e. Dublin city &mdash; and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire &mdash; as it previously existed &mdash; are covered by the Employment Regulation Orders &mdash; EROs &mdash; in respect of the Hotels Joint Labour Committee and the Catering &mdash; excl.  County Borough of Dublin and Borough of Dún Laoghaire &mdash; Joint Labour Committee.  These orders lay down statutory minimum rates of pay and certain conditions of employment for the categories of workers covered by them in the areas where they apply.  In addition a new Joint Labour Committee &mdash; JLC &mdash; covering catering establishments &mdash; excluding hotels &mdash; in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire was established by the Labour Court, on the application of SIPTU, with effect from 27 November <Col N="662" /> 1992.  This committee is currently considering proposals for an employment regulation order.  When these proposals are published and ratified by the Labour Court by making the required order, they will become legal minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the categories of catering workers covered in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire.  It will be a matter for the JLC to decide whether kitchen porters will be covered by the ERO.</P>
      <P>Under the existing Catering ERO the full minimum rate of pay for a general worker, which includes kitchen porters, employed for at least 12 months is £141.23 per week without board or lodgings. In the case of the Hotels JLC the current minimum rates for general workers &mdash; which is taken to include kitchen porters &mdash; not receiving board or lodgings ranges from £87.60 per week at 18 years of age to £138.72 at 20 years and over.</P>
      <P>Once an ERO is made for the new Catering JLC legal minimum rates of pay will apply to all catering establishments in the city and county of Dublin and to hotels in the county area.  Joint Labour Committees are established by the Labour Court usually on the application of either the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or individual unions.  It is a matter for the ICTU or individual unions to decide what geographical areas are to be covered when applying for the establishment of a new committee.  JLCs generally cover areas or sectors where there is a low level of unionisation.  The Hotels JLC was set up in 1965 on the application of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union &mdash; now part of SIPTU.  They only sought to have a committee set up to cover areas outside Dublin city, Cork city and Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the feeling among fishermen that seal predation, especially in relation to inshore nets, has increased in recent years.  In this regard the Department is considering undertaking a number of scientific studies to ascertain the current level of seal population around the Irish coast, and the migration patterns which, as indicated in the reply to which the Deputy refers, result in a significant increase in the seal population at certain times of the year. One of the studies being considered would also examine the economic effect of seal interaction with fishing activities.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the recent European Parliament resolution on this subject sponsored by Mark Killea, MEP has opened the way for EU funding of such studies.  Details of the aid are expected to be published shortly by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the migratory dimension of the problem, the general consensus is <Col N="665" /> that only a concerted approach by a number of countries would be likely to have any significant effect in the long term and the studies which are envisaged will help not only to quantify the problem but will also serve to highlight its international dimension.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's question as to whether seal migration and its effect on fisheries comes under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention, I am advised that this is not the case.  Consequently the prospect of the UK accepting responsibility in that context does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Great Gardens of Ireland programme which I announced recently is intended for garden restoration purposes only and cannot be used to fund the actual purchase of properties.  Such expenditure would not <Col N="667" /> be recoupable from European Funds. Kilmacurragh Gardens which were recognised as gardens of international importance in the last century are indeed a good example of the type of property whose restoration this programme was designed to assist.  I understand that the Irish couple, who purchased it some two years ago from Coillte Teoranta with a view to restoring the house and gardens, are about to put the property back on the market as they have been discouraged from proceeding with their plans by some local opposition.  I regret this development as I believe the present owners were committed to restoring these historic gardens and opening them to the public.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any other State Department or organisation which is in a position to purchase this property.  In circumstances in which future ownership is unclear, assistance cannot be pledged by the garden restoration programme which is designed to assist gardens where long term access by the public can be formally guaranteed.</P>

      <P>The film project &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; is scheduled to commence work in Ireland on 12 July 1994. It is expected that all work here will be concluded by mid-to-end October.  The concept of permanent employment is not one associated with films projects, which are once-off initiatives, but it is estimated that some 200 Irish personnel will be employed on the film between the crew and actors.  In addition, there will be employment for civilian extras together with some 1,500 members of An Fórsa Costanta Áitiúil, the Reserve Defence Forces.  Furthermore, the film project will involve the significant use of local services such as accommodation, car and truck rentals, horses and riding schools. These activities will have indirect employment effects and will involve substantial valued-added to the local and national economies.  It is estimated that a minimum of 15 million dollars will be spent on Irish employment and services while the film project is shooting here.</P>

      <P>While this is the case, I understand that the Hospital Committee of the European Union in collaboration with the standing committee of nurses in the European Union and the European Public Services Committee have commissioned research into this area.  I am informed that the preliminary, as yet unpublished, findings of this research indicate that nurse staffing levels in the Irish health services are comparable with those in other EU member states.  The findings also suggest that in relation to pay levels, hours worked, leave entitlements and other conditions of employment, Irish nurses compare favourably with their counterparts in other EU member states.  While any conclusions drawn must of course be tentative, this research does indicate that the employment conditions of Irish nurses are acceptable by international standards.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that the existing facilities for nurse training more than adequately meet current service needs.  The present system of nurse training is widely respected and recognised as being of an extremely high standard.  As the Deputy may be aware, An Bord Altranais is in the final stages of a comprehensive review of all aspects of nurse training and education.  As indicated in the recently published strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, it is my intention, following on the completion of the Bord <Col N="673" /> Altranais review, to proceed with a development in nurse education as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I am concerned at the level of speech therapy <Col N="674" /> services in certain areas of the country and I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  In 1993, almost £200,000 of the £1.5 million additional allocation for services for people with a physical disability was devoted to this service.  A further £1.5 million has been made available this year for services for people with a physical disability and I expect that a proportion of this allocation will be devoted to improving and expanding community-based therapy services, including speech therapy.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the inadequacy of the speech therapy services is the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists.  My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin commencing in the 1992-93 academic year.  The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy in the medium to long term.</P>
      <P>The review group on physical and sensory disabilities has been examining a range of services for people with physical disabilities, including speech therapy.  It is expected that the group will submit its final report within the next few months.</P>

      <P>Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, a full range of mental health services is available to all.  Under the Act, the admission of persons under 16 years of age is limited to voluntary admissions on the application of the person's parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>Mental health services for adolescents are generally provided in association with the child psychiatric services in child and family centres.  A family-centred approach is adopted and the vast majority of cases are dealt with on a non-residential basis.</P>
      <P>In the north Dublin catchment area there are at present four persons under the age of 16 years who are in need of in-patient residential treatment.  Such services are available from the following care facilities within the catchment: Warrenstown House, 14 places (including 7 for adolescents); Courthall, 8 places; James Connolly House, 8 places; Dromheath Avenue, 5 places; St. Paul's, Beaumont, (specialising in autism), 22 places.</P>
      <P>Admissions to Warrenstown House are prioritised, with emergencies being given priority over planned admissions. A review of the waiting list reveals that waiting times are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has operated a <Col N="677" /> scheme of special consideration for many years in the case of candidates who have disabilities.  This scheme is intended for candidates who have learned the knowledge to be examined but who would be impaired in communicating it to an examiner because of a physical or psychological disability.  Special consideration does not mean more lenient marking.  My Department's aim is to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment.  A range of facilities is available and these are tailored, as far as possible, to the needs of the individual candidates.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to a specific learning difficulty is that all applications for special consideration based on the existence of this condition are referred to the psychological service of my Department. Special consideration is approved where my Department's psychologists are satisfied that the condition is of such a degree that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers.  It is also approved where the examiner would have difficulty in deciphering the candidate's handwriting.</P>
      <P>A wide range of facilities is available in the case of a pupil who is impaired.  A candidate who is unable to read, or is effectively unable to read, may be allowed the service of a person who will read the questions.  A candidate who is unable to write, or is effectively unable to write, may be allowed the service of a scribe or the use of a mechanical aid such as a tape recorder, a typewriter or a word processor.  Extra time may be allowed where the candidate is unable to make adequate use of the services or aids allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facility which is afforded the majority of candidates who are impaired by specific learning difficulties is, however, simply to ensure that their answer books are marked by examiners who are experienced in marking the work of such candidates and in deciphering their handwriting.  These examiners will <Col N="678" /> ensure that full credit is given for all work done.</P>
    <P>In the particular instance adverted to, an application for special consideration on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty was made to my Department on 24 November 1993 by the candidate's school. Samples of the candidate's written work accompanied the application.  The application was referred to my Department's psychological service for consideration. Having evaluated all the available evidence and having taken into account that the candidate may have some specific learning difficulties, my Department's psychological service concluded that a regular examiner would be capable of reading his work.  Therefore, in the circumstances, special consideration is not warranted.</P>
    <P>Special consideration often consists of simply passing a candidate's scripts to an examiner who is used to deciphering poor handwriting.  As there was no need even for this, in the opinion of my Department's psychologists, the school was informed on 27 April that my Department was not prepared to grant special consideration in respect of this candidate.</P>
    <P>The existence of a specific learning difficulty does not automatically qualify a candidate for special consideration in examinations.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling they may not require the provision of any special facilities provided that they can read the question papers of the required level and write legibly and intelligibly.  Each individual case is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The teaching staff approved in any one year for vocational education committees is expressed in wholetime teacher equivalent units.  While the greater part of the staffing allocation is used to make permanent wholetime appointments, some of the allocation may be used only to make temporary or part-time appointments. This is necessary to give school managements the flexibility they need to plan their programmes and to cater for the broad range of subjects offered.  It is also necessary to take account of the effect on the annual staffing allocation of short term fluctuation in student numbers. Consequently, the vocational education committees may not fill a teaching post in a permanent capacity without the prior approval of my Department.  My Department, when considering applications for sanction to make permanent appointments, takes account of the curricular needs of the committee's scheme, the flexibility required to meet these needs, the approved teacher allocation, the number of permanent teachers already on the staff, the enrolment trends and planned rationalisation.</P>
      <P>An application was received from County Tipperary (North Riding) Vocational Education Committee for permission to make five permanent wholetime teaching appointments this year. This application has been considered in accordance with the general criteria I have mentioned and it has been decided that not more than three permanent wholetime appointments should be made.  The chief executive officer of the County Tipperary (NR) Vocational Education Committee has been advised accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> On the general question of the balance between permanent and non-permanent appointments, discussions will be held shortly, in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> with management and teacher interests with a view to agreeing a ceiling on the percentage of part-time teaching posts in post-primary schools and third-level colleges.</P>
