      <P>The innovativeness of this budget is illustrated by the Government's decision to extend the areas under the local development programme in the National Development Plan.  In the last 70 years or more the experience has been that centralised planning in relation to rural areas has not worked.  If proof is needed, one has only to look at the depopulation that has occurred in the west and other rural areas down the years.  To a large extent centralised planning has been the cause of rural decline. People who, with the best will in the world, had no appreciation of the difficulties on the ground, made decisions relating to rural areas.</P>
      <P>In this respect I warmly welcome the decision to double the sum for the Leader programme to £21 million. Experience of the first 12 pilot projects is that they have had a positive effect on areas neglected by State agencies, local communities and European agencies, areas that experienced unemployment and decline.  I do not believe the programme will solve all the ills of rural Ireland but it is certainly a considerable improvement on the previous position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £10 million to help reduce waiting lists in our hospitals.  We will never tackle waiting <Col N="1459" /> lists in various medical disciplines unless there is a sufficient number of people in these disciplines willing to work in the public sector.  Unfortunately, experience in recent times has been that this is not the case.  For example, the Southern Health Board recently advertised for a number of speech therapists.  Only four people applied and, the first three having turned down the position, the fourth person is now being asked if they wish to take it up.  Similarly, it is virtually impossible to persuade an orthodontist to work in the public sector.  There is a scarcity of people in these and other disciplines.  The way forward in this respect is for health boards to sponsor the education of a number of individuals in these areas and enter contracts of service with them for a period of five to ten years after they qualify.  This will be necessary if there is to be a meaningful reduction in waiting lists in the forseeable future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £5 million for tourism promotion.  Since Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 tourism has been a success story.  I will refer to my own county of Kerry which has been divided for the purposes of tourism marketing and promotion, with Shannon Development promoting the northern end of the county while Cork-Kerry Tourism promotes the southern end. That is unacceptable and is not in the best overall interests of the industry in Kerry.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the provision of £5 million for the GAA.  This has been criticised in some quarters and it has been suggested that the sum is equivalent to that which will be raised under the residential property tax.  However, Gaelic games are part of our culture and tradition, part of what we are, and in that respect this is a most welcome grant by the Government.  It is often forgotten that the investment in Croke Park by the GAA is in excess of £100 million.  Some people believe that this £5 million should not have been given to the GAA, that instead the residential property tax should be abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> In future when people stand up in this House to seek genuine tax reform they should remember the debacle that has occurred in regard to residential property tax.  There seems to have been what I can only describe as considerable hypocrisy in regard to this tax, which was first introduced by Fine Gael.  A property tax, not simply a residential property tax, but a property tax across the board was strongly advocated in this House in February 1988 by the then Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley. Yet we had Deputy Harney going on radio yesterday and stating that the Progressive Democrats, to use her words, &ldquo;never, never, never&rdquo; agreed, propagated or proposed a residential property tax.  Whatever about the merits or demerits of the tax, people on the Opposition benches have been less than honest in terms of their past policy on this issue.</P>
    <P>I fear that most of the assaults on the tax to date have not been motivated by the good of the general population, the economy, or the poorer sections in society but by pure political greed and opportunism.  In that context it is no wonder that there is considerable cynicism about politicians.  Many people do not believe what politicians say.  They believe that the promise of today is the U-turn of tomorrow and that the U-turn of tomorrow is merely a reneging of philosophy and ideals.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong need for politicians to re-establish their positions in the eyes of the public.  The only way to do that is to hold true to a philosophy and to tell the truth in relation to what one is going to do when one gets into power.  Opposition politics in the last number of years has descended to the level whereby any measure that is even remotely unpopular must be attacked irrespective of the fact that in the final analysis, it might be for the good of the community, that it might be required to assist the less well off in society, to bring about a balance within society.  This is something that we as politicians will have to rectify as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This has been an outstanding budget, but it has been clouded by marginal <Col N="1461" /> issues.  It has been vilified in terms of matters that are not central to its thrust and meaning.  This time next year this budget will be seen to have been one of the best ever introduced in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be said that seldom has there been a budget which has been so seriously misjudged by the commentators and punters.  The Minister, Deputy Ahern, had barely sat down when the &ldquo;orgy&rdquo; of praise from the experts began.  This was Bertie's bonanza, we were told, the biggest give-away budget for more than 25 years, a political masterstroke that was supposed to secure the political fortunes of the two parties in Government.</P>
      <P>If, as Harold Wilson remarked, a week is a long time in politics, then the two weeks since the budget must have seemed like an eternity to Minister Ahern and his Cabinet colleagues as what they believed to be their carefully crafted budget began to come apart at the seams. I warned at the time that this was a budget with a hundred stings in its tail, and as people have had the opportunity to look beyond the public relations hype and examine the small print they have begun to realise that for every small thing that Bertie gave, Bertie also took something away; that in the majority of cases people were no better off than before and that in many cases people will be considerably worse off.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times</i>-MRBI poll confirms that the people have not been taken in and are viewing the budget with a jaundiced eye.  Seventy-three per cent of those polled believed that their living standards would remain static as a result of the budget, 16 per cent thought that their living standards would fall and just 7 per cent &mdash; most of whom were probably farmers &mdash; believed that their living standards would rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year after its election this Government is already beginning to show signs of stress and strain.  The pathetic attempts by Fianna Fáil and Labour to blame each other for the residential property tax fiasco brings back memories of the worst episodes of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition <Col N="1462" /> of the 1980s.  However, it is not just the budget.  There are clear signs of panic in the Government in regard to the promised referendum to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce with suggestions from Labour backbenchers that the poll should be further postponed. It would probably be premature to start forecasting the demise of the Government, although it may be asleep, as the Minister opposite seems to be, but these developments, coupled with the fact that Fianna Fáil Ministers, up to the most senior level, made so little effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many features of this budget that are objectionable or unsatisfactory that it is hard to know where to begin.  The item which has attracted the most political and media attention has been the decision to extend the scope of the residential property tax &mdash; a measure which, when compared to other provisions, is relatively minor.  One of the more extraordinary features of the budget debate has been the way in which the Labour Party backbenchers, in particular, have built up a head of steam about the extension of the residential property tax, while they have totally ignored other provisions &mdash; such as the decision to tax unemployment benefit and abolish pay related benefit &mdash; which will have far wider and more severe consequences <Col N="1463" /> for a much greater number of people.  They have also ignored the move to means test widows' pensions.</P>
    <P>During the past two weeks a procession of Labour Party backbenchers have expressed concern about the decision to extend the scope of the residential property tax.  Yet when the order to begin taxing unemployment benefit was put last Wednesday not one Labour Party backbencher contributed to the debate, the decision was stoutly defended by the Labour Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, and the Labour Party trooped into the lobbies without a problem with Fianna Fáil to impose this new welfare cutback.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the residential property tax in principle.  I share much of the criticism of the decision to extend the scope of the residential property tax, but I wonder about the priorities of the Labour Party.  The yield from the extension of the residential property tax will be £5 million, while the annual yield from the new tax on the unemployed will be six times that, £30 million.  Here is a measure that will take a further £30 million out of the pockets and purses of those on low incomes, yet it does not even produce a murmur of dissent from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The media coverage of the budget has been unbalanced in regard to these two issues.  The extension of the residential property tax has received lavish coverage, yet the decision to extract a further £30 million from those on low incomes has hardly rated a mention.  The residential property tax has been a running item on the Gay Byrne radio programme virtually every day since the budget.  In last Saturday's newspapers there was a full page in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the property tax, two pages in <i>The Irish Press</i> and the best part of two pages in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I lost track of the number of pages in the Sunday papers devoted to the residential property tax, but one would have to look very hard to find even a few paragraphs on the taxation of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Journalists seem to have understood <Col N="1464" /> the likely impact of the decision on residential property tax &mdash; presumably because many of them will be directly affected by it &mdash; yet they seem to have totally failed to appreciate the significance of the decision to tax unemployment benefit for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The principle of treating welfare payments as taxable income could only be acceptable in the context of full integration of the tax and social welfare systems and a substantial increase in the basic level of welfare payments and the exemption limits for the tax net.  In the absence of that sort of fundamental reform, it is a further unjust and unfair penalisation of those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The media and political pressure on the residential property tax has clearly spooked the Government and Ministers Ahern and Spring have been beating a hasty retreat.  Hardship cases, we are told, will be looked at.  Guarantees are being offered that the tax will not be extended further and that the property values and income threshold will be index linked to ensure that no more people will be drawn into the net.  Can we now look forward to similar concessions for the unemployed?  Will there be guarantees that there will be no further extension of taxation on welfare benefits?  Will the Minister promise to look at the many cases of hardship that will arise from this decision and the decision to means test widows' and widowers' pensions?  I doubt it, because the unemployed do not have political clout, they do not have the sort of access to the newspapers and the airwaves that property owners have.  Fianna Fáil and Labour seem to have virtually written off those on social welfare, especially the unemployed, and believe that they can be re-elected without their support.</P>
    <P>A number of other social welfare changes in the budget were equally objectionable. In the usual devious way the Government introduced a reform which had been demanded for many years &mdash; the introduction of a widower's pension &mdash; but used this as a cover for the introduction of another social welfare cutback, <Col N="1465" /> the means testing of widows' pensions, and to add insult to injury they have tried to pass it off as an &ldquo;equality&rdquo; measure.</P>
    <P>From October 1994 widowers will qualify for a contributory pension on the same basis as widows.  However, the sting in the tail is that in future after a year of drawing a pension, widows and widowers whose income is over £16,000 will lose the entire pension, and those who earn between £12,000 and £16,000 will have it reduced.  Since the average male industrial earnings is now around £15,600 per annum, many widowers will not qualify, but many new widows who would previously have been entitled to a full pension will now lose out &mdash;&ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The change has a number of extremely serious and damaging implications which have received little attention to date in the saturation coverage given to the residential property tax.  It strikes yet another blow against the principle of social insurance, namely, that by paying PRSI contributions workers built up entitlements which are not means tested.  It also strikes a blow against the principle of equality for men and women, namely, that members of the disadvantaged sex should have their position improved, as opposed to &ldquo;levelling down&rdquo; those whose position is better off.</P>
    <P>This move will also create serious difficulties for funding many occupational pension schemes which are currently integrated with the social welfare schemes and provide survivors pensions by &ldquo;topping up&rdquo; the contributory State provision.  These schemes will either have to increase contribution levels to maintain existing levels of cover for widows, or reduce the level of cover for survivors in future.  Either way employers and-or PAYE workers are faced with additional costs or reduced benefits.</P>
    <P>In general, the social welfare increases in the budget were minimalist and it followed on the pattern of cut backs started by the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in 1992.  Much was made by Minister Ahern of the decision to increase disability benefit and unemployment <Col N="1466" /> benefit by 10 per cent, which represents an increase of just £5.40.  But against this, pay-related benefit for all new claimants has now been abolished which represents a loss of up to £16.80 for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit was supposed to act as a cushion for those who lost their jobs or who could not work through illness to help them adjust from paid earnings to social welfare benefits.  Now this is all gone.  People who are earning substantial amounts and who lose their jobs will have to survive on just £61 per week. The abolition of pay-related benefit further undermines the whole insurance based social welfare system.  Workers are required to continue paying PRSI at a high rate, but the benefits they were once entitled to are gradually being taken away or devalued.</P>
    <P>The general level of increases in social welfare payments were quite inadequate. The policy of increasing payments in line with inflation can only be acceptable if the basic rates are adequate, but this is not the case.  While the rates have finally moved towards the priority levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare which were regarded as being urgent back in 1986.  However, the rates are still well below the minimum adequate income levels set by the commission in that year.</P>
    <P>The derisory level of the increases speak for themselves; an additional £2.10 for a contributory old age pensioner and £3.40 for a pensioner with a dependant over the age of 66.  The figures for non-contributory pensioners are even worse &mdash; increases of £1.80 and £2.90 respectively. These same miserable increases are applied to many of the lowest rates such as unemployment assistance or the carer's allowance.  The increase of 40p per week for a child of a person on disability or on unemployment benefit would barely pay for a bottle of milk.</P>
    <P>Of course, while cutbacks like the taxation of unemployment and pay-related benefit come into effect in April, the date for payment of the miserable increases &mdash; which were once paid in April &mdash; have <Col N="1467" /> been pushed back further and further and will not be paid until late July.</P>
    <P>The budget shows no progressive reform strategy in regard to social welfare. On budget day, the National Economic and Social Forum &mdash; established with much hype by this Government &mdash; produced a report listing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which it regarded as &ldquo;needing immediate action&rdquo;.  Yet virtually every one of the 13 recommendations listed by the forum were ignored by the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In a year in which the Minister for Finance went into the budget against the most favourable fiscal background for two decades, those on social welfare had a right to expect measures to substantially improve their position.  But, once again, the majority of those on welfare have been passed over, forgotten or penalised.</P>
    <P>Having little interest in the unemployed or others on social welfare, the Government clearly hoped that the major selling point of this budget would be the changes in taxation.  The most significant of these was the removal of the 1 per cent income levy, but the Government deserves no praise for eventually removing a levy that should never have been imposed in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The other tax reliefs were very minor and, particularly in Dublin, have to be balanced against the impact of the residential property tax and the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Mr. Smith, to compel the three new Dublin county councils to impose service charges.</P>

      <P>I do not consider the extension of the residential property <Col N="1468" /> tax to be the most important feature of this budget, but I accept that it will be a further imposition on many families who are by no means wealthy and who are already paying heavily through PAYE. The combined impact of the residential property tax and the new service charges means that many families will have to pay an additional £200 or more this year.</P>
      <P>Relatively modest suburban homes in Dublin will now be included in the net for the residential property tax.  These are homes on which families may already be making heavy mortgage repayments. They may have been bought for considerably less and increased in value over the years.  The value of a home is a factor over which a family very often will have little or no control.  An area may suddenly become fashionable and houses will appreciate in value, although this will be of no benefit to the family concerned unless they decide to sell &mdash; the family would then have to purchase another house &mdash; yet now they will be subject to this property tax.</P>
      <P>Again, it will be largely the PAYE sector who will be liable for this tax because the self-employed can, with the help of their advisers and accountants, artificially massage their incomes downward. The Revenue Commissioners claim to have identified only 5,000 self employed people who earn more than £25,000 per year, yet the self employed include many of the highest paid professions, doctors, lawyers, solicitors and so on.</P>
      <P>These figures are clearly a joke.  One would round up the best part of 5,000 self employed people earning more than £25,000 at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.</P>

We have no problem with the principle of a tax on property, but why is it that when Fianna Fáil decide to impose a tax on property, the only property levied is the family home?

      <P>In the 1970s we had a wealth tax; Fianna Fáil abolished it.  In the late 1970s we had a resource tax; Fianna Fáil not only abolished it but repaid it.

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very unruly and he does not like to hear the truth.  The yield from tax on disability and unemployment benefits in a full year, will approach £50 million, yet the total tax take from farmers in 1991 amounted to just £36 million and, in 1992, to just £48 million.</P>
      <P>People who will in future pay tax on their unemployment and pay related benefits have in many cases, been paying tax at a rate of 48 per cent.  The tax take from farmers has been little more than a joke, yet they received further generous concessions in this budget.  Between 1989 and 1992 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £3,122 to £3,622. This represents an increase of 17 per cent, more than twice the rate at which wages and salaries increased over the same period.  At the same time the average tax paid by farmers fell by 9.3 per cent.  Now the average tax paid by farmers is less than one-fifth of that paid by the average PAYE worker.  Any Government with even a token commitment to the principle of tax equity should be seeking to extract a fairer contribution from farmers rather than tightening the financial noose on already heavily taxed PAYE workers who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While they get away with little more than nominal tax payments, the leaders of the farming organisations continually complain.  They have been among the most vociferous critics of the public sector pay increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but do not tell us how well the <Col N="1472" /> farmers have done.  Between 1987 &mdash; when the first <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was agreed &mdash; and 1992, the public sector pay bill increased by approximately 32 per cent.  In the same period the value of grants and subsidies paid to the agricultural sector increased from £191 million to £464 million, an incredible increase of £273 million or 143 per cent.  If Messrs. Tom O'Dwyer and John Donnelly want to improve relations between farmers and workers they will need to be honest and open and show more willingness to pay their fair share of taxation.  They do no service to small farmers who subsist at proverty levels by continually comparing their position based on the income of ranchers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest single shortcoming of the budget is its failure to come up with even a single, significant initiative to put more people back to work.  There is a whole range of new tax concessions for business and industry but no evidence to suggest that they will be any more effective in promoting job creation than the scores of tax concessions and allowances already in place.  With unemployment hovering almost permanently around the 300,000 mark any budget that fails to make job creation its absolute priority must be regarded as unsatisfactory and a betrayal of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We were told there would be a major new job/training scheme with 40,000 places but all we got was a merger of the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Training schemes have their place but are no substitute for job creation.  With a majority of almost 40 this Government has the authority and mandate to take the decisive steps necessary to tackle unemployment, our biggest social and economic problem. However, rather than prompting the Government into action, the size of its majority seems simply to have induced an even greater sense of indifference and lethargy around the Cabinet table.</P>
      <P>Continuing unemployment is wreaking a terrible social and economic toll and cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope that in the coming year unemployment will receive the same energy, attention and commitment as the residential property tax in recent days, or Northern Ireland over the past year.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I want to address one other issue, the subject of a deliberate attempt by Ministers who deal with social welfare to mislead this House.  I refer to the silence on women's social welfare arrears, the manner in which the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods and his Minister of State, Deputy Bruton, have deliberately denied women not alone their right to claim but even the necessary information to submit a claim for the alleviation payments to which they are entitled as a result of the decision taken in the European Court.</P>

      <P>The capital allocation for the housing programme has been increased by 95 per cent to £129 million to enable housing authorities to meet their objectives for 1993 and 1994.  This is the largest ever increase, clear proof that the house building programme is a priority for the Labour Party and that the commitment to tackle the housing waiting list is a major objective in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dublin city councillor I welcome the news that Dublin Corporation is being allocated 500 houses by the Department of the Environment which will enable the corporation to continue the <Col N="1476" /> house building drive started in 1993 and bring to 1,000 the number of houses provided by Dublin Corporation in 1993-94. When the house building programme was halted, as a result of the cutbacks in 1987 and the following years, the numbers on the waiting lists in Dublin city rose rapidly with all the hardship that entailed for families living in overcrowded conditions. The maintenance of this housing drive over the period of the Programme for Government can substantially solve the housing needs of Dublin city.  I welcome the additional £2.5 million for the remedial works scheme and the provision of £3 million for the replacement of defective windows.  Many of Dublin's old and, indeed, not so old flat, complexes need to be upgraded.  The Swan's Nest Court flat complex in Kilbarrack in my own constituency immediately comes to mind.</P>
    <P>The doubling of the funding for the task force on housing aid for the elderly by an extra £2 million will enable considerable progress to be made.</P>
    <P>The 1994 budget clearly reflects the strong and continued commitment by the Labour Party to the health services with a 9 per cent increase over the 1993 health budget and is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to developing a first class health service.  The successful initiative by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to reduce hospital waiting lists in 1993 is being built on and a further £10 million is being provided this year to make further inroads to this area.  The £6 outpatient charge for attendance at hospitals is being abolished and this will reduce the cost of hospital services to patients.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £100,000 to voluntary organisations to improve transport arrangements for people with disabilities, particularly for adapting vehicles to facilitate easier transport.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision of extra funds to the health boards who, for many years, had large debts which affected their payments to suppliers, and, indeed, the efficiency of the health services.</P>
    <P>This budget provides substantial relief for all income earners.  The abolition of <Col N="1477" /> the 1 per cent levy, the raising of tax free allowances by £350 for a couple and the increase in the standard rate band by £1,050 means that a couple on £25,000 per year will gain £640; a couple on £30,000 will gain £690 and a couple on £40,000 will gain £790.  Radical improvements have been announced for workers on low pay.  It has been stated that 63 per cent of the workforce earn less than £10,000 per annum.  The 2.2 per cent health and employment levies have been abolished for all workers earning up to £9,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general increases in social welfare benefits and the further increases in disability and unemployment benefit as well as increases in child benefit with a payment of £25 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>
    <P>Education has benefited because of the provision of an additional £7 million with £5 million available for the post-primary school building programme.</P>
    <P>Above all, this budget is pro-jobs, it supports work and gives people an opportunity to become economically independent. I welcome the provision of £100 million credit for small businesses and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not worry about Labour in Dublin South Central. We are concentrating on it and I am confident that we will get support.  There has been considerable turbulence in <Col N="1478" /> respect of the budget during the past few days but it should not be allowed to obscure the good points, many of which will become apparent to the average taxpayer on 6 April when the tax free allowances and tax adjustments in the budget will show in their pay packets.  The 1 per cent income levy has also been abolished, as promised, despite scepticism in some quarters.  The Government deserves credit and recognition for doing that and I hope that some of the sceptics will be prepared to admit that they got it wrong and that their judgment was wrong.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to reiterate all the good points of the budget already referred to by my colleagues, beyond saying it is very progressive.  Deputy Seán Kenny referred to the housing allocation for the city of Dublin.  We are talking about 1,000 extra houses being built there since the Government assumed office.  That is a major advance in dealing with a very serious housing problem.  It is right and proper that the Government, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, are given credit for their efforts.</P>
      <P>Tremendous progress has been made in reducing hospital waiting lists.  By any standards a major advance has been made over the past 12 months as there has been a 57 per cent reduction.  We must recognise, as Deputy O'Donoghue said earlier, that there are serious structural problems in dealing with some of the waiting lists relating to the availability of an adequate number of people with expert knowledge, particularly in the case of orthodontics.  Orthodontists are paid large amounts of money in a very competitive market and it is very difficult to get them to work in the public service. I have no doubt that problem will also be tackled and major advances have been made in that area.  An extra £10 million is being provided this year for those awaiting treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased a crash programme has been developed which will ensure that every house which needs a bathroom will get one.  It is unacceptable that there are still houses in the city of <Col N="1479" /> Dublin &mdash; and indeed in my own constituency &mdash; which do not have a bathroom. I am pleased that action is being taken to ensure that problem is rectified.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to get the significance of the residential property tax out of proportion as the expected yield will be £5 million.  However, it would be foolish to underestimate or ignore the extent of the adverse public reaction.  It is a particular problem in Dublin, especially in middle class areas.  I welcome the approach adopted by the Minister for Finance.  He has made a commitment to examine cases of hardship and, indeed, to make modifications which may be necessary to deal with some aspects of the budget.  We have to realise that in the last analysis politics is the art of the possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>For Labour it is the art of the U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be foolish for politicians to ignore the fact that there has to be a certain degree of public acceptance of any taxation proposals introduced.  In the last analysis the public will call the shots.  We should not be under any illusions about resistance to the introduction of any tax on property.  A series of taxes on property over the years has met with considerable resistance and most were subsequently dropped.  We had a land tax, a wealth tax and a resource tax and all have gone by the wayside.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that experts who write reports for the NESC and so on should make the case in support of the introduction of property tax in discussing taxation policy and policies to stimulate employment.  However, if there is to be public acceptance of property tax a considerable education programme must be undertaken to explain to the public the logic behind the recommendations made by various expert groups.  It would be foolish to ignore the information gap or to think the writing of expert reports is all that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget will help in making considerable <Col N="1480" /> progress towards creating employment, but it would be wrong to underestimate the extent of the problem or to suggest that it can be easily solved. Some of the taxation changes introduced are a welcome step in the right direction. To deal effectively with unemployment it is essential to change and to be innovative. I heard various experts talking about unemployment concentrating almost exclusively on taxation as a way forward.  Taxation has a role in the genesis of the solution to unemployment but it is not the full story and it is wrong to create that impression.  More effort should be put into trying to stimulate new ways of tackling problems, to come up with new products and inventions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister to modify the VAT being charged on scientific equipment in laboratories and research institutes.  That is a small but welcome change and it is particularly appropriate that it should come now when there is concern in the scientific and research world about the effect VAT is having on the purchase of equipment. This is particularly relevant in the case of the £5 million or £6 million which comes here from the Wellcome Research Institute.  As far as we are concerned that is money for nothing.  The British based Wellcome institute provides the money for research into many serious illnesses. This money makes a major contribution to the welfare of humanity apart from the fact that it makes an important contribution to our economy.  I hope the Minister will go all the way and allow all the VAT to be recouped.  There is a degree of concern in the scientific world that it may only be possible to recover VAT on instruments and equipment which cost more than £20,000.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the small amount of money made available to fund scientific research.  If we are to make progress we must build up scientific and technological capacity and that can only be done by investing in research and by developing capacity in the universities, the research institutes and the various other organisations involved in research and development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> I welcome the prospect of the establishment of a scientific review body. However, considerably more than reviews are required.  We need to improve morale in the scientific world. Many Irish scientists are concerned about the road we are going down.  I regret that a leading Irish scientist, Professor Fitzgerald, who worked in the Mater Hospital employing 30 people in his laboratory has announced that he intends to return to the US.  A report to that effect appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> a few weeks ago.  It is very important to lay down the scientific infrastructure to ensure that people of the calibre of Professor Fitzgerald and others in the scientific world will continue to work here.  It is good for the country.  It trains Irish scientists and medical researchers and it helps to maintain standards in Irish medicine and in industry.  That is a very important long term aspect of investment in science and technology.  I accept that the returns are not immediate or short term but we have to remember that many of the people who now lead Irish industry started off as research workers and many as engineers.</P>
    <P>One might wonder why an engineer should become a general manager of a big company.  One reason is because the scientific background and training puts the person with that knowledge in a position to take up leadership roles.  It is important in the context of our natural resources such as agriculture, fish and forestry and of the computer and the pharmaceutical industries that we be able to provide the background of research and development capacity so that when multinational companies consider where to locate they will choose Ireland as a place with a highly educated young workforce which also has a powerful scientific and technological infrastructure, which is not the case at the moment.  It is important to move in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was dull, lacking in inspiration, and boring.  It has become more interesting since it was delivered but for reasons the Minister for Finance had not anticipated and certainly <Col N="1482" /> would not like.  There were a great many trailers in advance of the budget &mdash; we were told there was more money for the Minister to give away than in the past 20 years and to that extent it would be a good budget.  Part of the trouble was that it was too well leaked.</P>
      <P>We take on board many things from the British but often we take the worst in their system.  On budget day it is traditional for the Minister for Finance to be photographed with his briefcase on the plinth outside Leinster House &mdash; aping the Chancellor of the Exchequer carrying his Gladstone bag.  It is a pity, however, we do not follow their example in other respects.  In 1947 or 1948, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Hugh Dalton, on his way to the House of Commons to read his budget speech replied in the negative to a question on it from a news vendor outside a tube station.  The news vendor, quite fittingly, was news conscious and rang an evening paper, I think it was the <i>Evening News</i>, and gave them the story which appeared in the newspaper before the Chancellor had reached it in his budget speech.  He offered his resignation which was accepted.  The Minister for Finance would have had to offer his resignation or be sacked if such a procedure had been followed here prior to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor contributing to the boredom is the widespread use of scripts. Sir, as you know, when the Minister reads his Budget Statement, his speech is circulated to Members in the Chamber and it is possible for them to read ahead.  That practice should be abolished except in the case of the leaders and spokespersons of the Opposition parties who have to respond immediately.  Indeed, there is an argument for giving them more advance notice as they have the most difficult job. The fact that we can read the script takes from the sense of occasion and the element of surprise.  Generally, I am in favour of limiting the use of scripts in the House.  I have seen colleagues &mdash; in all parties &mdash; reading from scripts, but when they appear on a platform down the country they make electrifying speeches.  If <Col N="1483" /> this practice was curtailed it might have the additional advantage of attracting more journalists to the press gallery instead of relying on scripts or watching the monitor.</P>
    <P>The most controversial issue in the budget is the residential property tax.  As pointed out time and again this tax will apply mainly to houses in Dublin but also in Galway and Cork.  The professionals have calculated that up to 40 per cent of households in Dublin will be affected.  It will affect people in my constituency, in the Castleknock and Porterstown area, and to a lesser extent in Lucan and Palmerstown. I acknowledge that this is a matter of concern for me as well as for a number of others.  My concern and opposition to the residential property tax is added to by the fact that in recent days we have heard about another imposition &mdash; service charges.  Members who do not represent Dublin constituencies may argue, with some justification, that service charges are imposed in other areas and that it is unfair that that was not the case in Dublin.  Equally, Members representing Dublin constituencies can argue that residential property tax is unfair because of the house values in Dublin and that it is a double imposition. We know that councillors in the three new county councils in the Dublin area did not want to impose service charges but were forced to do so because the Government did not honour the commitment it gave in the Programme for Government that it would reorganise local government and rationalise its financial aspects.  That has not happened and explains why councillors in Dublin have been forced by the Minister to impose these service charges.  This is unfair on the councillors because it is the responsibility of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax is unfair because it is another imposition on middle income earners, particularly those in the PAYE category.  They shoulder most of the burden of taxation in this State and are now being asked to shoulder an additional burden.  The Minister <Col N="1484" /> of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, commented on this matter.  She commented on a great many matters recently &mdash; I will refer to that at a later stage.  She said she favoured a provision whereby families could have their residential property tax deducted from their wages in line with the PAYE system as many people &ldquo;could not afford the lump sum payment&rdquo;.  If they cannot afford the lump sum payment they are hardly in the category of the rich whom socialists should soak.  Socialists should not tax people who cannot afford to pay it in a lump sum.  Why is there a need to pay the tax in instalments if people can afford to pay it in a lump sum?  It is also an acknowledgment that the PAYE sector will again be soaked.</P>
    <P>Instead of crucifying this section of the community once again could other sources of revenue be found?  The Minister of State was among those most critical of recent rezoning decisions in Dublin, particularly in both her and my constituency and of the fact that certain developers and landowners lucky enough to have had the support of a majority of councillors on the old Dublin County Council made millions of pounds.  I do not think any section of the community should be soaked in terms of taxation but if any section is to be these are the people from whom the much needed money should be raised.</P>
    <P>Lloyd George, on the question of reparations following the First World War, said that his policy was to squeeze Germany until the pips squeaked.  It would appear that the attitude of this Government is to squeeze the PAYE worker until the pips squeak.  It is time this stopped; it has gone too far.  The so-called coping classes have had enough and we are fast reaching the stage when they will no longer be able to cope.</P>
    <P>The budget was supposed to mark the beginning of the process of tax reform. The Minister for Finance, told us: &ldquo;residential property tax, as extended, was a modest measure of equality in the tax system.  The extension would contribute to tilting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment&rdquo;.  Dan <Col N="1485" /> McLoughlin, an economist with Riada Stockbrokers, described the new tax on property as flawed in virtually every index of taxation.</P>
    <P>We are reminded every day that this Government has the largest majority in the history of the State.  Other Governments who did not have this luxury had to reconsider unpopular measures because there was a possibility they would not be able to get them through the House.  The Government does not have that problem. If the Government was committed and determined to do anything it has the foot soldiers to get it through.  Everyone recognises that the rebalancing of the taxation system, to use that euphemism, is likely to be unpopular but if this is to be done it will be done by a Government with a large majority.  It showed a lack of commitment and sincerity on the part of the Government that when it started to tackle the issue it withdrew as soon as there was the slightest criticism.  The Government, therefore, can be criticised in two respects: for the way it sought to introduce the measure and for the way it withdrew when criticism was expressed from the backbenches.  This does not augur well for what is likely to happen when other measures unrelated to the budget have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister that the residential property tax will not be increased in later years and that there is no intention to change it.  However, bearing in mind the promises and the denials prior to the last election as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, there is a lack of credibility. I presume that when the Minister says there is no intention to change the tax he means there is no intention to change it at present.  Deputy Callely got it right, unintentionally, last night when he said on television, &ldquo;It is a banana skin the Government is prepared to change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tinkering with the property tax will not do; it must be scrapped.  The coping classes cannot be allowed to cope on their own.  Too much is being imposed on the PAYE sector and this cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State at <Col N="1486" /> the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, dealt with housing.  I welcome the additional provision for housing and the increase in the number of local authority houses but there has been an increase in demand.  Last September the Department admitted that there were more than 28,000 families in need of housing.  That represented an increase of 23 per cent since 1991.  Therefore, additional money was needed.</P>
    <P>Are we aware of the extent of the problem?  Having read speeches and statements made during the years and assessed the position in relation to housing in this city and elsewhere in recent months I have come to the conclusion that the extent of the problem is not recognised or realised.  Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment asking him to undertake a survey of the housing stock.  In his reply he referred me to the survey carried out in 1990.  That is a worthwhile document but it is very inadequate.  Indeed, it refers to its own inadequacies.  Twenty-four per cent of the houses included in the sample were not surveyed.  The occupiers of 35 per cent of these refused to admit the surveyors to their homes.  No reasons were given but I suggest that they were reluctant to allow people into their homes because of the condition of the houses. Therefore, it is an imperfect survey.</P>
    <P>It is also imperfect when it comes to the definition of &ldquo;fitness&rdquo;.  The definition reads as follows: &ldquo;A housing unit should be taken as fit unless it is considered to be a danger or a health hazard to the occupants&rdquo;.  That is a wide and subjective definition.  A proper house condition survey which would form the basis for a concentrated attack on unfit housing in both the private and public sector is required.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Seán Kenny of the Labour Party welcomed the fact that all local authority housing will have proper doors and windows.  Big deal &mdash; in 1994 all local authority housing should have adequate doors and windows.  We welcome the fact that money is to be made available but the amount is not sufficient. In this city, as admitted by Deputy <Col N="1487" /> Upton, there are people living in houses which do not have internal WCs.  This is a scandal and I do not think any Minister should take credit for dealing with this problem.  It is a scandal that successive Governments and councils allowed this to continue.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for housing was of great interest and one word that was not mentioned in it, was the word &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;. Are there no homeless people in Dublin and the rest of this State?  Are people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin and our other cities?  One would not think so from the Minister's speech.  The reality is different.  In <i>The Star</i> of Thursday, 13 January 1994 the following extract from a report by Focus Point was printed:</P>
    <P>In the first six months of 1993, there were more than 280 homeless youths in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Most were aged 16 to 17 &mdash; and more than one third of them had previously been in care...</P>
    <P>Hostels are full to capacity, often by 3 p.m. and the use of bed and breakfast as emergency accommodation is growing rapidly...</P>
    <P>More than 6,000 people use adult hostels in Dublin yearly; 329 people per month sought accommodation from Focus Point last year, a rise of 129 compared to 1990.  Nearly half were women and two thirds of them under 30;</P>
    <P>Adult hostels in Dublin accommodate 700 adults per night and are always full.</P>
    <P>Focus Point Director, Maureen Lynnott, said people were remaining homeless for an increasing length of time with the result that more were becoming caught in a &ldquo;cycle of homelessness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was not a mention of that report in the Minister's speech, although this is supposed to be a caring budget and we have a caring Labour Minister for housing and a so-called caring administration. Not only is no help offered to the homeless, <Col N="1488" /> it is not even worth the Government's while to make a reference to them.  It is no wonder that people despair when they read such articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, better known as the Minister for poverty, is also responsible for tax reform.  I take no pleasure in criticising Deputy Burton, a constituency colleague, and it is good to have a good relationship with one's constituency colleagues.  Deputy Burton is good at dishing out abuse but she is not too good at taking criticism.  This often happens to people who are new to the political scene.  They must learn that one can be critical politically without being personal.  My comments are certainly not meant to be personal.  Last year I welcomed her appointment as Minister for poverty and thought it particularly appropriate in that she represented the constituency of Dublin West where there is a great deal of poverty in the greater Blanchardstown area, particularly around Neilstown which is recognised as an area of deprivation.  She has been a sore disappointment so far.  In her speech on the budget she said, &ldquo;widows and old people will benefit from improvements in the free schemes&rdquo;.  Those free schemes include the telephone rental allowance, television licence, fuel allowance.  ESB allowance and butter vouchers.  The Minister of State's script went on:</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that the free schemes are very important to the recipients.  I am very pleased that we have been able to remove some of the more unacceptable restrictions in these schemes.  Widows aged 60-65 will now be able to retain these perks if the couple were entitled to them.  There are also important improvements for old people and wheelchair users.  These all provide further evidence for the caring nature of this budget.</P>
    <P>Is it caring for the Minister for poverty to refer to these allowances for widows as perks?  When I came into the House to listen to Minister Burton I got the script &mdash; another disadvantage.  I looked quickly through it, saw that it mostly <Col N="1489" /> claimed credit for what her senior Minister had already announced plus abuse of the Opposition.  I went back up to my office.  Some time later I read the script and I could hardly believe that the Minister for poverty would describe these allowances as perks.  In the event she did not use the word when speaking.</P>
    <P>When I issued a statement I was offered an explanation by her office to the effect that this was a typist's error.  I find that amazing.  What sort of typist would type in &ldquo;perks&rdquo; for &ldquo;allowances&rdquo;? That was not the explanation.  I was later told that these were speaking notes. Apart from the doctrine that the Minister must accept responsibility for these matters, what sort of mentality leads someone to describe these allowances, these entitlements, these rights, as perks?  As Marian Finucane said on her show, &ldquo;the use of &lsquo;perks&rsquo; is interesting as a perception&rdquo;. I find it interesting as a perception and will watch that Minister with greater interest in the future to see where that perception takes us.  Aptly named &ldquo;Minister for poverty&rdquo;, on the evidence of this budget she is determined not to become redundant; she will add to the poverty rather than eliminate it, as PAYE workers afflicted by property tax and widows whose contributory pensions are now to be means-tested will testify.</P>
    <P>A tremendous opportunity was missed in this budget.  The Government has the greatest majority in the history of the State and that can lead to its own arrogance. As the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, once said in a different context, that can lead to different problems. Those problems have started and this budget could be the first.  The Government believes it is secure with the largest majority in the history of the State, a majority that was described as unsinkable. There once was a ship called <i>The Titanic</i> that was supposed to be unsinkable. Thomas Hardy, in his poem about it, stated:</P>
    <P>As the smart ship grew in stature, grace and hue in shadowy silence grew the iceberg too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> The political iceberg will include, among other things, the residential property tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Jacob and Brendan Smith.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent budget brought about against a successful economic background, including a very good budgetary outturn in 1993 which was the result of the Minister's firm action, the very successful tax amnesty and predictions of a successful growth rate in 1994.</P>
      <P>I welcome the conclusion of the talks with the social partners and the drawing up of the programme for competitiveness in employment, a successful outcome. We can now deal with the sound management of the economy for the next few years against a background of consensus.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Minister, Deputy Ahern, the budget is pro-employment and will give a boost to enterprise and initiative.  It is based on a caring social philosophy.  The Minister stated it is financially prudent in the interest of employment and that is the case as it will go a long way towards helping the low paid.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with a small aspect of the budget, but one which has obtained a great deal of media coverage, the residential property tax.  I do not propose to get involved in any unseemly dispute about whether it was Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party who was responsible for the tax.  Obviously, it was a Cabinet decision, presumably agreed at Cabinet level.  The opinion polls suggest that the public blame the Labour Party for the tax, but I do not intend to pursue that matter either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the strength of feeling on the issue in the Dublin area. The property tax means for the people of Dublin what the rod licence meant for the people of the west.  It compounds the belief that the people of Dublin are continually losing out in terms of national policy.  This is set against a background of decentralisation, inadequate grants for industry for the Dublin area and so on. More importantly, there is a principle <Col N="1491" /> involved and there is now a belief that the philosophy of home ownership is under attack.  There is also a belief that the tax is anti-family.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's recent clarification of some of the issues involved, for example that there will not be any decrease in the threshold proposed in relation to the value of a house or the income threshold.  In addition, the Minister stated that the rates will be index-linked and gave a commitment that hardship cases and anomalies will be examined in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that the tax in its present form could force children to leave the family home.  Therefore, in any clarification of the matter in the Finance Bill only the income of the principal earner should be taken into account.  We must also consider the case of an elderly person on a low income whose children are living in the house and bringing in an income, but from whom the parent may not be able to get a contribution towards the residential property tax.  The case of a family who takes in an elderly parent whose income may put them above the threshold should also be considered.  Service charges to local authorities should also be taken into account in relation to the tax, they should be deducted from the tax payment.  The Minister has reservations about the mortgage element being subject to the tax, a matter which needs to be examined carefully.  There should also be an income ceiling; in other words, there should be a maximum limit in relation to income, which would go a long way towards alleviating any hardship caused by the imposition of the tax.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax will entail a large lump sum of money, probably the second largest expense of the year after the mortgage.  The Revenue Commissioners should allow payment by way of monthly standing orders similar to the way ESB and other bills are paid.  In other words, a mechanism should be put in place whereby people will not have to pay the tax in a lump sum.</P>
    <P>This is the International Year of the <Col N="1492" /> Family and I welcome the increased funding provided in the budget for marriage counselling services.  Nevertheless, many elements in our social welfare and tax codes are anti-family and anti-child rearing. I do not propose to deal with the issue of divorce in this context, I am merely talking about a man and woman committed to each other, have children and live under the same roof.  More should be done for that group in society. As I said already, many aspects of this budget are anti-family, for example, the residential property tax, the question of the rent allowance for a child who leaves the family home and moves into a flat, the means-test for unemployment assistance which encourages a child to leave the family home and the entitlements for elderly people such as the free telephone rental allowance which also encourages, or indeed forces, a child out of the family home.  All those matters need to be examined.</P>
    <P>Like many other Western European countries, Ireland has suffered a sharp decline in marriage and birth rates in recent years and that matter was highlighted recently by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  There is a basic philosophy in our society that a stable family is essential for our general well-being and, traditionally, great value is placed on children and child rearing. However, that is changing, the commitment to children is not as strong as it used to be and individuals are probably more committed to themselves than to the general well-being of society.  We need positive discrimination to encourage marriage, the family and child rearing generally.  Otherwise, our society will face major changes and could be destabilised. We must be conscious of that and bring about positive measures to stabilise the central unit of our society.</P>
    <P>In the budget the children's allowance was increased to £25 for the third and subsequent children.  However, that should be a major increase in the allowance because, it does not affect the costs of rearing a child.  Some of the tax take should be diverted to increasing the children's allowance.  As somebody who <Col N="1493" /> became a father in the past year I feel a profound sense of sadness at the discovery recently of two abandoned dead babies.  In the International Year of the Family it is tragic that something like that should happen.  One wonders what pressures those women were under in society or within their families that led them to abandon those babies.  They deserve our utmost sympathy.  I call for increased funding for all agencies involved in that area so that such tragedies will never happen again.  There should be an interdepartmental approach to ensuring that an unwanted pregnancy in the modern Ireland does not end in tragedy.  We need adequate funding, education, an interdepartmental approach and full support for all agencies involved.</P>
    <P>As a deterrent to crime the fitting of approved properly installed alarm systems should be tax deductible, regardless of other home improvement taxes allowances. The Minister for Finance should give serious consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the budget were caring in a social sense.  Fianna Fáil has a caring social philosophy and Labour does not hold a monopoly in that respect. The social welfare, health, and housing provisions of the budget are all welcome. The income levy has been removed, the probate tax has been substantially amended and those decisions are welcome. The new measures of urban renewal, particularly in respect of the Dublin area, are welcome.  The measures to encourage the motor industry will bear fruit in the year ahead.  I am pleased the PRSI levels have been amended; they will assist the clothing and footwear industries.  I welcome the rationalisation of employment schemes and the introduction of the community employment programme which I am sure will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time.  I wish to refer to issues which affect my constituency of Wicklow East and Kildare.  The Taoiseach said this budget was all about jobs and I agree.  I welcome the budgetary measures which will result in job creation, particularly those designed to promote and encourage <Col N="1494" /> small businesses to expand and new businesses to set up.  I welcome the establishment of the county enterprise boards and I am optimistic that they will emerge as a job-creating enterprise.  At the time they were established we were given to understand that there would be the minimum of bureaucracy and that there would be no referrals.  I wish to sound a cautionary note in that regard.</P>
      <P>I understand that the owner of a small business or company who wishes to avail of the scheme must approach the county development officer who refers the application to the county evaluation team &mdash; in my constituency we have an excellent county evaluation team.  The team refer the application to the county enterprise board who, in turn, refer it to the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, who is present, should ensure that applications are not delayed.  The county enterprise boards is a great concept.  They should not be choked by bureaucracy, as happened to some State agencies in the past.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the allocation by the Minister for the Environment of an additional £15 million funding for roads.  It is badly needed particularly in the light of the inclement weather we have had in recent months which has devastated county roads.  While that allocation, which is a recognition of the Government's and the Minister's concern about the problem, is not adequate &mdash; the Minister is aware of that &mdash; it is welcome.  If it is astutely used it will help improve the condition of our roads.  Major road developments are taking place in my constituency.  The long awaited Arklow by-pass has been sanctioned and its work will commence shortly.  When completed it will bring Arklow, a much maligned town in respect of employment and so on, back to its former glory when it was one of the most profitable provincial towns in Ireland. The Arklow by-pass and the adjoining industrial park, as proposed in Wicklow County Council's plans, will help solve many problems of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Bray is very congested and while the Bray by-pass facilitates business <Col N="1495" /> and commerce in the area traffic travelling to and from Greystones causes congestion. The construction of the Southern Cross Route when completed should solve that problem.  We have reached an impasse in regard to the construction of that motorway.  Recently, I explained the position to the county manager and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, and I am grateful that the Minister took immediate action in relation to it.  Within a number of days he approved of the scheme and instructed the relevant county council to submit an application by Friday fortnight in the light of new funding arrangements.  Heretofore, there was no arrangement to provide funding for non-national roads.  I am sure the application will be given careful consideration by the Department and that the problem of congestion in Bray will be solved.</P>
    <P>The housing problem is critical and Deputies have been made aware of the position by constituents.  We feel helpless because we are not able to provide housing for the homeless and those on the local authority waiting list.  I welcome the allocation for an additional 3,500 houses. I welcome the information I received this morning that 120 local authority houses will be built in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that funding for ports will be directed mainly at major ports to the virtual exclusion of smaller ports, such as Arklow and Wicklow. Funding is needed to upgrade ports to enable them cope with the pressures of modern day commerce.  Small ports are the lifeblood of many towns.  I am concerned about the port towns of Arklow and Wicklow.  Funding should be allocated for small ports and they should form part of the Government's job creating policy.</P>
    <P>The improvements in regard to agriculture, particularly in the probate and capital acquisition taxes and the farm retirement scheme are welcome.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry indicated yesterday that the Finance <Col N="1496" /> Bill will contain reliefs in stamp duty costs in the transfer of farms to young farmers.</P>
    <P>On the appeals procedure under the disadvantaged areas scheme, my constituency was well catered for under the review in that 84 per cent of the land area of Wicklow was included under the scheme.  However, there are anomalies which I hope will be redressed when the appeals procedure is finalised.  The portion of east Kildare which has been added to my constituency is almost the same size in terms of land, as that of west Wicklow which it adjoins.  An appeal has been lodged in this regard and if justice is to prevail that area of east Kildare will be included.</P>
    <P>Premia and headage payments should be made on time.  Like other businesses farmers must plan ahead and budget their finances, delays in payment prevent them from doing so.  I welcome, as I am sure do the farmers, the Minister's conmitment in the House yesterday that this matter will be addressed forthwith.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £5 million to the GAA.  That provision, which has been the subject of some criticism in the House, for Croke Park, the headquarters of our national games association has significant cultural and traditional implications. As a person who has been involved in the GAA all my life, I wholeheartedly welcome the allocation.  The President of the GAA, Mr. Jack Boothman, who is a constituent of mine, wrote to me recently expressing his and his association's appreciation of this excellent gesture and asking me to express his gratitude to the Minister for Finance.  I do that formally now.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues I would like to address but it would be unfair to my colleague not to conclude now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  The 1994 budget was framed against a background of very sound economic and financial management of this country's public finances by Fianna Fáil since returning to office in 1987.  The budget will give the necessary impetus to the creation of sustainable employment and the continuation <Col N="1497" /> of a caring social policy, coupled with a gradual tax reform programme. The Minister for Finance has indicated that the budget will contribute directly to the creation of 21,000 new jobs in 1994, which will mark the largest increase in employment since 1989-90. The Government must ensure that job creation follows on from the discipline of tight budgets and sound economic management.</P>
      <P>I know from my constituency that the ever-increasing burden of taxation during the mid eighties, with a 65 per cent top rate of tax and a 35 per cent standard rate of VAT, ruined the Border economy, with lack of competitiveness on the part of traders and manufacturers on this side of the Border.  Thankfully, in 1987, Fianna Fáil in Government took decisive action to stem the flow of revenue and jobs from these counties and recently the trend has been reversed.  Any further increases in the level of taxation on diesel, petrol and oil would be most harmful to the Border economy.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that we do not get back into a cycle of small increases each year on petrol and oil as it could be detrimental to Border counties.</P>
      <P>I would like to commend the Minister for labour affairs, Deputy O'Rourke, and her colleague, the Minister with responsibility for commerce and technology, Deputy Séamus Brennan, for their specific interest in the creation of jobs and particularly the concentration on measures to help small businesses.  In the past 12 months both Ministers have worked consistently towards the achievement of cheaper loans, the substantial raising of the VAT threshold, PRSI concessions for the low paid and easier administration for small business.  All of those measures will have significant advantages for many small businesses and will enable the creation of worthwhile employment in that sector.  The small business sector is particularly important in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commencement of the new Community Employment Programme, which will replace the social employment scheme, the Community Employment <Col N="1498" /> Development Programme and Teamwork is a very significant development. The new programme will build on the experience and strengths of the existing programmes.  It responds directly to the calls from all sectors for the expansion of work opportunities within communities. All of us who have been involved with social employment schemes, be they through voluntary organisations or local authorities, are conscious of the major contribution they have made towards the improvement of facilities and amenities throughout the country and also the opportunities they provide to people to work.  The inclusion of development modules within the programme will allow participants to obtain personal employment skills and specific skills relating to the type of work involved in their projects. The community employment scheme also brings with it the added advantage that all participants with a previous entitlement to a medical card or other social welfare benefits will be able to retain same once they participate on a scheme.  One of the major handicaps with the schemes that have existed up to now is that the participants did not retain these benefits.</P>
    <P>The provision of 40,000 places on the new scheme by the end of 1994 is a positive development, both from the point of view of those who will participate and of the needs of local communities.</P>
    <P>The provision of £129 million for the Capital Housing Programme in 1994 marks an increase of 95 per cent.  This is a very welcome development.  The provision of proper housing for the citizens of this country has always been a fundamental Fianna Fáil aim.  This level of expenditure should ensure that a further significant step is made in the Government's commitment to deal with local authority housing waiting lists and also the provision of housing for those in need.  This Government made a commitment to increase substantially the programme of works to provide proper facilities in local authority houses where basic sanitary facilities are lacking.  The increase in the allocation for this purpose is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> I would ask the Minister for the Environment to re-introduce the house improvement scheme.  A very limited and targeted scheme should be introduced in this regard to assist people whose houses need to be upgraded or who need extra accommodation to cater for families.  The scheme should be limited to a person's principal place of residence.  Unfortunately, many homes are lacking in basic sanitary facilities and proper accommodation, and the owners of those houses are not entitled to any scheme of assistance at present as they are not accepted on the housing list.  Those people who wish to repair or carry out substantial improvements to their homes but whose means are limited should be entitled to State assistance.  I again appeal to the Minister for the Government to consider the introduction of such a scheme at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Minister for Health to make further progress in relation to the elimination of hospital waiting lists and the special allocation of £10 million in the budget for this purpose is to be welcomed.  The increased allocation in the 1994 Estimates towards the provision of services for people with a mental handicap is also welcome.  I hope the Minister will provide increased funding to health boards to enable them to establish more day care centres, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a budget for jobs, but we must note that it includes an extra £157 million to improve the incomes of those in receipt of social welfare. I pay particular tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for his very caring and innovative approach to the administration of our social welfare system.  The general increase of 3 per cent in all weekly social welfare and health board payments and the extra 3 per cent increase in all short term payments are welcome.  Deputy Woods' commitment to a continued improvements in the carer's allowance is also welcome and is evidenced by the easing of the means test in that respect.</P>
    <P>One of the central aims of this budget <Col N="1500" /> is to create jobs.  As a Border Deputy, I remind the House that one major impediment to employment creation is the totally unsatisfactory road network, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I spoke here last Tuesday on the issue of roads, and once again I appeal to the Minister and the Government to provide increased funding for our regional and county roads.  An up-to-date national road network is of little use if there is not an adequate feeder system of local and county roads.  Border counties have suffered immeasurable economic damage due to the problems in the other part of the province.  Surely the provision of a proper road infrastructure is necessary to create and maintain employment. I appeal to the Government to ensure that a major portion of the funds available under the INTERREG Programme are allocated towards the creation of a proper road network within the Border counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>There are only two or three aspects of the budget on which I want to concentrate because they deserve to be emphasised.  Some of these aspects have been highlighted already and others have been referred to in the House, but they have yet received the attention they should.  I am not sure that the general public fully understands the implications of what the Government is proposing.</P>
      <P>This budget will go down in history as the budget which mugged widows, which sought to discriminate between men and women and, at a time of bereavement, to take from a widow part of the pension which she and her husband paid for during their working lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is understood that under the terms of the budget tens of thousands of wives will, in the years to come, substantially lose out on the pension the current law says they are entitled to by way of contributory pension. From October 1994 the contributory pensions of all new widows will be means tested, something which does not happen <Col N="1501" /> at present.  The means test, which will apply throughout the continuation of the time they are to receive payments, will be based on income earned.  Therefore, a widow who goes out to work to supplement her pension is likely to find that the pension she and her husband paid for during their married years will be substantially reduced by virtue of her earnings.  On the other hand, if a widow has private investments or income &mdash; it does not have to be earned income &mdash; or major capital and property assets, her entitlement to a widow's pension will not be affected.</P>
    <P>It is inequitable, discriminatory and unconstitutional to means test widow's benefit in the manner proposed by the Minister.  Every wife whose husband is currently making payments through the pay-related social insurance scheme and every wife making such payments &mdash; because she is in employment and is required to make them &mdash; was effectively mugged by the Government in the budget.  Wives have effectively been told that regardless of how long they have been making contributions if, following the death of their husbands they try to supplement their income it will be means tested and the pension affected.</P>
    <P>The Government is also effectively saying that the insurance schemes to which they contribute are no longer insurance schemes they are another from of tax, another bit taken from people through the PAYE system which, theoretically, will provide security for them in future.  If a private insurance company attempted to behave in this way it would be successfully sued through our courts. The Government should very rapidly redress its proposals in this regard.  This is the thin edge of the wedge.  If the Government applies a means test to widow's benefit old age contributory pensions will be next.  It will mean that people who made contributions, either voluntarily or compulsorily, over the years to provide them with a degree of security in their later life will have no such security.  In effect, it will suggest that if people want security in future they <Col N="1502" /> should contribute only to private schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope, as the controversy surrounding other aspects of the debate dies down, that women will understand and realise the threat posed by these budget provisions to their future security.  These provisions are extraordinary and unjust and should not be tolerated.  In that sense, the budget is anti-woman, it singled out women and widows for special, discriminatory and unconstitutional treatment.</P>
    <P>The Government has a tendency to attack the bereaved.  In its first budget it imposed the iniquitous probate tax which it should have been honest enough to abolish in this budget and which it is now seeking to ameliorate.  Having done that, the Government set out to discover what additional penalty it could impose on people who had been bereaved.  Having dropped aspects of the probate tax, the Government is now introducing a tax on widow's pensions, a form of benefit which has never been taxed.  Up to now there had been a guarantee that this benefit would be paid by successive Governments and entitlement to it has been based on the contributions to the scheme over the years.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach attempted to lecture Opposition Deputies on issues relating to allegations of hypocrisy in Government and political parties and the consistency of political parties.  Neither the Fianna Fáil Party nor the Labour Party told widows in the last general election campaign that they would tax their benefit.  Yesterday the Taoiseach said that parties &mdash; he suggested the Fine Gael Party in this context &mdash; were prepared to devalue democracy in the interest of short term political expediency.  If ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black, that was it.  The Fianna Fáil Party is the prince of short term political expediency &mdash; it invented the concept for its own electoral gain and applied it in every election it fought since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Labour Party is the party of trust &mdash; it was going to put trust back in politics.  I will not waste time by <Col N="1503" /> reading into the record the advertising campaign conducted by the Labour Party during the last general election campaign in seeking to assure people that it would not impose a family home tax, increase residential property tax or attack the mortgage and VHI allowances. However, I want to refer to promises made during the last few days of the general election campaign which, no doubt, Deputy Kemmy would claim were made by politicians in the heat of the moment.</P>
    <P>I refer to promises by Fianna Fáil and Labour to create the perception that if they were elected to Government there would be no increases in the residential property tax, no attack on the mortgage interest allowance or the voluntary health insurance relief.  All these promises have been broken.  In the context of the residential property tax, there is an illogical and arbitrary anti-Dublin approach which discriminates against families in Dublin city and county and which will ensure that they will pay a far greater contribution by way of tax on their homes than people in any other part of the country. Perhaps some parts of Cork will be equally affected, but that will be the extent of it.</P>
    <P>This tax is exacerbated by another lie told by the two parties in Government during the last general election campaign, that local charges would not be imposed in Dublin.  As a result of the efforts of the Minister for the Environment and, presumably, the Government, Dubliners have been mugged twice on this issue in the space of two weeks. As a result of this Government's policy not only will there be a substantial increase in residential property tax, or the family home tax, but having paid that from one's taxed income, bills for rates will be sent to those living in Dún Laoghaire and Dundrum.  There will be a re-imposition of rates by Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government on the people of Dundrum, Stillorgan and Mount Merrion and rates by another name &mdash; water charges &mdash; in other parts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>What did the Labour Party have to say <Col N="1504" /> about this?  On 24 November 1992 Dick Spring, at a time when he had been anointed by the media and the halo was looming large above his head on his nightly appearances on the 9 o'clock news, felt the need to write an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> because he was under attack from Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil attack was designed to assure people that Fianna Fáil in office would not do any of those things Labour could be expected to do.  Dick Spring, this epitome of trust in Government, this man who was going to bring a new form of Government &mdash; the wind of change &mdash; to Ireland, said: &ldquo;For the record, I intend to set out Labour's position in relation to each of the &ldquo;scares&rdquo; that Fianna Fáil have been putting about in the last few days&rdquo;. Then, in a banner headline relating to Labour policy, we read:</P>
    <P>Property Tax &mdash; No increase.</P>
    <P>Wealth Tax &mdash; No wealth tax (they have not introduced that yet).</P>
    <P>Mortgage Interest Relief &mdash; improvements while rates are high.</P>
    <P>This year we have had disimprovements; there has been no suggestion that mortgage interest relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be substantially reduced for the long term in the event of mortgage interest rates falling. The article continued:</P>
      <P>VHI relief &mdash; no change.</P>
      <P>In other words, the advertisements that people have been forced to read in their newspapers over the last few days are all untrue &mdash; each and every one of them.  Albert Reynolds knows this, of course, and so do most of the senior people in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pity is that these politicans, whom I used to regard as basically <Col N="1505" /> honourable people, have been forced to stoop to such tactics by the advertising agency of the British Tory party.</P>
    <P>Mr. Spring went on to say: &ldquo;I wonder has it occurred to anyone within Fianna Fáil to ask where the money is coming from for this dishonest and negative campaign&rdquo;. The Tánaiste had his free advertisement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> to say that none of this was true, but, alas, it was to come to pass.  What Fianna Fáil were telling people Labour would do in Government is what Fianna Fáil got into bed with Labour to do in Government. Therefore, rather than saying &ldquo;Property Tax &mdash; No increase&rdquo;, just 12 months on, writing the same article, the script could read &ldquo;Property Tax &mdash; Large increase. Mortage Interest Relief &mdash; Being abolished&rdquo;. The process is starting.  &ldquo;VHI Tax Relief &mdash; Slowly but surely to be eliminated&rdquo;. That is the policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party was adamant to ensure, in the words of its Leader, that in the context of dealing with these issues, trust should be placed in them.  How many recall the headline, &ldquo;Reynolds-Led Fianna Fáil Coalition Unworkable Warns Spring&rdquo;.  That was a scare created to increase the Labour vote.  Dick Spring was not going to get into bed with Fianna Fáil.  And what was the present Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party's message to the electorate as we headed into the dying days of the election campaign? It was to put their confidence in him and in Labour.  He said &ldquo;We have been tried and trusted down the years and despite negative Fianna Fáil campaign I believe our bona fides and trust will weather that Fianna Fáil storm.  If the gods stay with us I think also we will will even more seats&rdquo;.  Not only the gods but Saachi and Saachi stayed and between them and the Tánaiste, the electorate was seriously and sadly misled.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was accused of telling lies about the Labour Party, it turned out to be the party that was telling the truth about the Labour Party.  However, Fianna Fáil, at the same time, was telling the electorate lies about itself and people <Col N="1506" /> in Dublin now know that this Government, despite what is said in the last election, has not put trust back into politics. What this Government has done is what the Taoiseach was being critical of yesterday.  In the run up to the general election, the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties were prepared to let democracy be devalued in the interests of short term political expediency, their expediency. They were not interested in telling people the truth, in putting trust back into politics or restoring faith in democracy; they were interested in getting as many seats as they could to obtain as big a majority as possible and to then mug the people who voted for them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, so far the Government has indicated under pressure in this House that it will row back on its proposals in regard to the family home tax. Of course, what it should do is indicate that it will not implement what was announced in the budget.  To date, the Minister for Social Welfare has simply seen fit, in relation to his &ldquo;mugging&rdquo; of widows, to go on RTE, defend the proposal and say it will proceed.  It is extraordinary that the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are concerned about family homes, and the backbenchers in Labour, the party of social justice, have not yet had the wit to make a single comment in defence of the pensions and benefits to which widows are entitled and should remain entitled.  I hope that aspect of the budget will be addressed rapidly and that the outcome will be a U-turn on the part of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The real reason this Government cannot deal seriously with economic or tax reform is because the public spending explosion has not been stemmed.  In a few years, when the present growth cycle has died away, we will ask ourselves what we did with all of this economic growth.  It saddens me to say that because many people in this country will suffer as a result of the decisions that are being taken today.  As our Finance spokesman, Deputy Yates, said &ldquo;We have taken the fruits of growth and absorbed them into extra public expenditure. <Col N="1507" /> It is then that people will realise how seriously our economy has once again been mismanaged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Let us be in no doubt about this; the public spending explosion continues.  The real story of this budget is the projected 8 per cent increase in current spending. This budget does not include any provision for the public sector pay increases and the special awards that may come into place.  Current public spending will rise by at least 31 per cent over the next three years.  It is clear that this Labour-Fianna Fáil Government will allow public spending to grow.  This is the real reason for the inappropriate taxes, increases and changes in benefits, including the changes in the widows pension.  I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Shatter, said in relation to this.  It is extraordinary that the Government is suggesting that it will manage this social insurance fund in a way that will provide for a means test for widows' pensions, that there will be no assessment of property, savings or other pensions but that there will be a means test on earned income.  It is to finance additional quangos and to pander to certain elements that this increased spending is necessary.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the Taoiseach came into the House yesterday, quoted from a speech by Dr. Garrett FitzGerald and lectured Fine Gael on consistency.  What an inappropriate use of time.  The speech itself referred to the history of Fianna Fáil and its inconsistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, some things &mdash; such as the soft option &mdash; do not change &mdash; and that is what has been taken in this budget. This budget is ineffective in dealing with poverty and deprivation and deeply damaging to democracy in its onslaught on various groups.  It means that day to day Government spending will rise by another 8 per cent to a projected £9.3 billion, compared with an increase of 3 per cent provided in the 1994 Book of Estimates.  It will also mean that tax revenues will jump by a further 6.8 per cent to £10.37 billion.  This means that public spending will have jumped by 31 per cent over the past three years while the taxes <Col N="1508" /> needed to fund such expenditure will have risen by 24 per cent.  One billion pounds extra per year is what the Minister for Finance spent over the past three years, £1 billion every year.  Of course, when public spending is out of control, inevitably taxes will spiral upwards; that is what we are seeing, not reform.  In money terms projected Government spending has risen by £329 million since last December while capital spending will be £54 million higher than envisaged in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As I said already, we have not heard the end of this as already 27 special pay claims have been submitted.  How will the Government respond?  Must we wait for next week's instalment, next week's rejigging, next week's new figures; next week's pull back?  On what is the revenue from residential property tax, reduction in relief on VHI premia and mortgage interest being expended?  It is funding public spending.  The Government, this reckless partnership, is a free spending administration but our hard pressed citizens who saved their money, put money into their homes, are paying the price.</P>
    <P>What happened since the Book of Estimates was published?  For example, the Department of Health proposes £108 million additional spending over that provided for in the Book of Estimates; the Department of Transport Energy and Communications another £72 million, the Department of Social Welfare another £66 million, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, another £33 million and the Department of the Environment another £21 million, accounting for the increases to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the changes in PRSI &mdash; here I agree with the decision to reduce PRSI contributions by the lower paid &mdash; are a new poverty trap because the reform is not substantial enough.  For example, the cut in employers' PRSI for those earning less than £5,000 per annum and abolishing the 1.2 per cent health levy and the 1 per cent employment and training levy from those earning below £9,000 per annum, creates a new poverty trap since, when a worker earns £1 over <Col N="1509" /> the threshold, the levies come into force on the whole income.  In other words, paying a worker £1 over £9,000 per annum will cost that employee £202.50 and his employer £288, a total of £490.50. Is that tax reform?  It will create new poverty traps, act as a disincentive to job creation in that income level and the jobs we are most likely to attract from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to hear the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs say this is a media invention.  What about Deputies Shortall, Browne, MEP Niall Andrews and the backbench group of Fianna Fáil TDs such as Deputies Eoin Ryan, Liam Lawlor and others who met the Minister for Finance to protest and discuss the anomalies in this budget?  Is that also a media invention?  A little over a year ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to be the new politician.  He did not talk about breaking the mould because someone else had mentioned that before he got into his stride, claiming to be the politician who would bring a fresh, innovative, unclichéd approach to this House.  Well, he got a very good response from the media, a very positive profile, because he seemed to be against pandering to special interests and advocated openness.  He was seen as liberating the marvellous potential of members of his party.  Now it is back to square one, the man who stood for these things, who stood for equality, supports a tax which sets out deliberately to whittle away home ownership. He agrees with taxing a home as if it was a productive factory.  Homes are homes; they are not productive factories, generally speaking, people do not deal in homes, they live in them.  Now the man who stood for openness and trust in Government is grounding his backbenchers, like an authoritarian father grounding a teenager over breaking the rules, except that his backbenchers are not teenagers, he is not their father, and they were not breaking the rules.  They were articulating what they truly believed, articulating the values, policies and promises the Labour Party reaffirmed during the general election campaign and which won them so much <Col N="1510" /> support.  Now the man, so beloved of the media, is blaming his problems on them &mdash; the last refuge, blame the media.  The promises the Labour Party made during the general election campaign not to impose a property tax, not to remove relief on VHI premia and mortgage interest &mdash; were a central reason for the swing in support to them, that and the expectation that Labour would not go into coalition with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The position is very clear.  The Labour Party changed its mind, its promises during the general election campaign were just a dishonest way of fooling the people into voting.  Do these impositions &mdash; reducing relief on VHI premia and mortgage interest along with the introduction of residential property tax &mdash; lead to greater fairness?  Do they constitute more effective taxation?  I think most people have a social conscience, they want an equitable tax system and greater opportunities for the disadvantaged.  Certainly they do not want to see a particular group &mdash; mainly in our cities and particularly in Dublin &mdash; targeted by the residential property tax.  The Minister is damaging this group of people who have contributed so much to our economy and the quality of life here by his inaction in regard to introducing equity.</P>
    <P>If people felt that budgetary provisions dealt with basic tax reform and job creation in a comprehensive way, we would not have had this outcry against them.  That is my reason for saying the Minister has failed in his efforts.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance based his calculations on an ESRI survey of households undertaken in 1987.  The Minister for Finance built his house tax on shaky foundations according to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I received many letters from constituents, many of whom say they had never written to a politician.  They are outraged at this tax.  They feel it undermines the efforts they put into their families and their homes, over many years, that in effect they are now being punished for being thrifty, for having made sacrifices, for having attempted to maintain a certain standard.  They also <Col N="1511" /> feel it is anti-family.  I hope the Minister, as Fine Gael suggested, will withdraw this tax, or is the axe about to fall on the educational covenants in which those same families have also invested?</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent levy, an iniquitous tax, a lazy tax&mdash;which I called it last year&mdash; has been removed.  I notice that several members of the Government are now saying that people should be grateful it has been abolished.  Of course, the reality is it should never have been introduced. I have already spoken about the increase in the PRSI employers' threshold.  This too will be problematic in terms of job creation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation to the Women's Centre in Sheriff Street.  I hope it is an indicator of the type of support many women's groups nationwide can expect in future.  They have been endeavouring to establish centres and community projects nationwide for many years, with very little support, certainly not the type of support we have seen the Minister give within his constituency.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht managed to find the extra £1 million for the Arts Council, which should clearly have figured in the Book of Estimates.  The whole aspect of job creation within the spectrum of arts and culture does not receive the type of support it needs although its potential is immense.  Other countries have made extraordinary progress in this area in the creation of jobs.  We must do the same and ensure that the county enterprise boards incorporate this as part of their brief, that the Government incorporate it as a central part of its job creation philosophy so that it will be examined in a much more detailed and targeted manner than has been the case to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I wish to share my time with Deputy Leonard.  The budget demonstrates the commitment of this Government to economic growth, job creation and social justice.  It builds on <Col N="1512" /> the solid foundation for progress we have put in place.  It is also the second major step in the implementation of our strategy for economic and employment growth which is central to the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>We cannot be complacent about our strong economic performance especially in 1993.  We must maintain and build upon the financial stability and confidence in the Irish economy which are central to encourage investment, growth and job creation.  The budget rightly focuses on job creation and the innovative measures it contains will pay dividends in job creation in the short and medium terms.  I would like to focus on a number of these initiatives.</P>
      <P>Directing tax relief towards the lower paid in society and reducing the costs of such employments will increase incentives to work and encourage employers to increase employment.  In this regard I highlight the removal of the requirement for employer payment of the employment and training levy and the health levy for employees with a medical card. In addition, employer's PRSI is being reduced by about 25 per cent in respect of low paid employees.</P>
      <P>The widening of the standard rate tax band and the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy will alleviate the tax burden on the hard-pressed PAYE worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of up to £100 million in low interest loan funding announced by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, will make it easier and cheaper for small companies to finance expansion and development.  That provision is welcome.  The fact that a significant proportion of it will be at a fixed interest rate will be of major benefit to small businesses.  For too long we have heard it was difficult for small businesses to secure loans or to have a friendly bank manager.  In many cases they were treated negatively.  This measure will have an enormous effect both in the creation of long term jobs and also in the stabilisation of existing employment. Stabilisation of existing employment is very important.  For various reasons many small businesses which fail could, <Col N="1513" /> had they received financial assistance from their bank manager at the right time, have remained in business.  Too often they got a negative response from their financial backers and in the end had no option but to close.  The new low interest loan funding announced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will be of major benefit to many projects.</P>
    <P>The reduction in vehicle registration tax and the increase in the capital allowance ceiling for business cars has stimulated the motor industry.  The number of cars sold last month is significantly up on the number sold in January 1993.  This shows the confidence in the economy and that people are prepared to purchase new cars.</P>
    <P>Measures to be introduced will reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved in tax compliance, a single registration form for all taxes will be introduced and tax clearance procedures for public contracts will be simplified.</P>
    <P>Significant assistance is being provided for our tourist industry, through the provision of an extra £5 million for promotion and marketing, and the improvement of capital allowances for hotel buildings.</P>
    <P>While working for growth and employment we must, at the same time, acknowledge that the less fortunate in society &mdash; those without employment or with limited means &mdash; must be catered for in the short term also.</P>
    <P>The budget has continued to protect those on social welfare by ensuring that welfare payments in real terms are increased substantially.  The changes in social welfare will be of benefit, particularly to widows and widowers and those on low income.  I welcome the fact that the Government continues to be a caring administration, concerned about the less fortunate and anxious to ensure that they have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>The extension and increase relief on capital acquisitions tax for business and the farming community will lead to a more orderly transfer of productive assets to young energetic entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>In the Department of the Environment, budgetary measures will make a <Col N="1514" /> significant input into infrastructural development and social justice.  The urban renewal scheme which has been successful in the past in Dublin and our major cities, will be extended to smaller towns from 1 August next.  The new scheme will continue to build on progress achieved in revitalising the physical and economic condition of some of our cities and towns.  The new scheme will place greater emphasis on residential accommodation and on the restoration and refurbishment of existing premises.  The owner-occupier allowance is retained, but it is doubled in the case of refurbishment works to promote the restoration of existing buildings.  The section 23 allowance for private rented accommodation is also retained.</P>
    <P>A new capital allowance for industrial units is also being introduced.  I welcome the incentives being introduced for overshop living for the five boroughs.  People have moved out of many of our large towns and cities.  This incentive is a welcome response by the Government to encourage people to move back into our major cities and towns, to live over shops and to bring life back into those areas.</P>
    <P>County roads play a very important role in the economic and social life of Ireland.  For that reason I welcome the provision in the budget of an additional £15 million from the proceeds of the tax amnesty towards maintenance of non-national roads.  Adequate county roads are central to the development of local industry, agriculture, food processing and tourism.  The overall provision for non-national roads for 1994 is £102 million compared with £75.3 million in 1993, an increase of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>This provision is welcome in rural Ireland where county roads are very important.  In the past great emphasis has been placed on highways, by-passes and on building new roads.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, on ensuring that the allocation for county roads is increased by 35 per cent in 1994.  This will ensure, over a period, that the roads can be brought to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>Social housing is an important aspect <Col N="1515" /> of the Government's programme.  We are concerned to have a high-powered house building programme which will ensure that local authorities are in a position to house those on the waiting lists.  Social housing output increased significantly in 1993, about 3,800 local authority houses were started last year and 1,500 were completed or acquired by local authorities. Along with the completion of last year's new house starts, a further 3,500 dwellings will be started in 1994.  Local authorities were informed today of their allocations for 1994.</P>
    <P>The concern and commitment of the Government is evident from the fact that despite financial constraints it has continued to keep the house building programme at the top of the priority list and maintained the same number of houses in 1994 as in 1993.  The capital allocation for the housing programme will help reduce waiting lists for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for the housing programme was increased by more than 60 per cent in 1993 and, taking account of the £12 million allocated in the budget, the Government is providing for a further increase of 95 per cent, to £129 million, in 1994.</P>
    <P>A total of £33 million is being provided in 1994 for voluntary housing, an increase of 70 per cent.  These funds are directed to provide accommodation for special category housing needs.  The voluntary housing programme can help to resolve the housing problems and I pay tribute to the people involved in those programmes for the high standard houses they are providing.  Voluntary housing should be part and parcel of housing policy for the foreseeable future.  The level of expenditure on local authority and voluntary housing in 1994 demonstrates the Government's commitment to deal with social housing needs.</P>
    <P>The programme of the partnership Government gives a commitment to the accelerated implementation of the environment action programme which was published in 1990 based on the concept of ability to sustain the principle of precautionary <Col N="1516" /> action in relation to environmental risk and the integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas.  Progress to date in implementing the action programme includes the elimination of smog in Dublin and the establishment of the environmental information service, ENFO, which has proved successful in Dublin.  Over 1,000 visitors per week visit the centre seeking advice and information and it is particularly popular with schools.  I hope the Minister and I can extend the ENFO service to major cities like Cork, Galway and Waterford to complement the service provided in Dublin.  The action programme has also led to increased waste recycling.</P>
    <P>Particular developments in the past year include the publication of a major consultation paper and the holding of a consultation conference on the development of a recycling strategy in Ireland; the publication of a document on climate change and our strategy for the abatement of CO² emissions; the formal establishment &mdash; July 1993 &mdash; of the Environmental Protection Agency, foremost among whose responsibilities is the regulation and control of activities which pose a high risk of pollution, and the major programme of investment in sewage treatment facilities which is under way in coastal areas.  Significant funds have been allocated by the Government to alleviate problems affecting coastal towns &mdash; where sewage is flowing into the sea &mdash; in line with European Directives and the commitment of the Department and the Government to resolve such problems.</P>
    <P>Other developments include a continuing decline in the incidence of serious pollution of inland water and an increase in the number of Irish beaches which received a blue flag award, from 48 in 1990 to 64 in 1993, which shows the emphasis local authorities are putting on the need for clean beaches which are crucial in attracting tourists.  We have some of the cleanest beaches in Europe, despite what some environmentalists might say.  I thank the local authorities for the time, effort and money they have <Col N="1517" /> put into maintaining our beaches although some leave a lot to be desired. Responsibility for keeping beaches clean should not rest solely with local authorities. It should be shared between Government, local authorities and the people who use the beaches.  In that context visitors to beaches should be encouraged to bring bags in which to carry home their litter.  We have had increased sales of unleaded petrol which now accounts for about 37 per cent of petrol sales and in October 1993 we published a major consultation paper in relation to cleaner technology for manufacturing.  I hope manufacturing industries throughout the country will adopt the recomendations in that paper.</P>
    <P>The national recycling strategy promised in the Programme for Government is my priority and early last year I published a major consultancy study on recycling in Ireland.  I invited views from industry, local authority, consumer and environmental interests on the complex issues raised in the study.  This was followed by a conference last December to discuss the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Between 1989 and 1993 £1.6 million was provided by the Department of the Environment in grant aid to 50 recycling projects operated by such organisations as Kerbside Dublin and Rehab, local authorities and by some private interests. The purpose of the grants is to help projects get off the ground.  The grant is normally limited to 50 per cent of the capital cost of the project.  In 1993 recycling grants amounted to £400,000 and in 1994 the allocation has been increased to £500,000.  It has been said that some recycling projects did not last, but most of them have been successful. Deputy Leonard yesterday asked about grant aid for a project in his county.  We will be advertising such schemes in the near future.  Any project worthy of consideration will be considered and I hope to see new recycling projects come on stream in 1994 to complement the worthwhile projects already operating in rural Ireland and in the city.  Both Kerbside Dublin and Rehab have been very successful in recycling and in providing jobs <Col N="1518" /> for people in the city.  There is scope to create jobs in recycling and we hope to be successful in that respect in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Other significant developments have taken place in environmental protection, in relation to access to information. These include the introduction of the statutory rights to freedom of access to information provided by the regulations made by the Minister for the Environment in 1993.  This is an important development for increasing the level of public awareness of environmental issues and providing for a more open climate in relation to data on many issues which are a source of concern to the public. Environmental protection in a farming context is fully addressed in the rural environment protection scheme which was approved recently by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the protection of the environment is a priority with the general public.  Public awareness of the tremendous asset a clean environment is to the development of agriculture, food production, tourism, forestry, fisheries and in providing jobs is vital.  We must encourage people to become more environmentally aware and encourage industry to be open and frank with the public about the type of business in which they are dealing and to respect rights to environmental information which is so important nowadays.</P>
    <P>This is a pro-jobs budget, it will encourage people to invest in jobs.  The budget indicates support for rural Ireland.  We hear much about the decline in industry and the loss of jobs in rural Ireland but I hope this budget will go a long way towards redressing those problems. I am glad that the Government is committed to a bottom up approach though the Leader programme, the county enterprise boards, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and other initiatives so that people in their communities can become involved in job creation and can be helped through the £100 million provided for fixed low interest loans that can help to create and stabilise employment, <Col N="1519" /> which is so important to communities throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is pro-employment with its emphasis on providing substainable jobs.  It also safeguards social welfare recipients and provides additional tax relief for low paid workers.  It provides £330 million for tax relief in addition to injecting £157 million into the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years the Government has taken steps to create an environment for job creation, through debt management, low inflation and low interest rates.  For many years we longed for development funding at reasonable rates of interest.  The measures in the budget are expected to lead to the creation of 21,000 jobs.  Indeed, I have great sympathy for Ministers and Government agencies in their efforts to provide jobs.  County enterprise boards have been set up &mdash; I am a member of one such body &mdash; and I look to them to generate activity at local level.  One of the first functions of the board was to target areas where jobs could be created. In my area we have targeted the food industry and tourism primarily because we have a good track record in that industry in which 1,700 people are employed. The workforce has built up its expertise from its wide experience and we decided to build on that in further downstream processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two meat plants in my constituency, one of which is close to my home base and which changed hands recently.  It was bought by one of the largest processing companies, Meadow Meats, and we expected that a great many jobs would be created there. However, the live shipment of cattle has developed to such an extent that the slaughtering plants can no longer compete. Last week, a manager of one such plant told me that he was getting only one-quarter of the kill he required.  With an aggressive sales policy, this meat plant had penetrated the export market and did not rely on intervention.  Because the plants are not getting a sufficient kill, <Col N="1520" /> boners are laid off and have to seek work in Germany.  The chief executive officer of that meat plant spoke about the very low profit margins in the meat industry and said it was not sustainable to continue with the margin of only 2 per cent on sales.</P>
    <P>Staff from the newly set up Forbairt spoke to the county enterprise board regarding the poultry industry, which is the life blood of County Monaghan.  They stressed strongly the need to cut costs so as to ensure that our products are competitive on the export markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, has introduced a community scheme to replace the social employment scheme, Teamwork and the community development programme and it is hoped to increase participation in the scheme to 40,000.  More importantly, it is proposed to extend the duration of the new scheme from one year to two years for most projects but to three years for special projects for community groups.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £15 million from the tax amnesty yield for expenditure on non-national roads has been referred to previously. This proves the Government's commitment because it is increasing from £75.3 million to £101.9 million the allocation for county roads, an increase of 35 per cent.  I ask the Minister to have an assessment of needs carried out so that funding can be allocated on a needs rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial allocation to housing, the allocation for my county provides for 60 additional houses.  An additional £12 million has been provided in the budget for that purpose of which £4.5 million has come from the tax amnesty yield.  The sum of £4 million is allocated for the provision of bathrooms in local authority houses and other houses which do not have the essential facilities.  There is provision also for the replacement of substandard windows and for funding for housing for the elderly, another area of need which has been consistently recognised by Ministers.</P>
    <P>Since 1983, Deputies from the Border <Col N="1521" /> counties have faced the budget with great trepidation and fear because of its effects on our area.  All Deputies were very glad that the increases in petrol and fuel oils were modest and that these commodities are still cheaper in the South than in the North.  The 3 per cent reduction in the excise on motor vehicles is welcomed by the motor industry and should be of much benefit to dealers.  Already, I have noticed an increase in the number of new cars.</P>
    <P>Recent extensions of the schemes available to pensioners, introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, are very significant, for instance, widows aged between 60 and 65 will now qualify for any free scheme to which their late husbands were entitled, including the free travel pass, which is particularly valuable.  It was of great concern to widows that on the death of their spouses when they needed help most, the various social welfare perks were discontinued.</P>
    <P>The free electricity allowance scheme is being extended to include night storage electricity.  This allows unused daytime units to be offset against the cost of night-time units.  Every pensioner using night storage heating will benefit from this change.</P>
    <P>The free travel pass for a companion is being extended to wheelchair users who are currently entitled to the Department of Social Welfare travel pass.  Pensioners aged 75 or over who no longer live alone will in future retain their eligibility to the free telephone rental allowance. The age limit which applies to the free electricity allowance is being reduced from 80 to 75 years.</P>
    <P>Another item which was the source of great concern and on which many representations were made was the probate tax.  The Department has responded positively by exempting spouses and providing relief at the rate of 30 per cent for farm land and buildings.  These changes are welcome and we can certainly commend this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's contribution to this debate yesterday was <Col N="1522" /> as politically cowardly as it was devoid of thinking, as feeble minded as it was waspish and as clear an exposure of the rudderless, media driven and vacuous style of Government as we are likely to see for a long time.  We were told that the 1994 budget presented this partnership Government with its first opportunity to show its stuff, in terms of budgetary policy.  Apparently, in February 1993 the partners were still aglow and breathless from their exertions, having formed a Government after the election of November 1992, that they were unable to produce anything other than a holding budget.  Brimful of radical reforming zeal the partners in Government had to put off doing anything about tax reform for an entire year.  Nevertheless, it still managed while doing nothing to impose the 1 per cent income levy in defiance of all received wisdom at the time.</P>
      <P>This is the occasion on which the Government is putting forward its goods. This is its showcase, its proposal for budgetary policy which should characterise the rest of its life.  I have to suggest that this is a hopeless, timid and tummy-rumble of a budget.  The mountains moved and a mouse was born; the man in the golden anorak postured as a reformer and in doing so has given the process of tax reform a bad name.</P>
      <P>I heard the Deputies opposite describe this as a pro-jobs budget.  If the purpose of the budget is to improve the tax climate in terms of employment its effect will be negligible.  The most important change effected by this Government was the commencement of a secret agenda to remove the PRSI ceiling.  The blue print for this is to be found in the NESC report and published in Labour Party policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the budget change in employer's PRSI is to add £550 to an employer's costs in employing a skilled worker on £25,000 per annum.  That employee will also be liable to employee's PRSI of approximately £70. This means that the payroll costs in relation to that employee will increase by £620.  The effect of this will be dramatic. In my constituency Guinness, a major employer, has calculated that following <Col N="1523" /> this change in PRSI its payroll costs will increase by £1.2 million this year.  If the management of that company in Park Royal comes to the conclusion that the answer is to let workers go in Ireland and to close down sections of its operation here the blame will fall on the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil.  Without doubt this will have the same effect in other high-tech industries where wages are reasonably high, such as computer manufacturing, software and so on where workers are frequently paid salaries in the range of £20,000 to £25,000. Employers will find that it will cost an extra £550 to employ a person at that level next year.  Taken in the context of the additional cost of PRSI any of the tax changes in the budget are derisory.</P>
    <P>The most obvious feature of last year's budget was the 1 per cent income levy. For some reason its abolition is the most obvious feature of this year's budget but, with the greatest respect, the removal of this levy has nothing to do with tax reform.  The levy was wrong, anti-work and imposed by this Government even though it flew in the face of all conventional advice.  Its removal is an act of fiscal reparation by the same clueless and vacant-minded people who put it in place last year.  While its removal is welcome the fact is an anti-work levy of 1 per cent was imposed in year one and removed as a reforming measure in year two of the Governments term of office.  This demonstrates the idiocy of the Government and its complete absence of strategy and consistency in its approach to taxation.</P>
    <P>In general terms the changes in the allowances are not radical as has been claimed in this House.  The Minister, who found himself in favourable circumstances and with an unprecedented majority in this House, increased personal allowances by a nominal 8 per cent, which after inflation works out at 5 per cent in real terms.  This is only a marginal change and does not represent radical tax reform.  The 27 per cent standard rate tax band has been broadened by 6 per cent but after inflation this amounts to a <Col N="1524" /> change of 3 per cent.  Again this does not represent radical tax reform.</P>
    <P>These measures have been dressed up and described and swallowed by some people in the media as major changes but they are not.  Some commentators have been taken in by them and believe that the 1994 budget is pro-jobs.  Disregarding the lunacy of the 1 per cent levy, its imposition and abolition, the combined effect of the increase in PRSI on the payroll for skilled workers will far outweigh the 3 per cent change in tax bands or the 5 per cent change in allowances. In effect, the Government is hammering employment at the skilled level.</P>
    <P>PRSI for the low paid is also an issue in the budget.  The usual fraudulent guff about a low rate of PRSI for the low paid has been trotted out again.  The low rate of PRSI will not apply to the first £9,000 of income but only to those whose incomes falls short of that figure.  For such low paid workers a new poverty trap has been created.  It would cost an employer far more than it is worth to pay an extra £500 or £1,000 to a low paid worker in the troubled clothing sector.  If an employee in the hard pressed clothing sector is offered overtime next year the cost to the employer could be enormous. A new ceiling has been imposed on those at the bottom of the ladder and a new trap has been created in the budget &mdash; a PRSI trap.</P>
    <P>If there was real reform PRSI would form part of the general tax system and would apply to everybody, including those in the public sector, at the same rate.  In this way there would be an extra £400 million to introduce genuine reform and exempt those on low incomes but there has been no hint of this.</P>
    <P>In the past the employer PRSI ceiling always corresponded with the employee PRSI ceiling.  Therefore, we can look forward next year to the employee PRSI ceiling being increased in the budget to £25,000.  This would mean that a person earning between £20,000 and £25,000 would have to pay an extra £350 in social insurance which in effect is a tax.  In the budget the employer and employee PRSI ceilings diverge by £4,500 but they will <Col N="1525" /> converge again and the average taxpayer at that level will be hammered for a further £350 in direct levies.  That is the secret agenda involved in removing the PRSI ceiling.  This was recommended in the NESC report and forms part of the printed Labour Party policy.  It is what we are going to get despite the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the residential property tax.  It is worth recounting the history of this tax.  In 1973 the coalition parties offered to take health charges off the rates.  Prior to the election held in that year Fianna Fáil decided to offer the electorate the abolition of rates. It is interesting to note that this bribe did not work.  However, in 1977 Fianna Fáil offered this bribe again and said that in addition to the abolition of rates it would also remove motor tax.  This time the electorate were interested, and the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, who were about to suffer a major defeat, countered that by saying they would get rid of domestic rates over four years.  However, the electorate decided the promise in the hand was worth more than the promise over four years and accepted the immediate bribe from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone wanted to put all the tax burden on income tax in those days, that meant putting all the tax burden on employment.</P>
      <P>The next Fine Gael-Labour Government between 1982 and 1987 introduced legislation to make local charges the responsibility of local authorities.  They were fought tooth and nail by Fianna Fáil on that issue.  In every local authority Fianna Fáil ran for election on the promise that it would never impose such charges.  Minister Smith was transformed from a teddy-bear to a teddy-boy in his antics the other day in this House forcing councils to impose charges although his party got huge numbers of seats by promising never to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1982-87 period Labour also proposed a property tax, the residential property tax of which we hear today and <Col N="1526" /> persuaded Fine Gael to bring it in. Labour really wanted something radically different.  In 1988, not that long ago, the Tánaiste, then leader of the Labour Party, published a document proposing the establishment of a house property tax with all houses valued over £25,000 being subject to a 2 per cent tax and all house property valued over £100,000 subject to a 3 per cent tax.  It means that any house worth over £75,000 in those days would have carried a tax liability of 2 per cent on £50,000 which is £1,000 a year.  A house worth £200,000 would have incurred a liability for its owner of £4,500 per annum.  That is the Labour Party's last published word on the subject of property tax, except for advertisements in the newspapers in the last election to which I will come in a moment.  It wanted a confiscatory, ideological wealth tax based on the family home.  It succeeded in persuading its partners in Government to implement it on two occasions &mdash; Fine Gael to introduce the tax and Fianna Fáil to impose it on the ordinary middle classes.  It has gone a long way towards the confiscatory system it proposed in the document &ldquo;Labour's Alternative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a pernicious ideological tax which would have devastating consequences if imposed.  That document was signed by Deputy Spring, and bears his signature.  If that is his real agenda on taxation it is no wonder he becomes choleric at challenges to his residential property tax.  It is his brainchild, he insisted on it and he is intent on implementing it, in the long term, to the extent set out in that document.  That is his agenda and let us not fool ourselves about it.</P>
    <P>In local elections 1991, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil again sought support on the basis that they were against charges.  In 1992 they used the property tax in a scandalous, disreputable and cynical series of election advertisements. The Taoiseach chose to use the property tax scare to try to head off the Labour Party challenge and the Tánaiste put advertisements in the newspaper to the effect that it had no such agenda.  Both <Col N="1527" /> were engaged in a massive political deception of the electorate and neither believed a word they said.  They were engaging in an electoral tussle where they misled the people into believing their agendas were very different from what we now see.</P>
    <P>Add to this squalid spectacle the ludicrous behaviour of Minister Ahern in recent days, and what I would describe as the inellectual Gorgonzola cheese of the property tax issue emits a very rancid smell indeed.  The Minister claims that houses worth £75,000 amount in total to 3 per cent of homes.  That claim is rubbish and made in bad faith.  He says there will be indexation, so is this charge on 3 per cent of homes the end of the Government's drive to shift tax from work to property?  I doubt it.  He now says that the changes in this year's residential property tax will yield £5 million.  That is the amount he has earmarked in the budget for Croke Park.  More power to the GAA, but does the Minister really think we are so stupid to believe that the property tax was introduced and widened to make available a £5 million fund to inject into Croke Park?  The reality is different.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach intend to get a much bigger yield than they are prepared to publicly admit. Why did they reduce the income threshold and increase the rate of taxation if it was to produce £5 million which the GAA could well have done without, given its enormous resources?  Undoubtedly it will welcome this funding with open arms, and more power to its elbow because at least it is making the effort to build up something of value in the community.  The Taoiseach has an infernal cheek and a brass neck to come into this House and attempt to browbeat the Opposition parties into supporting the residential property tax to yield £5 million and use that £5 million in the way he suggested.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in this House the Taoiseach attacked the Progressive Democrats, among others, for what he claimed was inconsistency in relation to the residential property tax.  At our first annual conference <Col N="1528" /> in 1986, when the party was scarcely four months in existence, the Progressive Democrats considered and approved a document on the reform of taxation in which it committed the party to the repeal of the present residential property tax.  We have been attacked for doing U-turns or being inconsistent by people in the media who know nothing of our party's policies.  We have opposed the residential property tax in every printed document we published on the issue. In 1988 we published another document which committed the Progressive Democrats to the abolition of the residential property tax.  We never supported it and always said we would repeal it.  The reasons we are opposed to it need to be stated; they have not changed and are becoming stronger all the time.  First, it is not a local Government tax but an extra central Exchequer wealth tax on homes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the wealth tax makes an unsustainable distinction between wealth in the form of a home and other forms of wealth such as land, valuables, shares, yachts etc.  If there is to be a wealth tax, which we oppose, there is no point in applying it to one form of asset alone. Thirdly, it is anti-family.  Four family adults, each earning £10,000, which is far less than the industrial wage, living in a home worth £150,000 are liable through the head of the household or the owner or occupier of the house to pay £1,250 a year in residential property tax.  If those four people split up and two moved into one house and two into another and the houses were worth the same, they would not be liable to pay anything.  This tax is anti-family.  It is illogical and vicious in its effects because it encourages people to leave home to avoid having to pay. This tax is arbitrary, capricious and completely unfair.  It is also anti-Dublin and anti-urban.  Property values and costs are much higher in Dublin.  The sacrifices people have to make to get a roof over their heads are much more substantial than in other parts of the country, but the effect of this tax is to cripple them where other people in similar circumstances in other parts of the country <Col N="1529" /> are left alone.  The tax is also unpredictable. Values change with changes in style and fashionableness of suburbs putting some people in the way of tax liabilities which are not of their choosing and which they cannot avoid.  The system of self-assessment makes it into a tax on honesty.  The more flexible one's valuer the less one pays.</P>
    <P>This is also an ideological tax.  It started off as a tax imposed on the many by the few in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government and it has now become a tax imposed by the Labour Party on a section of society which it seduced into believing it had given up on its tax and spend socialist ideology.  It is also a penal tax.  A post-tax liability of £2,000 or £3,000 imposed on a single person with a gross income of £40,000 because of where he or she lives is confiscatory and unjust. I defy anybody to say it is fair to require single people to pay £2,000 or £3,000 more than their neighbours because they inherit a house from their parents, especially as such people pay very high rates of tax and PRSI.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, suggested that the residential property tax should be allowable against income tax.  How illogical can she get?  She proposes to widen the tax base with one hand and narrow it with the other.  What is going on in the Labour Party when a Minister can propose such nonsense?</P>
    <P>I am not making a bleeding heart argument for the residents of Dublin 4.  This tax will do immense damage to tourism in rural areas by stopping people from buying and building holiday homes, chalets and mobile homes.  Any person who builds or buys such property will be liable to a tax on 2 per cent of its value which, on a £40,000 cottage, would mean an extra £800 per annum on a family's outgoings.  Why should such people not go to, say, Benidorm on holiday when the Government imposes such a tax on holiday homes here?</P>
    <P>The residential property tax was badly thought out and is grossly unfair.  We will not be browbeaten into supporting it simply because it has been introduced. <Col N="1530" /> We will reject it, we always have rejected it and will continue to do so.  If, on the other hand, the Government wishes to take some of the load off income tax by funding local government in a different manner, the Progressive Democrats will participate in and support the political process necessary to put that in place provided it is part of a downward shift in taxation, that every halfpenny raised is used to directly reduce tax on work and that it is part of a radical transformation and democratisation of local government. That has been the position of the Progressive Democrats since we were founded in 1985.</P>
    <P>In 1989 we entered into an agreement with the Fianna Fáil Party for four years of Government, central to which was a commitment to establish an all-party committee to examine the financing of local government.  When we made that proposal in this House the Labour and Fine Gael parties categorically rejected it.  The Labour Party &mdash; now posturing in Government with its penal confiscatory tax and demanding that everybody should agree this is fair and the proper way to widen the tax base &mdash; destroyed any possibility of reaching a consensus in this House on the issue of financing local government.  Members of that party should feel ashamed.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax is unfair and arbitrary.  Its retention and extension are errors in terms of policy and politics. Its feeble defence by the Government is an object and pitiable spectacle.  As well as the silly proposal of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, I am talking about the suggestion by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, that the property tax will be index-linked.  If that is his intention, why did he bother introducing it in the first place?  If he believes this is the way forward in regard to widening the tax base, why is he going through such contortions to keep £5 million in the Exchequer?  Everybody knows that the two Government parties are misleading the public as to their real intentions.</P>
    <P>If it was important to widen the tax base, why stop now?  Why is the Minister persisting with the £5 million for Croke <Col N="1531" /> Park having regard to the damage it is causing his party?  The property tax has nothing to do with creating an extra £5 million, it is Labour Party ideology and its brainchild.  It is also its Frankenstein and threatening to destroy that party.  We are now witnessing the wriggling and the public is witnessing the injustices which, when they were imposed on a small minority, were acceptable but not when they affect ordinary people who might have been foolish enough to vote for the Labour Party in the last election.</P>
    <P>I reject the Taoiseach's accusation that we are inconsistent on this subject when we have done everything possible in every policy document we published to get public support for the reform of local government finances.  When we first came into this House we tried to establish an all-party approach to achieve that. However, during the last election campaign we were confronted with two parties who placed advertisements in the newspapers, personally approved by the Taoiseach, stating they would not do &mdash; what they subsequently did &mdash; in the budget and threatening the electorate what would happen if it voted for other parties.  That is a disgrace and we reject the Taoiseach's onslaught on our party yesterday, which was well scripted by somebody with a sharper mind than he, as completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature of this budget is that it is the second in a series of two produced by this Government which, together, increased public spending by 17 per cent and taxation by 17 per cent while the rate of inflation was 2.5 per cent in the past two years.  This is an irresponsible tax and spend Government, an irresponsible tax and spend budget and has made only a feeble gesture at tax reform, with marginal changes at best.  Is a 3 per cent change in the 17 per cent band supposed to be tax reform?  In respect of abolishing its ludicrous and idiotic 1 per cent levy, are we supposed to be grateful when the Government gives back what it should never have taken in the first place? The budget speech was as vacuous as it was long.  It marks the end of any prospect <Col N="1532" /> that this Government, with its enormous majority and an inherited set of favourable economic circumstances, intends to do anything serious about tax reform.  In short, this is a great missed opportunity and all the bluff and bluster of a discredited Minister for Finance, who will probably be reshuffled after the European Parliament elections, looks sad by comparison with the damage he has done politically and economically by this flaccid budget.</P>
    <P>Instead of feeble changes, the Government could have opted for radical change.  As I did in 1987 in reply to Ray MacSharry's first budget, I would have indicated support for this budget if allowances had been transformed into basic rate tax credits, if bands and rates had been cut, if the last two budgets had controlled public spending and if the Government had come to grips with public sector pay.  This budget could have been the one we so badly needed.  Since our foundation this party voted with the Government on aspects of budgets with which we agreed.  We crossed the floor of the House to support it on the inclusion in the tax net of certain social welfare benefits, we have always pursued the position that what we would do in Government we would support in Opposition. That was not to be the case in respect of this budget, which is the greatest missed opportunity and abdication of an opportunity to do something about employment any Government has had in recent years.  Many voters are sadder and wiser today.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance proposed the tax changes in the budget they did so in circumstances of considerable media hype.  They went to great lengths to get the proper media spin in the newspapers the following day.  In the process they received favourable headlines the following day, but the electorate has seen through this tawdry spectacle and is now aware how poor a budget this really is.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 16, 21 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>As already announced, it is proposed to enlist 500 recruits in the Permanent Defence Force in the current year.  Eighty of the recruits will be for the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Recruits will be enlisted for a fixed period of five years in the Permanent Defence Force with a Reserve commitment of seven years.  A limited number of personnel, selected before the end of the five year term, will be given the option of a further period of service in the permanent Defence Force.  A decision regarding the number to be given this option of extending their service will be made nearer that time.</P>
    <P>The new recruits will receive pay and allowances on exactly the same basis as existing personnel.  They will also have the same opportunities to undergo training courses and to serve overseas.</P>
    <P>The criteria for selecting personnel for retention in service is laid down in Defence Force Regulations and will be based on such matters as conduct rating, physcial fitness, medical category, and successful completion of appropriate military courses of instruction.  Candidates will have to be recommended by their commanding officer for an extension of service and be specially selected by a selection board established for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the representative structures established for the Permanent Defence Force, PDFORRA was consulted in relation to the proposed recruitment. While it was not possible to concede all the changes sought, I extended the length of the term of engagement for the new recruits from three to five years on foot of the association's representations.</P>
    <P>In excess of 9,900 applications have been received in response to the recent advertisements and all eligible candidates will be interviewed over the coming weeks.  It is expected that the enlistment of successful applicants will commence in April.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for 1994 provides for an average strength of 11,300 non-commissioned personnel in the Permanent Defence Force.  I am satisfied that that strength level is sufficient to enable the force to carry out all of its allotted tasks.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Reserve Defence <Col N="1535" /> Force, FCA and First Line, was 16,682 on 31 December 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at Question Time on 22 December he gave a categoric assurance that the yellow pack recruitment campaign would not be advertised until prior agreement in that respect had been reached with PDFORRA?  We know from the PDFORRA statement that such an agreement was not sought or obtained. Will the Minister not agree that it was unfair to advertise for recruits five days after assurance and include the provision that some personnel will be retained after five years while not stating on what basis they will be retained.  The inclusion of that provision is not fair to existing personnel or to new recruits who will not know how they should perform in order to be retained.  Will the Minister not also agree that this recruitment campaign represents a breach with representative bodies of members of the Defence Forces and will ultimately lead to unrest within the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a departure from what has happened in the Defence Forces previously.  The Government has acted irresponsibly by proceeding with the recruitment campaign without laying out clearly the numbers to be recruited, the basis on which they will be recruited and the procedures that will be put in place to ensure fair treatment of the 500 recruits to enable them become permanent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe relations between the Government and the representative association will continue on the basis necessary to ensure good industrial relations when this type of treatment is meted out without prior discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The week before last I had a warm and lengthy meeting with PDFORRA, the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association.  I have said before that I do not like the designation &ldquo;other ranks&rdquo;. During the course of that discussion Deputy Barrett's point emerged. However, the vehemence of Deputy Barrett's attack on the Government and me on this occasion was not matched by the courtesy and civility of the group of men I met, representing their trade union. While they were relatively happy with the so-called contract soldiers for the five year period &mdash; I increased the period from three to five years &mdash; they thought the matter had not been finalised, but I believe they are happy with the induction of 500 other ranks into the Army.  With the Chair's permission, I will give a lengthy answer because the question was rather lengthy.  Those 500 recruits will come within the remit of PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>Under the five year contracts there is an inherent possibility of extending the period for 30 to 50 per cent of those recruits.  Deputy Barrett's yellow pack jibe is not good for the Defence Forces.  It is a demeaning and diminishing remark. There is nothing cheap about joining the Defence Forces.  Those recruits will have the same entitlements and outlets available to them as existing recruits.  They will be able to travel overseas, participate in courses and so on.  I would have thought that five years training in the Army as a prelude to entering the outside world would be good preparation.  It could be regarded as second or semi-third level education.  It would benefit individuals to be a member of the Defence Forces for even five years and their time spent there would also benefit their future employers and the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the age profile of the Defence Forces has risen to an unacceptable level? At one time those serving in the Defence Forces could leave after a certain period of time and secure employment as a civilian, but that is not the case today.  I welcome the recruitment of 500 personnel into the Defence Forces but not the basis on which they have been recruited.  Will the Minister not agree that he has a responsibility to ensure that the morale of the Defence Forces remains high, that the good team spirit which is necessary because of the nature of their work continues?  If he makes such a radical change it is my job as Opposition spokesperson to point out that it should be made on a well thought out basis so that those recruited will know what they must do to be retained.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The membership of the group established to review BIM is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Chairman:</i>
      </P>
      <P>Mr. Eamonn Doherty, Former Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Members:</i>
      </P>
      <P>Mr. Tadhg O'Donoghue, Chairman, BIM and Senior Taxation Partner, Craig Gardner, Price Waterhouse.</P>
      <P>Mr. Patrick Cummins, Head of Rural Economic Division, Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Mr. Frank Ward, Solicitor, Frank Ward and Company.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tom Carroll, Assistant Secretary, Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>Ms Sara White, Assistant Secretary, Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Thompson, Principal Officer, Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Mr. Greg Heylin, Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group are as follows: &ldquo;To review the role and functions of BIM as the principal State <Col N="1539" /> Development Agency for the sea fishing and aquaculture industries&rdquo;; and &ldquo;To review the management structures, funding, efficiency and effectiveness of BIM.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The review will take account of: submissions and recommendations from the industry; Government policies and objectives; European Community policies and objectives; and the roles and functions of other State agencies as they relate to the sea fishing and aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>The review will consider the sea fishing and aquaculture industries developmental roles and functions of BIM which may more appropriately be carried out by the Department of the Marine or other State agencies and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>The group will report to me during 1994 on their findings and will make such recommendations as they consider necessary or appropriate with regard to: BIM's role and functions; improvements in the management structure and operations of BIM; the funding of BIM, including funding from industry sources; and any legislative changes required having regard to the findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>As regards industry representation, I am committed to the inclusion of industry representatives on the group and to full consultation with the industry on all aspects of the review.  The process of consultation on the question of agreed nominees is continuing and no deadline has been put on the timing of the making of such a nomination.</P>
    <P>I should mention that I have received representations from a wide range of organisations in the fishing, processing and aquaculture sector and the boat building sector as well as from a major trade union.  In total, it has been proposed that some ten additional names should be added to the membership. Deputies will appreciate that to so increase the membership would render totally ineffective the work of the group, but, as I have said, I am open to some increased representation and in this regard consultation will continue.</P>
    <Col N="1540" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was to ask the Minister if he would appoint representatives from the fishing industry to the BIM Review Group and I am pleased to hear him say he is open to suggestions. On what basis will he seek representatives from the industry?  Would he agree that it appears there are divisions within the industry and that this is an ideal opportunity to bring people together from all sectors of the industry so as to provide a united front in developing a very important and valuable industry which can create a large number of jobs in parts of Ireland where employment is extremely scarce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to the wishes of the industry.  The terms of reference of the BIM Review Group clearly indicate that the fishing industry will be consulted.  I also added in my press release that a representative or representatives of the fishing industry would be included on the review board. However, I received so many requests for representations that if all those individuals and organisations were represented, the board would be quite unworkable.  In the final analysis it will be a matter for the chairman of the board, former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Eamonn Doherty, to decide what sector or sectors will be representative of the industry.</P>
      <P>I would not like to give the impression that because there is a delay in appointing a representative or representatives, the industry is in some way disunited.  At the December Council of the fishing industry I held back full implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy by my refusal to accede to Spain and Portugal's absolute access to our waters.  I received marvellous support on that occasion from the various organisations representing the fishing industry, who were very united in the national interest, and I pay tribute to them in that regard.  I hope that a representative or representatives will be nominated in a short period of time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 7, 8, 12, 15, 17 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The revised statement of roles of the Defence Forces was approved by Government on 21 September 1993 and is as follows: (a) to defend the State against armed aggression; this being a contingency, preparations for its implementation will depend on an ongoing Government assessment of threats; (b) to aid the civil power &mdash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State; (c) to participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace; (d) to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Community; and (e) to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time, for example, search and rescue, air ambulance service, ministerial air transport service, assistance on the occasion of natural or other disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services, dealing with oil pollution at sea.</P>
      <P>The role of the Defence Forces in aid to the civil power has not changed; as is made clear in the revised statement of roles; the Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management consultants have been employed to assist in the current review of the Defence Forces organisation undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group on the basis of the revised statement of roles.  Publication of a White Paper is not envisaged; it would be inappropriate to do so having regard to the fundamental review being undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group.  I am satisfied that there are structures in place to implement recommendations of the EAG.  The review will, of necessity, cover issues which have major security implications.  Accordingly, it may not be <Col N="1543" /> appropriate to publish the entire report of the EAG when it is received.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan provides for a comprehensive fisheries development plan designed to maintain and strengthen the fishing industry's contribution to the national economy.</P>
      <P>A total investment of £143 million will be made in the fisheries sector over the period of the National Development Plan.  This investment will underpin an integrated programme of development in the fisheries sector, which covers the following areas: the fishing fleet, fish processing and marketing, aquaculture, fishery harbours and training.  It is expected that the programme will generate an estimated 2,000 additional jobs.</P>
      <P>The details of the development programme and, in particular, the allocations of funding between the various areas, the eligibility criteria for the measures and the procedures for applying for grant-aid have not yet been finalised. These details will be part of the detailed operational programme for the fisheries sector, which is currently in preparation.</P>
      <P>As regards the fishing fleet in particular, the main aim of the proposed investment is to modernise and restructure the fleet in order to develop it to its maximum potential.  The general objective of the fleet development programme is to bring about a sustainable balance between the fleet and available fish resources.  Particular aims will be to: improve and modernise the fleet, enhance operational safety, improve the handling and hygiene standards, maximise the quantity, value and quality of landings by increasing take up of currently underutilised quota and non-quota stocks and maintain maximum employment consistent with long term viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of this development programme will be pursued through a wide range of specific measures including grants for modernisation, the introduction of a decommissioning scheme and steps to facilitate the selective entry of new modern vessels in the white fish sector.  The details of this programme are at present being negotiated with the <Col N="1545" /> European Commission and I would hope to be in a position to publish a comprehensive programme before the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I thank the Minister for his reply, it is very naïve.  It does not stipulate the amount of money which will be designated for the replacement of ships in the fishing fleet.  I am sure the Minister is aware that our fishing fleet is 30 years old.  How would the Minister like to drive from Castletownbere to Dublin and back, a distance of 500 miles, in a 30 year old Morris Minor, Ford Prefect or Volkswagen Beetle?  This is the distance these boats have to travel to get their catches.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan is probably talking about a vintage fleet.  I agree that some parts of the fishing fleet could, to say the very least of it, benefit from renovation, modernisation and replacement.  That is what the new plan is about and hopefully it will bring about a modern fleet.  With regard to the funding available to modernise and update fleets, at the December Fisheries Council there was an extension from 25 to 30 years in terms of the ships which can qualify for such funding.  It is a sad story to have to <Col N="1546" /> tell the world that our fishing fleet has to travel our coastal waters and the high seas in 30 year old vessels.  This is not good enough.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first subjects I addressed in my new portfolio as Minister for Defence related to this area.  This is a very sensitive area in military terms. It was suggested that maybe the answer to the problem was a code of conduct. Such a code of conduct is currently being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to remind the House that men and women joining the Army are not requested to give details of their sexual orientation.  Regardless of whether one is of a homosexual or a heterosexual orientation, one would want to behave in a normal manner <Col N="1547" /> during the course of one's service.  It would not be good for military discipline if individuals engaged in inter-personal relationships during Army time.  This is entirely a matter for themselves outside Army time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What criteria do the Army authorities apply in regard to what they would regard as a breach of Army discipline which arises from inter-personal relationships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would have known the answer to that question, but I have no problem about answering it.  It must be recognised that overt homosexual and heterosexual activity within a military unit or installation would have a seriously detrimental effect on discipline, morale and cohesion within the Defence Forces and could be regarded as an act prejudicial to good order and discipline and, therefore, an offence under military law.  I think the same criteria would apply to Dáil Éireann.  I think the Deputy will agree that if a person in Dáil Éireann went about the place expressing his or her sexual orientation with someone of a similar disposition discipline would break down and it would be unacceptable. Therefore, the criteria which apply in Leinster House would apply to the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, to the best <Col N="1548" /> of my knowledge the answer is no.  With regard to the first part of the question, the answer is that it would depend on the circumstances in each case.  I cannot anticipate what the sexual behaviour or otherwise of an individual or individuals would be, but I imagine it would be measured against what is perceived to be the heinousness of the act and the location, nature and type of the act.  I think an action has been taken in one case.  I did not mean to mislead the House in regard to an allegation, but it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it.  I might have misled the House in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Dauphin helicopters undergo first-line servicing every 50 flying hours, with inspections on an annual basis.  All such servicing and inspections are carried out by the Air Corps.  A major overhaul is necessary after 3,600 hours flying or eight years and for this purpose a Dauphin helicopter underwent a scheduled inspection, modification and maintenance programme at the premises of the manufacturer in France during 1993.  The total cost involved was of the order of £900,000.</P>
      <P>The overhaul involved a detailed examination of every component part and was availed of to establish the condition of the aircraft, particularly as it had been operating in an extreme maritime environment, and to draw up new maintenance schedules specifically related to fleet usage by the Air Corps.  Such schedules may only be prepared by the manufacturer of the aircraft and require to be approved by the domestic aircraft certification authority &mdash; in this case in France.</P>
      <P>There is no plan to sell the Dauphin helicopters as they continue to be required for fishery protection, search and rescure missions and other operational duties.</P>

    <P>The UN school was established on 16 September 1993 and the school staff is <i>in situ</i> and working in such areas as briefings for personnel detailed for overseas service and the design of various courses of training.  The first courses for Irish personnel about to depart for service with <Col N="1551" /> UN peace-keeping missions will take place later this month and in March.</P>
    <P>There is no objection in principle to accepting students from other countries in due course.  Considerable interest in the school has been shown by a number of foreign Governments and the question of providing courses for students from other countries is being pursued at present.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his best wishes on the one hand and I will certainly raise the matter with Mr. Annan.  When I set up this UN school, which is now fully operational in the Curragh Camp, at the beginning of my portfolio, I made the same suggestion that we open it up to other countries.  It is interesting to note that three countries have evinced an interest in coming here, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Hungary.  Unfortunately, we would be in competition with other peace-keeping nations because there are UN schools in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria.  These countries have long established <Col N="1552" /> schools dedicated to the task we have given our school.  Our school is fully operational, open to all countries and, as the Deputy properly says, we probably have an outstanding record of peace-keeping compared to any other country in the world.</P>

      <P>I make no apologies for my views expressed on radio today because I have always felt and continue to feel that peace-keeping is exactly what it means, peace-keeping.  Peace enforcement is a contradiction in terms; one cannot enforce peace.  In response to a <Col N="1553" /> request from the United Nations we introduced the Defence Forces (Amendment) Bill, 1993, to give effect to its request to being an enforcement element into its mandate.  However, in the meantime my views have not changed.  Consistency has probably been one of the greatest weaknesses of my political life and a consistency of opinion expressed at that time was as valid as it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether the next contingent will serve under the new peace-keeping mandate from the UN?  I am very pleased that none of our troops was injured during this term of service.  Will the Minister agree that wisdom is now prevailing and that the short entry to the whole area of peace enforcement was sufficient to show that peace-keeping is far better than peace enforcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the latter part of the Deputy's question that peace-keeping is inconsistent and illogical in the context of peace enforcement; they are self exclusive.  In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have been in Camp Shannon under its present Commanding Officer, Commandant Maurice O'Donoghue.  I should like to pay tribute, as has Deputy Barrett, to the 80-man company there.  They have done magnificent work, have integrated into the local community in an extraordinary way, in a manner in which we in Ireland uniquely have a capacity to integrate <Col N="1554" /> wherever we may be; we are born missionaries whether in Army uniform or clerical garb.  Altogether, I should like to pay a special tribute to those men.</P>
      <P>In response, to the Deputy's question about a rotation, I understand that that matter will be examined by the Government in the very near future, that it must be examined before 10 March next.  The Deputy will be aware that the Army Chief of Staff, General Noel Bergin, and the Director of Operations are visiting Baidoa on Monday next for a number of days to assess the position first-hand and to advise both me and the Government in their military wisdom, on the continuance of our presence in Somalia.</P>
      <P>As I said on the radio at lunchtime, I should like to think that our response to a new rotation would be positive because, since Somalia hit the headlines in August 1992 &mdash; arising out of my visit there and the subsequent visit of our esteemed President and myself &mdash; it has become part of what we are.  Therefore, I should like to think that we would respond to what I would consider to be the majority will of the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he is entirely inconsistent in relation to this question of peace enforcement and peacekeeping in that he is on record on 6 July 1973 as trenchantly supporting the motion before this House that we send troops to Somalia in pursuit of the UNOSOM II peace enforcement mandate, arguing at that time that we had a responsibility in relation to peace enforcement, contending that it could not be left entirely to the larger powers.  Perhaps the Minister would reread his contribution in July 1993 and his contribution on the amendment of the Defence Act which was necessary to allow Irish troops participate in the UNOSOM II peace enforcement operations; when he will realise, that I was virtually the only Member of this House who argued against such a move.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now come round to my view in relation to this issue of peacekeeping versus peace enforcement. Therefore, I take it the Minister will not <Col N="1555" /> be bringing further motions before this House &mdash; certainly for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government &mdash; to send Irish troops on peace enforcement operations?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy says, there is no &ldquo;never&rdquo; in politics as I cannot say what may or may not happen either in the near or distant future, I cannot give the kind of undertaking he refers to. In relation to his suggestion that I have been inconsistent, nothing could be further from the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise it is there but I was responding to a request for a mandate which was then in existence and the Government was doing its duty by the international community, by Somalia in particular.  Of course, I had to respond in that particular fashion but that in no way is inconsistent with the views I have always expressed.  The Deputy did not convert me to the idea that we should be a peacekeeping nation <i>simpliciter</i>.  Therefore, there is nothing inconsistent between one and the other.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Eighty recruits will be enlisted in the Naval Service in the current year.  I am satisfied that the recruitment of the additional personnel will enable the Naval Service to continue to perform all of its allotted tasks for the foreseeable future.  However, the strength of the service will be kept under review in the light of operational requirements.</P>
      <P>The question of establishing additional units of An Slua Muirí is at present being examined.  It is not possible at this stage to say what will be the outcome of that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the additional recruits to the Naval Service, would the Minister agree that recruits are one thing but that the lack of sufficient vessels to undertake the task is quite another?  Could he perhaps combine this question with No. 19 in relation to the possibility of securing additional Naval Service vessels to enable the Naval Service perform the duties expected of them, in particular, in terms of fisheries protection and, latterly, in addition to fishery protection, the possibility of securing our shores against the importation of drugs? Taking all of these matters together, would the Minister agree that, in addition to greater strengths in the Naval Service, we need more vessels, to perform not only a function for this country but for the European Union as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, we have seven fishery protection vessels more than capable of doing the job and performing the functions required of them.  They are at present fully operational and fully crewed.  In addition to the Naval vessels, of course, we have the Air Corps so that there is an interface between the Air Corps and the Navy in the strongest possible manner. They guard our waters very thoroughly. I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy, not for the first time, that in addition to <Col N="1557" /> our existing capacity to patrol our fishing grounds and present jurisdiction, we shall have two new Casa aircraft between June and September next.  Therefore, we will have additional elements, as it were, to guard our fishing waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, would the Minister be realistic: we have seven vessels and jurisdiction over 16 per cent of European Union waters.  The Minister himself admitted and fought very hard, at the Council of Ministers' meeting, in relation to the Irish box. Would he agree that the reality is that Spanish vessels, in particular, are ravaging our sea waters, stealing our fish, simply because we do not have the capacity to provide adequate protection of our fishery waters because of the lack of naval vessels?  Might I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, if he continues to make the type of statements he has just made, it will render it extremely difficult for us to make a proper case to the European Union, which has a responsibility to assist this country in patrolling 16 per cent of EU waters, to ensure that whatever agreements are put in place are adhered to, so that we will not have a continuation of Spanish and Portuguese boats ravaging our seas daily?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's question to a point.  But the reality is that, within our present capacity &mdash; the availability of the type of vessels I have just outlined and the connection between the Navy and the Air Corps &mdash; we are well able to manage fisheries protection. That is not to suggest for one moment &mdash; and I would not want the Deputy to go away with any other message &mdash; that any additional vessel or aircraft we might have, within the context of the patrolling of 16 per cent of European Union waters, would not be very welcome indeed.  Of course, it would be my intention to pursue that very strongly.  In fairness to the Navy and the Air Corps, they are doing a very good job with the available vessels and aircraft they have.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps has a total of 38 fixed-wing planes and helicopters.  All of these aircraft undergo continuous programmes <Col N="1559" /> of major overhaul and routine maintenance to ensure their airworthiness but they may also require unscheduled maintenance to correct faults which may occur.  The number of aircraft available for operational duties at any one time varies accordingly.</P>
    <P>The aircraft inventory includes six Fouga jet aircraft of which four are currently in service and two are undergoing scheduled maintenance.</P>
    <P>In accordance with an EU-approved programme, a contract has been placed for the purchase of two new CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft.  The new aircraft which will be used for the purpose of fisheries surveillance operations, are due for delivery in the latter half of this year.  In June 1991 delivery was taken of a CASA CN 235 aircraft and this has been carrying out fisheries surveillance operations on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>The programme of pilot training in the Air Corps is ongoing and there are sufficient aircraft available for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that concern has been expressed that there will not be sufficient radar operators to operate the new aircraft which will be delivered in the latter half of this year?  What steps are being taken to ensure that the necessary staff are trained to operate the new aircraft &mdash; which will be a great addition to the patrol capacity &mdash; to ensure that they are fully operational and capable of being used to the fullest extent?</P>

If the Deputy gave me an opportunity to examine it I would either correspond with him or he could put down a question on this matter for the next Question Time.  The CASA aircraft will be coming on stream in the latter half of the year.  I would be anxious that they go into operation immediately.  I will certainly take account of the views expressed by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Marine has no responsibility for the provision <Col N="1562" /> of funding for ferries to the islands off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>At present, funding for transport to islands is available from the following sources:</P>
      <P>1.  Section 2 of the Aran Islands Transport Act, 1946, empowers the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to contract with any person for the carrying on of a shipping service for reward between Galway and the Aran Islands.  The Act also enables the Minister to pay, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, an annual subsidy to the operator providing the service.  There is no analogous legislation in relation to other offshore islands.</P>
      <P>2.  An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta provides the ferry and assists financially the ferry service to Oileán Cléire, County Cork.</P>
      <P>3.  Údarás na Gaeltachta assists financially the ferry service and the winter helicopter to Toraigh, County Donegal, provides the ferry for the service to Arranmore, County Donegal and subsidises the air service to the Aran Islands, County Galway, provided by Aer Arann.</P>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development, which is chaired by the Department of the Marine, is currently examining all aspects of island development, including the important question to access transport and the possibility of obtaining EU funding to improve access.  I expect a report on the committee's work this spring.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the financial losses being suffered by the Irish fishing fleet due to inclement weather conditions since November 1993; and the proposals, if any, he has to assist fishermen who are in severe financial difficulties because of the appalling weather conditions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, conscious that bad weather in recent months has severely restricted the activities of segments of the fishing fleet in certain areas.  I have recently received strong representations from a number of the fishing industry organisations and the matter was also raised by industry representatives generally at the regular monthly meeting which was held earlier this week between senior officials of the Department of the Marine, BIM and the industry organisations.</P>
      <P>While the restriction of fishing activity due to bad weather is a normal feature of the fishing industry, concern has been expressed that the extent of down time over recent months is such that exceptional circumstances of hardship arise and also that the viability of fishing enterprises may be at risk.  There are of course other factors such as weak markets which are also at play.  The landings information available to the Department of the Marine does not show any consistent pattern.  Landings at some ports are generally on a par with landings for the same period last year, while in others there is evidence that the landings have declined considerably in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, established mechanisms under the social welfare code and supplementary welfare allowances scheme to provide income support where certain conditions are met.  The coverage of the fishing industry by social insurance schemes is, however, not comprehensive and the major new scheme of optional social insurance for share fishermen will not provide cover for unemployment until January 1995.  I have advised the Minister for Social Welfare of the difficult financial situation in the fishing sector and asked for his full assistance in ensuring that fishermen will be facilitated to the maximum extent possible under existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also asked BIM for an urgent report on the size and extent or genuine hardship within the industry arising from the exceptional weather conditions that <Col N="1566" /> have applied and, if this is warranted, to bring forward proposals to deal with those exceptional difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have also written to the European Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr. Palleokrassas drawing his attention to the problems which arise and asking for his assistance both to deal with the short term difficulties as well as the opening of a debate on the setting of a long term mechanism to handle this type of exceptional occurrence.</P>
    <P>The assistance of the fishing industry organisations has been sought in assessing the extent of genuine hardship as well as their ideas as to how best this could be dealt with both in the short and longer terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the trouble to which the Minister has gone to give such a comprehensive reply.  It indicates that he understands the problem that has arisen from the desperate weather of the past three months.  Will the Minister keep me informed about his discussions with the Minister for Social Welfare because as things stand many fishermen are on the breadline?  Some of them have only fished for about three days in the past three months.  Will the Minister get the Government to make a special fund available to help fishermen who are in serious trouble with repayments and who are having difficulty surviving?  If it was market gardeners in north county Dublin, potato growers in County Donegal or cereal growers in the midlands a special fund would be set up.  Such a fund was set up in the past ten years.  Why can the fishing industry not be treated in the same way when faced with natural disaster such as we have seen over the last few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says and he is right that some fishermen have fished for only three or four days in the last number of months. I sympathise with their plight and I agree that what is good for the farmers should be good for the fishing industry. I have always felt that, and that is why I am pressing this issue raised in the <Col N="1567" /> Deputy's question.  The fishing industry has been the poor relation here for too long and the attention given to what is known as the maritime or marine ethos was merely humbug.  Since I became Minister for the Marine I would like to think that I have put some flesh on the bones and will continue to try to do so in difficult circumstances, because fishing is not perceived in this island nation as being top of the pile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Oral Question No. 34 and Written Question No. 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Council of Fisheries Ministers adopted at their December meeting a new Regulation which establishes a Community system governing the issue of licences for fishing vessels and the minimum information to be contained in licences.  This new system will apply from 1 January 1995.  The purpose of this regulation is to bring a degree of uniformity into the general licensing system in the Community and to standardise, at a minimum level, the amount and presentation of the information contained in licences. The underlying aim is to improve control of the Community's fishing fleet.  As a member state with a large fisheries zone to control, I support measures which will improve our ability to monitor fishing activity in that zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new system all vessels in the Community will have to be licensed and <Col N="1569" /> carry the licence on board.  A member state may, however, by derogation exempt boats of less than ten metres from the obligation to carry the licence on board where those boats operate exclusively within the maritime jurisdiction of that member state.</P>
    <P>The licence will have to include certain minimum information in relation to the vessel such as registered number, tonnage, engine capacity and the fleet category assigned to the vessel under the Community's multi-annual guidance programme for the fleet.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this will mean that, whereas at present only fishing vessels in the Irish fleet over 65 feet in length are required to hold a licence, as and from 1 January 1996 every vessel in the Irish fishing fleet will be required to have a fishing licence.</P>
    <P>It will also require a redesign and standardisation of the format of fishing licences.  Plans to introduce the new system are being developed and will be discussed with the fishing industry in the context of the ongoing development of licensing policy generally.</P>
    <P>The Council has also discussed the question of the introduction of a further permit type licensing system whereby fishing vessels with specific restrictions on their activities such as pressure stock licences would be subject to a general Community licensing framework.  The Council is to decide on this matter by the end of 1994.  I have an open mind on the matter, particularly as the introduction of such permits could be particularly important in the context of any changes in the present controls which apply to the Spanish fleet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline his view on the fishing permit and how it will affect Irish fishermen?  I understand the Minister did not adopt a position at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers but perhaps he will confirm the matter was discussed and the position he intends to take.  Is it true that a decision on the matter has been deferred to the next meeting?  If that is the case, the <Col N="1570" /> Minister should clearly outline his position and the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was discussed to a certain extent.  My position is, was, and will be that the permit must not be complicated and that it must be easily understood, succinct, pithy and to the point.  As I see it &mdash; and I have expressed my concern on this before &mdash; layers of bureaucracy are beginning to creep into the fishing fleet, not only the Irish fishing fleet but the European Union fleet.  New licences, new permits and new regulations are about to be introduced which will cause more harm than good. I want to examine the situation to see whether it is to the advantage of Irish fishermen which is my utmost concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister envisage permits will be enforced?  It is all very well to bring in a system of permits but it makes a laughing stock to introduce controls if they cannot be enforced, as we see in relation to the behaviour of the Spanish fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably a maritime protection vessel will ask to see the permit but if the permit is not available quite simply questions are asked.  It is the same as any licensing system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of the permit?  Is it a provision to restrict access of non-European Union fishing fleets to European Union waters or is it a means whereby there is control of European Union fleets within European Union waters so that their location, capacity to fish and so on can be monitored and regulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is aware that the proposed introduction of this system has frightened the lives out of Irish fishermen as they fish for so many different species, depending on the season, that they would find it extraordinarily difficult to manage a permit <Col N="1571" /> system.  When the Spaniards and French fish in our waters they primarily fish for hake but Irish fishermen are all-rounders and might fish for 20 or 30 different species during the year.  The permit system is a source of fear among fishermen because they feel it will curtail their activities.  Will the Minister allay their fears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of whether the fishing permit will be incorporated in the licence is still a matter under discussion with the Commission.  The permit will set out the fishing activities in which the vessel will be authorised to engage.  I can understand the Deputy's point of view and I would not wish to frighten the life out of anybody.  The licensing system was raised and I expressed concern that it was another layer of bureaucracy.  The permit would be incorporated in the licence, presumably, but the situation is still up in the air.  I will take account of the Deputy's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it proposed to verify the type of fish trawlers can fish for?  As Deputy Deasy stated, Irish fishermen can fish for different species each week, for example they might fish for mackerel this week and pelagic fish the following week.  How is it proposed to license that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious that some fishermen will feel that the proposals relating to the categorisation of licensing of a fleet would, if implemented, impact on the rights they have exercised over the years.  I assure them and the Deputy that this will not be the case.  One of the objectives of the present criteria is to ensure that no fisherman will be prevented from continuing with the fishing activity he or she has practised over recent years.  The categories chosen are broad and many boats will fall into multiple categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to see hardship.  Things are difficult enough for the fishing fleet and, given what Deputy Deasy said in relation to some sections of the fishing <Col N="1572" /> fleet not being able to get out for some three months, we would not wish to add to their difficulties.  I will make the position as clear and simple as possible.</P>

      <P>In 1987, at its party conference the Progressive Democrats voted in favour of a tax on what it described as &ldquo;all real property&rdquo; as a method of funding local government.  Deputy Harney who was a Front Bench spokesperson for the party at that time must surely be aware of this.</P>
      <P>On 11 February 1988, the then Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley stated in this House: &ldquo;Our party are committed to a comprehensive property tax on buildings and land&rdquo;.  He went on to refer to its detailed property tax proposals.  To my mind &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; include the family home.  It was argued trenchantly at the 1987 Progressive Democrats' conference that a tax on property would catch everyone, including those involved in the black economy. <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 11 October 1987 stated: &ldquo;everyone has to have a place to live&rdquo;.  It was clear, therefore, that its proposal of a tax on property extended to the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its policy document entitled &ldquo;Employment, Enterprise and Taxation&rdquo; published in November 1988 the Progressive Democrats proposed, on page 46, that £125 million be raised by way of a local property charge.  It stated: &ldquo;More often than not, the greater the value of such a house the more likely is one's ability to pay&rdquo;.  It went on to state that the actual amount to be collected from each household would reflect &ldquo;the basic value of all services consumed by such households and also the value of the property concerned&rdquo;.  I could not describe that as anything other than a <Col N="1627" /> property tax.  Therefore, in relation to the statements by Deputy McDowell and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, there is a need for clarification and an explanation.  We would be delighted to receive it in view of their forceful participation in the debate on the issue of the property tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the initiatives in the budget to promote job creation.  It has been estimated that there will be a growth rate of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent this year.  If that is the case it should lead to the creation of up to 21,000 net new jobs.  We have, possibly for the first time, a Government which has recognised the capacity of small and medium-sized businesses to create new jobs.  Having regard to the various measures in the budget, by the end of this year these businesses will have created a considerable number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>The reduction in employers' PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent in respect of those earning less than £9,000 per annum marks a major step forward. Despite the criticism by the Opposition parties the organisations representing the clothing and footwear industries in particular have been very positive in their comments and have made it clear that employment costs in those industries were simply too high.</P>
    <P>This reduction in PRSI should not be taken in isolation.  Having regard to the rescheduling of telephone charges, small businesses, particularly those which are export orientated, have made considerable savings in recent months.  This has led to a reduction in costs for industries with high employment levels and which face keen foreign competition in marketing their goods and services.  In addition, the Government has decided to simplify the documentation that has to be submitted by small businesses to the Revenue Commissioners and other State organisations.  This is to be welcomed because for far too long those involved in small businesses spent too much of their valuable time dealing with unnecessary paper work.  I am glad the <Col N="1628" /> Minister for Finance has presented this proposal.</P>
    <P>The challenge that small and medium-sized businesses now face is to create the jobs they said they would if costs were reduced in the budget.  We hope by the end of this year there will have been a considerable increase in employment in this sector.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the question of the debts of the health boards and hospitals has been addressed in a forceful fashion. This matter is of great significance to the suppliers of goods and services, many of whom can ill afford to wait for payment of moneys due to them by these establishments.  Now the slate will be cleaned and the onus will rest with health boards and hospitals not to again get heavily into debt by overspending their budgets with resultant failure on their part to meet their legitimate commitment to their suppliers.  Small businesses have been under tremendous pressure and some have gone out of business through not being paid on time.  This issue has been addressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who is anxious to ensure that payments are made to suppliers by statutory organisations within a specified period of time. A further way in which the Minister can make a contribution to the development of small businesses and the well-being of existing businesses would be to give the right to suppliers of goods and services in these circumstances to levy a penalty in the event of late payment as happens in regard to late payment to the Revenue Commissioners.  This would be a considerable contribution to the development and well-being of small industries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent conclusion of a new national programme by the Taoiseach, the Government and the social partners.  As shown since 1987 the best way forward is by way of consensus, not confrontation.  Through the excellent programmes begun in 1987 there has been a dramatic fall in the loss of work days through strikes and other interruptions to production.  That has probably been the single most constructive <Col N="1629" /> contribution to the tremendous growth in exports, we have been able to show we can meet delivery deadlines, possibly for the first time, without serious interruption of supplies.  That has been a most important contribution to the development of our exports which, it is hoped, will continue to thrust forward and thereby make a contribution towards the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Taoiseach's continued and relentless search for peace on this island.  When achieved it will have a major impact on further development, socially and economically.  Imagine the ease with which we will be able to sell this island as a whole in terms of economic production and tourism when it is shown that we have at last achieved peace.  I urge the Taoiseach to continue his strong efforts to achieve the goal we all desire and for which the world waits.</P>
    <P>One or two comments were made about specific aspects of the budget which I want to refute.  The first was a dismissive comment by Deputy McDowell about the £5 million which is to be given to Croke Park for its further development.  The GAA has made an enormous contribution to social development.  Any Saturday or Sunday morning or weekend evening one sees hundreds of thousands of young people and adults productively engaged in sporting activities.  That type of input from the GAA could not be purchased for any sum.  Therefore, it is good to invest in the GAA and help it develop its headquarters to international standards because it is part of our heritage and history.</P>
    <P>This year of the family is throwing up a number of difficulties.  It is with great sadness that we note the two recent incidents of babies found in tragic circumstances. I am glad that additional moneys are being provided in the area of marriage counselling.  However, moneys should be expended on pre-marriage counselling for young people, because I am concerned at the numbers who, for a variety of reasons, rush into marriage without making adequate preparation socially or economically.  That is something we must address to try to ensure <Col N="1630" /> that young people understand their responsibilities if they decide to get married, particularly at an early age.</P>
    <P>The budget concentrates on continuing to develop the climate for sound job creation and the social and caring aspect of recent Government policy.  In that regard it should be commended to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Flood, for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this budget for a number of reasons.  First, it maintains the financial discipline to which we have become accustomed, it brings about tax reform which will be beneficial to employers and employees like, it protects those who depend on social welfare for their income and provides extra funding for essential services and development.</P>
      <P>On financial discipline, the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 commenced a programme of restoring the finances of this State to a healthy position and I am glad that each year since then the Government has been successful in addressing that issue.  This year the budget deficit will be less than 1 per cent, something on which we should compliment the Government. Interest and inflation rates are at an all time low and although the Government has done an excellent job in creating an environment in which jobs should be created, we are all disappointed that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax reform is welcome.  Again it is important to point out that in a country as small as ours where the tax base is also small it is a great achievement to be able to shift the burden of taxation towards the creation of employment and remove many of the tax penalties from the employers and employees.  There are so many beneficial changes in the budget that I do not have time to mention them all.  The removal of the 1 per cent levy is welcome and the improvement in the tax bands and the tax free allowances is worthwhile.  Of particular importance is the reduction in PRSI, especially in the context of employers' liability.  The farmers' organisations and the Irish Countrywomen's <Col N="1631" /> Association were concerned about aspects of the probate tax, the Minister took that into account and removed probate tax from the transfer of property from spouse to spouse, which will be generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>The motor trade benefited from reductions in taxation.  Capital taxes have been reduced and, of particular importance in my own constituency, the urban renewal programme was introduced.  I am particularly pleased that Monaghan town has been included in that programme. During the short time I was Minister for the Environment I asked officials in the Department to go to Monaghan to look at a project suitable for urban renewal.  I am glad the Government included Monaghan town in its first urban renewal programme since then.</P>
    <P>We must all welcome the fact that the needs of those depending on social welfare payments are protected, with a 3 per cent increase for those on social welfare assistance and a 4 per cent increase for those on disability and unemployment benefits.  There have been many other welcome improvements in that area.  For example, when a husband in receipt of an old age pension and certain benefits dies his widow will now be entitled to retain those benefits, whereas formerly those entitlements were taken from her if she had not reached the age of 66 years. That is a very humane approach and I compliment the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare for introducing that provision.  The children's allowance will be increased and the regulations in respect of the carer's allowance have been amended.  It will now be easier for people to receive that allowance.  While I welcome the fact that the first £100 of income will be excluded, the Minister should examine the degree of incapacity of the person being cared for so that the people, mainly women, who care for those who are severely incapacitated might receive an allowance irrespective of income.  Many carers are completely home-bound as a result of the incapacity of the person for whom they are caring and that must be recognised.  They are <Col N="1632" /> making a great contribution, first, to the person needing care and, second, to the State.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Social Welfare Bill, will the Minister for Social Welfare examine the contribution conditions for disability benefit?  Some years ago a change was made whereby a person could no longer claim disability benefit if he or she only had credits in the contribution year. In other words, one would have to have worked for 13 weeks in the contribution year in order to qualify for disability benefit in the year in which one required benefit.  For example, if a person had a serious heart complaint or had to undergo surgery in 1992-93, returned to work as soon as possible thereafter, but becomes ill this year he or she will be entitled to only £25 per week disability benefit.  That anomaly should be addressed because people can become ill through no fault of their own.  People should not be penalised for becoming ill in the year following the contribution year.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs is a major challenge for all of us.  In the past I called on all State agencies, Departments of State, local authorities and health boards to focus on job creation and the maintenance of jobs.  That is essential.  We are all aware of cases where regulations are not implemented, or indeed are implemented too rigidly, leading to the loss of jobs or preventing the creation of new jobs.  There must be a sense of urgency in the planning process and account must be taken of the job content and what people will do when they receive planning permission.  The building of a wall at the back of one's house is job creation, as somebody must build the wall, make the blocks and so on.  The planning authorities have a major role to play in the creation and retention of jobs. Departments of State and agencies should focus on job creation.  It was brought to my notice recently that because of a delay in making a decision on the implementation of an EC directive by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Revenue Commissioners, a major contract for the <Col N="1633" /> export of beefburgers to South Africa was lost.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards have been established and should be flexible in making decisions.  We all know people with good ideas for starting up small industries or services, and county enterprise boards must take risks on their behalf.  If a person has a worthwhile project which may create jobs, county enterprises boards should not look for gilt edge security from the person involved and in the process prevent him or her from proceeding.  I look forward to seeing those boards taking risks and giving people encouragement and an opportunity to start up small industries or services which will create jobs.  I also welcome the announcement of the community employment programme in the budget.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to some specific issues, one of which is of major importance in my constituency, namely, non-national roads.  I welcome the Government's decision to provide an extra £15 million for those roads which is in addition to the £86.9 million announced in the Estimate.  That is a total of £101.9 million, an increase of 36 per cent on the previous year.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the particular difficulties in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, the many reasons for those difficulties, and that in allocating funds he will take account of them.  During my time as Minister for the Environment I was pleased to substantially increase the allocation to both those counties and to introduce novel programmes such as the pilot scheme for county roads.  Under that scheme the local community carry out work such as cutting hedges and cleaning drains to keep the water off the roads, and the councils carry out work on the hard core surface.  That scheme has been very successful.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance and his officials will be conscious of the needs of Border areas in the context of the INTERREG programme which will be coming on stream shortly.  I would be opposed to any proposal to disburse that money to maritime frontiers in Europe; <Col N="1634" /> in other words, areas along the coast of Ireland would benefit from the money. That would be acceptable if sufficient money is provided, but the allocation will be useless if it is diluted to the extent that areas do not benefit adequately from it. The INTERREG programme was originally established for Border areas and should be maintained for those areas until the roads, in particular, are developed to a standard similar to that in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to build 100 houses in my constituency.  The farming community will be assisted in a number of ways by the budget proposals including those on capital and probate taxes and by the announcement that premiums which are so important, particularly for small farmers, will issue more promptly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to provide £5 million to the GAA for the development of Croke Park.  I hope some Ministers will consider providing a contribution from available funds, particularly those for Border regions, towards the development of the GAA football pitch in Clones which has been designated as the main pitch for the nine counties of Ulster.  An allocation should be made to develop those grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputies from Border constituencies should recognise the great contribution made by the International Fund for Ireland to social and economic development and tourism in that area.  That organisation's annual report is published today.  I compliment William McCarter and the International Fund for Ireland for the good work they have done.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, to convey to the International Fund for Ireland and those countries who subscribe to it the appreciation of those living in the Border regions.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach and the Government on an excellent budget which will benefit the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Foxe.  I will concentrate on <Col N="1635" /> the social aspects of the budget.  I acknowledge the special assistance to persons with disabilities and the handicapped. The provision of £500,000 through the Department of the Environment towards pilot projects aimed at improving access for people with disability, especially those in wheelchairs, to outdoor amenities and facilities is welcome and only underlines the importance of the full implementation of the recent EU directive on accessibility.  The £100,000 provided through the Department of Health to assist voluntary organisations to improve transport arrangements, particularly by adapting vehicles, is an advance.  However, access to such facilities as Telecom Éireann telephone boxes causes tremendous difficulty for those who have a physical handicap. This might seem a minor point but it constitutes a real difficulty for the disabled.</P>
      <P>I note the allocation of £2 million for sheltered employment of people with disability in viable business projects, but I emphasise that there is a great need for sheltered workshops for the mentally handicapped.  There is a need for such workshops in my constituency of County Clare, particularly in the Kilrush area.  I am aware that the Minister for Health is doing all he can to support this necessary and worthwhile project.  The provision of £100,000 through the Department of Education to allow the employment of escorts on school buses for handicapped children, in certain circumstances, will alleviate much stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitments in the budget to social housing should be highlighted. While there is a commitment to the allocation of a further £12 million for local authority housing, that allocation will provide only an additional 75 houses in my constituency.  Obviously those 75 houses are welcome but they will not be sufficient to deal with the housing needs in County Clare.  The provision of £4 million in 1994 for the installation of bathrooms in local authority houses will provide a fundamental facility.  The remedial works programme is commendable <Col N="1636" /> and should have an immediate positive effect on the quality of local authority housing, particularly for our elderly.</P>
    <P>I note there will be a 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments from July, which in effect will mean that payments will be kept just above the rate of inflation.  Among the many payments involved is the increased rate for child benefit.  The budget recognises widowers in that they will qualify for a contributory pension from October 1994 and from that date all new widowers and widows will qualify for pensions 12 months after widowhood without an earnings limit.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there have been improvements in the family income supplement scheme.  The increase in benefit will mean on average an additional £6 per week for recipients.  The increase in the eligibility limit by £10 will go someway towards alleviating the financial difficulties faced by many people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the help this budget gives to women, not least under the welfare code by improvements and increases announced under the lone parent scheme which will encourage many women back into the workforce.  Women of 60 and over whose husbands die at pensionable age will continue to benefit from certain free schemes provided they satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.  The retention of those benefits by widows is a measure all Members will welcome. Through our clinics we have heard of the hardship suffered by a number of widows and I am glad this measure will alleviate some of that hardship.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance has been welcomed but much criticism has been levelled at it.  That scheme has great potential but because of certain restrictions only a small number of people are in a position to benefit.  I am glad that those restrictions have been recognised and that there will be a relaxation of the rules affecting assessment of income. This will be of benefit to carers &mdash; the majority of whom are women &mdash; whose spouses are employed.</P>
    <P>In the educational sector the budget recognises and pledges to address issues <Col N="1637" /> of equal opportunity and disadvantage. This Department has received an 11 per cent increase compared with that for 1993.  I am pleased the Minister has made a direct link between early school leavers and the long term unemployed.  The Minister is acting on the priorities highlighted by the recent convention emphasising equity and access to qualifications. I welcome the provision for additional expenditure of £7 million in the educational area by the Minister for Finance. I was delighted with the Minister for Education's commitment to examine and produce a pre-school programme.  The cost of school books will be addressed and an increase in funds for the book scheme will be forthcoming.  The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will be welcomed by pupils, parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the commitment to an increase in remedial school teachers. Cloughleigh national school has campaigned for some time for a remedial teacher.  The national schools of Cooraclare, Crec, Lacken, Clohanes and Liscannor have requested a shared remedial teacher.  I hope the national schools of Ballybrohen, Cooraclare and Knockanane can now look forward to their projects being fully addressed and completed now that increases for the capital programme in the primary school sector have been approved.  I am disappointed about the lack of reference to the need for psychological services in schools, particularly at primary school level.  I have outlined on many occasions in this House the great necessity for such psychological services.  I would like to see an increase in pilot studies for such schemes so that in the not too distant future every national school will be provided with such services.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the emphasis on the need for career guidance teachers.  Due to the commitment by the Minister for Education there will be more career guidance teachers in our schools.  These teachers are needed to help young people in choosing their careers and for counselling particularly at second level.  The Minister's commitment to adult learning <Col N="1638" /> programmes is also encouraging and I welcome the increase in provision for the adult literacy scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the agriculture sector as it is provided for in this budget. I am pleased that spouses will be fully exempt from probate tax and that 30 per cent relief will be provided for farmland and buildings.  Both changes, designed to assist farmers and spouses, are retrospective to 18 June 1993.  Many people in my constituency will be pleased with that measure.  I welcome the improvement in capital acquisitions tax which includes a relief for livestock and machinery, thereby facilitating the transfer of lands.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Members who represent rural constituencies will realise that delays in payment of headage and reactor grants cause great difficulty and hardship for many farmers.  The farming community is very anxious that all headage entitlements be paid in the year in which farmers apply for them.  This matter was discussed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations. The question of the exemption from stamp duty on transfer of farms to young trained farmers needs immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased funding for non-national roads in the National Development Plan and the provision of £86.9 million in the 1994 Estimates.  The additional £15 million in the budget for road maintenance is to be welcomed. However, a greater amount of money is needed for non-national roads.  This week I attended a meeting in north Clare where there is a lack of funding for this purpose.  This is a serious matter, not only for those who live in the area but it also impacts negatively on tourism.</P>
    <P>As regards arts and culture, I am aware of a very active group, led by Frank Whelan and others, in my constituency who hope to receive from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, funding for archives for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  This work would be done voluntarily.  Not only should we support our national sports but the Minister, I hope, will also demonstrate his interest in our national musical <Col N="1639" /> traditions by supporting a worthwhile project such as this.</P>
    <P>The budget has contributed in many ways to improving the lives of people in my constituency and throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my independent colleague, Deputy de Valera, for agreeing to share her time with me.  There are many commendable &mdash; and undesirable &mdash; aspects to this budget.  I welcome the extra relief in terms of capital acquisitions tax and the extra farm relief for livestock and machinery.  I also welcome the exemption for spouses from probate tax. We must bear in mind that this tax was introduced only 12 months ago.  Apparently the Government realised the folly of this proposal and has brought about a change in the tax in this budget.  I hope the Minister for Finance will go one step further next year and abolish probate tax.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that £9.5 million has been allocated to Teagasc, £5.5 million of which will be directed towards rationalisation and research.  People may say that a small country should not waste valuable funds on research.  However, if we do not carry out research, we will have to rely on other countries to do so and, bearing in mind that we are in competition with those countries in the marketplace, they will not give us up-to-date information.  We have a noble record in research, in animal and plant breeding, machinery design and disease prevention and it would be regrettable if research was allowed to flounder due to lack of funds.  I welcome the provision of £5.5 million in the budget for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the £9.5 million provided for Teagasc, £2 million has been earmarked for a free advisory service to small farmers. In the region of 14,000 farmers benefited from this measure last year.  At a time of high unemployment, scarce resources and cutbacks in agricultural production, it is desirable that such a service be provided to small farmers free of charge. There is much talk about preserving rural Ireland and keeping people in the <Col N="1640" /> countryside.  This is one way to ensure that people remain on the land.  I welcome the £2 million for the administration of schemes.  In the past, farmers had to wait six, eight or nine months to benefit from certain headage and premia payments.  I hope, with the provision of this extra money, the backlogs will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that £10 million has been provided to help to eliminate hospital waiting lists.  Last year £20 million was provided in this area, thereby relieving much suffering.  A sum of £20 million should have been provided again this year, with a portion going towards dental care, an aspect of our health service which has been neglected.  There are regulations whereby some children, irrespective of the state of decay of their teeth, will not receive attention until they move to another class.  Such dreadful regulations should be done away with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £100 million to the eight health boards.  The fact that this funding comes from the tax amnesty will not bother the chief executive officers very much.  It is dreadful to think that many businesses refused to do business with health boards because, due to a lack of funding, they had not paid their bills for perhaps up to 12 months. This did not give our health service a very good image.  Hopefully the allocation of £100 million will go a long way towards easing the problems of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that a sum of £5 million has been earmarked for a building fund for second level schools.  Unfortunately, there has been no increase in funding for the building and upkeep of national schools, the most important of our educational centres.  National schools are more important than second level schools and third level institutions in that all pupils attend national schools but not all pupils finish second level education or go on to third level education.  We are told that parents have the greatest influence on young children.  If that is the case then national schools come in a very close second.  I would welcome the allocation of funding for the upkeep of national schools, some of which are in an excellent condition but more of which are in a <Col N="1641" /> dreadful condition and have been described by the health boards as unsuitable for the education of young children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased allocation of £3 million for sport and recreational facilities and the allocation of £5 million to Croke Park.  Any moneys spent on sport are exceedingly well spent and will be recouped many times over in a reduced demand on our health services. Years ago the Romans used to say <i>mens sana in corpore sano,</i> a healthy mind in a healthy body.  If we adopt a similar approach we will have a much healthier nation and there will be a reduced reliance on our health services.</P>
    <P>In this context I want to refer to the scheme introduced in late 1992 early 1993 by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, under which all boxing clubs received a grant of up to £1,000 for the purchase of equipment.  This scheme was extremely well implemented &mdash; not one penny of the funds went astray.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider the introduction of a similar scheme this year.  The Olympic Games will take place in just over two years time and if one is to go on tradition we will have to rely on our boxers to come up trumps so far as the winning of medals is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £2 million for sheltered employment for the disabled. Since the advent of national lottery, funding for such organisations has been very hard to come by.  The traditional ways of raising funds such as running lotteries and selling tickets are no longer open to such groups &mdash; the money they used to get is now being taken up by the national lottery.  Any funding allocated by the Minister to this very worthy group of people is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £10 million for the vocational training opportunity schemes is very welcome.  It is estimated that this allocation will benefit up to 2,500 people. The people most affected by these schemes are the long term unemployed and anything which can be done to benefit them is most welcome and very desirable.</P>

      <P>Honours and in particular, first time distinctions are always a cause of understandable national jubilation. Irrespective of how bad or dull things may be nationally at times, Oscars, Eurovision Song Contest successes and European and World Cup progress are not alone a <i>cause célèbre</i> but invariably help to keep national morale afloat.</P>
      <P>Robert Fanning is an 18 year old Dubliner. He is intelligent and ambitious.  In 1993 he did a series of aptitude tests to assess his suitability in astronautics.  Last summer he spent four weeks in the United States participating in a NASA sponsored course.  The induction was rigorous and intensive.  Each Friday there was intensive testing of the week's work. He also sat the SET, solistic aptitude test, which he passed with flying colours.</P>
      <P>The net result of this entire process is that Robert has achieved the unique distinction, out of all the high claibre applicants from around the world vying for entry, of being one of five offered a four year degree course in astronautics at the Californian Institute of Technology. The distinction is put in perspective when one considers that not alone is Robert the first Irish person to have been offered this place but he is, in fact, the first European. Of the other four people offered places on the course, three are Americans and one is Japanese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The honour is again put in perspective when one considers that having successfully completed his degree course in astronautics, and in view of the intense interest being shown in him by NASA, there is every possibility that Robert will go on to train as an astronaut.  This is his ambition, his goal, and there is little doubt that it will happen.  However, it can only happen if Robert receives funding of $15,000 per annum from the Department of Enterprise and Employment or some other Irish agency.  This funding will supplement <Col N="1643" /> the annual funding of $30,000 made available by Cal Tec.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister kindly agreed to meet Robert to discuss the matter with him.  However, the closing date for acceptance of the offer is fast approaching.  He must know soon whether he will receive funding from the Department.  Otherwise he will have to pass up the offer, which will go to somebody else.  It would be a pity if for a relatively small amount of money a unique personal achievement, a national honour &mdash; the probability of an Irish astronaut in space in the relatively near future &mdash; has to be passed up.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter.  Mr. Fanning has been selected to participate in the Californian Institute of Technology astronantics course.  Having applied to NASA and competed with 5,000 applicants worldwide, Mr. Fanning was one of five successful applicants.  This has attracted an amount of publicity, arising from the possibility that Mr. Fanning will be Ireland's first astronaut.  If he is to be successful he will first have to complete his BSc, MSc and PhD.  I believe he also intends to undergo military flight training during that period which will require him to take out United States citizenship.  The educational process will take at least eight years and if he is subsequently considered suitable by NASA further training will be required for manned space flights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Fanning is seeking funding initially for his BSc in astronautics, which will amount to $60,000.  It should be noted that funds for MSc and PhD courses are provided with the intention of encouraging the best graduates to remain in Ireland.  With the pressure on the budget of the Office of Science and Technology, it would be difficult to find funds even for this worthy cause at this time.  I will, however, continue to review the matter to see what assistance I can give to Mr. <Col N="1644" /> Fanning in his exciting career path and to the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at Cottage Hospital, Edenderry, County Offaly, is totally unacceptable.  The Midland Health Board has, for a number of years, sought funding for a new 40-bed nursing unit at Edenderry.  I ask the Minister of State this evening that matters be progressed at Departmental level.  The Minister for Health, Mr. Howlin, has seen for himself the Victorian conditions at Edenderry district hospital; he went there during the course of a visit to the Midland Health Board in 1993.  Following that visit I am sure he is left in no doubt as to the urgency of proceeding with this matter.</P>
      <P>Conditions in the hospital, if they were to be described as Dickensian, would be somewhat complimentary to the building as it stands.  The hospital has all the appearances of an old workhouse or county home, institutions that many of us believe had been, for many years, confined to the history books.  At present there are a mere 14 patients in Edenderry hospital and the reason for such a small number of patients is that the first floor has been declared a fire hazard by Offaly County Council and it was necessary, therefore, for all the patients to be moved down to two rooms on the ground floor, a male room and a female room, with a day centre which could be described as little more than a box room.</P>
      <P>The Matron and the nursing staff at Edenderry hospital are labouring admirably under very severe conditions and to put the matter in context, the nearest geriatric unit to Edenderry is in Mountmellick, some 22 miles away or, alternatively, in Birr, which is some 40 miles away.  Therefore, there is a need in that part of County Offaly for a geriatric institution given that there is a demand in the area and also that Edenderry district hospital was, 100 years ago, a viable unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 40-bed unit has been proposed by the Midland Health Board.  Needless to <Col N="1645" /> say it has the backing of everybody in the community and I understand plans are at a most advanced stage.  I ask the Minister for Health to give this greatly needed project the go-ahead and to include provision for the 40-bed nursing unit in the capital programme which, I understand, is at present in the course of preparation and which will be tendered shortly to the Midland Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and the Minister of State regret that they are unable to reply to this matter and asked me to do so on their behalf.</P>
      <P>In the first instance responsibility for providing a community nursing unit in Edenderry lies with the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board has been considering the provision of a new community nursing unit at Edenderry for a number of years.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, regards this proposal as a top priority and is specifically identifying this need in seeking funding for capital projects for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Formerly the needs of dependent elderly persons were met by admitting them to long-stay hospitals.  This practice is now generally held to be unsatisfactory. Greater emphasis is currently being placed on the development of community-based services so elderly persons can continue to live in their homes, with assistance, if necessary, for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations on services for the elderly contained in the report, The Years Ahead, have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  In 1990 and 1991 the Government allocated substantial funds to the Midland Health Board.  These funds amounted to £465,840.  During these years the board made considerable improvements to services for the elderly throughout the region.  In 1990 the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly in line with the Department of Health's priorities.  The elderly in the Midlands benefited from <Col N="1646" /> increased levels of home help, home nursing, day care and the provision of a Department of Medicine for the Elderly at Tullamore General Hospital.  Indeed, a similar Department is about to be established at Mullingar General Hospital which will greatly enhance the level of services available for elderly people in the region.  The development of specialist departments of medicine for the elderly and the appointment of consultant geriatricians in general hospitals has been one of the most significant advances in the care of the elderly.  Such departments ensure prompt admission of elderly persons, specialist assessment and treatment, rehabilitation and in many cases continuing support in a day hospital on discharge.  Overall, there has been much improvement in the level of services being provided for the elderly in the Offaly region which it is hoped will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September 1993 is proving beneficial to elderly people in nursing homes in the Midland Health Board region.  The Act has two principal objectives.  First, it aims to ensure that all nursing homes which care for dependent elderly people will have a high standard of accommodation and care.  Second, it will assist financially dependent persons who need nursing home care and who cannot afford to pay nursing home fees.  The implementation of the Act is also another important step in honouring the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons will be well cared for.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out to the Deputy that there has been a fair share of positive action in so far as services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board region are concerned.  I would ask the Deputy to accept the commitment of this Government to the development of services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board area as shown by the generous additional <Col N="1647" /> funding for services for the elderly in the last few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude, the Midland Health Board regards the provision of a new community nursing unit in Edenderry as a visual element of its community care programme.  However, the Minister for Health can only give his approval for the project when he is satisfied that the necessary funding is available.  He will have to take into account competing demands for capital funding from all over the country and indeed the internal priorities of the Midland Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am grateful that this matter has been selected for the Adjournment Debate this evening.  This is an issue which affects 917 pupils who are on the same campus in three separate schools in Walkinstown; Assumption Senior Girls School, Assumption Junior Girls School and Assumption Junior Boys School.  Despite the fact that these schools have a total of 917 pupils on the same campus in four blocks, A, B, C and D, and share the same common hall and playground, they do not have the services of a secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argue that these schools should have at least two secretaries based on the regulation that schools must have an enrolment of 400 plus pupils to be eligible for a full-time secretary.  None of these schools taken individually would have that number of pupils; the schools respectively have 339, 297 and 281 pupils but taken together they amount to a total of 917 pupils.  There is nobody available in these schools to receive visitors, inspectors, parents or, indeed strangers, coming to the schools.  That is totally unacceptable and would not be tolerated anywhere else in the country.  Strictly speaking, the Minister may say that three different schools are involved but I <Col N="1648" /> remind him that 917 pupils are affected. How can one run a campus of that kind, with a common hall and common playground area, where principals cannot be in their offices constantly to receive people coming in, without at least two secretaries?</P>
    <P>I understand that, under the provisions of the new programme, there may well be a lowering of the figure of 400 but, regardless of the figure, there should be at least two secretaries there.  I am not asking for a secretary for each of the schools, two between the three seems very reasonable.  That would afford two secretaries for an average of 458 or 459 pupils each, which would still be well above the average figure.</P>
    <P>I hope that &mdash; with the burden of clerical work falling on the principal of each school at present, the fact that the problem is exacerbated by the principals required to be in class, with no secretary to answer the telephone or meet teachers' requirements, to welcome inspectors, visitors, parents and others to the school &mdash; in all fairness the Minister will allow two secretaries to be allocated to the schools in question.  I hope the Minister will accede to this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The current arrangements for the provision of clerical services in primary schools are based on the enrolments of individual schools.  Under the criteria which determine eligibility, it is not possible to include the three schools to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The programme of financial assistance for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in primary schools was introduced on a phased basis from 1 September 1992 under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to augment the resources available to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the phased introduction of the programme provision has now been extended to primary schools with single enrolments of 400 pupils or over, schools classified as disadvantaged with an enrolment of 200 pupils or over and some <Col N="1649" /> schools catering for pupils with special needs.</P>
    <P>Grants are calculated on a <i>per capita</i> basis and made directly to the boards of management of schools qualifying for assistance.  This recognises that each individual board should have discretion to apply the grant in a manner which best suits the needs of the school.</P>
    <P>The scheme does not provide for assessment on the basis of the collective enrolment of a number of schools operating in the same area or on the same campus.</P>
    <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy do not qualify at present as no school has a single enrolment of over 400 pupils or is classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>However, an additional provision of £300,000 has been allocated to the scheme which will make it possible to review the eligibility criteria for the 1994-95 school year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise, on behalf of the parents' council of Mount Saint Joseph's national school, New Ross, the lack of facilities for disabled children.  This primary school is in urgent need of ramps and special toilet facilities for two spina bifida pupils, two nine-year-old boys.</P>
      <P>Before giving the history of the attempt of the school to obtain these facilities from the Department, I want to put on record the tremendous commitment of Mr. Jackie Stacey, his staff and indeed the sixth-class pupils at this school to ensure that these two boys, and any other disabled pupils who would attend the school, manage to take part fully in the school curriculum.  The sixth class pupils have a rota to lift the wheelchairs of these two children in and out of the school, to bring them to and from the toilets and to ensure they are brought in and out of the playground at playtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has got to the point where serious insurance questions must be asked in terms of the risks to the sixth class boys <Col N="1650" /> who are, after all, 12 and 13 year olds, lest they suffer any physical injury from carrying wheelchairs around the school, and about the two boys in the wheelchairs because, if they fell from a wheelchair, there would be a serious medical consequences given their physical condition.</P>
    <P>Concern is now being raised by parents in relation to the delay by the Department of Education in providing these necessary facilities.  On 13 November 1992 &mdash; during the election campaign &mdash; the parents' council wrote to the Taoiseach. Two days later, on 16 November 1992 the Taoiseach acknowledged their letter.  On 2 December 1992 they received a letter from the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan which stated that the necessary works would be put in train at the earliest possible date. He was referring specifically to the installation of the facilities necessary for handicapped children, the ramp and the toilet facilities in particular.</P>
    <P>It is now some 15 months later.  I do not consider that the work has been done &ldquo;at the earliest possible date&rdquo;.  We all agree we want to integrate disabled children into our ordinary schools system. Not only is it extremely important for the children themselves, it is also extremely important for children who do not have a physical handicap to be able to cope with their fellow pupils who have difficulties. I should like to encourage all schools to open their doors to as many disabled children as they can to ensure those children's full participation in the schools curriculum.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Minister &mdash; although I have not spoken to her on the matter &mdash; I think that would also be her policy. I cannot accept the delay in providing the facilities for the two spina bifida pupils who attend this primary school in New Ross given that, in the heat of an election campaign the Minister for Education of the day promised that these facilities would be provided at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State brings me good news in relation to the provision of these facilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Doyle for raising this issue and apologise for the Minister's absence this evening.  As a parent of a spina bifida child I appreciate her concern in this matter.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of the commitment of the Minister and the Department to full and equal access to education of all schoolchildren, including those with a handicap.</P>
      <P>The school authorities applied to the Department in late September 1992 for a grant in respect of the provision of ramps to facilitate access to the buildings and play area for two newly enrolled pupils confined to wheelchairs because of spina bifida.</P>
      <P>The Department's district inspector subsequently recommended provision of this facility and this was approved in principle by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the usual procedure the Department's local professional <Col N="1652" /> advisers in the Office of Public Works were requested to draw up plans for the ramps in consultation with the school authorities and to furnish a detailed report, including costings to the Department.</P>
    <P>I understand that their report in the matter is nearing completion and should be available to the Department within the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The delay in the planning and design of this facility is regretted, I understand it is partly due to the complexity of the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the Deputy that, as soon as the report in question is received, the Department will expedite grant sanction and instruct the Office of Public Works personnel to give the necessary assistance to the school authorities to obtain tenders to put the work in hands.</P>

      <P>The remaining shortfall is in respect of claims presented to the United Nations arising out of participation in UNIFIL and UNFICYP.  In the case of UNIFIL, unpaid claims, which are for equipment and death and disability, amount to slightly over £4 million.  As regards UNFICYP, claims totalling £0.5 million are outstanding for extra and extraordinary expenditure &mdash; mainly overseas allowance and equipment &mdash; in the period from 1 January, 1982 to 15 June, 1993. With effect from 16 June, 1993, reimbursement in respect of UNFICYP troop costs has changed to a flat-rate settlement of $1,130.75 per man-month and payments are up-to-date.  A further £0.4 million is due in respect of death and disability claims arising out of participation in UNFICYP.</P>

      <P>Under current legislation the Naval Service is entitled to board any fishing vessel in the context of a fishery inspection, for example to ensure that the catch of the fishing vessel is within <Col N="1578" /> the limits prescribed by law, that fishing did not occur in areas which are prohibited, that the catch is confined to the permitted species of fish and that national and EU Regulations have been complied with.  In 1993, the Naval Service boarded 703 fishing vessels.  Of these, 61 were detained for alleged breaches of fishery laws.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service's response to complaints of harassment and aggressive behaviour by fishing vessels is to send a patrol vessel to the area of conflict as soon as possible to examine and report on the situation.  The presence of a Naval patrol vessel in an area generally results in fishing vessels behaving in an orderly fashion.</P>

      <P>Helvic harbour is owned by Waterford County Council who is responsible for its maintenance and repair.  The Department of the Marine did provide grant-aid to Waterford County Council in respect of emergency structural renewals undertaken at this harbour in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan a sum of £12 million is being made available for the development and improvement of facilities at fishery harbours.  In order to optimise the benefits of harbour investment projects, the Department of the Marine is formulating a Fishery Harbours Development Plan for the period 1994 through 1999.  All coastal local authorities were invited to submit development proposals to the Department for consideration and possible inclusion in the Fishery Harbours Development Plan. In view of the fact that the total cost of the various development proposals submitted to the Department far exceeds the money available, only those projects considered most strategically or economically <Col N="1579" /> beneficial will be included in the finalised plan.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is examining all proposals submitted, including proposals for the development of Helvick harbour, in order to assess their suitability for inclusion in the plan. Until this examination is completed and agreement is reached with the Commission of the European Communities on an operational programme to enable structural funding to be drawn down to subvent the plans implementation, I am not in a position to say what works, if any, may be undertaken at Helvic harbour.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the morning of 1 February, Salmara Fisheries notified the Department and the South Western Regional Fisheries <Col N="1580" /> Board that inspection of a fish cage at the company's licensed salmon farm site at Deenish Island on the preceding evening had revealed that damage to the netting had been sustained.  The company reported that the cage in question held approximately 10,000 fish which were ready for harvesting.  It is provisionally estimated that up to 5,000 fish were lost.</P>
    <P>Fish farmers are obliged to notify escape incidents immediately and I am satisfied that the company complied with this requirement.  The company has advised that damage assessment indicates that it was caused by seals in the area. While anti-predator devices were in place and were in working order, additional precautions to deter seals are now being put in place by the company</P>
    <P>A permit to allow the netting of escapees was issued by the Department with the proviso what all such operations were to be carried out under the supervision of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board.  Netting was carried out in the vicinity of the farm and estuaries of rivers flowing into Kenmare Bay.  The latest information available is that no escaped fish have been caught and the company has ceased netting.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is not possible to reliably estimate the survival rate of the escaped fish.  It is likely, however, to be poor at this time of year particularly given the circumstances of the escape and the prevailing weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The potential impact of escaped farmed fish on the wild salmon stocks is still widely debated at international level particularly on the complex question of long term genetic impact.  Preventative measures through good maintenance of nets and structures, anti predator devices and all other appropriate technology are required and are inspected for compliance at regular intervals.  It is in the economic interests of the industry itself to minimise the risks of escape through taking such precautionary measures and I am satisfied that fish farmers do co-operate with requirements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing notification procedures in the event of an escape work well and are being complied <Col N="1581" /> with by fish farmers.  However, the scope for improvement is being kept under regular review.</P>
    <P>An investigation by the Department into the circumstances of the incident is under way and I have requested a report on additional measures which might be taken to further minimise the risks of escape and on arrangements by the Fisheries Board for continued monitoring of the area for possible survivors.</P>

      <P>Programmes to increase fish consumption are implemented by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The aim of policy it to promote the demand for quality seafood, through improving quality, standards, presentation and product range, and thereby to increase <i>per capita</i> fish consumption by about 0.2 kg per annum. Domestic fish consumption increased by some 35 per cent over the period 1983 to 1992 and further increases are targeted for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BIM's Home Market Development Programme which is constantly updated consists of a number of measures, including a programme of seminars and information briefing with the catering and retail sector; a general programme of advertising, including a weekly radio slot, and specific seasonal programmes, including participation in special events such as Healthy Eating Week; a promotions programme which increases consumer awareness of fish and includes cookery competitions, inshore promotions, <Col N="1582" /> testings etc. and a public relations programme which promotes the use of fish in the home through the use of recipe and promotional material including an annual fish cookery calendar.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that fish promotion has been included for the first time in the new integrated operational programme for the fisheries sector for the period 1994-1999.  The promotion of fish on the home market is, of course, increasingly market driven.  In this regard I am glad to note the increased promotion of fish in many outlets and the advent of major private national advertising campaigns, all of which are increasing the consumers awareness of the attractiveness of fish and fish products.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Department operates a comprehensive monitoring and control programme to minimise sea lice levels at salmon farms.  Fish farm management strategies, of which this programme is a key component, are part of the wide-ranging precautionary measures being taken to conserve, protect and rehabilitate sea trout stocks.</P>
      <P>The sea lice programme is designed to ensure that sea lice levels on salmon farms are monitored, reduced and kept to a minimum and that appropriate remedial action is taken when the situation demands.  The extent to which this strategy has been effective can be gauged from the substantial reduction in sea lice numbers achieved at farm sites during 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sea Trout Task Force, which I established in June 1993 to advise on additional measures necessary to combat sea trout declines, presented an interim progress report to me last November.  Its recommendations on further monitoring and reporting arrangements for sea lice inspections for 1994 are being implemented by the Department.  As a result the monitoring programme is being intensified this year and will be aimed at reducing lice levels on all salmon farms <Col N="1584" /> even further particularly in the critical spring and autumn months.</P>
    <P>All salmon farms are to be inspected twice each month from February to May and at least once per month from June to January inclusive.  The inspections will be carried out jointly by the Department and the appropriate Regional Fishery Board.  Sampling methodologies have been further refined in line with task force recommendations and results will continue to be made available to the task force and other interested parties under an agreed reporting Protocol.</P>
    <P>The 1994 sea lice monitoring programme will complement and reinforce other ongoing improvements in fish farm management notably the following strategies which are being developed for an increasing number of farms.  In addition the Department's 1994 Action Programme to conserve, protect and rehabilitate sea trout stocks is being put in place in full consultation with the task force.  This Programme will also be informed by the report of the Scientific Sea Trout Working Group which, having evaluated the results of the 1993 national sea trout research programme, has advised on the research priorities for this year and precautionary strategies generally. This report will be published shortly and has already been made available to the task force to assist that forum in its deliberations.  Under the programme particular priority will be given to ensuring that the fishery boards systematically apply their enhanced resources this year to the assessment, conservation and development of sea trout stocks in their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In its interim report the task force advised that the scientific study of problems affecting sea trout would be advanced by preserving a distinct section of the coastline free of new salmon farming operations.  The area between Achill and Donegal Bay &mdash; which excludes existing salmon farm operations in Donegal Bay &mdash; was proposed by the task force, and accepted by me, as appropriate for this purpose.  The sea trout research programme for 1994 will specify the assessment <Col N="1585" /> work to be undertaken by the Salmon Research Agency within this self determined area.  Long term decisions on this area and sea trout research generally will be informed by the recommendations of the task force, whose final report is expected by Easter, and by the results and conclusions of the overall research programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the objective of ensuring that the Irish fishing industry can achieve maximum added value in relation to the national catch is and has been a major investment priority.  Over the period 1982-1993 grant aid to the processing sector was of the order of £48 million of which Community funding amounted to over £35 million.  It is estimated that this aid generated overall investment in the industry of more than £100 million over the period.  The main objectives for the processing sector are: to increase scale of production in order to build a strong internationally competitive fish processing industry with optimum utilisation of raw materials available, including non-quota species; to encourage increased emphasis on value-added production; to develop new markets; to improve hygiene standards in line with EC requirements and to create sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that fish processing sustains about 3,400 jobs in Ireland of which 1,750 are full time and 1,650 part time. The three operational programmes approved to date under the Community Support Framework 1991-1993 (CSF) are expected to create up to 500 extra jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These additional jobs are expected to <Col N="1586" /> come on stream over the next two years. In addition, investment in upgrading of premises in compliance with EC Hygiene Directives, will ensure the long term preservation of 357 full time and 334 part time jobs and that access to foreign markets will not be impeded.</P>
    <P>In prioritising projects, the main emphasis was on achieving greater scale, particularly in the area of value added products with the ultimate objective of maximising the number of jobs created.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that for the first time fisheries structural measures are to be integrated into the overall Structural Funds.  This will significantly improve the existing arrangement in which funding for fisheries is treated completely separately from other structural measures and, indeed, is split under two distinct measures: Regulation 4028/86 for fleet, aquaculture and port facilities and Regulation 4042/89 for fish processing.  It will mean greater efficiency in fisheries funding and will improve the ability of national authorities to frame plans covering a number of years and to tailor individual schemes to real needs.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the National Plan total investment in the processing sector is projected as being in the region of £38 million of which close to £15 million will be provided by way of EU and national funding.  It is envisaged that around 800 additional jobs in the processing sector will be created over the period of the plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 50, 52 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I had a wide ranging discussion on fisheries issues during my meeting in Madrid with my Spanish colleague Mr. Loira Rua last September.  In particular I stressed my own and the Government's deep concern about the level of illegal fishing by Spanish fishing vessels within the Irish Economic Zone.  In this context, I emphasized my disquiet about the level of illegal activity by Spanish fishermen and pointed out that almost 50 per cent of all Spanish vessels inspected were arrested for serious fishing offences such as illegal entry, illegal gear and large quantities of undersized fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also discussed the review of the terms of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community. I underlined my intention to ensure that any changes made to the <Col N="1588" /> existing arrangements would reduce illegal fishing, enhance control and provide better protection for stocks.</P>
    <P>In my previous statements to the House I have stressed the need to eradicate the use of hidden holds that has emerged among certain Spanish fishing vessels.  For this reason I made clear to Mr. Loira my resolve to reach a satisfactory conclusion in the matter.  I also expressed deep concern about alleged interference by Spanish fishing vessels with the fishing gear of Irish boats.  Mr. Loira has agreed to examine the possibility of establishing a code of conduct relating to the use of different fishing methods.</P>
    <P>As a result of our meeting, the Spanish Minister has agreed to the establishment of a framework for enhanced co-operation between the Irish and Spanish control authorities and more active monitoring of vessels engaging in illegal fishing.  This will be achieved through: regular bilateral meetings at senior level, including inspection staff, exchange of information regarding detentions and warnings and commitment on mutual follow-up on information received.  I would emphasize that Mr. Loira and I met as representatives of member states of the European Community, both wishing to uphold Community and international law.  He confirmed his determination on the issues involved.  While I stressed my own and the Government's absolute wish to make progress through dialogue, I emphasised that Ireland's position had to be respected and would be enforced.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to this meeting senior officials of the Department met with their Spanish counterparts and have agreed further measures for closer co-operation on the control and monitoring of fishing by Spanish vessels in the Irish Economic Zone.  In addition, the Department is currently at an advanced stage of preparation of amending fisheries legislation and in that context, it is hoped that a draft copy of the Bill would be available for circulation by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>As regards the latest position on the review of the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession, I would refer the Deputies to <Col N="1589" /> my replies to Deputies Creed and McGinley on 26 January and 1 February 1994, respectively.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the <i>ex-gratia</i> compensation plan which I announced before Christmas, certain former staff at Irish Shipping Limited who were in the company's employment at the time of liquidation in 1984 will be eligible for payment of two and a half weeks pay for each year of service with some allowance for the lapse of time and subject to a maximum of £50,000 per employee.  The payments will be once-off and without prejudice.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce the legislation to underpin the payments as quickly as possible.  The necessary drafting is being advanced as a priority with this objective firmly in mind.  The processing of payments to former employees will get underway as soon as the Bill is enacted. The Department is in regular consultation with representatives of the Irish Shipping workers who are being kept fully informed of progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine has been informed of the incident referred to by the Deputies in which the skippers of two Irish registered vessels alleged harassment and in one case having their boat and gear towed astern by a flagship off the south-west coast.  In the past the practice has been to seek a signed affidavit concerning incidents of this nature and when such is received, the Department conveys a formal complaint through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Flag State of the vessel involved.  Unfortunately however, in this instance because the incident occurred in the hours of darkness, the skippers of the Irish vessels were not in a position to obtain the names or registration numbers of the vessels involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I take a very serious view of any interference with the lawful activities of Irish fishermen and there is close liaison between the Department and the Naval Service in an effort to mount preventative patrols in areas of contention.  I have consistently expressed deep concern to ministerial colleagues at EU Council level.  They have indicated a willingness to take action against those who could be proven culpable.  In addition during my talks with him last September the Spanish Minister, Mr. Loira Rua, agreed to examine the possibility of establishing a code of conduct <Col N="1592" /> relating to the use of different fishing methods.</P>
    <P>At an operational level, a framework has been put in place whereby the officials in my Department have ongoing contact with the control authorities in each member state, in particular those with fishing rights in Irish waters.  Every alleged incident is reported immediately. I should emphasise the importance of indentification in such cases.  Where the offending vessel can be identified either through its name or number the matter will be pursued to the utmost.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from previous statements to the House, that the appropriate legal form of redress in cases of collision outside our territorial waters is by way of a civil action.  Ships moving within our territorial waters are governed by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.</P>

      <P>As part of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, it was agreed that a quantity of arcto-norwegian cod would be made available by Norway to the Union.  The amount of the cod is to rise from 6,000 tonnes to 11,000 tonnes in 1997.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a Declaration of the General Affairs Council on 21 October, 1992, the cod is to be divided between the member states of the Union on the basis of cohesion criteria.  The final distribution is to be decided by the General Affairs Council acting unanimously.</P>
      <P>The EEA has now come into effect from January 1994.  Accordingly, the distribution of the arcto-norwegian cod is currently under discussion.  Last December, the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should each be allocated 45 per cent of the cod with Ireland and Greece each receiving 5 per cent.  The rationale for this proposal was that 20 per cent of the fish should be allocated equally among the cohesion countries (Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal &mdash; 5 per cent each) and the remaining 80 per cent should be allocated on the basis of traditional catches.  As neither Ireland nor Greece has a record of catches in the area, this meant that the remaining 80 per cent would be allocated equally between Spain and Portugal, who would then receive a total of 45 per cent each.</P>
      <P>This proposal is, of course, totally unacceptable to Ireland; nor is it in line with the decision to allocate the fish exclusively on the basis of cohesion criteria or general principles of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of the fish is currently <Col N="1594" /> being negotiated and I can assure the Deputy that the most strenuous efforts are being made at all levels and in all fora by myself and Tánaiste to ensure that Ireland receives an equitable share of the fish.</P>

      <P>As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit will become reckonable as income for tax purposes with effect from 6 April 1994. The necessary Commencement Order was approved by the House on 2 February 1994.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of these benefits for tax purposes is to ensure that people in similar circumstances, with similar amounts of incomes, are treated in the same way under the income tax code. Under the proposed arrangements, my Department will continue to pay gross unemployment and pay-related benefits, that is without deduction of income tax. The Revenue Commissioners will take account of the amount of these benefits when determining the amount of tax payable. These arrangements will apply to all recipients of unemployment and pay-related benefit including seasonal workers.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to pay-related benefit, the Government decided to complete the phasing out of this supplement and to direct the resources thereby released towards improving the basic rates of unemployment and disability benefit.  Accordingly, with effect from July next, pay-related benefit with unemployment benefit will be discontinued for new claimants.  Existing claimants will continue to retain their entitlement to the supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special increase of 4 per cent is being made in the personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit.  This special increase together with the general and priority rate increases provided for in the budget will mean that disability and unemployment benefit recipients will receive an overall increase of 10 per cent <Col N="1598" /> or £5.40 per week.  In addition, to utilising the resources arising from the phasing out of pay related benefit, this special additional increase will cost £2.7 million in 1994.  All recipients of disability benefit and unemployment benefit will benefit from this special increase.  Less than half (45 per cent) of unemployment benefit recipients receive a pay related supplement.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate precisely the effect of these measures on an unemployed person with a family of 2 children at various income ranges on the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy. Persons or couples whose sole income is unemployment benefit will not be liable for tax as their total income would be below the relevant tax exemption limits. Entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on a person's reckonable earnings between £80 and £220 per week in a previous tax year and the rate of entitlement varies according to earnings.</P>
    <P>The impact of taxation will similarly vary from case to case depending on the particular circumstances (including tax free allowances) of the individual taxpayer.</P>

    <P>In the case the Deputy refers to the <Col N="1599" /> person concerned failed to qualify because he had a yearly average of 18 contributions.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> made a large number of recommendations for changes to the pensions system, including increasing the number of paid contributions required to qualify for pension and introducing a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.</P>
    <P>The report and the recommendations are at present being studied within my Department and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report.  The person concerned may be entitled to an old age (non-contributory) pension which is payable subject to a means test and I have arranged for details to be sent to him.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Glenville Garda station is a substation of Carrignavar station. Both stations form part of the Cobh District. The Garda assigned to Glenville station retired last month and has not been replaced to date.  However, I understand that it is intended to fill the vacancy at Glenville and that the divisional officer has already taken steps to do this. However, it is not possible at this stage to say when an appointment will be made.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Glenville is being policed by the gardaí from Carrignavar. The Garda station is opened on a regular basis and mobile patrols are carried out in the area using the patrol car assigned to Watergrasshill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no plans to introduce a new Garda Division for the North County Kildare area.  I gave the Deputy details of the policing arrangements for Leixlip, which forms part of the Southern Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Area, in my response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 189 of 6 October, 1993 and No. 120 of 7 December, 1993 and the situation has not changed since then.</P>
      <P>Both Maynooth and Celbridge Garda stations form part of the Carlow/Kildare Division.  The current strength at Maynooth station is 1 sergeant, 6 gardaí and an additional probationer garda will be assigned there on 18 February, 1994.  The current strength at Celbridge station is 2 sergeants and 9 gardaí.  There is a patrol car assigned to both of these stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both stations are open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Sundays.  Outside these hours, regular foot and mobile patrols are carried out throughout the District covering Maynooth and Celbridge and callers can contact the Divisional Headquarters at Naas who will transmit the message immediately to the gardaí on patrol in the area.  These areas are also patrolled on a regular basis by the Detective Branch and Traffic Corps from Naas. <Col N="1602" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that a Special Crime Patrol was established by the Divisional Officer last year to combat the problem of travelling criminals, including Dublin-based criminal gangs. This unit operates throughout the Division, including the areas referred to in the question, at the hours of most need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the comprehensive package of law and order measures which I announced on 14 December last to combat crime.  These measures are designed to improve the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime and will contribute significantly to the improvement of the police service to the public throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are satisfied that the public in each of the towns mentioned in the question have ready access to Garda services and that the current policing arrangements make the optimum use of available manpower and resources.  They are keeping the policing arrangements for North Kildare under continuing review.</P>

    <P>In addition, an amount of £23.4 million in 1993 has been provided under &ldquo;Measure 6&rdquo; for Research and Development. <Col N="1603" /> The 1994 Exchequer allocation will again be supplemented by further expenditure under the industry-led Research and Development Measure.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of science and technology, the Government has a clear conviction of the pivotal role which science and technology has to play in modern society, the contribution it can make to industrial development and the imperative need for industry constantly to upgrade and innovate.  Because of this and the large amount of State resources, directly and indirectly, tied up in this activity, the Government has decided to conduct a full-scale review of science and technology policy.  I am, therefore, establishing a Review Group to undertake an examination of this subject in order to: (a) determine whether the current policies, objectives, structures and components of the science and technology system are the right ones for achieving economic development through research, technology and innovation; (b) determine what mechanisms should be employed to achieve the desired S &amp; T goals in the light of the above and (c) provide a report on the findings, with recommendations about changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the national S &amp; T system in contributing to national economic development. This report will be in the form of a draft White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Minister and the Government to consider.</P>

However, <Col N="1604" /> both the Local Government Act, 1953 and section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925 have, since been repealed by the Roads Act, 1993.

While I have no information as to the mileage of roads taken in charge, using the powers contained in the Local Government Act, 1953, the total mileage of public roads in the State increased from 50,213 miles in 1954 to 55,306 miles in 1977, the last time a complete roads inventory was taken.</P>

      <P>An amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme was operated by my Department in each of the years 1988, 1990 and 1991.  The 1991 scheme was the last such scheme.  Since then my Department has not invited applications for grants.  Therefore, there are no such applications currently before my Department.</P>
      <P>Provisions for payment of grants allocated under the 1991 and earlier schemes were made in my Department's Vote for 1992 and 1993.  However, my Department gave notice through the local authorities that grants should be claimed before the end of 1993, as no provision would be made for payments in 1994. Therefore, there is no provision in my Department's Vote, nor any current scheme, under which an allocation could be made to the club mentioned or to any similar club or organisation.</P>

      <P>The present position in this regard is that work is underway in the Department preparing for the continuation of EU aid for development works at the commercial seaports.  The aim of our overall strategy will be to ensure that our seaports have the capacity and quality of infrastructure to meet the trading conditions of the 21st century.  To achieve this, a comprehensive port development programme, involving expenditure of £100 million over the years 1994 to 1999, is included in the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as port projects are concerned the Department has identified portal requirements and is now in the process of identifying projects to meet those requirements subject to EU approval of <Col N="1608" /> the National Plan.  This process will be concluded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department will be in touch with Arklow Harbour Commissioners in the near future in relation to their port development proposals.</P>

      <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance, is a weekly allowance paid by health boards to disabled persons over 16 years of age and is subject to both a medical and means test.  To qualify medically a person must, by reason of disability, be substantially handicapped in undertaking work of a kind which, if he-she were not suffering from that disability, would be suited to his-her age, experience and qualifications.  The disability must be expected to last at least one year from its onset.</P>
      <P>The conditions governing entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance and the social welfare benefits mentioned by the Deputy are not comparable in that eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, other than medical qualification, is based on a means test whereas entitlement to social welfare benefits is dependent on contributions being made by the applicant under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
