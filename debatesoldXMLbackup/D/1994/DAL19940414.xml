      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach if he could arrange for a debate on the increasingly grave situation arising from the German Government's decision to attempt to restrict Irish beef exports, which has led to a slur being cast on all Irish food on the German market and signs being put up in supermarkets saying they do not sell Irish beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if this question was dealt with in a more <Col N="542" /> appropriate manner.  It does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to debate the BSE matter.  That is important because there is virtually no disagreement in this House, or with the German authorities.  Deputy Avril Doyle and I raised this matter on the Adjournment last evening and I look forward to a longer debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Government consider providing time to discuss many of the worthwhile reports now being published for instance the ESRI report and the Task Force report on small business?  Much valuable work goes into the preparation of these reports and this House never <Col N="547" /> discussed for example the report of the Commission on Taxation, which is a pity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> When I first came to the Custom House as Minister for the Environment in early 1992, I was astonished to find that yellowed legal texts, almost as old as the building iself, were still being consulted. The law on local government was still an archaic, obscure and inconsistent labyrinth. Even the very terminology is largely meaningless to an ordinary citizen in the last decade of the 20th century.  It is my aim to bring this maze of local government law within the realms of rationality and modernity.</P>
    <P>Since I took up duty as Minister for the Environment, a major programme of legislative reform has been pursued across the whole range of areas which come within my portfolio.  During that period, a total of ten Bills has been enacted.  This is the third local government Bill in as many years, following the Local Government Act, 1991, and the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, which completed the successful process of creating three new county councils in place of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  We have also had legislation enacted or introduced in most of my other main areas of responsibility: three electoral Acts, two planning Acts, a roads Act, a housing Act, the Environmental Protection Agency Act and a Road Traffic Bill.  I hope to be in a position in the relatively near future to proceed with a further major electoral Bill and a Bill dealing with waste management and disposal.  From time to time I am under pressure to look at other changes in the electoral law which could, perhaps, include single seat constituencies and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 1994, represents a further significant advance in the ongoing process of legislative reform. It is, in its own right, a major exercise in reform, providing for what is probably the most extensive revision of local government law undertaken since the foundation of the State.  It consists of 70 sections and five schedules, and provides for the repeal of provisions in 78 different enactments, including the repeal of 27 separate Acts in their entirely.  It provides <Col N="554" /> for the replacement of legislation dating back almost 150 years by a modern, comprehensive and effective code relating to a wide range of local authority operations and some fundamental aspects of the local government system itself.</P>
    <P>The present Bill complements the Local Government Act, 1991, bringing forward the process of local government reform which that Act commenced and addressing several important new areas. The Bill, the Dublin Act and the 1991 Act, together contain a total of 165 sections, providing for repeal or revocation of provisions in 105 different enactments dating as far back as 1840.  By any standards, this amounts to a major overhaul and updating of the local government code.  Together, these measures bring us ever nearer the situation where all general local government law relating to structures, procedures and functions can be consolidated into one comprehensive modern enactment.  This Bill is not simply a passive consolidation exercise, much as we need that; it is a vehicle for a great many significant changes and substantive reforms, some of which I will now deal with.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has the process of legislative reform in recent years been more evident than in the area of electoral law, with new legislation on Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda.  Now it is the turn of local elections.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains updated and consolidated provisions in relation to local authority membership.  In Part III, I have set out anew, with desirable changes, those provisions in relation to the conduct of local elections which need to be enshrined in primary legislation. This will facilitate the codification of the detailed procedures relating to local elections, now contained mainly in the Local Elections Regulations, 1965, as amended by a number of subsequent measures. Following this Bill.  I intend to bring before the Oireachtas for approval regulations to consolidate and modernise all the procedures at local elections.  In the <Col N="555" /> process, I propose to apply to those elections the many improvements in procedure which have been introduced for Dáil and Presidential elections in recent years.</P>
    <P>The electoral provisions in this Bill are not just a restatement of those which apply in the other electoral codes.  I have given a great deal of thought to the special circumstances and requirements of local authorities, with particular reference to qualifications for membership. I am conscious of the body of opinion in favour of ending the so-called dual mandate of local authority and Oireachtas membership, and I know that many local authority members would welcome changes in this regard as a means of enhancing the separate status of local authority membership.  No doubt there is also the counter opinion that these should be retained.</P>
    <P>What is primarily in question here is, I believe, the significance of local government as a worthwhile enterprise in its own right, separate from central Government in both the political and administrative spheres, as far as that can be achieved.  This is a feature of many other democracies.  It is notable that in many European and other countries, dual membership of the national parliament and of local authorities is absent, or a rarity.  The opposite pertains in this country &mdash; a position almost unknown in other small comparable countries like Denmark. The concept of distinct membership is consistent with, and complementary to, the principle of enhancing the powers and discretion of local authorities as bodies with real responsibility for local matters &mdash; a major objective of the Government's local government reform programme.</P>
    <P>Initial steps towards enhancing the separate status of local authority membership were taken in 1991 with the exclusion of Ministers and Minister of State from membership.  I thought long and hard about the further extention of this principle before concluding that a blanket statutory prohibition on dual membership would not be appropriate at <Col N="556" /> this stage.  Such a prohibition is not often found in other countries.  Besides, an outright ban would cause inordinate discontinuity in local authority membership, given the existing high level of overlap.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill does provide for the exclusion of a range of public office holders from local authority membership. These are the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, chairpersons of various Oireachtas select committees, members of the European Commission and other EU office holders. Oireachtas members will be disqualified from being local authority chairperson or vice-chairperson &mdash; to be known incidentally as cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach in future.  These new exclusions will serve further to promote the concept of separate local authority membership.  Together with the other changes in the law relating to qualifications for local authority membership, they will apply from the 1998 elections. Existing local authority members are not, therefore, affected.</P>
    <P>More immediate electoral interest will focus on the holding of the town elections in June, as provided for in sections 14 to 20 of the Bill.  These will involve five borough corporations, 49 urban district councils and 26 town commissioners, authorities which have not had elections since 1985.  As already announced, the elections will take place on 9 June in conjunction with the European Parliament elections.  They will be held, not on the basis of outdated town boundaries which have, up to now, excluded many residents from having a say in electing the council, but rather with the electorate enlarged to allow residents in the built-up environs of towns to participate in electing the authorities for those towns.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the extension of boundaries for the purposes of the elections in the case of 54 towns listed in the Third Schedule.  These boundary alterations will be put into effect by way of regulations under section 18, implementing proposals submitted by county managers following consultations with the county and town authorities concerned. The boundary extensions are being <Col N="557" /> implemented in each case on the basis of proposals agreed by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Of the 89 local authorities affected, 62 have a population outside their urban boundaries.  Local agreement has now been achieved in the case of 55 local authorities.  I compliment the county managers and the elected members of the county councils and of the urban, borough and town commissioners where such marvellous success was achieved against very severe time constraints.  I appreciate that support.  I realise that Members of this House who were elected in some of these areas have contributed also.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the wider aspects of the issue of town local government. Before I comment on the specific provisions of the Bill, I would like to provide a brief historical perspective to this question and to set the proposals in the Bill in the overall context of the Government's programme of local government reform.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Local Government Reorganisation and Reform, published in 1991, produced no agreed recommendation on this matter. The importance of the issue becomes apparent, however, when one considers the perspective of Ireland's social and demographic development during the past 30 years or so.</P>
    <P>In 1961, a clear majority of Ireland's population was rural.  Today, that situation has been reversed and at the time of the 1991 census, almost 60 per cent of the population lived in urban areas.  This fundamental shift in a relatively short space of time has presented new challenges, particularly in areas such as employment, infrastructure and amenities, recreation and leisure facilities, education and youth matters, community structures and the whole area of social infrastructure in the towns.</P>
    <P>The Government is alert to these challenges and has responded constructively and imaginatively on several fronts.  The significant investment in urban water and sewerage facilities; the provisions of town by-passes which remove disruptive and <Col N="558" /> damaging through-traffic, allowing towns to develop as social and economic centres; the priority being given to social housing and the urban renewal schemes which have revitalised the centres of many of our towns and in the process created valuable employment are all examples of a decisive response to the issues of concern to towns.</P>
    <P>The actual structure and framework of local government in our towns has not developed in keeping with social and demographic changes.  The legal provisions associated with bodies such as town commissioners are archaic in many respects.  Large and important county towns, such as Mullingar and Portlaoise, are still hampered by a form of town government introduced 140 years ago.  I say this without disrespect for the members of those authorities, but rather in the certain knowledge that those same members would be the first to acknowledge the need for modernisation of the structures within which they must work. Similarly, the fact that large centres of population such as Dundalk, Bray, Tralee, Ennis and Athlone have local authorities of the same classification as places only a small fraction of their size would suggest a lack of consistency and of good organisational arrangements. Other places, like Celbridge and Maynooth, have witnessed very rapid development in recent years, with populations now far in excess of many longstanding urban districts.  They are very much in need of proper representative structures, yet they have no town local authorities.</P>
    <P>In short, the system of town local government has not moved with the times.  When the rural district councils were abolished in 1925, the urban districts survived, but the emphasis has remained on survival rather than on development and growth.  There has been a tendency to adopt sterile, simplistic, adversarial positions whenever change is mooted.  Perhaps for this reason, succssive Governments have shied away from addressing the issue.  The result, for town local government, has been relative <Col N="559" /> neglect and failure to keep pace with modern developments.</P>
    <P>The issue is, admittedly, a complex one.  Various suggestions have been floated over the years but there is no single simple solution.  I pointed out, when announcing the publication of the Bill, that its purpose was not simply to guarantee the continued survival of town local authorities but to create a modern and effective system of town local government.  However, by putting to rest once and for all the fundamental question as to the future sub-county structure to be adopted, a major step has been taken.</P>
    <P>Town local government is to remain and is now to be modernised.  The outstanding matters requiring decision have been narrowed down considerably, and it should now be possible to focus on these without sterile and distracting controversy.  I hope that all concerned will make a positive and constructive input to the next stages of the reform process provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>These stages will involve a statutory review by an independent local government reorganisation commission which is provided for in Part X of the Bill.  The commission will consist of up to seven members and must include elected councillors from both town and county authorities among its members.  The task of the commission is to prepare and submit a reorganisation report containing proposals for town local government, including such matters as the number of classes of local authority; the role and functions appropriate to each class; financial, staffing and organisational matters in relation to each class and the implications for county councils.  The report will also contain proposals regarding the appropriate class for each existing town local authority, criteria and procedures for the creation of local authorities for non-municipal towns and measures and arrangements for the implementation of reorganisation proposals.</P>
    <P>The commission will have regard to all relevant factors such as community identity and civic tradition, local capability, the need for effective and efficient <Col N="560" /> discharge of functions and delivery of service and the need to safeguard the position and capacity of the county councils as the primary units of local government. The Bill gives the reorganisation commission a clear mandate and a definite framework, and makes specific provision for implementation of its proposals.  There is no question, therefore, of solutions being imposed by the Custom House.</P>
    <P>During my visits to local authorities I was amazed at the difference in capacity &mdash; this is not always related to size and function &mdash; of many of them.  This will have to be addressed in a comprehensive way with maximum local involvement so that the best possible solutions can be found.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, a policy of strengthening the powers of local authorities and giving them greater flexibility and freedom of action has been consistently followed. Removal of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule, relaxation of centralised controls on local authorities and devolution of functions in specific areas of operation such as housing, are cases in point.  Similar measures are proposed in the Bills on road traffic and casual trading.  The Bill before the House continues and extends this approach.  For example, it provides for the removal of central controls which currently apply to local authorities in areas such as by-laws, parks, burial grounds and personnel matters. The principle that the local authority is best positioned to decide local issues on its own initiative is similarly reflected in the creation, in Part VII of the Bill, of a new broad by-law making power which will enable the elected local authorities to regulate a variety of matters and activities where they consider this desirable in the interests of the common good of the local community, without the need for ministerial approval, sanction or consent. The same philosophy is also brought to bear in Part VI which provides flexible, devolved powers for local authorities in the provision of various amenities and facilities.  A scattered range of largely outdated provisions will be replaced by a modern, uniform code which will be concise, yet comprehensive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> I wish to make special reference to the provisions relating to public library services.  These provisions, contained in sections 34, 35 and 36, will have the effect of consolidating and modernising the law while at the same time strengthening and extending the library powers of local authorities.  The three sections will replace a total of nine separate Acts dating as far back as 1855, largely archaic in form and restrictive in effect.  This is exemplified by the fact that they even prohibit compulsory acquisition of a site for a library, something which I think was unique among local authority services.</P>
    <P>In their place, a simple enhanced set of provisions will be substituted, providing a new statutory basis for the library service, with broad and flexible powers, as well as important new elements such as provisions for the adoption of library development programmes.  Removal of the anomaly regarding the acquisition of land is provided for and there is provision to allow the application of updated provisions to An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.</P>
    <P>The public library is one of the most valuable services provided by the local authorities.  It serves educational, recreational and cultural purposes as well as more specialised needs such as those arising from the ever-increasing interest in local history and heritage.  The service constitutes a valuable resource and I want to see it continue to grow and develop.  I am delighted, therefore, to announce that I will be providing additional funding for the library service to the tune of almost £2 million this year.  This significant injection of funding is intended for new book stock providing an important boost to the service to coincide with its &ldquo;statutory relaunch&rdquo; under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The library service has done much to promote interest in local history and heritage, helping to develop a sense of identity and self-esteem within a community and a pride which can spill over into practical, beneficial effects such as care for the local environment and the built heritage.  There can also be an important tourist dividend with the increasing numbers of visitors motivated by a desire to <Col N="562" /> trace family roots and gather material about their ancestral place of origin.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate, however, that we should depend solely on the local librarian, or local history societies, to see to the collection, safeguarding and presentation to the public of local records and archival material.  That is the reason section 67 of the Bill contains a new provision relating to keeping local records and archives, modelled on the law applying to the national archives.</P>
    <P>There must be a priceless heritage of archival material throughout the country, deriving from the activities of our local authorities and the bodies that preceded them.  In the absence of any formal statutory provision and without a co-ordinated programme for the development of a local archives service much of this material could be lost or destroyed.  A network of fully-fledged local archival institutions cannot be developed overnight, but we cannot afford to delay in taking the basic steps.  Five years from now, in April 1999, our country councils will be 100 years old.  What better way could the councils mark their centenary than by resolving now to put in place a phased programme for recording, conserving and making available for inspection the records of their own activities over the years?  I hope to be able to make a tangible input to this in terms of a modest, but I hope useful, amount of funding.  Initially, this might be directed towards ascertaining what has been done to date in relation to local records and archives, what material exists in different areas, what the immediate priorities are, and how a consistent programme of development could best be put in place.</P>
    <P>With a wide-ranging Bill of this type, it is virtually impossible to comment on all the provisions in a Second Reading speech.  Some are, in any case, of a relatively minor or technical nature and do not require any elucidation of principles. I would like, however, to touch very briefly on a few further provisions.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains provisions relating to the office of local authority cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach which will, in future, be the official titles of the chairperson <Col N="563" /> and vice-chairperson and were recently introduced for the new Dublin authorities.  The titles of lord mayor and mayor will, however, continue to be used, where they already exist, with a new statutory provision for deputy lord mayor and deputy mayor.</P>
    <P>The existing law relating to local authority meetings is obscure, fragmented, inconsistent and well-nigh impenetrable from the point of view of the ordinary councillor or the public.  Part V provides for making regulations to introduce a modern and uniform code which will be beneficial to local authority members and officials and conducive to more efficient discharge of business.  It should also make the workings of local authorities more understandable and accessible to members of the public.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring briefly to Part VIII of the Bill as it contains provisions relating to the unavoidable question of finance.  The provisions themselves are largely technical in nature, dealing with such matters as situations where a local authority might adopt an insufficient estimate and updating the statutory basis for the payment of general purpose block grants to rating authorities.  I would like, however, to refer briefly to the wider question of local authority finance.</P>
    <P>Local government is a huge financial concern with a total workforce of almost 30,000 across the country and estimated total spending of over £1.6 billion in 1994; of that total, about £850 million is financed by Exchequer grants, almost all from my Department.  Local authorities provide a wide range of services, the extent and diversity of which are unequalled by any other undertakings in the land.  Many of these services are essential to life itself; all are vitally important to our quality of life, even if they are often taken for granted.</P>
    <P>I, more than anyone in this House, would like to be able to provide ever higher levels of financial support to improve and expand local services, but we must all be realistic about this.  Calls for more local authority spending are <Col N="564" /> either calls for more taxation or calls for expenditure cuts in other public services which are important in a caring society. We must take full account of the inescapable reality that there is no bottomless well of resources to meet all the many genuine demands that can be put forward. The Government has to strike a balance between expenditure and taxation. We simply cannot have it both ways.  The Government's aim is to reduce, rather than increase, the overall level of taxation and to achieve a fair allocation of the overall resources available. Within these limitations local government has been doing relatively well in recent years.  It is often said at times like this that local authorities have no resources of their own.  This year they will raise over £400 million from their own resources.  With Exchequer and European Union funding, this will allow them to finance housing, road developments and sanitary and other services for which they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the maximum return is achieved from the resources which are available.  The changes for which this Bill provides, with other reforms in recent years, will make for more efficient and effective local government. In particular, the removal of out-dated centralised controls should promote a greater sense of responsibility, initiative and dynamism on the part of local authorities and increase their determination to achieve the best possible return from the resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to improve local government in its operations and relevance to the communities it serves and to modernise its procedures and structures. It is a landmark Bill and I confidently commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a lost opportunity to do what should be done to make the local government system more meaningful and efficient.  Despite what the Minister said and the commitments in the Programme for Government this legislation does not address the central issue of the roles and functions to be <Col N="565" /> allocated to national and local government, respectively.  Until this is done there will be no change in local government.</P>
      <P>If we are to move away from a centralised system of government towards more self-reliant and self-governing communities there must be political commitment to strip the central Government system of local government functions.  I regret that the Government is not willing to let go and allow for devolution.  If this does not happen the changes proposed in this legislation will not improve the lot of local government.  Government is supposed to serve the people.  If this is to happen, a reformed local government system should be seen as a valid partner in the process of government and be accorded a status commensurate with its new role.  Ireland is way behind other western European countries in updating its regional and local government system. As a result, we have denied the people that we are supposed to serve the right to control their own affairs as far as possible and to play a more active part at every level of government.  The centralised system we operate has choked local initiative and prevented the development of the pool of talent that exists in local communities.  It is time we got rid of this outdated system of government and introduced a programme of public empowerment.  Local communities need and want to be more involved in the local process.  If we are prepared to strip central Government of many of the local functions it currently deals with, the public will respond at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is over 20 years since I was first elected to a local authority and in that time I have seen the system go backward instead of forward.  The reason is the abolition of domestic rates and the lack of anything to replace them.  I am not advocating that we should return to that outdated system of financing local government, but one must be realistic. Local government service cannot be provided without money, and no form of local government taxation will be acceptable to the public until the central taxation system is reformed.  How can we <Col N="566" /> ask anybody to pay additional taxes on top of what they are asked to pay at present?  The real problem we face is the failure of the Government to define the functions that should be carried out by local government and provide the finances to enable the local government system to operate.  We are trying to retain as much power as we can at central level and hand out as little money as possible to run the system we have.  The whole thing is an utter mess.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister's party that decided in 1977 to abolish domestic rates and fund local government from central taxes.  I listened to what the Minister said this morning when he asked for understanding because local government is only part of the administration that a Government has to service.  That is true, but the problem rests on the Minister's shoulders.  It was his party that decided that central Government should fund local government.  Since 1977, the Government has not kept pace with inflation in funding local authorities, but who gets the blame when the local authority cannot meet the demands of the public?  It is the local authority.</P>
    <P>A typical example is the appalling state of our roads.  About £100 million per annum is raised from motor taxation and an estimated £241 million from motor registration tax, yet the road network is collapsing around us.  If people think that some day they will wake up and find every pothole has disappeared and road surfaces are what one would expect to find in 1994 in the run-up to the 21st century, they are fooling themselves. Despite the state of the roads, there is no plan to reinstate the county road network as it used to be.  Local authorities do not even have money to fill potholes. Engineers in local authorities say that the best they can do is to throw a bucket of tar into a pothole but, because of the weather we have had during the last six to nine months, the hole that was filled last week will have all the tar washed out in less than a month.  What a disgrace, and what a waste of public money and of the time and energy of the workmen who are sent out to do this job.  Roads cannot <Col N="567" /> be built or repaired without money, and the local authorities do not have the money.  The Minister may plead that we must be understanding about the share of the cake that can go to local government. However, it was his party that decided that was the way it should be and they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The public are rightly becoming irate at the damage being caused to their vehicles which are so expensive, the risk to life, the accidents that are caused by the disgraceful condition of our road network and the absence of a plan to deal with this problem.  It is all very well to announce in the National Development Plan that we will spend so much money on building new national primary roads, here, there and everywhere.  I do not object to that, but every time we build a road we had better start building up a fund to maintain that road every year in the future because the EU will not be allocating money for the maintenance of national primary routes.  The maintenance of all those new roads will come out of current expenditure provided by the taxpayer.  We are building new roads now and we do not have the money to maintain the existing ones, yet nobody in the Government is prepared to come forward with a plan to tackle that.  We will cut tapes and put up plaques when we open by-passes. However, to get on to the by-pass one has to travel along county roads riddled with potholes and I have yet to hear any proposal from a member of this Government for dealing with that problem.  Once again it is the local authority that gets the blame.  I have read a few speeches by the Minister.  First he blames the councillors, then the county managers, then the inefficiency of the engineering staff, as if he himself were not responsible.  It is the Department of the Environment that controls the purse strings.  There is no point in blaming county managers, councillors or engineers for the state of our roads when they do not have the money to do anything about it.  That will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>As I stated, this Bill does nothing to alleviate the two central problems of our <Col N="568" /> local government system.  We must decide the roles and functions to be allocated to national and local government. We can change boundaries, repeal old legislation and update existing legislation, but that will not tackle the central issue of the functions to be given to local and national governments.  Having made that decision we should then decide proper financing for local government. Financing for local authorities cannot be decided without knowing the functions which they are expected to carry out. Until the Government addresses those two major issues the public will continue to consider local government irrelevant. We are destroying real potential in local communities which would produce growth in our economy and develop society as a whole.</P>
    <P>If we had a proper system of local Government more people would be prepared to serve as public representatives at local level, but we must first convince them that the system will allow them to use their talents for the benefit of society. Otherwise they will not be interested.  If Members are honest they will agree it is difficult for all political parties to find committed candidates to stand for local elections.  I accept that on the last occasion we had some issue candidates, for example, the pothole candidates in County Cavan, but they had a purpose in going forward for election.  The number of people prepared to go forward for local elections is reducing because they consider local government irrelevant. The newspapers published articles about the number of trips and the money involved but nothing is written about the contribution people are prepared to make.  It is extraordinary that the Department of the Environment has to control the number of meetings a county council should hold and, of course, the number of meetings will dictate the amount of allowance per month.  A member will have to attend 80 per cent of meetings to receive the allowance.  Am I living in the same world as that outlined in the Minister's speech?  He talked about giving great powers to local government and that central Government is taking its <Col N="569" /> hands off local government, but that is a joke.  We are conning people.  Will the Minister tell one county council it can hold 40 or 50 meetings a year and another that it can hold 70?  Will he tell county councillors that they must attend 80 per cent of those meetings to receive a certain allowance per month?</P>

      <P>I am giving my opinion about what is wrong with local government. There is too much interference from central Government and members involved in central Government are afraid to divest themselves of certain roles and functions and allow them to be carried out at local level.  This Government is not unique in that regard, successive Governments have been afraid to make that change.  The Minister should not say this is a Bill to reform local Government because it is nothing of the sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It contained one very important recommendation on the devolution of functions from the centre to a new revitalised local government system. It stated that the devolution process would have the following elements:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters which would be devolved from the centre and administered directly by local government would include: individual housing grants, group water schemes and driving testing; foreshore licences and non-commercial small harbours; non-national (heritage parks, protection of historical <Col N="570" /> and archaeological sites), and a role in the maintenance of public buildings; standards and controls for safety at work.</P>
    <P>More importantly it goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Matters which should be related to (though not necessarily integrated in) the local Government system, i.e. aspects of Education, Health, Social Welfare, Transport and Traffic, Heritage and Amenity, Tourism, Police and Courts, Consumer Protection, Social Employment Schemes.  There also appears to be scope for devolution in areas such as agriculture and industry. A Local Authority Information Service in relation to Public Service Activities should also be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that recommendation, it is the basis on which we should all work to develop a system of meaningful local government.  Local authorities should be involved &mdash; perhaps not directly &mdash; in the central issues outlined in the Barrington report.  The extent to which they can be involved can be debated, but there must be some connection between local government and those important services which the public need and deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> some weeks ago that the Minister intended to prohibit Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs from simultaneous membership of local authorities.  What has happened since then and since the publication of this Bill?  It is extraordinary that, not having gone ahead with that, we are now deciding that the best way forward is to disqualify Members of the Oireachtas from holding the office of cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach of a local authority after 1998.  With respect, does the Minister consider that reform?  A person is either a member of a local authority or not.  Will it be a case of a person, say, with black hair being chairman and a person with white hair being vice-chairman? The Minister should or should not <Col N="571" /> allow people to be members of a local authority.  A Member of the Oireachtas who is also a member of a local authority has similar rights to other members, but this legislation will prohibit such person from becoming the cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach. If a Senator is a member of a local authority, is the Minister claiming that he or she could not perform the duties of leas-chathaoirleach in a proper manner?  This is a pathetic attempt to show we are doing something about the question of the dual mandate.  I do not know if it is constitutional as I am not a constitutional lawyer.  People should not be allowed to become members of the local authority in the first place if the Minister does not want them to perform certain roles.</P>
    <P>If the Government has the will and courage to move from the centralised system of government to a more expanded role for local government, it would be in the interests of democracy that those who serve as public representatives at local level were not allowed to serve at national level and that those who serve at national level were not allowed to serve at local level.  If the Minister expands the role of local government we could then consider the question of dual mandate, but it should apply both ways.  If a person's career is in local government it should remain there and if one leaves local government and wishes to stand for national Government then so be it.  It is ridiculous to say that because one is a Member of the Oireachtas, one cannot stand for local government, but if one is a member of local government one can stand for the Oireachtas; that would mean people hopping and trotting off local authorities on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of allowing people bring experience to those bodies. I hope Members have contributed to the development of local authorities from the experience they gained at national level. If we had the courage to adopt a real system of local government giving greater powers to local authorities I would be the first to suggest that the two systems <Col N="572" /> should be separated and people should decide if they wish to serve at local or national level, but there is not much difference in the two systems at present.  It is time central Government showed its willingness to abolish the legislation under which the Minister of the day &mdash; I am not referring to the present Minister as such action has been exercised by his predecessors &mdash; can postpone the holding of local elections by order.  That is a case of big brother, central Government, deciding that local elections will not be held.  Elections to local authorities should be held every five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No Minister of any party or Government should be empowered to postpone an election for two years.  There have been many postponements in the past 20 to 30 years.  Elections were not held between the years 1967-74, 1974-79, 1979-85, 1985-91 and the present local councils are due to run from 1991-98, seven years.  A fixed term and election date should apply to local government as applies to the European elections.  Central Government should take its hand out of that administration and the people should decide every five years who they wish to elect.  That would provide us with a system of local government of which we can be proud and will serve people, which is the purpose of any system of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VI which deals with amenity, recreation, library and other functions is welcome.  Those functions are an essential part of the activities of local government. I am delighted a number of out-dated, restrictive enactments are being repealed in this Bill.  The role of local government in dealing with community and local affairs is vitally important, but, unfortunately, no finance is available to such bodies to enable them become involved.  I can say, with my hand on my heart, that in the 1970s in the Dublin County Council area, the local authority had more money to spend on amenities and grants for local developments than it has in 1994, and we are supposed to be <Col N="573" /> making progress.  At that time the national lottery had not been established. Why can national lottery funding not be chanelled through local authorities for distribution to local communities and sporting bodies?  The Estimates for this year highlights that no finance is available to local authorities for those activies.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the transfer of the sports section of the Department of Education and the Minister of State responsible to the Department of the Environment.  Such a change would result in a better co-ordinated approach in dealing with the needs of the public in regard to sport and recreation.  If I was Taoiseach tomorrow I would change the Minister's title to that of Minister for the Environment, Sport and Recreation. Those activities are an essential part of life in local areas.  We are ignoring the potential in those areas and the valuable work being done by voluntary groups. Many people give much of their spare time to looking after football and athletic teams and so on on a voluntary basis. Since the establishment of the national lottery it has become difficult for those groups to raise money at local level, particularly in under privileged areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, will confirm what I said in respect of the Ballybrack area, which we represent.  A football club there has approximately 17 teams.  When that club charges £5 per ticket for an entertainer like Joe Dolan in the Victor Hotel, its members have to collect £1 a week, door to door from the local people to make up the price of the ticket.  There is high unemployment in that area and people spend money on the national lottery.  That club received in the region of £200 last year from the County Dublin vocational education committee. The efforts of the voluntary members of that club are being ignored although the national lottery raises millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain to those people how a golf club or other organisation can get £30,000 or £50,000 when that club cannot be allocated £1,000 towards its annual running costs.  It does not turn away children when they arrive on a Saturday or Sunday morning without the <Col N="574" /> fare for the coach the club hires to transport players.  It sticks in people's craws to see large sums of money handed out everywhere and announcements made by Ministers, TDs and Senators while they are trying to do something worthwhile for the children of the area without receiving a penny from anybody.</P>
    <P>Part VIII, which refers to local authority estimates and rates, highlights the centralised system of local government. Under this legislation the Minister will retain power to instruct a local authority to revoke or amend its estimate of expenses following a request by a manager. The elected members of a local authority should be answerable to the people who elected them in respect of the level of service they supply and the charges they impose.  If the management of a local authority is not happy with the estimates agreed by the elected members the efficiency audit group should be called in to examine the expenditure being sought for the financial year.</P>
    <P>I know of managers who have said the rate was not sufficient and appealed the matter to the Minister.  However, the Minister does not need to be satisfied that the level of expenditure is justified or if savings can be made.  The word of the manager against that of the elected representatives decides such issues.  No manager or Minister should be allowed to interfere in that system.  An efficiency audit group should be called in when there is a dispute to examine the level of expenditure and to see if savings can be made.  Nobody should be allowed wave the big stick and have the right to abolish an elected local authority because they do not strike the rate the manager wants. That is not local democracy or local government.  It is time that out-dated system was removed.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the Barrington report, each local authority should publish an annual report within six months of the end of the financial year and include an audited statement of accounts. They should also be permitted to appoint a firm of commercial auditors to audit their accounts annually within standard <Col N="575" /> commercial deadlines.  That is how local government should be run.</P>
    <P>When three new local authorities were established in County Dublin in January the Minister waved a big stick and said that if they did not impose service charges he would abolish them.  The Minister in introducing this legislation said he is handing down great powers to local authorities, but he told them that if they do not charge the public more he will put them out of business, in the same year the residential property tax was introduced. It is time central Government removed the threat that &ldquo;either you do what I tell you or I will put you out of business&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the only provision in this legislation relating to town councils is that boundaries be extended for election purposes.  A reorganisation commission is to be set up to carry out a review and make proposals for the reorganisation of local government.  Why were the local elections postponed in 1991 if in 1994 the only provision we are making in legislation is for boundary changes and the setting up of a new commission?  What has happened to all the changes proposed in the last three or four years?</P>
    <P>I put the Minister on notice that my party will be opposing the powers in section 65, which provides that areas hitherto known as wards in county boroughs and district electoral division in counties will in future be known as electoral divisions and that the boundary of a division can be altered by regulations. I oppose the giving of this power to the Minister for the Environment in view of the commitment in the Programme for Government to set up on a statutory basis an independent electoral commission.  If the Minister of the day has power to decide on the boundaries of electoral divisions he will influence the work of the independent commission as electoral divisions will form the basis of Dáil constituency boundaries.  I will oppose that section tooth and nail.  If we are to have an independent electoral commission it should be allowed to do its job.  The Minister should not have power to alter <Col N="576" /> the boundaries of electoral divisions, which will form the basis on which the commission will do its work.</P>

      <P>I am astonished the Minister is bringing in a Bill with so few proposals, yet in his introductory speech he describes the proposals as being of major significance.  The Bill is a waste of time. It is astonishing to hear the Minister say in his speech that the Bill is, in its own right, a major exercise in reform, providing for what is probably the most extensive revision of local government law since the foundation of the State. That is excessive and a gross exaggeration of what is proposed in the Bill, much of which restates existing law in a more modern way.  It brings the law in this area up to date, which may be necessary, but it should not be called reform of local government.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for elections to town authorities in 1994.  Such elections have not taken place for nine years.  They were postponed on four separate occasions and the reason given was that there were major proposals under consideration for reform of the local government system and it was decided not to proceed with the elections until these proposals were in place.  Having witnessed four postponements of the elections the only proposal from the Minister is to extend boundaries in some towns.  The Minister knows there are many towns with substantial populations which have no town authority.  A substantial proportion of residents live in areas where there is no authority beneath the level of county borough or county council.  People not living in county council, county borough and town authority areas have no local authority available to them.  That matter has been swept under the carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I wondered for some time what approach the Government would take to elections to town authorities.  The excuse was used on previous occasions that extensive progress was being made in drawing up proposals for reform of local government and that we were to expect positive changes in this area.  I knew nothing positive was being done, but I wondered with the change of government what excuse would be used.  Under this Bill a commission is to be set up.  The Irish solution to nearly every problem is to pass the ball to somebody else, to think up some excuse to get us over the hump. We could not have the audacity to propose that elections to town authorities be postponed again, in which event, a period of ten years would elapse before elections are held.</P>
    <P>This is a depressing exercise.  It is clear that Ministers for the Environment for the last 20 years and Governments in those years, dominated for most of the time by Fianna Fáil and for part of the time by Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were involved in a conspiracy which is supported by these parties when they take office.  They support the ethos of the Department not to relinquish to town authorities any function or authority which it feels it can best carry out.  Despite the fact that in Brussels and Strasbourg we fully support the principle of subsidiarity for Ireland as a nation, we do not apply that principle to the administration of services at home. Ours is the most centralised system of government in the European Union and practically in the western world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That position is supported by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, including the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith.  His predecessors in recent years also supported that position and were reluctant to respond to the constant call from communities throughout the country to give them a more meaningful role in the administration of affairs in their locality.  That call has been clear for <Col N="578" /> the last 30 years and Muintir na Tíre responded to it in its movement for the establishment of community councils. Local government in Europe has responded to this call, which was not just an Irish phenomenon.  People wanted more of a say in the administration of affairs at local level, but we have resisted that call to devolve functions and stifled the local government system through lack of funding.</P>
    <P>It was ironic to listen to Deputy Barrett, a member of Fine Gael who, with Labour, brought in the Financial Provisions Act, 1983, which removed the statutory obligation on the Government to provide funds to local authorities in lieu of the money that would have accrued to them had rates on houses continued to be implemented.  Once that statutory obligation to properly and adequately fund the local authority system was removed, the whole system rapidly deteriorated.</P>
    <P>It was not only Fianna Fáil who proposed the abolition of rates on houses.  In the 1977 general election all the parties, Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, had that promise in their manifestos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the parties in the House at that time wanted the removal of rates on houses but they proposed it in different ways.  The Fine Gael and Labour proposal was to remove them by 25 per cent per year over a period of four years.  Fianna Fáil said it would remove them in one fell swoop, that was the only difference.  The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government at the time had started down that road; with a 25 per cent reduction, the remaining 75 per cent to be abolished the following year.  There <Col N="579" /> was a difference of two years between what Fianna Fáil did and what the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition intended to do.  So let us not make a big deal about that.  None of the parties in the House want the reintroduction of rates as a means of funding local authorities.  Given the high level of personal income tax and other taxes on employment, resulting in people having a low level of disposable income.  It is simply not politically realistic to seek to implement a local tax, whether on property or otherwise.  Until there is major reform of the system and there is a Government commitment to the sharing of national Exchequer revenues between central and local Government, people will not readily accept the imposition of a local tax to adequately fund the local authorities.</P>
      <P>That lack of funding is not the fault of the people.  Previous Governments changed the law on the funding of local authorities, the result of which is that local government is now in a shambles. It has little discretion over what it may or may not do in its locality.  It has a semblance of power and of having a certain range of functions, but its ability to carry out those functions is severely restricted and, as Deputy Barrett said, the rate support grant given to local authorities has not been maintained in line with increases in inflation.  The opposite has been the case.  However, central Government ensured that its finance was adequate to take account of inflation rates.  The Department's funding was not dealt with as was the funding for the local authorities.  There lies the crux of the matter &mdash; central Government looks after itself at budget time and local governments has been left aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Minister for the Environment in the past 20 years has taken a realistic stand on behalf of the local authorities to ensure they are properly funded.  Fine speeches will not cover up the neglect and decay that has set in to the system. People are angry about the inability of elected local authorities to deliver on the level of services expected and they are not over ambitious in their expectations. <Col N="580" /> People want reasonable facilities.  The deterioration of the whole county roads system at an accelerating pace due to the neglect of the Minister for the Environment and successive Governments to provide adequate funding, represents a serious dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>These roads were built with the investment of taxpayers money and decades of investment is now being washed away because of the failure to maintain road surfaces.  It is absolutely scandalous that millions of pounds were spent on building roads which have now been neglected in order to provide access for people in rural areas and towns.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister or the Government are waiting for; do they want the people of rural Ireland to march on Leinster House before they will take action to deal with this matter?  The Minister came into this House and made a fine speech about his proposals for the reform of local government.  This is not being done with mirrors and we are not fools.  I am 29 years a member of this House, I have seen Ministers come and go, I know what to believe and what not to believe and I will not believe speeches such as those made by the Minister this morning and his predecessors.  Whoever writes those scripts in the Department wrote practically the same scripts for some of the Minister's predecessors, including all the fine language.  This is the way things are done now; a script is handed to the newpaper journalists, that is the headline they run with and who cares if the reality does not live up to the verbiage.  I care and I have the right to speak on behalf of the people who sent me here to complain about the neglect.</P>
    <P>Tens of thousands of people here love this country, want to live and work here and want to play a role in improving the areas where they live.  After their families they are concerned about the upkeep of their local areas.  They want to be proud of their areas and contribute to their improvement.  The Government can be in no doubt about the willingness of people to work voluntarily to improve their own areas, to act on local councils and to offer themselves for election or <Col N="581" /> rejection at local council level.  Although there may be few functions that the local council can provide, in the main, they are the functions in which the people are mostly interested, namely, the amenities and facilities in their own locality.</P>
    <P>When the Leader programme was promoted at Europen level, it was available here on a pilot basis and people are in ecstasy about how sucsessful it has been. The response of the people has been lauded but we knew there would be such a response because there is a desire on the part of the ordinary person to participate in the betterment of his or her own locality.  Central Government, however, has been a major obstacle to that and has never yet admitted that it is a stifling influence on community development and some change will have to be made.</P>
    <P>The expectation of major reform arising from the discussions between parties in this House in Government over the past number of years &mdash; certainly since 1989 &mdash; would lead one to believe that something meaningful would emerge in the area of local Government reform. Instead of that we have tripe in the form of this Bill.  The only solid parts of the Bill concern the up-dating and re-stating of existing legislation just like the referendum Bill before us the other day which for that reason needed little debate.  This type of mirage to suggest that some activity is taking place and the use of flowery language may fool some people but it will not fool everybody.</P>
    <P>The specifics of the Bill are so bare that one wonders about the necessity for its introduction.  If it was necessary to have a Bill could it not have been a one line Bill stating that the town authority elections will be held in 1994.  I am not certain that this Bill is essential.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Chairpersons of various Oireachtas select committees, members of the European Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General and judges are excluded from local authority membership.  When did a judge or a Comptroller and Auditor General ever decide to stand for election <Col N="582" /> to a local authority?  From where did the Minister get all these public office holders?  Was it just to fill up space in the Bill?  Is he afraid Commissioner Padraig Flynn wants to come back in June to stand for election to the Castlebar Urban District Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is laughable.  These issues do not arise.  I am a long standing Member of the House and I never remember it happening.  The Minister has not given a satisfactory explanation.  If Members of the Oireachtas were debarred from membership of local authorities I would say, having given it careful consideration, the Minister is creating a real distinction between the role of central Government and local government.  That would have been worthwhile and radical but I have come to accept that I must not expect anything radical from the Government. If the Minister wanted to give local government a separate identity he should exclude Dáil Members from local authority membership.</P>
      <P>If a councillor was elected to the Dáil he should have the right to nominate his successor.  That would overcome the conflict and jostling that occurs when a vacancy arises.  The procedures should be similar to that operating in the European Parliament where there are replacement substitute candidates in the event of a vacancy arising.</P>
      <P>It is not an earth shattering proposal as the Minister claimed in his speech when he said it is &ldquo;the most extensive revision of local government law undertaken since the foundation of the State&rdquo;. If that is an example of one of the major changes I am sure there are other people who would feel as I do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each local authority is to have a Cathoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach and I agree with that.  However a Member of the Oireachtas is disqualified from being a Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach. As Deputy Barrett said, if a person is elected to a local authority it seems strange that he should not be <Col N="583" /> entitled to go forward for whatever positions may arise.  It would have been more sensible to apply the &ldquo;no dual mandate&rdquo; principle instead of this milk and water proposal.  It is not an area of major reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reorganisation commission as being independent and then said he would appoint all the members to it.  The Minister cannot claim it is independent if he makes the appointments.  That matter was debated on numerous occasions when other legislation was processed.  In the recent past the Government agreed to nominate organisations who would have a right to nominate people whom the Minister would appoint rather than have the Minister select all the members.  It would be wiser to continue down that road rather than revert to the position where the Minister appoints all the members.  The commission's proposals will be implemented subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the work of the commission is to be embodied in legislation the commission must be seen to be independent and above party political influence. This will not be the case if the Minister appoints the members.  He should reconsider that issue.</P>
    <P>Local Government reform cannot be isolated from adequate funding for local authorities.  The distribution of the rate support grant has given rise to concern. It is not distributed in a logical manner but on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and the amounts to be allocated are decided by the Minister. That provision is contained in the Finance Act, 1983, introduced by the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition.  It gives the Minister absolute discretion regarding the amount of money to be allocated.  Will the Minister indicate why he has not made a statement about the proposal to introduce equality in determining the allocation of the annual grants if the rate support grant is to remain the major source of funding for local authorities? The fiscal studies report highlighted major differences in the amounts allocated and it may have been an embarrassment <Col N="584" /> to the Minister to see the huge discrepancies that existed following this accepted method of assessment of the needs of each local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues Deputies Barrett and Molloy in expressing disappointment with the Bill.  We have become used to a style of Government which is all about spin and nothing about substance.  It does not matter what the Government do so long as there is an army of spin doctors, advisers and public relations consultants to put the best gloss on every statement and pretend something extraordinary is happening.  This is one of the most pathetic examples of appallingly weak, inadequate legislation being hyped up by the Minister for the Environment as if it were major local government reform.  It is nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to his experience in the Department of the Environment, the need for his officials to consult the texts of old Acts and the urgent need to modernise all that law.  This is very laudable: it is time the archaic legislation and texts which embody local government law were modernised and consolidated into a single Act.  A case could probably be made for a local government consolidation Bill.  However, writing old law in a new way does not constitute local government reform.  It is a classic case of <Col N="585" /> putting old wine into new bottles.  This Bill may well restate in a more modern and coherent way various pieces of local government law but it will not reform our outdated, out of touch and badly financed system of local government.</P>
    <P>In most countries local government reform means giving power back to the people; to use the current Euro term which is so much in vogue, it means giving effect to the principle of subsidiarity, giving people a greater involvement in the way their areas and environment are controlled and administered.  In Ireland local government reform means a ministerial speech which presses all the right buttons and uses all of the politically correct phrases about local government reform but which always postpones local elections thus denying people their minimal involvement in local government, this is, the right to vote for their representatives. It always means ducking the crucial question of the financing of local government, setting up yet another commission to examine the system and, at best, a little administrative tidying up. That is effectively what this Bill does.</P>
    <P>I have a sense of <i>déjá vu</i> about the debate on this Bill.  On 15 May 1990 the then Minister for the Environment came into the House with an order to postpone the local government elections which were due to be held that year.  The reason given for the postponement was that the Minister was setting up an expert committee to examine local government reform, something which had been under examination for more than 20 years: in other words, because a committee was being set up we could not have elections to old bodies.  Everybody agreed there should be reform and the expert committee would examine the matter and produce a report, legislation would be introduced by the beginning of 1991 and the local elections would be held later that year.  However, in 1991 there was yet another postponement of the urban council and town commission elections, which we are discussing today.  The reason given for that postponement was that such an extensive reform of local government was taking place at county <Col N="586" /> level that the question of reform of local government at town and district level would require further examination.</P>
    <P>There will have been a nine year interval between the urban district council elections in 1985 and the elections which will take place later this year.  The Minister referred to his commitment to electoral reform, the measures he has taken in this area and the legislation he has introduced, and will introduce for example, the Presidential Elections Act and the Referendum Bill.  It is some reform when elections which are due to be held are postponed and people are denied their basic right to vote for their representatives, the purpose of an election in the first instance.  In anybody's language, nine years is too long an interval between the holding of local elections. The last occasion on which local elections were held on time was in 1979. It will be 1998 or possibly 1999 when the next local elections will be held.  During the intervening 20 years, there will have been much talk about local government reform.  Giving people the opportunity to vote for their representatives on three occasions in a 20 year period, when five local elections should have been held, does not constitute electoral reform.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to postpone the county council elections until 1998.  These elections were postponed in 1990 to 1991 but are due to be held in 1996.  The Minister has given himself the additional power in section 25 to postpone these elections until a later date, something he probably will do.  The rationale behind the postponement of the elections in 1998 will be that as the European elections will be held in 1999, it will be better to wait the extra year and have all the elections together.  This is the type of rationale used by the Government for the postponement of elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made fine speeches about electoral reform yet, the local elections are postponed and no reference has been made to the two vacancies which have existed in this House for over a year and for which by-elections should be held.  Last week the Taoiseach said it may be too complicated to hold the by-elections <Col N="587" /> on the same day as the European elections.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the by-elections will be held on 9 June as expected?  The postponement of these elections would not happen in a banana republic in the southern hemisphere. This country is sending observers &mdash; Members of this House and representatives of non-governmental organisations &mdash; to oversee the elections in South Africa, and this from a country which refuses to hold elections.  The Government is being downright hypocritical about its commitment to electoral reform and giving people the right to vote.</P>
      <P>The postponement of the elections from 1990 to 1991 was to allow the Barrington committee to report.  That committee made certain recommendations about urban councils and town commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It avoided the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It made recommendations about what was called the sub-county structure and proposed two alternative options.  As it happens, I did not agree with the recommendations of that committee but that was sufficient at that time for the Government to come in here in 1991 and say, &ldquo;we have not yet decided what we will do about the urban district councils and town commissions, we must wait a little longer, more work <Col N="588" /> will have to be done on this so the elections cannot go ahead in 1991.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government has had four years since the original postponement of the local elections in 1990 and the establishment of the Barrington committee in which to produce a reform of urban district councils and town commissions. What has it produced in those four years? At the beginning of this year we had the panic, a circular issued to the county managers concerned telling them to produce revised boundaries for the various towns in their counties and submit them to the Department of the Environment by the end of March 1994.  That was done because the Government was in a flap, because it had given a commitment that the local elections would go ahead in June 1994, because it was politically tied to that commitment and it would have been too embarrassing to go for another postponement; it had to produce something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reform of local government has been carried out, so what are we getting? We have county managers producing revised boundaries, which will be electoral boundaries only, and people will be asked to vote for them.  For what are people being asked to vote in these new enlarged towns?  They are being asked to elect people to bodies which will not administer the areas in which those people live.  It may well be that, at some point in the future, those towns will be extended to cover those administrative areas.  Therefore, there will be candidates in these elections knocking on doors on the outskirts of towns asking people to vote for the urban council or town commission elections in those towns, and the people at the door &mdash; as people always ask what are you going to do for me?  The answer will be there is nothing I can do for you because the body to which you will elect me will not be delivering services to your area.  The remaining credibility of local government and local elections will be undermined by an absurd circumstance being produced under the provisions of this Bill, people will be electing representatives to bodies <Col N="589" /> which will not administer the areas in which the votes live.</P>
    <P>Why did we wait these four years? There had been an expectation that, at a minimum, some of the larger town commissions would have been raised in status to urban district councils but little or nothing has been done in that area.  There is a root and branch reform required at local government level which has not been dealt with under the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we have the postponement of the local authority elections in 1998.  In our discussion of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1993, I argued that, in the establishment of the new Dublin county councils, there should have been a fresh set of elections to allow the people of Dublin an opportunity to vote for the members of these new county councils. Now the earliest opportunity the people of Dublin will have to vote for those county councils, which came into being at the beginning of 1994, will be four and a half years later, in the middle of 1998. That makes a mockery of local government if the Minister does not exercise his powers under section 25 of this Bill to provide for a further postponement.</P>
    <P>Then there is the provision in section 6 of this Bill regarding the disqualification of various people from membership of local authorities or from various offices in local authorities.  I will not lie awake at night worrying about the fate of the chairpersons of the various Oireachtas Committees but I am concerned about some of the small print in this section, for example, the reference to people who may be disqualified for the non-payment of court awards made against them in respect of a local authority.  Does that mean that if somebody say a member of ACRA who participated in ACRA's campaign of non-payment of service charges in some parts of the country, stands for election to a local authority, has participated in that campaign and, as part of that campaign, has not paid service charges he or she will be disqualified? As I understand it they will be disqualified from membership of a local authority under the provisions of this <Col N="590" /> Bill.  Similarly, if, say, a pothole councillor or somebody who is engaged in that type of campaign decides to withold some payment from a local authority.  Would such disqualification apply?  For example, a local authority tenant who very often, through no fault of theirs but rather through some kind of retrospective assessment which very often occurs in the assessment of local authority rents, may find themselves with an award being made against them in court.  Very often tenants can find themselves with very large arrears, not through any continuous neglect of payment on their part but perhaps through the non-supply of information or some difficulty that may have arisen in that area, sometimes through family difficulties, and if they are not in a position to pay the rent, they will be disqualified from membership of a local authority.  This is a draconian power the Minister is stitching into this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of local government reform in this House over many years.  We had the Local Government Act, 1991, many aspects of which provided for a reform of local government had its provisions being implemented.  The most exciting part of the 1991 Act was Part VI which allowed local authorities to establish committees and joint committees on a completely new basis, allowed local authorities to involve in those committees and in the running of services people from the wider community, from sports clubs, voluntary organisations, residents associations and so on, allowing local authorities to delegate those functions to those committees. Those sections of the 1991 Act, three years later, still have not been implemented.  I wonder why.  Why were local authorities denied the right to reform the manner in which they operate themselves simply because the Minister has not implemented sections of the Bill passed in this House three years ago?</P>
    <P>Then there is the provision in Part VIII of this Bill regarding estimates.  As I read it, in this Bill there is a new provision &mdash; the Minister can, by order, change the estimates a local authority has struck if he considers it to be an insufficient estimate. <Col N="591" /> As I understand the provision here, effectively he can order that local authority to change its estimate.  In other words, it gives the Minister effective power to adopt estimates for local authorities. That is one thing I cannot understand because, at the end of the explanatory and financial memorandum we are told there are no financial implications in the provisions of this Bill.  A very simple reform which could have been effected and which both members and officers of local authorities would have welcomed would have been to reform the archaic system of accounting obtaining in local authorities and in the drawing up of local authority estimates. I see no reference to that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole question of finance has been avoided.  Perhaps the most significant omission from this Bill is the total absence of any proposal to deal with the financial crisis facing local government. The failure of successive Governments to put local government on a sound financial footing means that local services in many areas are virtually grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>A number of reports highlighted the growing crisis in local government funding as councils fight a daily battle to survive. However, successive Minister have failed to act, preferring instead to force councils to impose or increase service charges.  The present rate of support system is totally unsatisfactory.  It was drawn up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and produces huge variations between the funds available to different authorities.  For instance, the <i>per capita</i> rate support grant for local authorities in the County Dublin area last year was £38.60, less than half which the Minister gave to his own local authority in Tipperary North Riding. Water charges have now been forced through in the three new county councils of Dublin by the Coalition parties and it seems that Dublin Corporation will be forced to follow suit next year.</P>
    <P>The main objection to service charges which is as valid now as it was in 1983, when they were first introduced, is that they are levied in the main on the already overtaxed PAYE sector.  It should be <Col N="592" /> remembered that both the Government parties, when in Opposition, pledged to repeal the charges and milk them for all their political advantage but they have now totally reneged on their promises. Householders who are unable to pay service charges or who take a principled stand against them are treated without mercy.  There is a great contrast between the way our authorities deal with the wealthy tax dodgers on the one hand and the water charge protesters on the other.</P>
    <P>Wealthy tax dodgers are the beneficiaries of regular amnesties and allowed to write off huge debts owed to the State.  Those who take a stand against the form of double taxation represented by water charges are subjected to heavy-handed treatment with children refused higher education grants, money deducted from pensions and disconnection of supply.  Local authorities should not be allowed to withdraw vital water supplies and should be required to cover any outstanding charges through the courts, as in the case of other debts.</P>
    <P>The public are becoming used to U-turns by politicians &mdash; changing their position in Opposition to a different position when in Government.  Nobody performed a U-turn with more skill than the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, in relation to water charges.  He built his political career by opposing service charges.  He is now presiding over the effective imposition of charges by diktat on local authorities and the various communities they represent.  There is no point in making speeches to the public saying that at some stage in the future these charges may be abolished when the Minister &mdash; and in this case the Minister of State &mdash; has the power to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Section 48 deals with local government finance and provides that the Minister for the Environment can give whatever size of grant he wishes to local authorities. There is no provision for funding local government.  On 15 May 1990, when the local government elections were postponed, the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Flynn, said &mdash; Official <Col N="593" /> Report, column 1157 &mdash;: &ldquo;It is appropriate that this question of funding should now be examined in conjunction with the question of structures and functions&rdquo;.  He did not make it a term of reference for the Barrington committee.  After Barrington had reported the Institute of Fiscal Studies carried out a study of the funding of local government.  That study is still gathering dust on somebody's desk and nothing has been done about it.  We are no wiser today about the Government's intentions with regard to the funding of local government than at that time.  The only inkling we have is that it is the Government's intention to starve local authorities of central funding and to force them to charge the public for services. There are now charges for water and in some counties for sanitary services and refuse collection.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 3 April 1994, stated that it is the Government's intention, as I had suspected, that the motorway ring around Dublin will be a toll road.  Local authorities will be told to charge people &mdash; who have already paid road tax &mdash; using the roads.  This is the direction in which the Government is going.  It is putting the gun to the heads of local authorities and telling them to charge for services.  However, the public want a system of local government that provides efficient services, good roads, good public parks and good housing properly maintained.  They also want a system of local government that will provide for a clean environment for themselves and their children.  They want to feel a sense of community where the local authorities support the voluntary efforts of community organisations through sports clubs, youth clubs, residents' associations and so on.  They want control over the decisions which affect their lives. What passes for local government reform by the Minister for the Environment does not provide for any of those things.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that various services can be provided by local authorities ranging from libraries to roads but that was already the case.  The problem most local authorities experience in providing those services is lack of resources.  Providing in <Col N="594" /> a Bill that a local authority may do X, Y and Z is completely meaningless when the local authority does not have the resources and no means of obtaining them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the system of local government that operates in Denmark. I wish we had the same system here and the level of commitment from the Irish Government as the Danish Government has to devolving powers and giving resources to local authorities.  In Denmark two-thirds of all public expenditure is spent at local government level whereas the whole approach here is to retain the financial control in central departments.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not provide for local government reform.  It is crude, sloppy, lazy legislation introduced for the primary purpose of postponing the local elections, and to allow the local elections to the urban councils to proceed this year on the basis of the revised boundaries.  It will introduce a greater degree of confusion into an already confused system of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this elaborate legislation introduced by the Minister. I understand that with 77 sections it is one of the longest Local Government Bills introduced in the history of the State.  It updates many Victorian Acts and brings us into line with modern times. In this country we speak about local government reform and everyone, including Governments, have been afraid to challenge it.  The Minister is going part of the way in identifying with what has been said in the past.  The first real attempt to reform local government was in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  People say that this Bill would not have been introduced were it not for the necessity to hold local elections.  The last urban council elections were held nine years ago.  There has been much discussion in the intervening period and we heard talk of district councils and other issues while different parties in Government were identified with certain beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government affects every day life and is very important.  The first thing that <Col N="595" /> comes to mind is the condition of our roads.  This issue affects all politicians, especially those outside the greater Dublin area where road structure is second to none.  County Cork, has a reasonably good roads structure but improvements are necessary.  I understand that this year £57 million will be spent on county roads.  An even greater amount was spent last year but the system is to be changed this year.</P>
    <P>National primary roads are of vital importance.  Heavy vehicles on the national primary routes are weighed regularly, to comply with EC legislation and to ensure that they do not damage the roads.  However, because of the changes in business in rural areas the county roads, many of which date from Cromwellian times, have to carry greater weights than the primary roads.  They cannot continue to carry that level of traffic and this problem needs to be examined. Year after year the county council has to carry out essential repairs to sections of county roads, sometimes three or four times a year.  In fairness, the people who work on the roads do an excellent job but there is a serious problem with drainage of county roads as a result of which water polluted by soil and acid lies on the road corroding the top dressing.  Narrow county roads cannot accommodate two wide vehicles side by side so that they are driven up on the dykes and take soil on to the road as well as blocking the inlets into the dikes. This is causing major problems.  I sympathise with local government and the Minister in his efforts to improve our county roads but we need to take an intelligent approach to the problem.  I am glad the Irish Farmers' Association is taking an interest in county roads.  It realises the importance of a good roads structure for transporting goods and services. I urge the Minister to enter into negotiations with the farming community with a view to taking a partnership approach in alleviating this problem because they seem to know how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Some seven to ten years ago we had <Col N="596" /> special grants to maintain scenic routes serving little coves, seaside resorts and areas of heritage but they were withdrawn. I call for their reintroduction.</P>
    <P>We have a model system of local government, one of the best in the country in County Cork.  The county council employes 2,500 people and has a turnover in the region of £120 million, which is big business.  It is responsible for 7,000 miles of public road, 700 miles of which is on the coast stretching from Youghal Bridge to the Kerry border.  That takes a huge amount of servicing including expertise to deal with coastal erosion and many other problems.  I am extremely proud of the management, engineering and other staff of Cork County Council. The county council has a northern, southern and western division under three separate assistant or deputy county managers who are all innovative and play a major developmental role.  Dublin County Council would have been well advised to look at how the system operates in Cork and rather than establishing three separate county councils they could have taken their example.  That would have been a better way forward.  I understand that the system in Dublin is working reasonably well but in areas it leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>The morale of county councillors is low and I wonder why.  Is it because they have no say in decision making or are not prepared to take decisions?  The financial area relates to business and councillors of all persuasions like to be involved in financial decisions but there are few decisions to be taken in that area because there are no moneys coming into the system to develop it.  We need to look at methods of funding local authorities in a different way.  The State is perhaps too much involved in local authorities and I do not support this because it takes away from the councils's autonomy.</P>
    <P>The council do an excellent job but we are seeing a change because of the dual mandate about which we have heard much.  It is proposed to give the chairman of the county council an executive type function.  If so, we will need to examine the impediments incorporated in the <Col N="597" /> county managers Acts of the thirties and fifties.  The county manager has the executive power and is in a position to override the decisions of local authority members if he is not satisfied with them. This does not happen very often, but it is a real possibility and we are always nervous of it.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate here is becoming a bit of a laugh.  Politicians are being encouraged to resign from one job before taking on another.  The dual mandate operates in France and in many other countries.  I understand that it is proposed to deprive councillors who are also Members of this House from holding the office of chairman of the local authority. I would not support any such proposal; it is a retrograde step as it will deprive Deputies of their right to be nominated by other councillors as chairperson.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the workload of Ministers and a reference to the American system.  If Ministers are as busy as they say they are should we consider some other method of appointing them?  They must neglect their constituents as they have to appoint advisers to look after them.  There is, therefore, a need for reform.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is extremely busy and has tried to reform the local government system.  If he was not a Dáil Deputy he would be able to devote more of his time to local government affairs.  As we are all aware, because Ministers are extremely busy it is becoming fashionable to appoint advisers.</P>
    <P>Many Members have held a dual mandate and candidates in the European elections, in an effort to maximise their vote, said that they will offer the seat to somebody else if they are elected.  In 1987 Ray MacSharry held a dual mandate and did an excellent job.  When Deputy Cox held a dual mandate he was heavily criticised mainly because he offered to give the seat to somebody else if he was elected.  Others who held a dual mandate include Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Blaney.</P>
    <P>People with expertise are appointed as chairpersons or directors of semi-State <Col N="598" /> bodies.  These people are double jobbers and have a dual mandate.  Bernie Cahill, who is a busy man, was appointed because he had special expertise.  Why should a Dáil Deputy with ability be deprived of the opportunity to be appointed as chairperson of a local authority? I am not aware of any great demand for a provision such as this.  This is only the thin edge of the wedge; under any subsequent legislation local authority members will not be allowed to be a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad who is a colleague of mine will not have to seek re-election.  The two cushiest jobs in the Oireachtas are those of the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathoirleach of the Seanad.  Why should they be given more protection than a backbencher, like myself?  It is time we stopped this nonsense.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the dual mandate a person elected by the public has a constitutional right to seek the position of chairperson of a county council. Local authorities have a major role to play in each county.  A case can be made in favour of expanding this role.  We now have enterprise boards, the Leader programme, various town bodies and a training authority while the Industrial Development Authority has been divided into three bodies.  Every Member is aware of the problems constituents can encounter when they apply for grants from any of these bodies.  Local authorities should have a co-ordinating role and provide assistance to these people.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture and energy within local authorities have tended to overlook forestry development which has been a source of annoyance for some land owners for several reasons such as problems with drainage and the road structure.  Since the programme was adopted and promoted by the European Union in recent years county councils have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The population of this country is 3.5 million; yet we have the most expensive local government system in the western world.  It is hard to explain the reason we have such a top heavy executive structure. <Col N="599" /> Society is full of whizz kids and do-gooders who have many ideas but which rarely work.  There is a need to reform the system.  Someone will have to say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;; are we getting value for money and is the system cost effective?</P>
    <P>My party's 1977 manifesto was heavily criticised.  Such a reform was inevitable as the rateable valuation system was a burden and a financial strain.  The system of land valuation would have been changed by some Government if the Government led by Jack Lynch &mdash; whom I wish well &mdash; had not done so.  With hindsight it is easy to be wise.</P>
    <P>Service charges were introduced under the 1983 Local Government Act and we should recognise there is a need for them. As problems have been encountered throughout the country we should now close ranks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the section which deals with convictions for the non payment of charges.  I support this section because if members of local authority fail to give example there will be no discipline.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to provide an additional £2 million for libraries.  There is an excellent library service in Cork where an extensive modernisation programme is underway.  In our provincial towns we have some of the finest libraries, but many more towns are awaiting development, for example, Mallow, Youghal, Midleton which is onstream, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, which is looking for new facilities.  There is more to a modern library than the facility to get a book and take it home.  There are many more periodicals and newspapers available both to our people and to tourists. A library must be easily accessible to everybody because of the facilities it provides and, therefore, this is a progressive step.</P>
    <P>I often dominate the House and there is much more I would like to say.  On this occasion I had to say a few words, whether popular or unpopular.  I have said them and I thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard so <Col N="600" /> much about reform of local government in the last five or six years that it is disappointing this is all we have received. Politicians, the public and members of local authorities were led to expect general reform of local government, but unfortunately that has not happened. Having awaited the publication of this Bill with a certain amount of anticipation and interest I am disappointed at what has been produced, a Bill with much padding and rhetoric and little sign of any local government reform.</P>
      <P>Local government reform is essentially conceived to give local people an effective say in the running of their affairs, but there is nothing in this Bill to provide for it.  The Bill does provide for the extension of town commission and urban district boundaries, but it should not have been necessary to introduce a Bill to do that.  The Minister may think that if he can convince the public he is doing something, it does not matter whether he does it.  This Bill is all shadow and no substance and may fool some of the public, but it does not fool me.  The extension of the town commission boundaries and urban district boundaries is for electoral purposes only.  The people will have a right to vote for the candidates offering themselves for election but, once elected, those candidates will not be able to represent the extended areas, responsibility for which will still remain with the local authority in whose area they are.  When Galway City was made a full county borough in 1986 by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the county council and the city council, in consultation with each other, worked out a major extension of the city boundary to take in large parts of the now built up city and much rural land for future development of the city. This was a real extension of a local authority boundary because the responsibility for providing services in the new area was also given to the authority taking over those areas.  I mention this to highlight that what is proposed in this Bill is not reform of local government in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collapse of local government as we know it began in 1977 when, in order to <Col N="601" /> win the election, Dr. O'Donoghue decided to abolish domestic rates.  Perhaps it was right to abolish domestic rates which were an unfair local taxation.  We were promised that the amount of money lost to local authorities would be reimbursed by way of what we now call the rate support grant.  That was done for one or two years, perhaps three in some cases.  Since then the grant has fallen far short of compensating local authorities for the loss of domestic rates.  The local authorities lost their power to raise money and spend it in their own areas as they deemed necessary.  This loss of the rate support grant has ensured that local authorities are now unable to carry out their functions as local authorities.  I was a member of Galway County Council for 20 years and of Galway City Council for eight or nine years.  The service provided to people has deteriorated greatly in the last few years.  The only functions local authorities now have is to pass the annual estimates and draw up a county or city development plan every five or six years. All other powers have been stripped from them and they have suffered because of that.  They have suffered because the 1977 manifesto has denied them the funds they were due and, in every year since 1980, the necessary finance to run the services within the county.</P>
    <P>The most obvious example is the lack of funds to service the roads.  The amount of money provided by the Department is sufficient for surface dressing of county roads in Galway only every 40 years.  Two or three years ago that was 35 years. At the present rate of funding that will increase to 50 years until the whole system of county roads will collapse altogether. It is a false economy.  Many roads are deteriorating to such an extent that some are now impassable.  In Connemara and other parts of the county, doctors and public health nurses have to park their cars at the end of a country road and walk a mile across potholed roads to deal with their patients.  School children cycling to school or walking to meet buses must traverse the same road.  In áiteanna i gConnemara ta na bóithre ana uafásach. That is because once the surface dressing <Col N="602" /> of roads in such hilly terrain deteriorates, the foundation is washed away.  It is false economy not to provide money for the surface dressing of those roads because it will cost millions to restore them to their original state.  Drainage should form an important part in the construction of roads in such areas.  The criminal neglect of those roads is due solely to the fact that county councils are not provided with the necessary funding to carry out repairs.</P>
    <P>It would be logical to spend some money to take water off those roads, but we should at least keep their surface dressing in place.  In the long term that would save the Department of the Environment millions of pounds because the structure of the road would be maintained. Throwing loose stones into potholes is a waste of time, energy and money.  It is false economy.  In a wet winter those stones will be washed away within a week.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to explain to people why our county roads are in such a state when I consider the amount of money spent on national primary routes.  In the past six months a total of £1.6 million was spent on a mile and a half or two mile stretch of road on the Dublin-Galway route between Oranmore and Derrydonnel. The surface of that road, which appeared to be adequate, was taken up, the road was lowered, raised and lowered again, ending up with a road which is more dangerous than the one which existed before the repairs began.  On part of that road the surface is higher than the boundary walls of the houses and fences alongside it and that can be very dangerous. Will the Minister explain how £1.6 million can be available for that type of work while in rural areas of County Galway roads are virtually impassable?</P>
    <P>Major local authority schemes are being financed by Brussels where the criteria for the spending of such moneys are laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to speak.  Until we <Col N="603" /> channel to local authorities the EU money available for providing services in local areas, we will not have tackled local government reform.</P>
      <P>Money is provided from the EU for group water schemes, but such schemes have come to a complete halt in County Galway and other rural areas because the money is not being channelled to local government.  We are told it is not viable to grant-aid schemes in isolated rural areas where there are 200 or 300 houses scattered within a radius of four or five miles.  People living in such areas are as much entitled to running water in their houses as those living in built up urban areas.  The channelling of money to local authorities for such schemes should also form part of any meaningful local government reform.</P>
      <P>A £25 million sewerage scheme in Galway city to prevent the pumping of raw sewage into the bay and waterways has not been sanctioned because of lack of liaison between the local authority and the EU.  Last year sanction was refused because somebody claimed it might breach an EC directive on birds and this was investigated by the EU.  Officials of the EU requested the Department of the Environment to submit the second environmental impact study on the scheme produced by Galway Corporation and it took 2 months and two days for the Department to send a copy of that study to Brussels.  I do not know how much money the Department of the Environment has to allocate for local services since we lost out in respect of the Structural Funds, but perhaps that is why we in Galway are destroying our bay and beaches.  As a result of the delay in sanctioning that scheme we have not received the blue flag status for our major beaches for the past two years.  We are willing to proceed with the scheme, but until we open the channels between local authorities and Brussels there will not be any real local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before publication of this Bill I read in newspapers articles that the Minister intended abolishing the dual mandate whereby a member of a local authority <Col N="604" /> could also be a Member of the Oireachtas.  However, I understand Fianna Fáil and Labour backbenchers objected to that section and it was not included in the Bill.  I was amused to hear my colleague, Deputy Molloy, stating that he favours the abolition of the dual mandate.  Between 1989 and 1991, when he was a Minister, he remained a member of his local authority despite my advice that he should resign.  He resigned from the sheep dipping committee, but remained a member of several other subsidiary committees of the council.  I am glad that at least he has seen the error of his ways and taken my advice.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind in regard to the dual mandate.  There is merit in having people here who are also members of local authorities because of their direct knowledge of local matters, but there is also merit in having people solely members of local authorities.  If local authorities are properly financed members should only be members of those authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not see merit in excluding a Member of the Oireachtas from being chairperson of a local authority.  Two years ago I had the privilege of being elected mayor of Galway and I enjoyed the role.  I would have given up my position as a Member of the Oireachtas to serve as mayor of Galway because I achieved more in one year in that position than I achieved in one year as a Member of the Oireachtas.  It was a full time job and if I had not been a professional fulltime politician I would not have been able to carry out the demanding duties placed on me as mayor of a city.  I fail to understand how anybody holding down a nine to five job, as members of local authorities who are not Members of the Oireachtas must do, would be able to carry out that function.  Will the Minister reconsider that aspect of the Bill?</P>
    <P>None of the provisions in the Bill indicates real reform of local government. We are only fooling ourselves by pretending that the extension of boundaries and debarring the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, the Cathoirleach of the Seanad and judges from being members of local <Col N="605" /> authorities is reform of local government. I do not know many judges who are anxious to be members of local authorities. Their time could be more usefully spent than being a member of a local authority.  We must face up to the need to reform local government.  EU money now financing local authorities should be channelled to local authorities in a less controlled fashion.  They, rather than the Department of the Environment, should be given the responsibility of dealing with their affairs and deciding how to expend their finance.  The postponement of elections and tinkering with authorities' electoral areas cannot be considered real reform of local government.  I am astonished this Bill has been introduced.  I often heard that long churning makes bad butter and this Bill is an example.  The debate on local authority reform has been ongoing for the past seven to eight years and the result &mdash; this Bill &mdash; is disappointing to everybody concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this small attempt to widen the responsibilities and role of local government.  The Minister introduced three major local government Bills which will result in changes for Dublin and other areas in the administration of many aspects of local governemnt. The Minister introduced about ten Bills which affect the running of local authorities.  It is striking in this legislation that there is a reference to the 1854 Act passed approximately 50 years prior to the establishment of the present local government system.  The previous system was that of the grand jury and municipal local authority.  It is the Minister's duty to blow some of the cobwebs from that legislation to provide a more coherent system of local government.  I welcome the definition of the Minister's task.  He said his objective is the significance of local government as a worthwhile enterprise in its own right separate from central Government in political and administrative spheres which is a worthy one.  He also said that when discussing the concept of distinct membership the principle of enhancing the powers and discretion of local authorities as bodies with real <Col N="606" /> responsibility would be the cornerstone of future legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>During the past few years there have been some small steps forward.  As a member of a local authority, I welcome the removal of the <i>ultra vires</i> regulations which made it impossible for local authority members to effectively engage in commercial enterprises.  The possibilities being explored in Dublin City Council of reinvigorating the economy of that area would have been impossible without the introduction of recent legislation.  Under this Bill the powers of local authorities have been further expanded in respect of the administration of parks, local community facilities, graveyards and other aspects of local community life.  Indeed, the Minister will give local authorities considerable new powers in the area of casual trading.</P>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that local government does not need another small aggregate development but a revolutionary Bill.  During the days of English rule there was no local government, the local landlord or grandees in a town effectively laid down the law at local level.  This Bill or earlier legislation do not address the key problems of responsibility, the nexus of power in local authorities and the area of finance, to which I will refer shortly.  Until we address the area of responsibility at local level, and decide who wields the power &mdash; the local authority or some local mandarin who is effectively responding to another mandarin in the Department of the Environment &mdash; we will not have local democracy.  Before that can be achieved we must also provide a system of local financial support.  The last speaker referred to the condition of country roads.  The Dublin area has consistently received the second lowest financial allocation in respect of local government. When travelling in the North recently I was amazed at the condition of the roads. Many people in that area appear to be prosperous and perhaps a greater local input could have been made to improve the roads, particularly when large milk tankers and other heavy vehicles contributed to their bad condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> Part II of the Bill empowers the Minister to ban Ministers and Ministers of State from being a member of a local authority and covers other areas. However, most backbenchers, particularly those on the Government side, would find it a disadvantage in terms of carrying out their duties if they were barred from being a member of a local authority.  The political journalist, Denis Coughlan, sparked off a recent debate on this matter by asking what backbenchers and other Members should do to make this House more responsive and effective in respect of legislation.  The establishment of four major committees has resulted in all Members working hard and greater responsibilities being given to backbenchers.  While the current system of constituency organisation incorporating proportional representation remains it would create enormous difficulties for backbenchers, particularly those in the Government, if they were not members of local authorities. The minutiae of local events are important.  As the famous Tip O'Neill said, &ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo; and all professional politicians know that is true. Mr. Coughlan and other journalists who examined this area do not consider this the central problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the coverage the media gives to local government. Although my local authority is responsible for more than one-seventh of our population, many newspapers, like <i>The Irish Times,</i> do not send a journalist to local meetings and, therefore, much work at local level is not reported.  The central problem is that neither this Bill nor any Government, including those of which Deputy McCormack's party were a partner, have tried to grasp the nettle, which is the lack of local democracy.  This Bill deals with much of the legislation covered in the Acts governing local development, namely, Local Government (Dublin) Acts 1930 to 1933, Limerick City Management Acts, Waterford City Management Acts and Cork City Management Acts.  We are dealing with the managerial system and it is interesting <Col N="608" /> to note that the current system came from the United States in the progressive era of Thomas Woodrow Wilson.  At that time it was considered that businessmen or appointed executives, not directly elected mayors, should run local communities. That movement spread across much of America and to this country.</P>
    <P>Our local government system is often extremely undemocratic, given the massive Executive powers and the very limited powers of local authority members.  It was interesting to hear the previous speaker say that when he was mayor of Galway, as a full time politician he found the role very satisfying but one may serve in the ceremonial position of mayor for only a year and there is no effective system of political control.  As leader of the civil alliance on Dublin City Council I found it very difficult to develop a Cabinet system because the bulk of the powers are retained by the bureaucrats.  It is similar to the Minister responding to proposals by civil servants.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider introducing real local democracy.  The discussion about the dual mandate totally misses the point.  What is needed is to give much more extensive power to locally elected representatives.  I am in favour of having full time local councils who would be paid a decent salary to run the councils. Locally elected representatives would have real authority and if at the end of five years the people did not like what they had done they could be removed from office.  The introduction of the new expensive systems has had the effect, at least in the local authority of which I am a member, of capping the number of meetings held and rendering it more difficult to carry out our duties.  I am pleased the Minister will be considering this system, particularly as that which operates in larger local authorities, has an anti-democratic effect.</P>
    <P>Despite the increased powers given under this and previous legislation, some measures in recent years have removed powers from local authorities.  For example, the setting up of the National Roads Authority resulted in all primary and many secondary roads being taken <Col N="609" /> out of the control of local authorities.  In this city there is the Dublin Transportation Initiative which is run by an executive committee.  We have been trying to rebuild the centre of Dublin and by creating tax incentive zones the Government has removed from the direct administration of the city council large areas of the city.  In dealing with the issue of the dual mandate the Minister has not addressed the central problem of local government which is lack of power for directly elected local representatives. This matter and the financial weaknesess of local government should be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiatives in section 3 on the management of the alteration of boundaries, polling dates and so on.  This section also deals with the position of Cathaoirligh, Leas-Chathaoirligh, mayors and deputy mayors.  If we are to continue with the present system of local government Deputies should not be arbitrarily excluded from carrying out their key role as members of local authorities. It is incredible that some of the most experienced and gifted politicians would be excluded from their role in local authorities. It is only eight years since the Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Labour, held with great distinction the position of Lord Mayor of Dublin.  That shows that it is not impossible to hold both offices at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Minister retains great powers over local authorities' meetings and procedures. While he has extended powers to make by-laws in a wide range of areas, particularly relating to amenities and library services, he retains the absolute power to reject proposals in this regard. One of the main areas of control of local authorities in regard to amenities is the provision of parks and so on.  Dublin City Council is very proud of its parks developments.  Despite straitened financial circumstances we have developed new parks such as the Stardust Park and provided a range of amenity services. We are very proud of our library service which has given Dublin city and county a wide range of information and other services.  In many localities such as my <Col N="610" /> area of Coolock the library service is a live resource centre for the district.</P>
    <P>The financial issue is dealt with in section 8 in which the Minister restates his powers.  I hope that at the end of this year the local authority which I lead will not be in conflict with the Minister on the management of our local finances.  It is very difficult for a local authority to carry out the full range of its activities with limited resources.  In the area controlled by Dublin City Council many buildings, including this one, are owned by the Government, which does not pay one penny in rates on them.  We have a unique record among local authorities in that we raise 70 to 75 per cent of our own revenue. Yet in recent years we have been severely constrained in the services we offer because for three consecutive years there was a freeze on our rate support grant.  In 1977 when Professor Martin O'Donoghue was Minister we witnessed the unbelievable folly of the abolition of rates; and local government is still suffering the aftermath of that action. Had rates not been abolished Dublin City Council's budget of £220 million would be increased by £50 million per year.</P>
    <P>In many areas of this city people face the prospect of paying residential property tax and service charges.  This <i>ad hoc</i> build up of local taxation is extremely unfair to householders.  The Government should streamline a system of local financial support.  It is crucial that there be equality as between city and country. Dubliners should not have to pay taxes that are not imposed in other parts of the country.  The Minister should consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a tiny aggregate step forward.  We are not dealing with the key problems of local government, those of power, responsibility and finance. Section 10 deals with the setting up of the Local Government Re-organisation Commission.  Deputies who are or have been members of local authorities would agree that we do not want to take two steps forward and one step backwards on this issue; we need a revolution in local government and until that is <Col N="611" /> achieved we will not have a satisfactory system of local democracy.</P>

      <P>This morning the Minister made an acute if somewhat rueful observation during his contribution.  He stated: &ldquo;With a wide-ranging Bill of this type, it is virtually impossible to comment on all the provisions in a Second Reading speech&rdquo;. There was a time when that would not have been the case in this House.  That is the case now, however, because of the Government's boneheaded insistence on allocating time slots for Members who wish to speak on the Bill.  The Minister is allocated half an hour, regardless of the size of the Bill, and 20 minutes is allocated to other Members.  I would have liked to hear Deputy Broughan, for example, continuing his contribution and, perhaps venturing into the even more lurid and indiscreet areas of his private thoughts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have made for a far better debate in this House but with a Bill such as this, the nonsensical time limitation for Deputies on Second Stage, universally applied in the way that it is, is making a mockery of debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is wrongly titled.  Its title, the <Col N="612" /> Local Government Bill, 1994 should be, the Local Government Evasion of Responsibility Bill, 1994 because it deals with none of the issues the Minister has set out as its functions and objectives.  It will not reform local government, far from it, and the one provision which might address the question of reform kicks the whole issue off to another commission. I will return to that later.</P>
    <P>In this case the mountain has laboured mightily and brought forth a mouse because even in the limited area of reform that the Bill claims to bring about, it will not succeed.  We will have to wait even longer for that.  It ducks all of the principal issues in local government reform, some of which were identified by Deputy Broughan, who should be ashamed to be a member of a Government party that introduces such a rag Bill, flying under the false colours of reform.  This Bill does nothing of any real significance about the functions of local government at town or county level.  It ducks the issue of powers, with the exception of some fairly small and rather cosmetic changes in the powers of local authorities and, crucially, it says nothing of any consequence about the financing of local government &mdash; I will return to that later.  Deputy Broughan raised this point, although he has a biased view, and I speak as one Dubliner to another having gained a certain impartiality from living in another part of the country.  The Bill does not do anything significant about the way local authorities are financed.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious of the way the terms of reference of this reorganisation commission are written because the reference to financing in those terms of reference gives me no confidence that the Minister will be seeking or will be receptive to any real proposals about changing the way we finance local government.  No changes in the fundamental nature or structure of local authorities are proposed in this Bill nor do I expect any fundamental changes in those areas from any report emanating from the commission.  I am not criticising the people who will be appointed to this commission but the terms of reference they are being given will spancel them. <Col N="613" /> They are a little less restrictive than the terms of reference given some years ago to the Barrington Commission.  We all know that the terms of reference were so strict in that case that the report of the Barrington Commission was accompanied by a minority report which took issue with the fundamental task given to that commission.</P>
    <P>Despite all that the Minister has entertained us this morning with worthy thoughts about how matters have changed and what changes are required. He referred to the &ldquo;fundamental shift in a relatively short space of time&rdquo; in the distribution of population here.  He stated:</P>
    <P>In 1961, a clear majority of Ireland's population was rural.  Today, that sitaation has been reversed and at the 1991 census, almost 60 per cent of the population lived in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for finally discovering what the rest of us have known for quite some time.  I wonder if the Minister is happy with that shift in the population structure.  Does he think it is a good thing?  Is he of the opinion that there is nothing we need to do about it other than this tomfoolery of finagling around with the structure of towns, which will have no effect on population shifts. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that and I would gladly propose that he be allocated more than half an hour to give us them.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to tell us his view of the challenges facing us.  Ministers like to use words such as &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;; it makes them look progressive and macho. He went on to state: &ldquo;But the actual structure and framework of local government in our towns has not developed in keeping with social and demographic changes&rdquo;.  If one had a tune one could put music to that and sing it.  The Minister said he will produce a Bill to ensure that the structure and framework of local government in our towns will not develop in keeping with social and demographic changes because what we can anticipate from this commission will not make much of a difference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> The Minister referred also to the purposes of the Bill.  He stated: &ldquo;its purpose was not simply to guarantee the continued survival of town local authorities but to create a modern and effective system of town local government&rdquo;.  Then, because he is making no proposal, he went on to say: &ldquo;However by putting to rest once and for all the fundamental question as to the future sub-county structure to be adopted, a major step has been taken&rdquo;.  I would be the first to shout hosannas and allelulias if it were true but there is nothing in this Bill that resolves to me any fundamental question as to the future sub-county structure to be adopted. One would need a microscope and a great deal of tutoring to find anything in it that resolves that question.  The Minister went on to state &ldquo;Town local government is to remain and is now to be modernised&rdquo;. Where?  I see no modernisation in this Bill.  He stated further: &ldquo;The outstanding matters requiring decision have been narrowed down considerably&rdquo;.  The Minister is ducking all the main issues because he does not want to talk about financing, functions or powers and he said &ldquo;... it should now be possible to focus on these without sterile and distracting controversy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the Minister calls the controversy in the Labour and Finnna Fáil parties concerning the dual mandate.  Is that not sterile and distracting? I listened to some of the speeches by Government Deputies today and they have not been talking about financing local authorities or about local democracy.  They have been talking about this sterile and distracting controversy concerning the dual mandate and, according to the papers this morning, they have been talking about it so much that the Minister is backing down from even the small change he proposed in this Bill.  I am willing to bet at this stage that the only changes we can rely on seeing to this Bill on Committee Stage will have to do with this dual mandate arising from this sterile and distracting controversy, and indicating again the enduring proclivity of the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties in Government to look after jobs <Col N="615" /> for the boys and girls.  That is all that will come from this magnificent change in the structure of town local government.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the new commission will suffer the same fate as the Barrington Commission.  Very little of the report on local government reorganisation and reform is embodied in the Bill.  None of the fundamental questions posed in the report is answered.  I do not know what &ldquo;financing&rdquo; in the new commission's terms of reference means.  It is just one item mentioned in that subsection.  Did the Minister consider what was said about financing?</P>
    <P>In 1985 Deputy Kavanagh, then Minister for the Environment, produced a policy statement on the reform of local government in which he stated at paragraph 9.1:</P>
    <P>It is the aim that local authorities should have opportunities of raising a reasonable proportion of the resources required to meet local needs from local sources.  This is essential if they are to measure up to the role implied for them in the Government reform programme.</P>
    <P>That is what was said in 1985 but both Labour and Fine Gael set their faces firmly against the only financing proposal for local authorities made by that Government which was local charges. They promised to abolish them in the next local government election.  They have not done anything about it and are hoist with that petard since.  It would make a cat laugh to hear the Minister and members of the Government parties wriggling around on the question of local charges and baring their consciences. Deputy Stagg was one of the prime exponents of that until he got caught up in some nasty difficulties on local charges. There are no proposals about financing now.</P>
    <P>The Barrington Commission in page 38 of their report stated:</P>
    <P>We believe that it is essential that the system of financing local authorities <Col N="616" /> should conform to the following principles.</P>
    <P>1.  There must be some link between spending and raising money in order to promote responsibility and accountability; a number of the submissions we received referred to this point.  Democracy and responsibility can be looked on in this context as two sides of the one coin.</P>
    <P>2.  This implies that local authorities should raise a significant proportion of their revenue from non-central sources such as charges or local taxation.</P>
    <P>3.  Liability should be dispersed widely among the electorate and not confined to any one sector.</P>
    <P>What does the Government think about those statements and what does it intend to do about them in the context of town local government?  If the financing issue is not resolved there will be no prospect of bringing about a democratic local government system.  We know the typical profile of a local authority budget &mdash; 90 per cent of its capital expenditure is determined by the Department of the Environment.  That money goes to the local authority with a tag attached stating what kind of project it is to be spent on and what phase of what project is in question.  Some 60 per cent of current expenditure comes directly from the Department of the Environment and the balance is raised by means of rates and local charges.  They have very little real discretion in spending.  The only real area where they can make substantial changes is in relation to their current budget and expenditure on staff.  Until we resolve that problem along the lines set out by the Barrington Commission we will never put &ldquo;government&rdquo; back into local government nor will we have democratic local government.  We will continue the pretence we have had since 1977.</P>
    <P>It is fine for members of the Labour Party and some members of Fianna Fáil to talk about empowering local communities. That ensures them a favourable <Col N="617" /> mention in the newspapers and on trendy television shows but where does this movement come from?  In most cases it comes from the sense of frustration felt by people faced with a system whose only response is we do not have the funds to do what you want us to do.  They do not have the flexibility to respond to the priorities identified by people living in their area of responsibility.  No matter how much goodwill there may be, we will not be able to do anything about that until we put government back into local government and until it is in a financial position to make its own choices in favour of the people who elected the members.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the dual mandate.  It seems to be the only point Government Deputies are excited about.  Does the Minister expect us to take him seriously.  He spoke about &ldquo;the significance of local government as a worthwhile enterprise in its own right, separate from central Government in both the political and administrative spheres, as far as that can be achieved.&rdquo; When the Minister spoke about the distinct entity of local government he did so in the context of the dual mandate and not in terms of producing structures which could work for people.  Do I conclude that the Minister sees the issue of local democracy only in terms of whether Deputies should be members of local authorities or chair them?  If that is the case, it is a sad reflection on the Government's understanding of the role of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The commission has been given a deadline of 12 months but this can be extended by the Minister.  If he is serious, why should he tell the commission it can have more time to make a recommendation if it has a difficulty? Section 21 states that local elections are to be held every fifth year.  It is nonsensical to extend the lives of local authorities for years.  Section 25 proposes that the life of local authorities can, by order, be extended.  Is the Government trying to fool us?  It is saying that there is no reason to change the present law, yet includes these provisions in the Bill to try to get some credit for reforming local <Col N="618" /> government, even though it does not even have the spine to try the slightest reform.  That extension provision should be done away with in so far as the local elections and the reporting limit of the commission are concerned.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be given extended powers to make by-laws in a number of areas.  I am delighted that this provision has been included in the Bill; I supported a similar provision in the Casual Trading Bill.  However, again the nobble and the spancel are provided for. The Minister said that in certain circumstances he may decide that the local authority may not make by-laws for some areas or may do so only with his consent. I take it the Government has no political, emotional, intellectual or conceptual attachment to any idea of local democracy. Every time one looks at a provision in the Bill which is halfway democratic one has only to look at a later section to see that the nobble has been put on and local authorities will still be subjected to the whims and directions of the Minister who sits in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a series of boundary extensions.  Why has Newbridge not been included in that list?  It had been expected for some time that Newbridge, or Droichead Nua, would be one of the towns whose boundaries would be extended.  All the reasons given by the Minister for extending the boundaries of towns apply with particular force to Newbridge, approximately half of the population of which is within the electoral boundary.  Why are these boundaries being extended, to use the Minister's phrase, &ldquo;for the purposes of the elections&rdquo;? In the case of the 50 or so towns which will have their boundaries extended, whether they have urban councils or town commissions, it seems the extension is being made only to increase the number of people who will be entitled to vote in the elections.  They are not being extended to give those town authorities any powers over the new areas which will be included for the purposes of these elections.</P>
    <P>That is a very cynical manoeuvre.  If we are to extend the area in which people <Col N="619" /> can vote for a town authority, then we should also extend by the same amount the area in which that town authority can make decisions within its sphere of competence, limited though that is in the case of urban councils and almost nonexistent as it is in the case of town commissions. This is the worst example of a cosmetic change being made for purely superficial political reasons; it is another straw in the wind which shows that the Government has no commitment whatsoever to any real reform of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the boundary extensions, which will be a source of annoyance to some people as areas they would like to see included will not be included while other areas may be.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to look at the overall local government system.  When one looks at the progress made in the area of local government one must wonder if the system is becoming more bureaucratic every day.  The difference between the number of people involved in administration and those engaged in physical work is alarming.  We are all aware from our constituencies that the number of local authority outdoor workers has decreased substantially; in many cases these workers are a dying breed.  As a result the level of maintenance on roads, housing and sewerage schemes is not of a quality expected in a modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past six months many roads have fallen to pieces, so to speak.  While this has been caused to some extent by inclement weather it is also partly due to a lack of maintenance by local authorities which do not have adequate maintenance staff.  The reason local authorities do not have adequate staff to carry out maintenance is that many of these workers availed of voluntary redundancy schemes.  County managers saw these schemes as a way of reducing their overheads and paying bills but forgot that they would also lead to a loss of essential manpower.  At the same time the number of engineers employed by local authorities <Col N="620" /> has increased considerably.  Have we gone overboard in terms of local government administration?  Despite the improvements in back up facilities, computerisation and other office aids, it now takes five or six people in administration to do the job done by two or three people when I became a member of a local authority 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased dependency by local authorities on the central Exchequer for funding, many local authority members are not prepared to implement some of the cruel decisions which are necessary for the long term benefit of the people they represent.  We have seen examples of this in Dublin city where the members of Dublin Corporation avoided imposing charges for many years.  It was easy for them to make up any shortfall in revenue through the high rate base on commercial property.  I want to compare this with the position of Leitrim County Council which has approximately 700 ratepayers.  One can see how the discrepancy has arisen between the provision of services in smaller rural counties and the provision of services in large cities.  Local authorities in rural areas are expected to provide the same services as those provided in Dublin, yet when we seek to impose charges we are told that no charges were introduced in Dublin city until this year. This begs the question: how much extra revenue could have been raised by Dublin Corporation and did it get a much larger share of funding from central Government than it was entitled to?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it got a much larger share of funding than it was entitled to for the very simple reason that it made its case and got away with it under successive Ministers.  As a result it was able to avoid introducing charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the county road system which has been hammered by the weather in recent months.  If one were to ask local authorities specifically how much of the capital allocation they <Col N="621" /> receive for roads is positively spent on the roads system in any county, one would be shocked to discover that the adminisation costs are much greater than would be normally acceptable if the same work were undertaken by way of public contract.  I hope the additional moneys allocated by the Minister's Department for county roads will yield a better return. If we want people to remain in rural areas we will have to provide them with the same basic facilities as are provided for their counterparts in urban areas.  They will have to be provided with reasonable roads on which to travel to and from their places of work and their local town.  Many such roads have been repaired but, because of negligence on the part of their users, have deteriorated within a very short period.  That is sad but nonetheless true.  Yet it is those same people who will hold public meetings and criticise public representatives of all political persuasion because their local roads are not in the condition they would wish.  In many cases surface water, mud and the like will be allowed remain on them, thus damaging their surface.</P>
    <P>I am sure the question of the dual mandate has arisen already.  Anybody elected to a local authority should have the right to hold any office available to them through such membership.  I do not want to sound anti the proposals contained in this Bill but it is only fair that those who face the democratic process should have equal rights once an election is over.  While it might seem cruel to some Members in this House, the hard fact is that whenever a member of any party is elected, they are entitled to hold any office available to them.  Often their colleagues decide who should hold such offices.  I suppose I could attribute that to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the position there is different and I will not comment.  As Chairman of an Oireachtas Committee, the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, if the provisions of this Bill are enacted, I could no longer be a member of a local authority but I believe people should be given the option of choosing.  On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will reconsider <Col N="622" /> the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the holding of such offices by Members of the Oireachtas. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would feel similarly that as a member of a local authority he can often avail of that forum to express his views on local problems.</P>
    <P>We must look at local government from a number of perspectives.  It is proposed in this Bill to postpone local elections to 1998.  Perhaps it is a pity there is not a fixed term of office with regard to Dáil elections so that Members elected to this House would have before them a guaranteed term and not always have to look over their shoulders.  It might well lead to better government and representation for the electorate generally.</P>
    <P>The provisions with regard to the making of by-laws will afford members of local authorities an opportunity of taking decisions it would have been their wish to take over many years, although some probably would prefer that such power was not handed back to them.  Members of local authorities will have to stand up and be counted when it comes to taking decisions affecting their local communities. Over many years the drawing up of by-laws has been important to local authorities but the consultative process was too long-winded.  I hope this Bill will help to short circuit that process.</P>
    <P>While not dealt with in this Bill, the designation of certain areas and the preparation of county development plans should be examined.  The right of local authorities to designate areas as being unsuitable for certain purposes has not been fully exploited to date.  There is need for local authorities to have wider discretion.  Planning with regard to, say, afforestation and other projects should fall within their remit.  The reason is very simple.  No doubt Deputy Enda Kenny will understand what I say in this respect.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are powerless to control or prohibit much development that takes place within their administrative areas.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced recently that something will be done to control development which can affect our environment and which can have a devastating effect in certain parts of the west and elsewhere.  Last week we saw the same problem arise in County Meath when a non-national bought up 700 acres of prime land and planted hardwood trees, thus taking it out of production for the next 100 years.  It was not subject to planning permission.  The laws obtaining with regard to afforestation can be easily circumvented by anybody wishing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, should be devising a proper overall development programme.  There must be joint involvement of those most aware of local conditions, those who live in an area and their elected representatives who are answerable to the public.  The public will always remember the misdeeds of members of local authorities, those who are perceived as having failed to fulfil their role.  Generally such people do not hold membership of local authorities for very long.  We will all have observed that phenomenon, whether in Dublin, Cork, Leitrim, Mayo or wherever.  Nonetheless such members of local authorities are often blamed for things which occur within an area which may be totally beyond their remit or the limits of their capabilities as members of local authorities. The future development of our country should be in harmony with the wishes of local people.  It is unfair that foreigners should have the right to force local people to accept developments not to their liking.  Many disputes have arisen <Col N="624" /> regarding developments forced on people in various areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 6, 12, 14, 30, 61, 69, 73, 78, 81, 95, 99, 100, 102, 110, 113, 114 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C virus was first described in 1989.  As I have indicated to the House, the question of introducing a screening test for hepatitis C for donations nationally had been considered in 1989 and 1990.  During this period, the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health examined the possibility of introducing such a test.  However, a review of international practices and discussions with medical experts in other countries revealed that there was insufficient scientific information about the test to approve its routine introduction.  The position was carefully monitored and, when the test was considered sufficiently reliable for the purposes of screening donations, it was introduced in Ireland.  This occurred in 1991 at the same time as the screening was introduced in the UK.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board advised me on 17 February 1994, of a problem with the Anti D product and I immediately authorised the national blood screening programme.  I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the number who have been screened for hepatitis C antibodies under their hepatitis C/Anti D Screening programme is 46,269 and that the number who have tested positive is 883 up to and including 12 April 1994.  A further confirmatory test is being carried out on the blood samples given by these women and some may yet prove to be negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recipients of Anti-D may have received the product in more than one year.  The board has informed me that the recipients testing positive have an average of 3.3 exposures to the product. Because of this it is not possible to say which year they were infected with hepatitis C.  I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that 587 received Anti D in 1977.  Six per cent of those presenting for testing with 1977 exposures are testing positive.  However, this does not necessarily mean that these <Col N="629" /> women were infected with hepatitis C in 1977.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has been investigating the probable year of infection and has informed me that it is clear that while there is a level of infectivity in other years it is much lower than in 1977 and that we cannot be certain at this stage that it has been caused by Anti D and this is being investigated.</P>
    <P>In the five year period 1975-79, 90 per cent of those who received Anti D have presented for testing.  In the five year periods 1970-74 and 1985-89 75 per cent of those who have received Anti D have presented for testing.  In the five year period 1980-84 70 per cent have presented.  However, in the four year period 1990-93 only 50 per cent of those who received Anti D have presented for testing.  I am concerned with the relatively low uptake of the women who received Anti D during this period and I would urge these people to come forward for testing so that we can get a full picture of the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board cannot at this stage indicate when the screening programme will be complete. The board estimate that 60,000 women received the Anti D product in the relevant period.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board and general practitioners are providing a counselling service to women who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.</P>
    <P>Screening of children and/or partners of women who test positive for hepatitis C has commenced.  This is being carried out in consultation with the three children's hospitals in Dublin and in paediatric units at Cork and Galway. Women who test positive for hepatitis C and who wish to have their children tested should contact their general practitioners or the Blood Transfusion Service Board and arrangements will be made to have the test carried out free of charge.</P>
    <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C antibodies is being provided at the following hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, <Col N="630" /> Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.  Special consultant staffed clinics have been set up in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>The treatment initially involves an outpatient visit which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required.  The treatment, including the provision of Interferon, if prescribed by clinicians, will be provided by the public hospital service free of charge.  The costs incurred in the screening and treatment programme will be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that there are risks, however remote, of contracting a transmissible disease through transfusion. However, the benefit of blood transfusion must always be weighed against the risk factors involved.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has informed me that the highest possible standards are complied with to ensure that such risks are minimised.  The board has informed me that it is not possible to guarantee absolute safety in blood and blood products, but that the standards in place are constantly reviewed, monitored and updated.</P>
    <P>All donors are screened and the system of screening used is in accordance with the highest standards in well-developed countries, and take account of guidelines issued by such bodies as the Council of Europe.  These standards are also, of course, complied with for blood products provided for haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that public confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board remains high.  Since its foundation the board has provided an essential service to thousands of Irish people. Because of the crucial importance of maintaining the highest possible standards for blood and blood products I am determined to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the application of the highest possible safety standards.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I announced on 4 March 1994, the establishment of an expert group to examine and report to me on: all the circumstances surrounding <Col N="631" /> the infection of the Anti D Immunoglobulin product manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board; the system and standards in place for donor selection, the manufacturing process and use of the Anti-D Immunoglobulin produced by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and to make recommendations to me on the above matters and any other matters relating to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which the group consider necessary.</P>
    <P>If the expert group find any cause for concern in respect of any other aspect of the systems and standards in place in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the expert group are being asked to examine these matters and report to me.</P>
    <P>No consideration has been given at this stage to the question of compensation. As I have already indicated I am awaiting the report of the expert group.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention to extend the national blood testing programme to all persons who received blood transfusions in the past because the risk of infection is very low.  It is known that Irish blood donors have a low incidence of hepatitis C by comparison with other European countries.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that it is at present considering the necessity of implementing a policy of targeted look back of recipients of previous donations from donors now found antibody positive to hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>In general, a person who already has liver disease and develops hepatitis C is more likely to have an accelerated progression of hepatitis C.  The problem identified with the Anti D product related to hepatitis C and the present programme was confined therefore to hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>With regard to life assurance, I am unable to comment on this issue as it is a matter between the person and the assurance companies involved.</P>
    <P>I would once again like to stress the importance of all women who received Anti D at any time between 1970 and 1994 of coming forward for testing.  While the programme to date has been very <Col N="632" /> successful, I am, however, concerned that only 50 per cent of the women who got Anti D between 1990 and February 1994 have come forward.  I would urge these people to come forward for testing.</P>
    <P>The Government and I are determined in so far as is practicable to identify any person who has been put at risk by virtue of exposure to the Anti D product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  He realises the serious nature of the problem from the point of view of women's health.

      <P>I have given the House the number of positive second test results which is 883.  There are three levels of testing.  People who prove positive to the first general screening test are tested in the viral reference laboratory here and for absolute confirmation positive tests are then sent to the United Kingdom for final testing.  Eight hundred and eighty three cases have been confirmed by the viral reference laboratory and to date all the positive tests submitted by the viral reference laboratory have been confirmed in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I realise that standards of blood products are now very high but does the Minister recognise that this problem arose because women followed an approved and recommended procedure and have contracted Hepatitis C through no fault of their own?  Will he confirm that all treatments arising from testing positive will be free of charge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am determined to indentify as far as possible every woman, who has been contaminated by the Anti D product and has contracted Hepatitis C.  The Deputy will be aware that there was not a reliable test for Hepatitis C before 1991, so it would not have been possible to have alerted women to it before that time.  There is always some risk.  The figures we have relate largely to 1977, the most vulnerable year and we believe that the great bulk of people who may have possibly contracted Hepatitis C have been identified.</P>
      <P>I wish to ensure that every woman who has received Anti D since it was introduced in 1970 will be tested so that we can identify them and provide comprehensive treatment, as necessary, free of charge.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient beds to meet the acute hospital needs of the population and the hospital facilities generally are sufficient to maintain the high level of throughput at present achieved within our hospital service. Access to surgery is based on clinical need and urgent cases are always given priority.</P>
      <P>All persons are entitled to opt for public hospital treatment as a public or as a private patient.  The objective of Government policy is to ensure equitable access to necessary care.  This objective is being pursued through the operation of appropriate admission arrangements at hospital level and through the waiting list initiative which was an important feature of the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are of concern in the context of equity and access to care.  The principle of equitable access to hospital care led to the agreement, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that specific beds should be designated for public and private patients so as to achieve total transparency.  This system has now been put in place and, while not restricting admission of patients needing emergency treatment, it ensures that private patients requiring private elective procedures are only admitted to private beds.  The operation of this system will continue to be closely monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a direct result of the Government's waiting list initiative last year the numbers waiting in the acute public hospital sector at June 1993 were reduced from 40,130 to 25,373 at December 1993, a <Col N="635" /> reduction of 37 per cent.  Furthermore, there was particular success in reducing the numbers of adults and children waiting for periods in excess of 12 months and six months in the problem specialties. These numbers were reduced from 14,624 at the launch of the initiative to 6,240 by December 1993, an overall reduction of 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>Among the specialty areas covered by the initiative were those which include cardiac procedures, hip replacements and cataract procedures.  The target of 17,254 additional procedures announced at the launch of the initiative was exceeded and the overall number of additional procedures performed in 1993 was 18,768.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £20 million last year enabled agencies throughout the country to invest in the facilities, equipment and/or personnel required to help them to reduce waiting list numbers in the most cost effective manner.  The funds for the waiting list initiative in 1993 were in addition to the extra resources allocated in 1993 for a range of other service developments throughout the hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the 1993 initiative and a further £10 million has been provided this year.</P>
    <P>The principal objective will continue to be the elimination of waiting times in excess of 12 months for adults in the problem specialties.  A detailed review on the experiences gained during 1993 has been undertaken and my Department is discussing with the health agencies the arrangements to be put in place during 1994 to further reduce waiting times.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister identified the main problems which impede ready access to surgery in the areas I mentioned?  To what extent have problems in these areas been tackled in the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>From the outset we identified the areas which had long waiting times as distinct from large numbers on <Col N="636" /> the waiting list.  The key issue is the length of time one is waiting rather than the number of people waiting.  We identified the geographical areas with long waiting lists and provided resources on a contract basis hospital by hospital to deal with them in the areas of orthopaedics, hip replacements, ophthalmology, cataracts, ear nose and throat, and cardiac, vascular and plastic surgery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>What facilities were lacking to cause the problem and to what extent has the problem been resolved?  I note that extra facilities were provided and also the exodus of patients from Cork in one specialty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a specific question tabled about Cork and I will certainly be very happy to discuss the matter when we reach that question.  The Southern Health Board took a very good initiative to solve the problem it had.  My objective in the Department of Health and the objective of each health board is to provide a service to the patients who need it as expeditiously and as cost effectively as possible, and whatever mechanisms are employed to achieve that will be in the patients' interests.  Obviously there will be long term positive results from the waiting list initiative in terms of the capital investments that were part of that initiative which will continue to have an effect into the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent published report of the inspector of mental hospitals is the report for the year 1990.  This report was published in 1993.  The report in respect of 1991 is currently being printed and will be published shortly.  The report for the year 1992 will be sent to the printers in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the report of inspector of mental hospitals will be published in the year following the year to which it refers.  I hope to achieve that position before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the alleged commitment of this Government to openness and transparency does the Minister agree that it is anomalous that reports for the past three years of the inspector of mental hospitals have not been made available? Does he agree that this suggests that he is being secretive about the contents of the report?  Given that the 1990 report, published in 1993 contained evidence of bad management and bad practices in our psychiatric hospitals which created a public outcry, will he agree that patients in psychiatric hospitals and their relatives deserve an objective report on the care being provided?  Will the Minister try to defend the long delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  It is my intention to ensure that information will be available. The Mental Treatment Act, 1945 requires the publication of reports.  When I was appointed Minister 14 months ago the last report published was for the year 1989.  I intend to publish by the end of this year the reports for 1990, 1991, 1992 and, I hope, 1993.  It is my intention to ensure that from this year onwards reports of the inspector of mental hospitals will be published in the year following inspections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector is well respected and diligent and his reports are <Col N="638" /> up to date.  Will the Minister confirm that the reports have been compiled but have not yet been published?  If so, is it not ridiculous to pay two people a salary to do this work, given that the information contained in these reports is not readily available to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Few reports remain on my desk for long.  I tend to be brisk in transacting business.  I have been informed that it takes about six months to complete the process of inspection, issue a draft report, consider health board amendments and finalise the report.  As I was not happy with the position I was determined to do something about it.  From this year onwards reports will be published in the year following inspection.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that there are only three public beds for people with eating disorders in this country; his views on whether anorexia and bulemia are serious problems; and the plans, if any, he has to help people with these disorders.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Eating disorders, including anorexia and bulemia, can be extremely serious for those affected and their families.  Although these conditions are not specific to either gender, they particularly affect women.  The symptoms of the disorders may range from mild to severe.  Persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated in their own health board area.  Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided on the basis of clinical need in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition, a tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park and St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin.  The allocation of beds within these hospitals is a matter for hospital management in the context of patient need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> There is therefore no pre-determined allocation of beds for eating disorders in the country, beds being made available on the basis of patient need at any particular time.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that adequate facilities exist for the treatment of these disorders.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to prevent these conditions arising.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is actively involved with the Department of Education in the promotion of healthy nutrition in schools and in programmes which foster self-esteem and positive body-awareness, particularly among young girls.  The unit is also developing an information leaflet on the subject of eating disorders.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome the Minister's statement that a programme is being promoted in schools. This is most important.  He mentioned that beds are available on demand.  The excellent article by Victoria White in <i>The Irish Times</i> highlighted the fact that there are only three public beds and that people with eating disorders have to avail of VHI cover.  Will the Minister seriously consider providing beds for people with these disorders and provide support for the clinics which treat them?  Does he accept the figures quoted in the article, that 20 per cent of female students in the United States and 1 per cent in England suffer from this disease?  As there are no figures available in this country, will the Minister consider establishing a national bureau to compile statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no beds designated for patients with eating disorders. The decision on whether a patient should be admitted rests with the hospital authorities. Treatment is provided in a local acute psychiatric unit and, if necessary, a tertiary referral service is available in the hospitals I mentioned.  I share the Deputy's view that there is a need for education to prevent these distressing disorders arising.  This matter is given priority by the Health Promotion Unit <Col N="640" /> of my Department.  On the question of statistics, I am anxious to receive information on the health status of women.  I have been informed that approximately 1 per cent of all adolescent females suffer from anorexia nervosa while a slightly larger percentage of females suffer from bulemia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 5, 15, 62, 86, 93 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy in the area of drug misuse is based on the national strategy to prevent drug misuse.  This strategy, which has been accepted by the Government, is based on the recommendations of the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse which included representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies involved in the drug prevention and treatment fields.  The strategy recognises the validity of a multi-faceted approach to drug treatment and prevention including drug-free harm reduction, maintenance and rehabilitation programmes.  The strategy, while recognising the multiplicity of treatment and prevention programmes, advocated a drug-free lifestyle as the ideal.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged however that a drug-free lifestyle is not an option for many drug abusers, at least in the initial stages of treatment.  Consequently, my Department has sponsored the introduction of methadone maintenance programmes as a means of stabilising the behaviour of drug abusers and a means of preventing the spread of the HIV virus through contaminated needles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, intravenous <Col N="642" /> drug misuse is the principal mode of transmission of the HIV virus in this country.  At present 57 per cent of all HIV positive cases are drug-use related. Accordingly, the strategies for dealing with drug abuse and HIV-AIDS are closely interlinked.  Since 1992 substantial funding has been allocated to these areas, particularly in the greater Dublin area where the majority of drug abusers reside.  This funding has allowed for the development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which, together with the drug treatment centre and voluntary organisations, provides a comprehensive treatment network for drug abusers.  It is intended to further develop these services during 1994 and the Minister has allocated specific funding for this purposes.</P>
    <P>The national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse, which is chaired by me meets on a regular basis to review developments in this area.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's strategies on HIV-AIDS and drug abuse, methadone maintenance, i.e. an artificial drug provided as a heroin substitute, is made available by the Eastern Health Board and also by the Drug Treatment Centre.  The rationale is that by availing themselves of this free &ldquo;safe&rdquo; drug, addicts are less likely to indulge in high risk needle-sharing and other anti-social behaviour.  This helps prevent the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases as well as bringing addicts into contact with the range of services, treatment and otherwise, available for them.  It is important to point out that once the addict's behaviour is stabilised a range of treatment options is offered including assistance towards a drug-free lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Approximately 600 persons are now availing of methadone programmes in the Dublin area and there is also a substantial waiting list in the region of 400 persons: because of the particular circumstances of this group, however, it is very difficult to be definitive about this figure.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Gregory's question about the City Clinic, Amiens Street there is currently a waiting list of 200 <Col N="643" /> persons who reside in the catchment area of the clinic.</P>
    <P>Further measures are planned by the Eastern Health Board to involve more persons in the treatment services and thus reduce the waiting list at the existing clinics.  Towards this end funding has been made available this year to allow the board to open two additional satellite clinics as well as establishing another community drug team to identify and liaise with drug abusers in particular areas.</P>
    <P>In this regard, another development currently under active discussion is an increase in the numbers of persons on methadone maintenance programmes by the involvement of general practitioners in the community.  The report of the expert group on the Protocol for the prescribing of methadone will form the basis for the involvement of these general practitioners. It is intended to circulate the report to general practitioners shortly with other relevant information about support services available in satellite clinics.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive framework of prevention and treatment services for drug abusers.  I will continue to work to ensure that these services are expanded and developed as necessary and in line with our requirements in relation to the prevention of drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is not acceptable to have 204 drug users on a waiting list in one city clinic, all from the local areas of the north inner city?  There are twice the number of addicts on the waiting list for that clinic as those receiving treatment.  The crisis is worsening every week with new addicts calling to the clinic and being turned away.  Left to the mercy of drug dealers, many turn to violent crime and others end up in prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the people on the waiting list end up in prison?  We saw the tragic consequences yesterday, a fatal overdose by a prisoner in Mountjoy who, perhaps, was on the waiting list.  Does the Minister agree that if an adequate service was provided, which should be available by right, the drug dealers would be all but out of business and violent crime dramatically reduced in this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for bringing me up-to-date with the latest figures.  I agree it is not acceptable to have a waiting list.  It is unfortunate that, because of the way the satellite clinics are structured, half of those waiting are people who are receiving treatment in one satellite clinic.</P>
      <P>As to the effect of this programme, Deputy Gregory will be aware that the number of people on treatment in the methadone maintenance programme has expanded dramatically in recent years and we are making further strides in this regard.  To alleviate this situation we are in the process of establishing two new satellite clinics.  I do not want to tell the House precisely where those clinics will be located because the matter is still under discussion but they will be established very soon.  With their establishment there will be a substantial reduction and, it is hoped, a total elimination of the waiting list in the clinic to which Deputy Gregory refers.  A further initiative is the methadone maintenance Protocol which will involve general practitioners in prescribing methadone treatment in a controlled way and the establishment of a new drugs team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are conscious of the situation and have been spending more money in tackling it.  The amount has gone up in 1992, 1993 and 1994 &mdash; I can give the Deputy the figures if he wishes.  It is hoped that by the summer we will have established the two new satellite clinics and have the methadone maintenance Protocol involving general practitioners in operation <Col N="645" /> which will help to reduce waiting lists, as some of the people will go to their GP instead of to the satellite clinics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that a satellite clinic is one which serves the local community and that all the people on the waiting list in the city clinic are from the local community?  It, therefore, follows that setting up satellite clinics in other areas of the city will have no impact on the waiting list of the city clinic which serves the north inner city of Dublin.  Is the Minister not attempting to mislead me and the House by making irrelevant statements about other clinics that he hopes to establish?  Does the Minister not agree that to provide treatment on demand to the people looking for it at that clinic would require twice the staff the clinic currently has and twice the budget allocated to it?  Will the Minister answer that question rather than attempting to mislead me by his erroneous statements?</P>

He made a point about the location of the clinic serving the local community.  I did not say where the new clinics were to be located, but the Deputy can draw an inference from my answer. When deciding on their location we had the Amiens Street waiting list to the forefront of our considerations.  I confidently predict that with the establishment of the two new clinics the waiting list in Amiens Street will be substantially reduced.  The <Col N="646" /> other initiative, involving general practitioners in the prescribing of methadone, would further reduce the waiting list throughout the city.</P>

This is what the Government strategy committee and the National AIDS Strategy Committee concluded.  It is also reflected in a number of other facts which I do not wish to go into today.  We are taking the best approach which is in line with that in every other country trying to combat this problem.  Some people have the view that there is one rigid treatment programme to which addicts must adapt themselves.  I take the opposite view, that we cannot expect drug addicts to adapt themselves to a particular uniform treatment programme which somebody lays down.  A treatment programme must be flexibile.  The treatment programme and the treatment providers must adapt themselves to the addicts rather than the other way around.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referred to improvements in the overall conditions of employment of nurses.  The position in relation to claims for improvements in the conditions of employment of all grades of health staff, including nurses, is that such claims must be processed through the industrial relations procedure. These procedures provide an equal opportunity for management and staff to discuss the relevant issues in detail and to reach agreement in due course.</P>
      <P>Under the recently agreed <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, nurses and other health service grades will have two possible avenues for negotiating special claims for improvements in conditions of employment.  Claims may be pursued through the grade restructuring approach or via the traditional conciliation and arbitration/Labour Court procedures. Under either option, it is likely that negotiations will take place in relation to the implementation of any award made.  These will be concerned particularly with changes in working practice or other issues which management will be pursuing in return for any concessions made.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not simply talking about monetary rewards for nurses, although they are part of the equation. Will the Minister agree that nurses are the most professional and competent people in the health services, but also one of the most under-valued in terms of pay and working conditions?  When people leave hospital they invariably praise the nursing staff.  They are the first line of defence in casualty, very often they must bring the bad news of a death to relatives and they are the buffer between the highly paid consultant and patients and their families.  In fact, they are the human face of hospitals.  Is it not the case that 18 months ago an independent survey showed that the stress level of Irish nurses was the highest in the professions here and one of the highest in the world?  What action has the Minister taken in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly share the view of the Deputy in regard to the professionalism of nurses here.  We are extremely fortunate to have a profession of such a high standard in an integral part of the health service.  Our nurses are recruited across the world and held in high regard.  I disagree with the Deputy that they are under-valued.  Any person who interacts with the health services places great value on the quality, standard and work of our nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined the necessary procedures for improvements in respect of pay and conditions. Similar procedures apply to everybody working in the health services. Almost one-half of those working in acute hospitals in the health service are nurses.  They are a large and effective group.  The issue of stress in that profession was discussed here previously.  A report commissioned by nursing organisations highlighted the concern about stress levels in the profession.  Most <Col N="650" /> people in the health services, particularly nurses, work under stress, and those working in accident and emergency are subject to even greater stress.  I have had discussions with SIPTU, the Irish Nurses' Organisation, the psychiatric nurses' division of SIPTU and the PNA and I am aware of the concerns.  I am working with the unions and nurses' representatives in an effort to reduce stress levels in the profession and improve working conditions for a most valuable cohort of our health service staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the low pay and status of nurses might have more to do with the fact that the work is predominantly carried out by women?  The status of women workers in general needs to be examined.  Will the Minister comment on the need to change the law in relation to psychiatric nurses who are not entitled to compensation if attacked by psychiatric patients?  They must prove negligence against the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputies first point.  I am not sure whether it is a sociological fact that because nurses were traditionally women this was reflected in their pay structure. Our nurses are reasonably paid by international standards and mechanisms are in place to do comparative evaluations necessary to improve pay levels.  I would be anxious to improve conditions for any segment of the workforce involved in delivering quality health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to compensation for assault, psychiatric nurses work under similar conditions to other nurses.  For example, a nurse in a casualty department may be faced by a drunk or disorderly person or a nurse working with the mentally handicapped may be faced with a disturbed person.  All nurses are covered under the normal insurance policies of their employer, the health board or the agency that employs them.  The only categories of public servant to which specific compensation procedures apply are the Garda and prison officers.  It would be extremely costly to introduce a similar <Col N="651" /> mechanism for all grades in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the distinction between the Garda and prison officers and nurses.  Why is it not worth the candle to give such protection to our nurses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of being worth the candle.  For example, should ambulance drivers or hospital porters be included?  Where would we draw the line?  There are special arrangements including a compensation tribunal for gardaí and prison officers who literally put their lives on the line when facing armed criminals.  Regarding other grades of people who may suffer assault I would be anxious to see what mechanisms need to be put in place.  I have given specific instructions that nobody involved in an assault case which occurred in recent months should be at the loss of wages, including premium pay by virtue, of an assault and medical expenses are to be covered by their employer and the health board.  I want to create the most generous environment possible for health care workers and I have had detailed discussions with representative authorities and bodies to ensure necessary measures are taken.</P>

      <P>There is merit in examining this area.  In my clinics I receive many representations from young people who wish to pursue a nursing career.  A considerable number of young men wish to follow that career.  Many young people take private courses to prepare for formal nurse training.

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it takes a nurse 40 years to receive her full pension entitlements, that this is not a career span but a life sentence, that many nurses who trained and worked in England get no recognition for their work and that this area must be addressed? Will he also accept that often nurses must do menial, domestic duties and that to deploy highly trained medical staff, in whom much money has been invested to achieve such competence, to do such work is wasteful and there should be a policy of employing more domestic staff and deploying the nursing staff in the medical area for which they are qualified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's final point first.  I agree nurses are highly trained professionals and they should not be assigned work more appropriate to domestic staff.  Most hospital managers are most anxious to employ domestic staff, where possible, to alleviate the burden on nursing staff.  This is more cost effective as domestic staff are paid less.  That principle is applied on the ground.  The career structure of nursing is not unlike that of the teaching profession and the timespan for full pension entitlement is somewhat similar.  I am anxious to improve that position and negotiations are underway with professional organisations in that regard.  I have received many representations from nursing organisations in respect of career breaks and job-sharing and those matters have been actively pursued during the past 12 months.</P>

As the House is aware, primary responsibility for income maintenance rests with my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and the Deputy may wish to pursue this matter in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that this question was transferred from the Minister for Social Welfare to the Minister for Health, which indicates the point of the question.  Nobody seems to take responsibility for young people between 16 and 18 years.  Traditionally health boards have been responsible for them in that they allocate money for B &amp; B for homeless people.  Would the Minister agree that, given the increasing incidence of homelessness, particularly in Dublin &mdash; in the first half of last year 280 children were reported by the Eastern Health Board to be homeless &mdash; this erratic system is not suitable and does not meet the need of these young children who have no income as they are not entitled to the dole?  Many of these people are wandering around the streets, some of them engaged in prostitution.  This is a serious social matter for which some Minister must take responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware this question was transferred from the Minister for Social Welfare.  I suspect the reason is that the Deputy did not ask it in the right way.  It refers to the Child Care Act, 1991, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that the system of providing B &amp; B is erratic.  If power was given under the Child Care Act to provide maintenance for these unfortunate people the system would be even more erratic and unco-ordinated.  I do not wish to get into the area of social welfare but Deputy O'Donnell will be aware that an orphan's allowance scheme is available from the Department of Social Welfare in cases where one parent is dead and the other has abandoned the child &mdash; it may be contributory or non-contributory. Unfortunately, this allowance has to be applied for by the Garda, which might not always be suitable in these cases.  This <Col N="657" /> is a matter for the Government in the context of discussion of the Estimates, but if a decision is made on the matter the most logical thing to do would be to pay the allowance through the Department of Social Welfare as an extension of the orphan's allowance scheme &mdash; that is simply a personal view.</P>
    <P>On the B &amp; B system, there is a responsibility on health boards, which are funded by the Department of Health, to provide accommodation, not income.  In recent years the number of emergency accommodation places for homeless children, particularly in Dublin where the problem largely arises, has been substantially increased.  Health boards and relevant agencies must have recourse to the B &amp; B option when young people are unwilling to go into a hostel.  The choice is simple; either insist on these people going into a hostel for the night, knowing that they will not do so, or leave them on the streets. We have informed the health boards that we want to reduce the incidence of young people availing of the B &amp; B option and we are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>Funding for homeless people has been substantially increased and there are 100 places as compared to fewer than 20 a couple of years ago.  The Minister received £15 million this year from the Government towards the implementation of the Child Care Act, £5 million of which relates to initiatives taken in 1993.  I anticipate that a substantial increase will be made in the number of emergency accommodation places in 1994.  The provision of places is a matter for the Eastern Health Board and they will be funded by the Department of Health.  Discussions are taking place as to the improvement to be made in 1994 to build on the substantial advances of recent years.</P>

      <P>The Minister has fought a great battle at Cabinet for funding and the Child Care Act will be implemented in full within a shorter space of time than I thought was possible.  Section 5 of that Act states that the provision of accommodation is primarily the responsibility of the health boards.  The more funding we get from Government, the better will be the system of emergency accommodation and care &mdash; the Child Care Act is about much more than accommodation &mdash; and the quicker we will implement the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figures given by the Minister for Health of new bed places for young homeless people were challenged by organisations working with homeless people?  They maintain that rather than 30 new beds being provided, only 14 were provided, seven fewer than the number available two years ago.  Will the Minister comment on that matter?  Will he also comment on the out-of-hours service for homeless young people?  I had cause to use this service on Good Friday.  In mid-afternoon on that day when I telephoned the emergency number I was told by way of answering machine to telephone another number to which I got no reply.  I had to send a young man with very small children to the Garda station &mdash; I am sure it is of interest to the Minister for Justice that the problem is being transferred to the Garda when all else fails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area where there are homeless young people, <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements are made by ordinary people who, out of concern and kindness, take these young people into their homes.  When people go <Col N="659" /> to the health board for assistance towards keeping young adolescents in their homes they are told there is no structured arrangement whereby the health board can support <i>ad hoc</i> fostering of the older adolescent.  That is a very easy and low cost way of keeping these children out of trouble and prostitution.  Why is the health board not capable of providing such support?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the challenge to the figures given by the Minister for Health, those figures are correct.  On the out-of-hours service, I agree with Deputy McManus that the service is not perfect but it is being improved as quickly as resources allow &mdash; a couple of years ago there was no such service.  On the funding of health boards for fostering children, that is a good idea, but I could come up with a million ideas on which money could be spent.  The money available is spent in the most equitable and efficient manner and there is no provision for fostering these children at present. However, the suggestion will be put to the Minister for Finance when discussing next year's Estimates.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the practice of balance billing on the part of some consultants has had any such impact.  However, I am supportive of the continuing efforts by the VHI to maximise the number of consultants who are fully participating and thus to reduce the incidence of balance billing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House whether he will use his influence, which is no doubt considerable, with both the consultants and the VHI to ensure that this practice is <Col N="660" /> eliminated and with the objective of making available to patients all possible information at a time when they are under considerable stress?  Also, in view of some of the developments reported recently, will the Minister take a more personal interest in the problem with a view to using that influence effectively?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am strongly supportive of the efforts of the VHI to ensure that every consultant is a fully participating consultant and that no further bills are sent to patients after treatment. Obviously, there is a contractual arrangement between the VHI and the individual consultants and I hope all consultants will be signed up to a fully inclusive service so that the subscriber to the VHI will know that all the costs will be covered and he or she will not be receiving any surprise bills.</P>
      <P>The question of information is a separate issue.  During the time of the disagreement between the VHI board and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association in relation to information, it was my strong view that every subscriber to the VHI was entitled to know the extent of the cover.  If it is not possible to have every consultant participating fully, the subscriber is entitled to know which consultants are fully participating and which are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that he has a certain responsibility to ensure that that information is accessible to the public?  One way of doing that would be to extend the patients' charter, which was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, to include the VHI subscriber. If the VHI is not publishing this information, does the Minister not feel he has a responsibility to do so in the interest of the patients?  Not only would that be of benefit to the patients but <Col N="661" /> it might encourage more consultants to participate in the scheme.  Surely the Minister has a responsibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a responsibility to publish data I do not possess but I am glad the VHI is making that information available by telephone and through the list of participating consultants which has been circulated to general practitioners. The information, therefore, is available to every subscriber on the telephone lines made available by the VHI so there should be no lack of information in this regard.  The real objective I hope to achieve is to ensure there is full participation by all consultants.  There will be a further complication, however, in July when there will be an opening of competition under the third EU directive.  I must introduce legislation here to set the framework for that.  I do not want competition to be health inflationary, however, because the subscriber to the VHI will have to pay.  I am determined to ensure there is open information and that the criteria we lay down &mdash; community rating, lifelong cover, open enrolment etc. &mdash; are preserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister taking such an interest in the VHI.  I remember a time when he was reluctant to become involved in the issues of private health care and private health insurance, saying he was the Minister for public health.  Is the Minister aware that the VHI has refused to cover the cost that may be incurred by a woman seeking to have tests carried out privately for hepatitis C?  Will the Minister comment on that in relation to the patients' charter to which he referred and in relation to the VHI's responsibilities to its patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I have a responsibility to ensure that the public health service is of the best quality.  I have other <Col N="662" /> responsibilities also.  The VHI is vested in me; I am the 100 per cent shareholder of the VHI on behalf of the people of Ireland and I have responsibilities, under the EU directive, to prepare the framework for open health insurance.  I take those responsibilities seriously.  Much work has been done in relation to preparing the ground work for the regulation of health insurance here.  Clearly the scale of private health insurance will impact on the quality and scale of public health provisions and both of those will then become my responsibility to some extent.</P>
      <P>On the specific question regarding the VHI covering tests for hepatitis C, I do not want to get into that area because there is a private contractual obligation between an insurer and an individual client.  The rules are determined by the insurer, in this case the VHI, and the schedule of services it provides.  I understand, however, that they do not normally cover infectious diseases as described under the Infectious Diseases Act and in this case it has refused to provide cover.  Now that my attention has been brought to this matter I will investigate it but I am not sure what role, if any, I have in addressing what is a contractual arrangement between a subscriber and an insurance company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years arrangements have been made with the VHI whereby an overall cash limit applies in respect of VHI subscribers provided with private or semi-private accommodation in public hospitals.  This system is designed to <Col N="664" /> ensure that the income potential of these facilities is achieved to the maximum extent possible, while providing a financial framework within which the VHI can meet the hospital accommodation needs of subscribers and maintain premia at reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>An agreed overall cash limit is allocated among the relevant public agencies by my Department having regard to available data on the income generation performance of the agency concerned and its projection of future private activity.  I am arranging to have circulated in the Official Report a table which indicates the individual cash limits applying to the agencies concerned in respect of the year to end February 1994.</P>
    <P>The aggregate cash limit available for distribution among the agencies in respect of 1993-94 was £50 million and represented an increase of approximately £10 million over the previous year.  In agreeing the overall cash limit with the VHI and allocating it among the agencies every effort is made to match the limit with the prospective volume of activity. There are no final figures on VHI payments yet available in respect of the VHI financial year 1993-94.</P>
    <P>In regard to private hospitals, the position is that the VHI agrees individual budgets with the hospitals concerned. While I have no direct involvement in this process I am assured that the board take a rigorous approach to cost containment in framing these budgets.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect the Minister had a great deal of time on his hands after identifying priority areas for reform and indulging in cosmetic nit-picking.  I am tired listening to Ministers talk about reform of local government and improvements that could be made.  All that happened is the local government system has deteriorated.  None of the amendments has improved the system.  Minor details, such as dual mandates, the exclusion of certain office holders from memberships and so on, do not mean anything to the public.  They do not care whether we have triple mandates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister wasted time bringing in this Bill.  He could have taken a tour of every local <Col N="767" /> authority and experienced at first hand the jarring effect of a car tyre going into a large pothole.  He would not have to read the newspapers to find out what state the roads are in or have people coming from afar to marvel at the degree to which they have deteriorated.  He would not have to introduce reforms to make local government relevant or to improve its efficiency because he would realise there was need for practical reform in that funds should be made available to allow local authorities carry out their statutory functions.  No amount of whitewash or covering over the cracks will change that.  It is is fact of life.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would see the error of his ways in his second year in office.  Some time ago Deputy Crawford spoke about potholes in Monaghan and Cavan.  The Minister was so happy with the position that he did not think it necessary or desirable to go to the bother of giving a prepared reply.  He smiled confidently and looked across the House at the unfortunate Deputy Crawford.  He said he had made sufficient money available and asked if the Deputy had not made representations to his local authority. He asked what they were doing with the money he gave them but he did not say he had reduced the amount of money available to each local authority by 10 per cent in the current year at a time when it should have been increased tenfold.  Let us talk realistically about local government reform.  The &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is a 10 per cent reduction in funding.</P>
    <P>The motorist who drives over hill and dale is shocked by the state of the roads. The Minister is not aware of what is going on around him and that is sad.  His backbenchers should have been the first to impact on his consciousness.  Could it be possible that they failed to penetrate his subconscious or that he is totally impervious to their charms?  Could it be possible he just does not care or does not understand the position?  Could it be possible that the Government made such bad providion in the Estimates that it is throwing up its hands and saying it can do nothing about the matter?  If that is not <Col N="768" /> the case I implore the Minister, before it is too late, to ask the local authority members of his party if they have been given sufficient money for the maintenance of main and county roads.  The Minister will be lucky to escape with his life because councillors know that the sight of the Minister in any constituency suggesting he gave money to repair the potholes would be a laugh.  If the Minister can survive for another year without being assassinated by one of his own people or falling into or drowning in a pothole, he is capable of bearing interminable pressure such as no Minister experienced so far.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be suffering from the Marie Antoinette syndrome &mdash; he does not fully understand the magnitude of the problem facing him.  He has had the audacity to come into this House with a local government Bill in which he has avoided dealing with the real issues.  The Minister should adopt a more practical attitude and give local authorities the necessary funding to meet their statutory needs.  He should stop the nonsense engaged in by successive Ministers of stating at Estimates time that sufficient funds have been given to the local authorities. He has not given local authority sufficient funding and it now appears that he will not.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it now appears that nothing short of a serious shock will change the Minister's thinking in this area.  This shock treatment could include the withholding by motorists of car tax. The Minister of State will know of a case in my constituency where the people of Wicklow proposed withholding their car tax because no one had even looked at the extent of the problem with which they have had to deal in recent years.  I had to advise against this action as they would have been breaking the law.  However, the time will come when people will take the law into their own hands.  I implore the Minister, while there is still time, to cop on and to get off his high horse but in so doing, he should be careful that he does not fall into a pothole.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on its introduction, the third Bill on local government introduced in three years.  The Minister also introduced legislation dealing with his main areas of responsibility &mdash; three electoral Acts, two planning Acts, a road Act, a housing Act, the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the Road Traffic Act.  This Bill will strengthen local government in many ways.  I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on the tremendous work he is doing in the area of housing. Since he took responsibility for this portfolio public representatives have found it very easy to make direct contact with the housing section of his Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister has highlighted the importance of local government as a worthwhile enterprise in its own right separate from central Government in both political and administrative spheres in so far as this is possible.  The Bill provides for the holding of elections to borough corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners in 1994 and for the extension of outdated boundaries for the purposes of these elections. It also provides for the establishment of a statutory local government reorganisation committee to make proposals on the modernisation of town local government.  This committee will consist of up to seven members and must include elected councillors from both town and county authorities.  I welcome this local input into the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will have the task of preparing and submitting a reorganisation report containing proposals on reform of town local government, including recommendations on such matters as the number of classes of local authority, the role and functions appropriate to each class, finance, staffing and the <Col N="770" /> organisational matters appropriate to each class.  It will have to take into account all the relevant factors, such as community identity, civil tradition, local capability, the need for the effective and efficient discharge of functions and delivery of service and the need to safeguard the position and capacity of county councils as the primary unit of local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the reorganisation committee a clear mandate and provides a definite framework.  I do not accept the points made by the Minister about the dual mandate.  It is unfair to deprive Oireachtas Members, having been elected to the local authority, of holding office in their local authorities.  In many local authorities it is the Oireachtas Member or Members who provide the link with national Government and who play a major part in furthering the interests of their local authorities.  The Minister should re-examine this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other reform measures, including the updating and consolidation of the provisions relating to local authority membership, local elections and local authority meetings and procedures.  The next elections to local authorities are fixed for 1998 with subsequent elections taking place at five year intervals thereafter.  The Bill restates in a comprehensive and updated format the law relating to local authority library services and local authority powers in the provision of various facilities and services.  I welcome the power being given to local authorities to make by-laws without the need for ministerial consent.  The Bill updates the law dealing with local authority estimates, rates, personnel, associations, archives and other minor technical matters and removes unnecessary controls.  The outdated provisions in enactments are being replaced, repealed or revoked by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are starved of funding. It is fundamental to the future of local government that sufficient funding be made available to local authorities especially for the maintenance of roads. The maintenance of the roads in County <Col N="771" /> Kerry is a major problem for Kerry County Council.  We have made two major submissions to the Minister within the past six months.  It is fundamental to the developments which have taken place in County Kerry, for example, Farranfore Airport, that we have a good county road structure, and the only way we can provide this is with sufficient funding.</P>
    <P>Tralee Urban District Council has shown tremendous initiative and foresight in the past six years in motivating tourism developments costing millions of pounds. It encouraged private investment in these developments in Tralee &mdash; the Aquadome, the restoration of a windmill and a steam train development.  These developments would not have been possible if the local authority had not taken the initiative and borrowed a substantial amount of money.  Thankfully the council will be in a position to make repayments after this year.  If other local authorities were encouraged to undertake similar developments much more could be achieved.  Local authorities are in a position to encourage private investment in such developments.  I want to emphasise the importance of providing sufficient funding for local government.</P>
    <P>The policy of strengthening the powers of local authorities and giving them greater freedom and flexibility has been consistently followed since 1991 and I hope this policy will be pursued in the future.  The Bill continues and extends this approach.  For example, it provides for the removal of control by central Government on local authorities on matters such as by-laws, parks, burial grounds, etc.  The more freedom given to local government the better and the more development which will take place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister should look again at the provisions regarding the dual mandate.  Oireachtas Members play a very important part in local authorities; they provide the necessary link with central Government.  For that reason alone they should not be prevented from holding office in their local authorities.</P>

      <P>Opposition Deputies have said that this is piecemeal legislation which is going nowhere and will do nothing.  I should have thought that any Bill allocating an extra £2 million to our libraries would be welcomed and the fact that its provisions are about to repeal the legislation appertaining to libraries, giving wider powers to the library authorities. These are improvements the local authorities have been seeking for many years.  The fact that local authorities can now draw up their by-laws is something all Members would welcome.  The provisions of any Bill that tend to modernise archaic legislation are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister indicated that the provisions of this Bill provide for the repeal of 27 separate Acts in their entirety.  I am sure Deputy Kenny will welcome that proposal, in addition to the fact that the Minister said he would examine the provisions in 78 different enactments with a view to their repeal, the type of activity for which we have been calling on the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Effectively the Minister has also decided to set up an independent Local Government Reorganisation Commission, exactly what the Opposition had been seeking and has given that commission a 12 month timescale within which to report to him.  That is welcome, progressive and is what one would expect of the present Minister and his Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>We have the largest number of town commissions or urban councils in Cork, the boundaries of each of which have been extended.  In that exercise the great thing was the amount of co-operation given by everybody involved &mdash; the county manager, officials and the present elected representatives.  These are positive developments.  When endeavouring to sell something one should build on positives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the first to admit that, while this Bill is not a panacea for all the ills that have befallen local authorities, it represents an important, progressive step in that direction.  For that reason alone I am glad the Minister has seen fit to <Col N="773" /> introduce it.  Any detailed examination of the Bill would lead one to believe that the natural progression therefrom would be to examine Dáil constituencies and that what should follow is the single seat constituency along with the proportional representation system of election.  The Minister has not taken that road in this Bill.  Nonetheless it is something to which he must give serious consideration, given some of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I might be very subjective but, as a legislator one must endeavour to be objective. Being a member of a local authority my subjective view would be let me be a TD; let me be a member of a local authority; I would aspire to being a mayor, a chairman or vice-chairman of my county council. Of course, I would have such aspirations, as would every one of us, but we must also take into account the role of the TD as a legislator and the modernisation of the Dáil itself and what is taking place.</P>
    <P>There were calls from Fine Gael for the introduction of a committee system and for its extension, which will continue into the future.  This means that more of our time as Deputies will be taken up with the consideration and passage of legislation, which is as it should be.  At the same time any TD analysing the content of his or her constituency work would admit that 80 per cent relates to local authority matters.  For that reason I am delighted the Minister has decided not to go the whole hog and bar TDs from membership of local authorities, which is good in itself, because it is my firm belief that TDs have much to contribute at local level to the management of their cities and counties.  I agree with the provisions of the Bill where it is stated that TDs should not be chairpersons or vice-chairpersons of local authorities because if, say, even for one year I were chairman of my county council, that would be a full time job and would mean I would be seeking to pair with somebody in this House over that year while I acted in that capacity.  That is not right; that is not the reason we are elected to this House. While under present arrangements it is <Col N="774" /> possible for us to hold membership of local authorities, being a chairman thereof is a professional job that should be left to councillors, not Members of the House of the Oireachtas.  Were this question put to councillors nationwide we could be certain that their response would be to leave it to those not elected to Dáil or Seanad Éireann, it should be within their bailiwick because they have the time to do it; and to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister has decided to repeal such a large number of enactments, one matter about which all members of local authorities are concerned is: how efficient are local authorities? How well are our cities and counties managed?  I believe there is a chasm here in that there is no regular efficiency and-or cost-effective audit.  It is my belief that money is being squandered by some local authorities.  The time has come when there will have to be much greater control over how such money is spent.  We all know the saying, seek a busy person because he will do the job properly but my view is that say, a mayor, a lord mayor or a chairman of a county council, if also a TD, will not be able to devote every hour of his or her day to ensuring that the substantial amount of money being allocated to local authorities is well spent.  For example, look at the county roads that have been properly surfaced over the past ten years, yet every year the amount of money for this purpose is increased.  One need only look to the price structure for tarring our roads. It is my understanding that our costs are approximately one-third higher than those in the northern part of the country. Surely the time has come for somebody to investigate expenditure of this kind to ascertain whether there are cartels operating, whether people or companies are making undue profit at the expense of the State and, ultimately, at the expense of the taxpayer.  This aspect of local authority administration must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I think somebody referred to the managerial set-up within local authorities and the Local Appointments Commission.  I have a beef about this in that politicians <Col N="775" /> have been taken out of all these areas for fear of political patronage.  For example, local authority officials sitting on interview boards has been described as being the great tour of Ireland.  I am accusing nobody.  Nonetheless there is a danger here of the old pals act.  If there are senior officials of various local authorities travelling the country interviewing personnel for senior positions, there is a grave danger of the old pals act obtaining. Perhaps the Minister would examine this practice to ensure that senior personnel of one local authority would not be involved in the appointment of city managers, assistant city managers, county managers or assistant county managers. I am not pointing the finger but all such appointments should be open and above board.  There have been a number of suggestions of the old pals act having been engaged in in recent years.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  We can progress from here to ensure that local government will become more meaningful to all of us.  The devolving of powers to local authorities is something for which we have all called.  For instance, I think we had to wait five years for the enactment of a speed limit; at least that is now happening under the Road Traffic Bill. In addition we have autonomy in respect of the libraries.  It would be my hope that this trend will continue well into the future.</P>

      <P>I am happy to make a brief contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban district council elections were postponed by this Government on the basis of their undertaking a radical reform of local government.  This Bill, published some days ago, comprises a comprehensive analysis from the Minister's point of view of what should be done in local government in 1994, that is assuming he conducted an analysis into the present state of affairs <i>vis-à-vis</i> local government.  I am disappointed that the evidence and the information available to the Minister from a wide variety of sources did not lead him to introduce a Bill of radical proportions.  The only <Col N="776" /> effect of this Bill is that urban council boundaries are being extended for electoral purposes this year, £2 million is being made available for libraries and urban district councils and local authorities will be given relief in respect of the introduction of by-laws.</P>
    <P>Whoever wrote the first portion of the Minister's script is obviously a person of literary ability.  &ldquo;The law on local government was still an archaic, obscure and inconsistent labyrinth&rdquo;.  It is not the usual outline one gets from Departments. Having referred to the local archives that person also has an interest in tradition and culture.  Obviously they have a wealth of information about how archaic local government is.  I am not sure whether that person is one of the two officials present but they must be bored out of their minds listening to references to county roads, potholes and so on.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, did not take this Bill to the limit and propose radical reform of local government.  As the Minister said, we are five years from the centenary of the foundation of local government in Ireland.  The legacy we bequeath to the next generation will not be great.  As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said, certain Acts are being repealed while others are being examined but the Bill does not address the fundamental questions which pertain to local government in the mid-nineties and as we head towards the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The local authority is the fundamental organ of economic development and expansion in Ireland and it should be given the opportunity to be such.  This Bill does not address the necessity for local authorities to grasp that opportunity. The Minister pointed out that in 1961 a clear majority of Ireland's population was rural; in 1994, 60 per cent of the population live in towns thus putting enormous pressure on housing, water and sanitary facilities, amenity and leisure facilities, educational and administrative facilities, etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the question of the dual mandate and said that Deputies and Senators would be disqualified <Col N="777" /> from local authority membership. I can picture the Minister for the Environment walking around Herbert Park or the fields of Tipperary thinking long and hard on the dual mandate.  He arrived at the wonderful result that it would not be appropriate at this stage. The Minister would have thought long and hard about the dual mandate and whether he should confront the Deputies and Senators of the Fianna Fáil Party and tell them he was about to end the dual mandate and that they can be a Member of the Oireachtas or a member of a council but not both.  No doubt the junior partner in Government, led by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, would also have thought long and hard about this.  I am not sure what advice the Minister of State would have given to the Minister before he arrived at the decision that dual membership would not be appropriate at this stage.  Does that mean it may become appropriate at another stage?  Will the Minister have to think long and hard about it again to take the next step?  I note the references to &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; and &ldquo;leas-chathaoirleach&rdquo; of local authorities, but they will still be called &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and so on throughout the country.  The graduation from English terms to Irish terms in local authorities takes a long time.</P>
    <P>Since 1975 I have served on the local authority of which I am a member, Mayo County Council.  Attendance at meetings has never interfered with my ability to perform both jobs.  In general, it enhances one's ability to deal with problems arising at local level.  It helps the members of local authorities understand that, if necessary, there is another forum in which to raise these issues.  If the Minister and the Minister of State seek the views of Government backbenchers who are also members of local authorities the majority will inevitably be in favour of a continuation of dual membership.</P>
    <P>Physically, geographically and politically it would be difficult to hold dual mandate in terms of membership of this House and membership of the European Parliament because of the extensive constituencies <Col N="778" /> and the duties involved.  When one represents a Dáil constituency and is a part of a local authority one becomes familiar with various problems and is able to deal with them.  The Minister's conclusion that dual membership would not be appropriate at this stage smacks of his fears of the wrath of standing up in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and saying that &ldquo;dual membership is over and that as we approach 1999 as Minister for the Environment he has decreed that nobody who stands for the Dáil can also be a member of a local authority.  That battle will be fought in the backrooms of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know the Labour Party position but I am sure they will have a view.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party stand for the grassroots and for the small man they will want their Deputies serving on local authorities.  That is a personal view.  From experience I know it is feasible to have dual membership in the Dáil and on a local authority and that one can perform both functions well; one does not interfere unduly with the other.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Keeffe saying that Deputies should devote more time to legislation and scrutinising Committee Stages of Bills and so on.  The quality of any Government should not be judged by the amount of legislation enacted but rather by the quality and the effect of that legislation for the common good and should reflect the rights of minority groups.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of a Government should be judged by the quality of the legislation passed, its effect on the common good and its reflection of rights for the minority.  That is what the people elected their Deputies to do, in a general sense that is their brief.  If their views are reflected in legislation it can solve the difficulties ordinary people face.</P>
    <P>The principal organ of development should be the local authority but there is a great degree of overlap and undue bureaucracy in many local authorities. For instance in County Mayo, the functions of the development agencies overlap, although one is told that they do not.  One has to deal with Údarás na <Col N="779" /> Gaeltachta, Forbairt, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the regional tourist offices, Bord Fáilte and to a lesser extent, Teagasc. The developmental agencies set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, FÁS, the Leader programme, the county enterprise boards and the small industries division of Forbairt are also involved.  A person with a proposal has to deal with a number of agencies.  Evidence has emerged that duplicate grants were paid in respect of the same business &mdash; which were withdrawn when it was discovered. It was possible to submit applications to several bodies such as a county enterprise board and to a Leader programme and to submit duplicate original receipts in many cases.  A single developmental organisation located in one centre, could streamline applications and eliminate duplication of administrative costs.  State funding is wasted to some extent by the duplication of resources. The number of developmental organisations, good though they may be in their own right, causes great confusion.  We can develop this point later but I am not happy with the situation.</P>
    <P>Castlebar Urban District Council has an annual expenditure of around £2 million, £150,000 of which comes from the rates support grant and £600,000 from commercial rates.  The rate is £39 in the £ valuation, one of the highest in the country; £150,000 in service charges and the domestic service charge is £110, one of the five highest in the country.  If rates had not been abolished in the 70s householders would be paying rates of between £600 and £800 at 1994 levels &mdash; the rateable valuation might not be as high as the rates would impinge directly on the voters.  Councillors deal with commercial water charges, car parking charges, annuities on council houses and revenue from graves.  This leads to a shortfall and they are £1.1 million in debt.  In fairness, the Department of the Environment increased their allocation by 3 or 4 per cent on last year's allocation and, with inflation so low, this will marginally reduce the debt.  Many local authorities are in the same situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> The Minister referred to the ability to introduce by-laws.  This is a welcome trend but the reality of implementing it is another matter.  For example, the Garda Commissioner has the authority to decide where double yellow lines will be located. I know my local authority submitted numerous applications to the Department of the Environment and to the Department of Justice for no parking areas but the number of queries raised suggests that officials in the Custom House were not <i>au fait</i> with the situation. The provisions on by-laws in the Bill will not deal with this problem or with the issue where local authorities may wish to have areas where travellers cannot park. One has to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for permission to set up a taxi rank.  Perhaps the Minister will give examples of the by-laws that can be introduced by the local authorities without reference to ministerial sanctions.</P>
    <P>A number of weeks ago I related an incident I witnessed in the course of my duties in the northern part of my constituency. Three bullocks were drinking out of a pothole and each had sufficient, which is an indication of the size of the pothole.  Every Deputy, with the exception of those who live in small city constituencies where the roads are good, have problems with county roads.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner did not do anything for the county road system in the county. If the county council is to be the organ of development something could be done about the duplication in training and expertise.  A great deal needs to be done such as the development of new parks, wall building and the basic essentials of the side dressing of roads and cutting bushes.  This could be done in conjunction with FÁS schemes but it does not happen because of problems with unions.  In some counties as many as 300 or 400 people are doing this essential work and, as the Minister of State knows, if the water is not removed from the road surface there will be problems.  Irrespective of what moneys are spent, the problem will not be dealt with unless there is adequate manpower to carry out that work in a wet climate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I hope the Minister will accept amendments. He has an opportunity to reform local authorities to bring them into the next century so that they will be the principal organ of development as well as dealing with the fundamental question of the authorities' ability to raise money.  I hope that on Committee Stage that the Minister and his Minister of State will, to use his own words, &ldquo;think long and hard about this&rdquo; and accept reasonable amendments.</P>

      <P>The reform of local government was promised even before the promise was made to drain the Shannon. There is no older chestnut in national politics than the promise to introduce reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would not describe this Bill as the most radical ever introduced it contains some extremely good, workable and sensible provisions.  It also contains provisions which are anything but sensible. I refer to the proposal to disallow a Member of the Oireachtas from becoming chairperson or vice-chairperson of a local authority of which he or she is a member.  This makes no sense.  It is ridiculous to exclude a person who has a mandate from the people from holding the highest office on the council.  In all probability this provision is unconstitutional, not that anyone will bother to challenge it.  A body elected by the people has a democratic right to elect whatever individual is chooses to be chairperson or vice-chairperson of that body.  Central Government is interfering by stating that a Member of the Oireachtas will no longer be allowed to be appointed as chairperson or vice-chairperson of a local authority.  This is a negation of democracy and the Bill should be changed.  A Member of the Oireachtas is entitled to be the chairperson or vice-chairperson of his or her local authority.  I had the privilege and honour of being chairperson of Kerry County Council for one term.  It will be a travesty of justice if this provision is implemented and it should be reconsidered. It is a bit like inviting somebody to play a game of football and refusing to <Col N="782" /> pass the ball to them.  We are not playing ball in this instance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reform of local authorities and the boundaries for urban authorities, the Bill illustrates an extremely disturbing trend which has continued unabated for many years, that is, the continued drift from rural Ireland towards the centre.  This matter has to be addressed immediately.  The ICMSA made an extremely good point that one of the more disturbing features in rural Ireland in the purchase of land by foreigners.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss further in this House the possibility of measures being introduced by Germany in regard to Irish beef imports.  I sincerely appreciate the solidarity being shown in this matter.  In their contributions last night Deputy Harney and Deputy Doyle were extremely responsible in commenting on this important matter.  This is an important issue for a variety of reasons given the economic importance of our beef industry, the significance of our beef export trade to Germany and the need to protect our reputation as a major exporter of high quality beef to a wide range of international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no suggestion of a ban being imposed by Germany on Irish beef.  The German authorities through their embassy, have confirmed this point. What we have is a draft proposal by the German health ministry which provides that additional requirements would be imposed on beef imports from certain countries, including Ireland.  These conditions would be over and above the requirements set down in the European Union trade rules on beef.  This matter is still at the proposal stage.  No decision has been made by the German authorities. As of now there are no restrictions on Irish beef exports to Germany. <Col N="783" /> I emphasise this point in order that we do not damage the reputation of our valuable industry by being too alarmist.</P>
    <P>As it happens we could meet the extra conditions being suggested, because of our elaborate control system on BSE, but that is not the issue.  I am extremely concerned that Ireland should be mentioned at all in scope of any proposed measures.  The measures being proposed by Germany are not justified on scientific or economic grounds.  Neither can they be justified on animal or public health grounds.  Any such action would be unilateral in nature and, consequently, would be illegal under the rules of the Single Market.  It could not be defended by any scientific argument or any normal risk analysis.</P>
    <P>Since this matter has come to light I have lost no time, nor have I spared any effort, in conveying my views to the German authorities.  Through our Embassy in Bonn and through the German embassy in this country we have explained that any unilateral action of the kind suggested would be completely unjustified and would be contrary to European Union law.  Contact has also been established at the highest level in the German ministry of agriculture.  We are also liaising with the European Commission who have a central role to play in this matter.  We are making progress in convincing the German authorities of the merits of our case.  The latest indications are that the German authorities will defer any action until after the next Agriculture Council on 26 April.  I am satisfied that the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion and that the suggested restrictions will not be imposed on Irish beef.  I intend to persist with my efforts to ensure that unilateral measures are not taken against Irish beef.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if I explained to the House our situation in regard to BSE. Ireland has a low sporadic incidence of the disease.  Since 1989 over 80 cases have occurred in a cattle population of 7 million animals.  This is equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.0002 per cent which is insignificant.  We have an extremely <Col N="784" /> comprehensive set of controls in place. BSE confirmed animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.  We are unique in having a system of depopulating herds in which a case occurs. The feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants is banned.  We have a very good surveillance system, which includes ante- and post-mortem examinations in abattoirs for the symptoms of the disease. These controls, which go beyond those recommended by the European Union and other organisations, allied to the high animal health status which this country enjoys, highlight the reason additional measures or controls on the part of the German authorities would not be justified. In reality they would serve no useful purpose.  BSE is a disease which has generated a considerable amount of interest and has been the subject of considerable scientific research and analysis. The various measures which have been put in place by the European Union, which, incidently, do not refer to Ireland, have been on the basis of scientific information. Germany is attempting to depart from the scientific approach and this is not reasonable.  Neither is it acceptable that a member state should be allowed to depart from the rules of the Single Market.  These rules should apply equally to all member states and Irish beef should have continued access to the German market on the basis of these agreed rules. We can settle for no less.</P>
    <P>If further discussion is necessary at European Union level on BSE, then I have no objection to that.  Neither can I have any objection to on-going scientific analysis and research.  This, in fact, has been happening, especially in the UK where a number of major projects are under way.  However, matters like this cannot be progressed on the basis of unilateral measures by individual member states.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland is regarded as having just a trickle of BSE cases is recognised by international organisations such as OIE, the International Veterinary Organisation and WHO.  It was also accepted by the EU Commission when it extensively reviewed the matter in 1990. <Col N="785" /> This country sells beef to 60 countries internationally.  Our beef industry has made good strides in penetrating lucrative value-added markets in Europe and especially in gaining a foothold in the supermarket trade.  It is part of a concerted move away from intervention. Germany is a very good example of such a market.  It was worth £75 million last year.  There is scope for further development and progress in that area.  We have a good product, produced in a good environment and under good conditions. I am, therefore, determined that our market access should be protected and maintained.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will spare no effort to avoid any disruption of our beef exports to Germany.  The low levels of the disease in this country and the extensive nature of our controls means that any proposed restrictions by Germany would be unnecessary and unwarranted. I am satisfied that the German authorities recognised the value of our controls and I believe that over the past day or so we have made good progress in getting our argument across.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am confident that this matter can be resolved without the restrictions being put in place.  A discussion at the Council of Agriculture Ministers later this month could clarify the matter further and the EU Commission will no doubt play a constructive and a helpful role in the matter.  Should the German authorities decide to proceed with the proposed unilateral action we would have no alternative but to protect our position by taking the matter to the European Court.  However, I think good sense will prevail and it will not come to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With confirmation yesterday that the German Health Minister, Mr. Horst Seehofer is pressing ahead with plans to restrict Irish beef imports, immediate and determined action by this Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is now required to defend our multi-million pound beef industry from further slanderous comment and commercial sabotage. <Col N="786" /> Let us make no mistake, what we are looking at has been the grossest of commercial sabotage.</P>
      <P>With only 80 cases of BSE in our national herd of seven million &mdash; 0,0002 per cent &mdash; compared with the 100,000 cases in the UK which has a national herd of 12 million, there is no justification for concern at home or abroad about the health status and certification of Irish beef.  Recognising that public health must always be paramount, there is complete depopulation of herds in which a case of BSE arises and the containment of the disease in this country, despite the virulent outbreak in the UK, is a valid testimony to the strict procedures in place.</P>
      <P>The innuendo and totally unwarranted scare about health risks from Irish beef comprise a profoundly unfriendly act towards Ireland by the German authorities, and that surprises me.  This disgraceful act of commercial sabotage has all to do with the dynamics of internal German politics and nothing to do with the health status of our herd.  The German Minister for Health urgently needs to restore his political credibility with federal elections in the offing since the major scandal over blood plasma products broke in Germany.</P>
      <P>German farm incomes have decreased by 19 per cent over the last three years while at the same time Irish beef penetration of the German market increased by more than 50 per cent.  The present scaremongering could decrease Irish beef consumption in Germany, thereby increasing the sourcing of beef domestically, and help to restore the political fortune of a Minister for Health who is prepared to stoop to any depths to ingratiate himself with the German electorate. Recent television reports in Germany are urging consumers to change to German beef to be sure that they will have healthy beef.  That is the propaganda going out on German TV about Irish beef.  If this is not electioneering on the back of the Irish beef trade, it could be little else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words of Herr Borchert, the German Federal Agriculture Minister, in Dublin Castle on 30 March last are worth <Col N="787" /> looking at again.  In this lengthy address to this major conference, Agri-Vision 2000, he referred to his concern about the imbalance in trade between Ireland and Germany.  He said that in 1992, Ireland exported 17 times more agricultural goods to Germany than it imported from Germany.  This export surplus was approximately 1.2 billion DM. Rather ominously, he also pointed to the fact that in the case of butter exports to Germany at 34,000 tonnes in 1992, these are ten times greater today than they were ten years ago.  Herr Borchert went on to comment on what he saw as Irish agriculture's clear advantages in some sectors, not only in terms of natural but also of economic conditions of production. He said: &ldquo;It is above all Ireland's economic advantages which cause great difficulties for German agriculture&rdquo;.  That appears in a different context today than it did on 30 March.  In the context of CAP reform proposals, he went on:</P>
    <P>... to reduce production is proving to be more difficult for beef than for cereals and milk.  It would be impossible, for administrative reasons, to close down production capacity, and a quota regulation cannot be considered because of the lack of controls at the point of sale ...</P>
    <P>... I am not yet convinced that beef regulations introduced so far would bring about a lasting improvement in the market.  The measures taken must, in my view, be examined once again.</P>
    <P>Herr Borchert's view is that &ldquo;competition within European agriculture will increase&rdquo;.  I hope that will be done fairly, honourably, with no dirty tricks and within European Union rules.</P>
    <P>While we would have no difficulty in complying with the restrictions imposed on Irish beef, they are unacceptable.  The commercial facts of life are that those sourcing beef will go elsewhere if extra red tape and bureaucracy are imposed. My views are supported by our failure to penetrate the Turkish and Jordanian <Col N="788" /> markets in recent years where there has been a huge increase in the importation of beef sourced from Europe.  Those countries set a precedent for the market damage that can be caused when restrictions are imposed.  In Turkey 22,000 tonnes of beef were sourced from Europe in 1991 and increased to 30,000 tonnes by 1993, but excluded Irish beef because of the restrictions they had placed on Irish and UK beef.  We were lumped in with the UK problem by the Turks who obviously did not have an appreciation of the health status of the Irish herd. In Jordan 16,500 tonnes of beef were sourced from Europe in 1991 which increased to more than 46,000 tonnes last year, but again with no penetration of the market by Irish beef because of restrictions.</P>
    <P>The very implication that restrictions may be necessary carries a broad message for the consumer and European and world markets.  It must be understood that if we have to comply with any restrictions, they will have a similar effect to a total ban and if anyone doubts that they need only consider what happened in Turkey and Jordan.</P>
    <P>The very suggestion of a restriction has had an extremely damaging effect on our export trade to Germany.  To couple us with the problem in the UK and fail to draw any distinction between the huge difference in incidence of disease and our total slaughter or depopulation policy in the case of any outbreak which makes us BSE free can only be interpreted as an act of commercial sabotage.</P>
    <P>We now have reports of the Dutch and our other export markets expressing concern about the reports from the German Health Ministry.  Any hint of restrictions implies risk in eating Irish meat.  German officials are asking supermarkets to delist Irish beef.  We have reports of supermarkets advertising that they do not sell Irish beef.  The enormous implications of this to one of our vital industries cannot be lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has known for some days of the intentions of the German authorities, but failed to act to counter the libel and slander of this to one of our <Col N="789" /> major industries.  The Health Minister imposed the restrictions.  The Minister may have been working behind the scenes, but we do not have evidence of that.  In any case, his actions failed because we still have public scaremongering in respect of the health status of the Irish herd by a German Health Minister.  I ask the Minister to vigorously lobby the Council of Agriculture Ministers when it meets in a couple of weeks and the President of the European Commission to force the Germans to withdraw their proposed restrictions and apologise for this act of commercial sabotage which has inflicted international damage on our excellent reputation as quality food and beef producers.  If this line of action should fail the Minister must indicate that he is prepared to go through the German courts and, if necessary, the European Court of Justice &mdash; I welcome the indication that he would take that course of action &mdash; to redress the damage and to indicate our earnestness in protecting our quality Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Even if the Germans withdrew their proposed restrictions and apologised in the morning, as I hope they will, there must be a case for major damages to restore the credibility of the Irish food industry in the eyes of world markets.  If an individual behaved against another individual in the manner in which the Germans have against the Irish in relation to the health status of Irish beef, it would be actionable and the sums involved would be extremely large.  I fail to understand how one so-called friendly country can behave as the Germans have towards us on this issue and not pay for the damage they have caused by innuendo and implication.</P>
    <P>The Government's ham-fisted performance during the bungled European negotiations on the National Development Plan was a study in how not to influence people and win friends in Europe.  The continuous abrasive wrangling and the gratuitious insulting of senior European officials squandered in a reckless way the fund of goodwill that <Col N="790" /> had been built up so carefully since we joined the Union.</P>
    <P>The 11:1 defeat of the Minister for the Marine and this direct threat to our beef and, indirectly, to the quality of our entire food industry shows how isolated we are in Europe.  The blame and shame for this isolation lies squarely on the shoulders of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the entire Government team.  It will be up to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to redress the damage done to our beef industry.  We are not merely talking about protecting the producers of beef or farmers &mdash; although thousands of them are extremely important contributors to our GNP &mdash; but about protecting the livelihoods of thousands of PAYE workers in meat processing plants, an area that could create much more employment if allowed to do so unhindered by scaremongering.  Thousands of jobs and livelihoods are on the line.  The jobs of veterinary surgeons and all those involved in linked industries to the meat processing industry are at stake if the Minister cannot in the next day or two, nail the damage that has been done by innuendo and implication by the German Health Minister linking us to the problem of BSE in the UK.</P>
    <P>If the Germans decided that the restrictions should apply to all beef imports they would be entitled to do so, but to single us out for special mention in the same breath with the UK problem is unacceptable and the Minister must make them realise and accept that. Nothing short of an apology with no restrictions will be acceptable.  If the Germans want to play the rules of the European Union fairly and not resort to dirty tricks, either to electioneer or to increase the income prospects of German farmers, they must apologise to make good the damage they have done to one of our vital national interests, namely our beef industry.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for being a gentleman, it is a time for taking off the gloves and speaking to the Germans in a language they will understand.  If they get away with this act of commercial sabotage what will happen down the road? <Col N="791" /> There may be an attack on Ireland's major butter imports into Germany, which have increased tenfold in the past three years, to protect their farmers.  Will they resort to further dirty tricks to cause further damage, particularly in election years, if they get away on this one?  It is profoundly regrettable that a country I considered friendly towards us should resort to such tactics.</P>
    <P>This matter has nothing to do with the health status of the Irish herd which is the best in Europe and accepted by the Germans to be so, all the more inexplicable their behaviour in linking us to the UK BSE problem.  Epidemiologists will say we do not have a problem with BSE with a .0002 incidence.  I challenge the German authorities to list the bovine diseases they have with a greater incidence than that and to tell us that the health status of our herd is not infinitely higher than that of the German herd. Yet, we have never publicly humiliated or tried to discredit the German beef production sector as they have done to us.</P>
    <P>This will be a test of the Minister's earnestness and I hope the gloves will be taken off.  I await evidence of his effort to obtain a public apology, the removal of any restrictions and the making good of the excellent name of Irish beef and quality food production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we are having this debate and I thank the Government for allowing time for it, even by way of statements.  I am also delighted the Minister is present.</P>
      <P>I detect a change in Government attitude today as opposed to yesterday.  I agree with most of what Deputy Doyle said.  Obviously the food sector is particularly important to our economy.  It employs 25 per cent of those in manufacturing jobs and earns approximately 40 per cent of our net export earnings. The German market is our second biggest continental one and this year meat sales to Germany will be worth approximately £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish food sector thrives on its <Col N="792" /> reputation for producing a high quality product.  That is particularly important in Germany because of the high level of consumer awareness there.  In the early 1990s Kerrygold was able to double its sale of butter on the German market at a time when the overall butter market was declining.  It achieved that on the basis of a high quality product and being able to capture a niche market within Germany.  All consumers are sensitive to quality, image and presentation, but perhaps the Germans are the most sensitive of all.</P>
    <P>From time to time Germany uses restrictions of this kind as a barrier to trade.  A number of years ago the Germans imposed extremely tough restrictions on products supplied to their markets.  The producer had to give an undertaking to deal with any waste material and producers from small countries had to make arrangements for recycling such waste.  While that measure was noble and worthy from an environmental point of view, it posed an enormous barrier to trade for many companies and was seen as having being introduced for that purpose.  I am not sure that this is not what is happening in this case as well.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle there are political implications, but I also consider there are major commercial implications. A recent &ldquo;blind&rdquo; taste test survey was carried out among German consumers who were given beef to taste.  Irish beef rated 65 per cent as opposed to 25 per cent for the locally produced product. Are these restrictions being considered in Germany because Irish beef is so popular and is growing in market terms there? About 85 per cent of the beef we export to Germany is supplied as vacuum packed prime beef cuts for sale in the retail sector.  Product, quality and reputation are extremely important to the people who buy that beef.  The fact that our product is winning high marks because of its high quality may have given rise to concern among local producers and may be a reason for these rumours.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the incidence of BSE here &mdash; 87 cases in a herd of 7 <Col N="793" /> million.  He calculated the percentage as 0.0002 per cent, a very low rate.  We do not have an indigenous BSE problem and it is well known we have the most stringent BSE eradiction programme in Europe.  A person whom I would highly regard in this area said that if public health was at risk the supply of Irish beef to any market could not be justified.  That person told me we are regarded as having the most stringent eradication programme in Europe.  The incidence of BSE here has come from animals imported from the UK or from contaminated bone meal fed to animals which is now banned.  There has been more than 100,000 cases of BSE in the United Kingdom, 36,000 cases last year in a herd of 12 million as opposed to 16 cases in a herd of 7 million here.  Those figures highlight the difficulties in the UK and that there is no problem from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the politics of this issue in a responsible way because we all have a responsibility.  A major sector is at stake.  I detect in the Minister's attitude a change of heart.  Originally the Government took the view that there would be an effective ban on our beef because the restrictions are an effective ban.  Those restrictions will only apply to cattle slaughtered within three years or animals with clear certificate for four years.  A scare about the health implications of beef or any food product might as well be a ban because people will be afraid to purchase the product.  As Deputy Doyle said, and reference was made to this in the national media today, there are signs in many German supermarkets stating that they do not stock Irish or British beef.  Effectively it is a ban.  The Minister went to great lengths to say there is not a ban at present and that we must not involve ourselves in scare tactics or be alarmist.</P>
    <P>We must be extremely concerned, because to counteract a health scare of that type will be difficult.  It will take all the ammunition the Government can muster and will require additional resources for CBF.  It is much more difficult to get positive publicity and to <Col N="794" /> counteract a scare of this kind than one might imagine.  When people are worried or doubtful about a product they will switch to another.</P>
    <P>Even if the Germans do not impose restrictions the damage may well have been done and that is a cause for concern. Was the German ambassador called in by the Minister?  I said last night he should have been called in by the Taoiseach. We need to state our point of view as forcefully and vigorously as possible. What has happened in a disgrace.  Deputy Doyle described it as libellous or slanderous. It is highly irresponsible and there is no justification for putting our beef products in the same category as those of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that no decision will be made before 26 April but that date is too far away.  In the matter of two weeks much permanent damage will have been done not only in the German market, which is an important one, but also in other continental and international markets where competitors will be able to use the German example to prevent people from purchasing Irish beef.  A decision cannot wait until 26 April.  Has any contact been made with the President of the Commission?</P>
    <P>I admire the fact that the Minister said this matter would be taken to the Court of Justice because I believe it contravenes Article 30 of the Union treaty.  When French farmers were banned from supplying turkeys to the UK market in 1982 because of the Newcastle disease they won their case before the Court of Justice and received £12 million compensation from the British, but the amount of damage done in the process was a great deal more than £12 million because the good name of the product had been destroyed.  Obviously the same will be the case with Irish beef.  What will be done at European Commission level before 26 April to seek to have the proposals withdrawn from the agenda of the German Government?</P>
    <P>When did the Minister become aware of this proposal?  Was he aware of it before it hit the public press on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning?  What <Col N="795" /> actions did he take?  Given our membership of the European Union it is normal when the products of member states are the subject of proposals by Ministers that inquiries are made through diplomatic and other channels.  Were such inquiries made?  Was the Minister aware what was happening and what action did he take?  The Irish Commissioner is quoted extensively in newspaper articles.  What role is he playing at European Union level to protect the good name of Irish food products generally?</P>
    <P>This is a labour intensive sector capable of generating many more jobs and sensitive to high environmental standards and to the perception that products are produced in the purest possible environment. If those conditions exist that sector is capable of generating thousands of new jobs, particularly if we target the value added end of the market, which has not been targeted as extensively as it could have been in the past.  It has the capacity to grow but it will be dependent on reputation, quality and image and if that image is tarnished, which is the case in this instance, it could stunt the growth of what could be a very successful industry in the future.</P>
    <P>What resources are available to CBF, particularly in terms of the German market, to counteract the publicity this scare has generated?  If at supermarket level German consumers read signs to the effect that no Irish or British beef is sold there, what resources are at the disposal of CBF to counteract such negative publicity?</P>

      <P>The decision of the German authorities to place restrictions on the importation of Irish beef is a serious development which, as Deputy Doyle said, is tantamount to commercial <Col N="796" /> sabotage and must be resisted in the strongest possible way by the Irish Government.  Even if the German proposals fall short of a total ban, which had been rumoured, the restrictions will still have serious implications which may have a knock-on impact way beyond the German market.  It is a development which, if allowed go unchallenged, will have implications not only for farmers but also for thousands of workers employed in the meat industry, the transport business and ancillary trades.  What is at risk here is not just Ireland's £100 million meat export market to Germany but the reputation of Irish meat throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Ireland must insist that the European Union acts to prevent Germany from using spurious claims about BSE in the Irish herd to discriminate against Irish beef.  This is not the first occasion on which the Germans attempted to ban beef imports allegedly because of BSE. In 1989 they attempted to ban imports from Britain where everyone acknowledges there is a serious problem with BSE.  On that occasion the European Union intervened to prevent the ban. There must be similar intervention to protect Irish exports, particularly as so few incidents of BSE have been recorded here.</P>
      <P>International concern about the spread of BSE is understandable.  The extent of the problem in Britain is alarming.  We have all seen dramatic television pictures of the horrific impact of the disease on cattle.  Some evidence has emerged that it may be passed from cow to calf and a similar condition has been discovered in cats.  While there has been no evidence of the condition being passed to humans, concern among consumers is understandable and it is absolutely essential that every possible step is taken to prevent any remote possibility of it being passed on through the food chain.  Even allowing for these concerns there is no justification for imposing restrictions on Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While hundreds of cases of BSE are recorded in Britain each week, fewer than 90 animals have been identified with <Col N="797" /> the disease in Ireland.  In virtually all these cases the source of the condition has been identified as coming from outside the country.  Since 1988 we have banned the importation of bonemeal, the principal source of contamination.  The policy of slaughtering all animals in herds where even a single case is detected has been an expensive exercise for the taxpayer but it is the correct strategy if we are serious about protecting the reputation of Irish beef.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question in the House the Minister said that £8 million has been spent in this area, and more money may have to be spent.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the German authorities have decided to ignore our record and treat Irish beef in the same way as the product from Britain where the problem is so serious.  There are considerable grounds for believing that this move, certainly in so far as it relates to Irish beef, is motivated by domestic and commercial considerations rather than genuine health fears.  It is totally in breach of the spirit of the European Union and GATT, and the Government must take all steps, including legal action, open to it to challenge the German decision.</P>
    <P>Elections are due to be held in Germany in the near future.  There is a strong farmers lobby there which would like to see restrictions on Irish beef for their own reasons.  There is also a strong consumers lobby in Germany which the Government there will clearly want to impress prior to the election.  Irish beef, Irish farmers and Irish workers in the meat and related industries should not be the pawns in a German electoral game. The implications of this move would be considerable and could have a knock-on impact way beyond the German market. If Irish beef is smeared in this way it is likely that other countries may be panicked into imposing similar restrictions. In particular the valuable Middle East market, where there are serious concerns about BSE, may be put at risk.</P>
    <P>This controversy raises the broader question of the need to protect and enhance the reputation of Irish beef.  Our <Col N="798" /> biggest marketing asset abroad is the relatively clean and uncontaminated image of our product, and this must be protected at all costs.  There is no significant problem with BSE, but there is one from the use of illegal growth promoters, which would be a mistake to ignore.  To many consumers at home and abroad the differences between BSE and the use of angel dust are not always clear. Unfortunately, despite all the warnings, the increase in penalties and the exhortations of the Minister, a number of farmers continue to put the pursuit of quick profits before the broader interests of the farming community and persist with the use of illegal substances.  They pose a considerable threat to the international image of Irish beef, almost as great as the unjustified action by the German authorities. If we are to protect the international reputation of Irish beef the Government must take all possible action, including international legal action, against the German restrictions. We must also intensify efforts to protect and prosecute domestic saboteurs who use illegal growth promoters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing his time with me.  The news emanating from Germany in the past few days has been most distressing and disturbing, news that in certain supermarkets in Germany window advertisements state that they are not selling Irish and British beef.  This is much more serious than we would be inclined to think at first glance.  Bearing in mind that our total exports amount to in the region of £17 billion annually while exports of beef and cattle are slightly in excess of £1 billion, that puts in perspective our dependence on the cattle and beef trade.  Industrially we operate under many constraints &mdash; the size of our production units are quite small and we are also constrained by our peripheral location.  It is bad enough to have those two drawbacks without being ostracised by the second largest importer of Irish beef on the Continent, namely, Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date we have had a total of 84 cases <Col N="799" /> of BSE whereas two years ago there were 1,000 cases of BSE per week in Britain, yet we are being treated in the same way as Britain by the Germans.  When infected animals are discovered here the Department insists on closing the farm concerned, with no animals allowed in or out.  All bovines on that farm &mdash; cows, calves, bulls, bullocks and heifers &mdash; are slaughtered.  The Department must be complimented on its approach in this regard.  In England when an animal is found to have BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, known coloquially as mad cow disease, only the affected animal is slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Approximately four years ago Ireland lost a valuable trade to the Middle East. The reason for that was that certain &ldquo;friends&rdquo; of ours in Europe spread rumours to the effect that our herd was infected with BSE.  When Middle Eastern countries refused to import our beef cattle, the country most responsible for spreading those rumours filled our quotas.  One wonders why, on this occasion, the same country adopted the approach it adopted over the past few days.  I am happy to hear the Minister state that there will not be a ban on Irish beef but while notices are being displayed in supermarkets indicating that no Irish or British beef is being sold, there will be no need for a ban &mdash; nobody will buy beef and, consequently, no country will import it.</P>
    <P>That move to highlight the effects of mad cow disease some years ago was assisted by the media in Ireland, particularly, television.  Night after night we were shown pictures of an animal so affected by mad cow disease that it was staggering around the feeding yard. Some people suspected that all cattle were affected and, consequently, the consumption of beef here dropped alarmingly. I hope the media on this occasion will not assist our enemies on the Continent as it did then.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House, both today and yesterday, have shown their great concern for this problem but there is a greater threat looming than the <Col N="800" /> one presently facing us.  It would be most unfortunate to lose £100 million in export trade to Germany but a greater threat is the continued use of angel dust and other illegal substances.  I realise those substances are banned but it does not matter whether they are injurious to health: our customers believe they are.  They want beef that is produced without the aid of such substances.  As soon as the word goes out abroad that our cattle are so treated, our export trade will collapse. While I complimented the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry earlier, I would criticise them in this regard because they are not imposing sufficiently stringent rules.  If they brought those cases to finality it would highlight the use of angel dust and other such substances.</P>
    <P>Small farmers are not responsible for this in most cases but other outlets, including factories, are responsible for promoting the use of such substances, and while that practice continues it will remain a greater threat than that posed by the Germans criticising our beef.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank each of the Deputies who contributed so responsibly to this debate.  We are in agreement that we do not have an indigenous BSE problem in Ireland and that the relatively insignificant number of cattle found with this disease were imported.  Those cattle, as well as the entire herds, were immediately depopulated and put out of the human food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a unique system of controls in Ireland.  It is the best in Europe and no other member state has such rigorous controls, depopulation policy and ante and post mortem examinations.  These enable us to ensure consumers that the food they purchase is safe to eat and comes from a country with the highest environmental and hygiene standards. That is the main reason CBF and Irish exporters have been spectacularly successful in recent years in exporting to the most prestigious markets, in particular Germany, not only beef but butter also. I do not have to spell out the level of <Col N="801" /> success we have had in both of those areas at the highest and most prestigious level of the market.</P>
    <P>In regard to this specific matter, it came to my attention unofficially some days ago that the German Minister for Health had a draft proposal to impose some restrictions on the importation of beef into Germany from a number of member states.  I was most concerned that Ireland was one of those member states and I made the point repeatedly to the various authorities in Germany that this action was unilateral, discriminatory, unjustified and was calculated to do major damage to the Irish beef market, not only in Germany but in the 60 countries worldwide to which we export Irish beef and other food products.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of the market, not only for the economy but in regard to the number of jobs involved and the general support that our food industry provides for the economic and social development of the country.</P>
    <P>I took up this matter immediately with the German Agriculture and Health Ministries, both personally and through our ambassador in Bonn.  In addition, the German ambassador in Ireland was called to the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday and was briefed on the matter.  We expressed our extreme concern and the ambassador was left in no doubt about our position on this matter. Contact was made also with the Commissioners responsible for both Agriculture and Health and the latest indications are that this matter will not be proceeded with until after the Council of Agriculture meeting on 23 April.  It is hoped and expected that this issue will be resolved at that meeting.  Should any particular difficulty arise, I have made it clear that I regard the matter as unjustified, unilateral, discriminatory and not based on a scientific analysis of any kind.</P>
    <P>I will not desist from taking whatever legal route may be required, if the matter should come to that, but I am confident we will not reach that stage.  I am disappointed at the way this matter was leaked to the media.  General scare tactics were used whereby German and other <Col N="802" /> European consumers were put off Irish beef.  This behaviour by one member state was out of order.  I am confident that the strong representations made to all the relevant authorities, including the German authorities and the European Commission, will bring about a successful resolution of this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter.  The European Commission is considering a proposal which will mean non-EU visitors to Ireland who spend less than £142 will not be entitled to claim a VAT refund.  If, as proposed, the European Union introduce this legislation it could have major implications for our tourism industry. The majority of tourists in Ireland, 70 per cent, spend less than £142 on shopping. According to the Central Statistics Office and Bord Fáilte figures, approximately £45 million was spent on shopping in Ireland in 1992 by non-EU tourists.  This new proposal could mean that up to £31 million would be lost to the economy.</P>
      <P>The lack of incentive to shop and receive a VAT refund will reduce the amount of spending in retail outlets. Consequently less revenue will be earned in these outlets.  The net effect will be that retail outlets will close down, particularly those whose main business is in tourism. Retail staff will join the dole queues, there will be a reduction in the amount of PAYE and PRSI returned to the State by retail employers and there will be a downturn in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>If this proposal is introduced tourists will only receive a refund if they spend over £142.  Shopping tours to Ireland will become unattractive and will consequently decline.  The obvious outcome will be a decline in business which will effect, particularly in the off season, not only retail outlets but tour operators, hoteliers and their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland as a tourism country will be at a disadvantage as the level of spending by tourists, which is normally less than in <Col N="803" /> other EU countries, will decrease.  This will have adverse spin-off effects on other industries and on the economy.  I am concerned about the implications of this proposal, if implemented, for the 100 employees of FEXCO, the foreign exchange company based in Killorglin. This company processes over 20,000 VAT refunds from the UK authorities for non-EU tourists.  If implemented this proposal will endanger those jobs.</P>
    <P>The proposals will be presented to the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament on Monday, 18 April in Strasbourg.  It will be examined by the economic and social committee of the EU which is made up of representatives of employer and employees organisations and other organisations in the member states. Members representing Ireland include John Carroll, Liam Connellan, John Freeman and Bill Attley.  It is important that they and our MEP's who are members of these committees are lobbied in case this matter should go through without their being fully aware of the implications.</P>
    <P>A final decision will be taken by the Council of Ministers.  In this instance it will be taken by the Finance Ministers. Since it is a tax matter the decision must be unanimous.  No date has been set for this meeting but it will probably be held in May.  It is crucial that the Irish members of the committees and Ministers oppose this measure.  I call on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to take up this matter with the European Commission to protect our tourism industry and the jobs it generates.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has responsibility for European affairs and I appeal to her to do everything possible to ensure this proposal will not go through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  We share his concern at this proposal which is at a preliminary stage.  I am sure that the Deputy is fully aware of the present rules concerning the VAT treatment of goods <Col N="804" /> purchased by non-EU residents but, for the sake of clarity, I propose briefly to outline the current situation.  What is at issue here is the VAT treatment of purchases made by tourists and other travellers through normal retail outlets, rather than the special duty free shops which are located only in special designated areas.  At present, EU rules are somewhat general in this regard, merely laying down the principle that goods which are purchased within the Union by non-Union residents for their own personal use may be exempt from VAT, provided the goods are removed from the EU.  Member states may, if they wish, set limits to the application of the exemption and they may also extend it to their own nationals whose habitual place of residence is outside the EU.</P>
      <P>In this country we have adopted a very flexible approach.  In the first place, there is no limit as to the value of goods which can benefit under the scheme.  All purchases, no matter how small or how big, are eligible for VAT relief provided that they are removed from the EU within two months of their purchase.  The relief can be given directly at time of purchase or by means of refund, the latter being the most common approach.  It is a matter for the participating retailer concerned to decide how he wishes to operate the relief.  In most cases, retailers avail of the services of refund agencies, which are private commercial concerns operating at the main points of departure in the State and providing a mail service.  Irish citizens residing outside the EU for at least a year are also entitled to the relief.  The main beneficiaries are tourists, emigrants and visiting businessmen from non-EU countries.</P>
      <P>The commission proposal to which the Deputy refers was formally presented to the Council by the Commission only on 28 March last.  It is just one of a number of items relating to the operation of the Single Market VAT regime which, in the Commission's opinion, require clarification or simplification in the light of their operation during the last year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal concerning purchases made by non-EU residents is being tabled <Col N="805" /> in response to a specific commitment to bring forward proposals for harmonised rules which was given by the Commission when the transitional Single Market VAT regime was being adopted.  The Commission propose that the relief should be restricted to purchases which exceed 175 ECU in value, roughly the equivalent of IR £140.  They also propose the introduction of harmonised rules relating to the documentation which will be required to effect the relief and that the goods should be removed from the Community within three months of being purchased.</P>
    <P>The proposal is at a very early stage of discussion: to date, there has been just one preliminary meeting at official level to consider it.  At that meeting the Irish official expressed very serious reservations about the proposed threshold and they were not alone in doing this. The House will appreciate that it is impossible at this stage to predict what the outcome of the negotiations will be. However, I can state that the Minister for Finance is unhappy with the principle of a threshold limit and that, in any event, he is resolutely opposed to the proposed limit of 175 ECUs.</P>
    <P>A very short time has elapsed since publication of the Commission's intentions and the Minister for Finance has not received any observations from trade interests in the matter to date.  However, he believes that the proposed single item limit of 175 ECUs simply does not accord with the reality of tourist purchasing patterns in this country or in the EU generally. While tourists buy a large volume of quality Irish manufactured goods here, in most cases the cost of the individual items purchased would be quite modest and in any event, would be considerably less than £140.  Nonetheless, retail shopping by tourists constitutes the lifeblood of many retailers and manufacturers in different parts of the country.  A number of sectors of traditional indigenous manufacturing such as the knitwear, clothing, glass and the various craft sectors are heavily orientated towards servicing the tourist market.</P>
    <P>The Government would be seriously concerned that adoption of the Commission's <Col N="806" /> proposal would adversely impinge on purchasing patterns by tourists here for the very simple reason that they would have to pay significantly more for their purchases.  There could also be a certain amount of resistance on the part of non-EU citizens to visit any member state of the Union.  The proposal lacks logic in this wider context &mdash; the EU would be handicapping itself unnecessarily in the world tourism context.</P>
    <P>In addition to the traditional tourist markets in North America and, to a lesser degree, Australia and New Zealand, Members of the House will be aware that in recent years there has been a marked development of a winter tourism market relating to visitors from Ireland.  These tourists come here principally to shop and in the process they make an important contribution to the economic viability of not just retail outlets but hotels, restaurants and other tourism-related services during the off-peak winter season.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy raised this matter as it has given me an opportunity to indicate the Government's position.  The Deputy can be assured that the views expressed here today will be conveyed in full to the Minister for Finance.  I will also take up the point he raised about the Economic and Social Committee.  I am sure our representative on the committee share our common view on this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The District Court in Ballincollig was held in the community centre until last year when the District Justice found the premises unsuitable and asked that certain repairs be carried out. The court has been transferred in the intervening period to Whitechurch community centre, a round trip of 20 miles from Ballincollig.  There is no direct bus service from Ballincollig to whitechurch &mdash; people from Ballincollig have to get a bus into the city and then get the bus to Whitechurch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday 300 cases were listed for the District Court in Whitechurch, 150 of <Col N="807" /> which were down to be heard.  This meant that 150 people from Ballincollig had to travel to the court in Whitechurch.  Apart from the cost, this is an unnecessary disturbance. More seriously, Ballincollig Garda station has a complement of 17 gardaí, 11 of whom were tied up at the court in Whitechurch last Friday.  I dread to think what would have happened if there had been a disaster or a robbery in Ballincollig during that time.  The local people would be very annoyed if 11 of the complement of 17 gardaí were ten miles away in a court which should rightfully be held in their town.</P>
    <P>We have had negotiations with the management of the community centre and Cork County Council on the refurbishment needed to bring the centre up to standard.  The county council is willing to pay the cost of sound proofing the centre, thus solving the major problem. It appears a room in the centre adjacent to the court can be made available for family law cases and another room can be made available for solicitors, etc.</P>
    <P>Apart from Dublin, Ballincollig is the fastest growing town in Ireland.  It is expected that, as a result of the development plan, the present population of 14,500 will have increased to approximately 20,000 by the end of the century. This growing community should have a District Court.  The location of such a court in the town would act as a deterrent to vandals and others involved in crime. The hearing of cases involving people from Ballincollig in other towns is not a sufficient deterrent to those involved in crime.</P>
    <P>We want to bring justice to the people; even bringing the District Justice and court clerk to Ballincollig would do this. Otherwise gardaí will have to be continually transferred to other locations and local people will have to incur unnecessary expense and endure a great deal of hassle.  I hope the Minister considers my request favourably.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision and maintenance <Col N="808" /> of courthouses is the responsibility of the local authorities.  District Court sitting had been held in the Ballincollig Community Centre for approximately ten years.  In June 1993 the honorary secretary of the Ballincollig Community Centre Committee wrote to Cork County Council requesting them, because of difficulties caused by vandalism and the behaviour of some of those attending the court, to find alternative accommodation for the District Court sitting in Ballincollig after 1993.</P>
      <P>Since this notice to quit Ballincollig Community Centre was served on Cork County Council exhaustive efforts have been made in the search for a suitable alternative venue.  The seven premises looked at in the immediate Ballincollig area were either unsuitable or unavailable. I understand that Cork County Council is currently holding consultations with the owners of a property in Ballincollig with a view to restoring court sitting to the town.  I want to assure the Deputy that when suitable premises are found in Ballincollig, sitting of the District Court will return there and we will spare no effort in our endeavours to ensure that this happens as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  To ensure that I do not cause distress to you or the Minister I will be referring to a concept known as WILIs &mdash; worn out institutional and legislative idiosyncracies.  It comes from the same derivative as the concept of a quango.</P>
      <P>I want to use this debate to declare war on WILIs.  It is time we got rid of worn out institutional and legislative idiosyncracies. I am declaring war on nonsensical and outdated rules and regulations devised by Government Departments which defy rational explanation. This issue is one of a number of similar issues I intend raising in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday's newspapers carried <Col N="809" /> advertisement for the recruitment of an additional 1,050 gardaí. This recruitment has the support of all sides in this House in the context of the fight against crime and the need for additional gardaí. Having regard to the reduction in the strength of the Garda Force in recent years this recruitment has particular support on this side of the House.  However, I was astonished to see in the advertisement that the Department of Justice still deems it essential for a man to be a minimum of 5'9&rdquo; in height before he can be eligible to become a member of the Garda while a woman need only be 5' 5&rdquo; in height.  Previously in the House I have asked the Minister for Justice to explain why men need this extra four inches in height.  To date I have not received a rational explanation.  The last occasion on which this matter arose the Minister of State at the Department of Justice treated me to a legal treatise as to why it was legally possible to impose such different eligibility requirements as between men and women without telling me why they were needed.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain to the House why it is regarded as contrary to the national and public interest that men of five feet, five inches in height conduct investigations into fraud, embezzlements, burglaries, rapes and murders.  Is there something special about the investigative instincts and acumen of men of five feet, nine inches in height that differentiates them from their peers of lower stature?  What is this special ingredient? Can the Minister tell the House what inquiries were conducted by the Department of Justice to determine that women of five feet, five inches in height actually possess this special ingredient while men of similar stature apparently do not?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it could be explained to the House why it has been possible for the Department of Justice to have had a number of very eminent senior and junior Ministers, politically responsible for the Garda force, who themselves are excluded from these height regulations from becoming gardaí if they wish to do so.  Was it that they entered politics <Col N="810" /> because they failed the height eligibility test to become members of the Garda Síochána and went for second best and made a job of becoming Ministers for Justice.  Why is it that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice. Deputy O'Dea, who has been sent in yet again by his senior colleague to defend the Minister on this issue, as a man of substantial political stature, stands over a rule which regards him personally as ineligible to join the Garda Síochána over which he presides as Minister?</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue before.  It had been my hope that, as a result of doing so, winds of change would have blown through the cobwebbed corridors of the Department of Justice, and that the present Ministers, both senior and junior, would have attacked this ludicrous anomaly with some of the reforming zeal they have shown for some other issues.</P>
    <P>These Garda height requirements qualify for the April WILI award of merit.  I am looking forward to making a similar award in the month of May to a different Government Department on a different issue.  While police forces world-wide have no difficulty recruiting five feet, seven inch and five feet, eight inch men, in Ireland it is seen to be essential that a barrier be erected and preserved against the possibility of such men infiltrating and undermining the Garda Force.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the advertisement published last Sunday announced that the Garda Síochána is &ldquo;an equal opportunity employer&rdquo;.  A more ludicrous claim in the context of the different eligibility height criteria applicable as between men and women would be difficult to find.  Perhaps the next electoral amendment Bill should insist that, to be eligible as a Dáil candidate, a man should be five feet, nine five inches in height.  Or perhaps the Select Committee on Legislation and Security should conduct public hearings so that members of the Garda Síochána, the Minister and his officials, the general public and those engaged in criminal activities can make submission on the <Col N="811" /> issue.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this for us; perhaps research has been undertaken by the Department and is currently being kept secret, which indicates that the majority of male criminals in this country are above five feet, nine inches in height and that is only people of higher stature who commit crimes and, ergo, we require gardaí of five feet, nine inches in height.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will now recognise that this rule should not be maintained. New advertisements should be published in this weekend's papers stating clearly that the eligibility of those who wish to join the Garda Síochána will be based on their capacity to be good members of that force and that no discrimination in relation to height will influence the decisions made on recruitment applications.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, a man for whom I have a high regard and indeed some degree of political affection, will join me in a campaign to bring to an end this ludicrous and ridiculous discrimination against the men of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for his kind remarks.</P>
      <P>A key element of the crime-fighting package announced by the Minister last December was the Government's decision to recruit over 1,000 additional gardaí in the period 1995 to 1997.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new competition to recruit 1,050 Garda trainees to cater for requirements until the end of 1977 was advertised in the national press on 10 April, 1994.  The competition, which is being run by the Civil Service Commission, is open to both men and women. There is no restriction on the number of either sex to be recruited within that 1,050 figure.  Successfuly candidates, whether male or female, will be called in order of merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible to be considered for appointment to the Garda Síochána applicants must be at least 18 and under 26 years of age on 1 April, 1994, be not <Col N="812" /> less than five feet, nine inches in the case of men and five feet, five inches in the case of women, have achieved at least Grade D in five subjects in the Leaving Certificate or equivalent.  Candidates who intend sitting this year's Leaving Certificate examination will be eligible to apply and results obtained by 1 September, 1994 will be taken into account. Candidates must also be of good character and be certified by the Garda surgeon to be in good health, of sound constitution and fit physically and mentally to perform the duties of a member of the force.  Incidentally, Deputy Shatter was incorrect when he stated in February last that the regulations obscurely require that both men and women be built in proportion to their height.  That requirement of proportionality applies only in the case of men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State deserves a special award for keeping a straight face when he says that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past Ministers for Justice have consulted with the Garda authorities on the criteria for eligibility to become a member of the Garda Síochána. The Garda authorities consider that the current criteria for eligibility are necessary to ensure that the candidates selected are suitable for the duties of the force and the Minister is disposed to be guided by them on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that Deputy Shatter has raised the question of the different height requirements for male and female candidates in the past.  Indeed this matter was raised on the Adjournment only last February.  I will again set out the position in the matter.  Regulation 5 of the Garda Síochána (Admission and Appointments) Regulations 1988 specifies that the Commissioner shall not admit a person as a trainee to the Garda Síochána, if a male, to be not less than five feet, nine inches in height and, if a female, to be not less than five feet, five inches in height.  The height differential between <Col N="813" /> the sexes is permitted &mdash; as I said in February last &mdash; by section 5 of the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985 which amends various other stipulations.</P>
    <P>I trust the Deputy would agree that equality considerations do not require that the physical requirements for a job must be identical for men and women. However, they do require the elimination of unjustified discrimination as between men and women.  The different height requirements for men and women in the Garda Síochána &mdash; which arise from the particular nature of the employment &mdash; are not contrary to equality law at present.  The practical reality in the case of the Garda Síochána is that, because of the nature of the employment, it is necessary that persons recruited should be of a minimum physical stature and physique to meet the day to day challenges they encounter in the course of an ordinary day's work.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Shatter says, I take his point completely, but unfortunately the work of the Garda Síochána is not confined merely to investigative procedures.  As the Deputy will know &mdash; while somebody may come in on the ground floor they might progress to investigating big frauds and the like. But much of the day to day work of the Garda involves heavy, physical, dangerous work, when they literally put their lives on the line.  Therefore, it is necessary that people be of a certain minimum strength.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to note that there <Col N="815" /> can be a bit of light entertainment in the Chamber from time to time, even if I suspect it had a serious intent.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the matter of moneys promised for marriage counselling services, in particular the funding of one marriage counselling service, the only non-denominational one of which I am aware in this city.  It is appropriate in the International Year of the Family, and also the year in which the Government has promised a referendum on divorce, that our attention should focus on the needs of the family and on the reality of marital breakdown.  The Minister and I have debated the issue of divorce on many occasions and we agree on the importance of support for marriage and the need for counselling and mediation services.  The Government agrees that we should support the institution of marriage while at the same time recognising the needs of people whose marriage have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately support for such services as marriage counselling and so on has been minimal and erratic.  In the budget a sum of £750,000 was promised to marriage counselling services but up to half-an-hour ago the marriage counselling service had heard nothing about money for it.  I plead with the Minister to provide a breakdown of the allocation of these money for the various agencies. Can the marriage counselling service plan according to its pre-budget submission? I accept the Minister is serious in his intent in this regard and there must be some explanation for the delay in providing this allocation.  The Minister is aware of the work of the marriage counselling service, the cost to the Government of which is a £12,000 Eastern Health Board grant and a £25,000 per annum special budget allocation during the past three years.  The organisation is greatful for this allocation but it is not enough.  Following the budget allocation the organisation increased its counselling hours, doubled its out-postings, recruited <Col N="816" /> a new chief executive officer, developed new services, trained more counsellors, recruited additional staff and acquired more premises.  It is updating its services so that more people can avail of the service. If it received the amount sought in its pre-budget submission it would be able to reduce its extensive waiting lists and extend its services nationwide.</P>
    <P>This organisation which has been in existance for the past 31 years is highly regarded.  I was a member of the board of it some years ago and it has a highly trained staff.  Every politician knows the effects of marital discord and relationship difficulties.  Anything we can do to alleviate those difficulties and any support we can give to such an agency will result in the alleviation of some of those difficulties.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not a solution to marital breakdown.  Our aim is to try to help those people who are experiencing difficulty. Obviously, we cannot focus on a one end solution for a certain number of people.  The Minister said he is concerned about the level of mediation services and is supportive of them but verbal support is not sufficient.  Those agencies need money.  Even if they cannot have the money now they need to know when, or if, they will receive it.</P>
    <P>Under normal circumstances the agency would know in January what money would be available for the year. They are concerned that since January they have heard nothing from the Minister despite many attempts to ascertain what is happening.  I hope there will be a positive response from the Minister and that this agency, and others involved in marriage counselling services, will know what the future holds for them and how much of their funding they will have to garner through cake sales and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for the tabling of this motion is that there seems to be a delay in allocating Exchequer funding to marriage counselling services in 1994.  I <Col N="817" /> do not agree with that basis and propose to give the reasons for my views in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out the background to the substantially increased funding of £750,000 that the Government has made available for marriage counselling this year.  Up to now the grants to marriage counselling services were administered by the Department of Health through the health boards and, from time to time, supplementary grants were paid by the Department of Social Welfare.  Grants paid to the various organisations providing marriage counselling services were paid on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and there was neither a formal procedure for evaluating the requirements of the various organisations concerned nor was there any central departmental responsibility for the funding of marriage counselling services.</P>
      <P>There has been little increase over the years in the amounts provided to the various organisation.  In effect, the amounts have been static and there has been no particular centralisation of decision making in the process with several Departments involved at any one time.  In addition to the Departments of Health and Social Welfare being involved, the Department of Justice was also involved, if only indirectly, from the point of view of its responsibility for the State's family mediation service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Equality and Law Reform I took over responsibility for, among other matters, the family mediation service, and Exchequer funding of marriage guidance and counselling services in addition to legal aid and reform of family law.  In all of these important areas I am engaged in implementing a comprehensive programme of legislative and administrative measures of protection and support for couples who, for one reason or another are in difficulties with their marriage.  The funding for counselling services is an earnest of mine and of the Government in endeavouring to assist marriage counselling <Col N="818" /> services in 1994.  It represents more than a two-fold increase over the total paid last year.</P>
    <P>Work of immense value is being done by a number of voluntary organisations in this area.  One of the most effective ways to help those experiencing marital difficulties is to give practical assistance to the voluntary organisations by way of proper funding.  A particular aim of the increased funding this year is to give a boost to the organisations with a view to enabling them, if possible, to expand and develop their services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that marriage guidance and counselling is a new subhead in my Department's Vote, and there are technical Government accounting procedures which require that payment of grants in this area must await the passing of my Department's Vote.  That Vote will come up for discussion during this Dáil session.  However, I can assure the House that this is not giving rise to any particular delay in the payment of grant aid in 1994 to the organisations in question. There is also a difference between arrangements for payment this year and previous years in that more detailed information is being required of applicants for State funding not only because of the amounts involved but also because of the need for organisations to demonstrate how increases in funding will be used and to the best advantage possible. My Department has been engaged in very fruitful discussions with the main organisations in this area, to inform them of the new arrangements.  Special forms of application have been devised in the light of those discussions and issued to the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department has not received complaints from any of the organisations concerned regarding delays in making payments.  The information available to me is that in previous years these organisations were paid moneys normally in the latter half of the year.  As soon as my Department's Estimate has been cleared, I aim, in suitable cases, to pay at least 50 <Col N="819" /> per cent of the amounts approved to the organisations concerned and I intend that payments will be made quarterly thereafter.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree, in the light of what I said, that my Department is following all necessary financial procedures <Col N="820" /> in this matter is determined to assist organisations as best as possible and is ensuring that all moneys are disbursed in a fair and equitable manner in the interest of the community which the counselling organisations are serving.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 15 April 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 42, 58, 75, 92, 104, 108, 111, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 156 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>State funding for medical and related research is channelled through the Health Research Board, which carries the statutory responsibility for promoting, conducting or commissioning medical and epidemiological research. The board has funded considerable research into birth defects, especially neural tube defects, and some of this research is still in progress.  This research is set out in detail in a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report.  Further research proposals in this area would, of course be considered by the board on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In view of the specific statutory responsibility of the Health Research Board in regard to research it would not be appropriate for me to initiate research on this matter.  I should point out that I increased the board's allocation by 30 per cent in this year's estimates.</P>
      <P>Information on birth defects is available from a number of sources: registers operate in the Eastern Health Board area and in Galway; the birth notification scheme collects information on birth defects which are apparent before a new born baby is discharged from hospital and information would also be available from the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme in respect of babies with birth defects who were subsequently treated in an acute hospital.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I consider that it would be more appropriate to consider how existing sources of information on birth defects can be developed rather than to establish a separate register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to international comparisons, it must be borne in mind that a <Col N="669" /> crude comparison of incidence rates can be misleading given differences in national policies on abortion as well as significant variations in birth rates among older women between countries.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the provision of services for children with birth defects is in no way adversely affected by the lack of full availability of information on the incidence of these defects.</P>
    <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioners' services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs would justify this.  This special provision is intended to ensure that any person in genuine need of a medical card will receive one.  In view of this, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents' means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Tabular Statement.</P>
    <P>Research on Birth Defects.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 the Health Research Board has funded research by Dr. P. Kirke to test the hypothesis that periconceptional supplementation with either a multivitamin preparation alone or folic acid alone can reduce the risk of neural tube defects.  The work has been conducted in association with Trinity College and since <Col N="670" /> late 1992 has been co-funded by the National Institute of Health USA.  This research constitutes the board's main commitment at present in the area of research into birth defects.  The following publications have resulted from this work.</P>

      <P>The Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, provides that a &ldquo;producer&rdquo;, as defined by the Act, is liable for damages in respect of personal injury or damage to property caused by a defective product.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, general practitioners are not considered as producers, and are, therefore, not liable for damages arising from defective generic or other drugs.  The question of indemnity for general practitioners in this context, therefore, does not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of child psychological services in the context of the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.  These services are a key component of the comprehensive range of community-based child care and family support services currently being put in place to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to respond effectively to the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and attention.  The Deputies will be pleased to learn that last year I approved the creation of over 20 new posts in the child psychological services. My Department is currently in consultation with the health boards in relation to their priorities for funding from the additional special moneys made available by the Government this year for new service developments in the child care area.  I expect that a further strengthening of the child psychological services will take place in that context.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to issuing further patients' charters, which will be based on legal reform where necessary, to cover groups such as children, expectant mothers, the elderly, the mentally ill and people with a physical or mental handicap.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 108 hip replacement operations have been carried out at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast on behalf of the Southern Health Board. The total cost of these operations, excluding transport, was IR£280,300 which is within the contracted price.  The average cost per patient was £2,595. However, the contract was structured on a sliding scale related to the volume of cases to be carried out.  This was to ensure that the board did not have a liability for the full contracted price of £500,650 for 300 operations in the event of fewer patients availing of the services.  The total cost of airlifting the 108 patients to Belfast was £56,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of nine hospitals providing orthopaedic services in the Republic <Col N="676" /> were approached by the Southern Health Board with a view to carrying out the work.  A price of £4,600 per procedure plus transport costs was quoted by one hospital but this was subsequently withdrawn. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the price contracted with the Royal Victoria Hospital was competitive.  None of the other hospitals contacted by the board was in a position to take on the additional workload at the time.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Southern Health Board that the balance of the procedures will be carried out during 1994 within their existing resources.  The board is confident that these procedures will be carried out locally due to the availability of improved theatre facilities in St. Mary's, Gurranebraher for which I have provided the necessary capital resources.  The health board is also seeking to fill two locum orthopaedic surgeon posts to manage the additional workload.</P>

      <P>Information in relation to the overdraft facility available in respect of the last 12 months, and the balances due up to approved allocation, for each health board and voluntary hospital are shown in the tables which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards overdraft, my Department reviews the position on a quarterly basis, in consultation with the major banks. My formal approval is required by health boards and a small number of hospitals to the overdraft facility.  In the case of the majority of the voluntary hospitals, <Col N="678" /> the facility level is a matter for agreement between each hospital and its bankers. However, the banks will only approve facilities which are consistent with the approved expenditure allocation notified by my Department.  The overdraft levels indicated represent the maximum levels approved.  Overdraft, by its nature, is a fluctuating source of working capital, and actual overdrawn balances may fluctuate considerably from one month-end to another due to timing differences in cash inflows and outflows.</P>
    <P>The amounts owed by my Department to individual agencies are calculated at the end of each calender year.  The position in respect of each of the agencies in question as at 31 December 1993 is shown in the tables.  It is intended to eliminate these balances using the normal annual balances provision available to my Department, together with the additional £100 million injection announced in the budget.  I anticipate that formal agreements with each agency in relation to the refinancing package will be in place shortly, which will allow the clearance of all of these balances within the current month.  Balances which arise at the end of 1994 should equate with the agencies' approved level of normal working capital, and these will be cleared early in January 1995.  This arrangement will continue for future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties at the Blindcraft workshops, Inchicore, Dublin 8 which operates under the aegis of the Board for Employment of the Blind.  The workshops have been experiencing serious financial difficulties for a number of years due to highly competitive trading conditions in bed manufacture which is the mainstay of Blindcraft's business.</P>
      <P>The board receives a capitation payment of £154 per week in respect of each of its 32 blind workers.  However, the financial position has deteriorated to such an extent that my Department also has to provide additional deficit funding of approximately £250,000 per annum.  In effect the cost to the State of employing each blind worker is nearly £16,000.</P>
      <P>Last year, I requested the National Council for the Blind of Ireland &mdash; NCBI &mdash; one of the leading voluntary organisations catering for the blind, to offer suggestions on how the difficulties at Blindcraft could be overcome.</P>
      <P>The NCBI investigated a variety of alternatives, in co-operation with the trade unions concerned, including visits to a number of special workshops for the blind in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The NCBI submitted outline proposals last August which formed the basis of detailed discussions with officials of my Department, culminating in a plan which I received on 24 January.  I have accepted the plan which involves NCBI taking responsibility for the management of the workshops for an initial period of three years, during which time new product lines and vocational training programmes will be introduced and there will be a concerted sales and marketing campaign.  European Union funding has been promised to assist with the introduction of training and new product lines.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, before the plan could be put fully in place strike action was taken by members of the National League of the Blind in furtherance of a pay claim by the blind workers.  Following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, the workers concerned returned to work on 31 March and their claim is being referred to the Labour Court.  I hope that this will lead to an early resolution of the issues in dispute and the full implementation of the plan as, otherwise, the entire future of the workshops is at risk.  I intend to finalise the composition of the board when the industrial relations difficulties have been resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are <Col N="685" /> prescribed in respect of these particular illnesses.  The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that persons with a long term disability or disease which is treatable by drug therapy would not have to suffer expense in order to obtain their required drugs and medicines.  The illnesses designated for inclusion in the scheme at its inception were those considered appropriate to this objective at the time.</P>
      <P>The needs of people with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long term medical condition such as motor neurone disease, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to the report of the Commission on Health Funding which contained a number of recommendations regarding arrangements for the supply or subsidisation of drugs and medicines to patients, including those covered by the long term illness scheme. These recommendations centred on the <Col N="686" /> principle that there should be one integrated scheme of State provision where a limited range of drugs would be provided free of charge to medical card patients and at subsidised prices to other patients.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of community drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from long term medical conditions.  Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the number or range of illnesses currently covered by the long term illness scheme or to introduce restrictions on the range of drugs reimbursable on the lines proposed by the commission report.</P>

This policy is in line with the recommendations of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report &mdash; Development of Hospital Maternity Services &mdash; which examined in detail the objectives of health care in relation to maternity services.  It is generally accepted that this policy has contributed to the marked decrease in the level of maternal, perinatal and infant mortality. I am pleased to say that the annual State of the World's Children report from UNICEF seems to indicate that Ireland is now the safest country in the world for women giving birth, with a mortality rate of two per 100,000 births &mdash; the lowest of the 145 countries reported upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that at present, health boards are experiencing difficulties in <Col N="687" /> providing services for home confinements. This situation has arisen because of the practice of hospital confinement over the past 20-25 years and the consequent unavailability in some areas of experienced practitioners in home delivery.  Where private midwives are engaged, the fee payable by health boards is £58.40.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, regardless of departmental policy and professional advice, some women will choose a domiciliary birth.  I am anxious that appropriate provision be made to cater for their needs. Health boards are being asked to reexamine their arrangements for domiciliary births.</P>
    <P>A review of the maternity and infant care scheme is nearing completion.  I intend to review current policy in relation to all aspects of the scheme, including domiciliary births, when I receive the report of the review group.</P>

      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1990, prohibit smoking in designated areas and facilities, including certain offices occupied by Government Departments and semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor introduced a &ldquo;voluntary code of practice&rdquo; on smoking in the workplace in 1992, following recommendations from the Consultative Committee on Smoking in the Workplace.

    <P>I recently accepted the recommendations of the reconvened Consultative Committee on Smoking in the Workplace, that the voluntary code should be redrafted and promoted more comprehensively.  I will be announcing measures in this regard in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time. However, at all times, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  The situation is exacerbated at times through, for instance, major accidents or epidemics such as influenza.  Some accident and emergency departments, particularly in Dublin, have experienced difficulties from time to time because of the number of elderly people requiring attention.  The difficulty here has not primarily been the provision of acute hospital beds but of insufficient stepdown facilities for patients in need of a different level of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of the type to which I have referred.  In December 1993 I allocated a further £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the <Col N="689" /> accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.  This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in stepdown accommodation more appropriate to their condition.  This action helped significantly to relieve the seasonal pressures on the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The change which I have recently announced in relation to the charge for attendance at accident and emergency departments is intended to create an incentive for patients to attend their general practitioner in the first instance, in cases where their condition would be most appropriately treated at this level. I am hopeful that this change will help to ease the pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Following the publication in September 1991 of the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, a second group, the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, which was also chaired by Professor David Kennedy, monitored and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of these reports' &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations.  This group found that the implementation of the &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations was broadly satisfactory, although it was recognised that to put these fully into effect would take some time.</P>
    <P>Certain recommendations required the provision of additional resources and, as such, must be considered in the context of individual hospital's development priorities and the funds available for improvements throughout the health services as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <P>The provision of educational facilities for children with autism, in the first instance, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended that educational provision for children with autism, who have been identified in accordance with accepted criteria, should continue to be made in special schools for pupils with emotional and behaviourial disorders, other types of special schools and ordinary schools, as appropriate. The committee did not recommend the provision of a dedicated special school facility for children with autism.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that more recently representatives of the Irish Society for Autism met with officials of the Department of Education and put the case to them for such a facility.  This proposal is being examined by the Department of Education at present.  I am awaiting the outcome of this examination.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="692" /> propose to take Questions Nos.36, 80 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The delays in payments by health boards and voluntary hospitals were a reflection of the cash difficulties of these agencies, which arose as a result of expenditure overruns incurred over a number of years.  My Department does not delay payments to agencies, and releases funds in accordance with an agreed profile of approved expenditure.</P>
      <P>The extended credit period reflected by these delayed payments will be eliminated in the context of the £100 million refinancing package announced in the 1994 budget.  In this regard my Department has contacted the health agencies outlining the terms and conditions under which each board's share of the additional funds will be released.</P>
      <P>Each agency's share of the additional cash has been determined on the basis of reducing the agency's short term debt to a level consistent with the specific working capital criteria set out in the proposal. One such criterion is that agencies are required to ensure that all trade creditors are paid within 30 days of statement date. Other criteria include a predetermined maximum level of overdraft, and a requirement that payments to other service providers, such as nursing homes and voluntary organisations are paid when due.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions include an absolute requirement for each agency to manage its cash flow within the total approved cash provision notified; to maintain an appropriate level of short term indebtedness, or working capital, within a specific limit and to ensure that expenditure is within the approved allocation.</P>
      <P>Compliance with strict reporting arrangements is also a requirement, and agencies must also observe enhanced accountability requirements which are contained in a Bill which I will introduce in the House in the near future.</P>
      <P>My Department has sought written acceptance of the terms and conditions from each agency.  It is intended to release the funding during the months of April and May 1994.</P>

The number of people aged 65 and over in the Inishowen area is 3,208 &mdash; source 1991 census.

      <P>The 1991 census of population figures for Inishowen indicate that there has been an 11.5 per cent decline in the elderly population in the area on the previous census period.

As a result the North Western Health Board does not perceive a need for an extension to the community nursing unit in Buncrana.</P>
      <P>I might add that the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 last September provides the health board with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly in the Inishowen area locally and flexibly.</P>

      <P>The appointment of doctors to the general medical services scheme and the filling of vacancies are matters for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board in accordance with the provision of an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation.  I have been informed by the Southern Health Board that in June 1993 a general practitioner in Drimoleague participating in the GMS scheme resigned from the scheme.  The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board decided that the vacant post should be filled by open competition as provided for under the provisions of the above agreement.  The post was advertised in August 1993 and following the competitive process a doctor was <Col N="698" /> offered the post in the following December.</P>
      <P>The doctor confirmed his acceptance of the offer in January 1994.  However, in March the doctor informed the board that he would not be taking up the position. In such circumstances and in accordance with the above agreement, the board has now offered the post to another doctor who has indicated that he will be in a position to take up the position in July.  In the interim, the board will continue to ensure that GMS patients have access to the full range of general practitioner services.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board is responsible in the first instance for the delivery of psychiatric services in County Roscommon. This includes mental health services currently provided at St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, which the Government has recently decided to adapt for use as a prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the patients of St. Patrick's Hospital, their relatives and the staff working in the hospital that there will be full consultation with all concerned as the hospital is converted to its new use.  With this in mind the Government has decided that alternative accommodation <Col N="699" /> will be provided for patients residing in the hospital or attending it on a daily basis.  As far as possible and with the best interests of patients in mind, these facilities will be provided in or close to the town of Castlerea.  The final decision regarding patient transfers will be based on clinical need and the wishes of the patients themselves.  The Western Health Board is currently preparing its proposals for the provision of alternative facilities and will be liaising closely with my Department and the Department of Justice in relation to the resources needed to effect the transfer of patients and staff from the hospital and the time scale for such transfers.</P>
    <P>Existing staff will continue to care for the patients in their new locations and there will be no compulsory job losses as a result of the Government decision to change the use of St. Patrick's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The service is free to all women in health centres where it is carried out. General practitioners and family planning clinics who carry out cervical screening would as a rule charge women who wish to be screened.</P>
      <P>A working party was established in 1988 to review the cervical smear testing service.  This group produced a very constructive interim report.  A commitment was given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the working group on cervical screening would be reconvened.  The first meeting of the reconvened group took place on Friday 27 November 1992 with the following terms of reference: to review the implementation of the recommendations of the interim report of the Working Party on Cervical Screening; to review the general efficacy and cost effectiveness of the operation of the present systems and to consider what further cost effective improvements can be made.</P>
      <P>The working group is chaired by the chief medical officer of my Department and includes experts from various fields.

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 49 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>The causes of suicide are complex but are consistent internationally.  Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.  In response to the problem of suicide the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed.</P>
      <P>Research into issues such as suicide is primarily a matter for the Health Research Board and that body has carried out a number of studies in this area. This research has tended to concentrate on suicide rates and on the accuracy of reporting systems.</P>
      <P>In order to try to reduce the extent of suicide my Department is contributing towards the costs of a pilot project on attempted suicide in Cork to be carried out by staff of the Southern Health Board.  The aim of this project is to reduce the recurrence of attempted suicides and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also providing financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning, which will take place in University College Cork from 31 August to 3 September, 1994.  This symposium will be attended by between 200 and 300 researchers from all over Europe who are working in the area of the causes of suicide and the prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour.  The expert pool of knowledge available at this seminar will, I am confident, greatly assist our <Col N="702" /> understanding of this very serious problem.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 55, 87 and 135 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1985, a programme of voluntary linked HIV testing has been in operation. Under this programme, HIV testing is carried out by the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD on behalf of the Department of Health and the results are analysed by the Department as a basis for monitoring the prevalence of the infection.  The data collected under this programme shows that the annual percentage rate of increase for each of the eight years sought is as follows: percentage <Col N="705" /> increase (over previous year)&mdash; 1986, 47.38 per cent; 1987, 26.54 per cent; 1988, 16.99 per cent; 1989, 14.65 per cent; 1990, 12.33 per cent; 1991, 13.33 per cent; 1992, 13.58 per cent; 1993, 10.36 per cent.</P>
    <P>The statistic for 1986 is artificially high as the HIV test was only introduced the previous year.  Overall the rate of increase is declining.  The decrease can possibly be attributed to a number of factors as follows: increased awareness of the risk of infection in the community generally as a result of public awareness campaigns; targeted awareness campaigns and sponsorship of action by voluntary groups; and targeting of specific groups such as drug abusers with methadone maintenance programmes to help users lead less chaotic lifestyles and needle exchange programmes to reduce the risk of infection through the sharing of contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>The most recent HIV statistics show that over 57 per cent of cases of HIV infection are drug-abuse related.  The Department of Health is currently developing the HIV data base for the purpose of programme planning and evaluation.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, the Department of Health has now extended the programme through anonymous, unlinked HIV surveillance.</P>
    <P>The first phase of this programme commenced in October 1992 in maternity hospital units in general hospitals, under which blood, which is surplus to specified clinical requirements, is batch-tested for HIV infection.  It is proposed to extend the programme initially to STD clinics and to hospital out-patient departments during 1994.</P>
    <P>This form of surveillance is designed to provide a more comprehensive and accurate estimate of the prevalence of HIV infection in the community at large &mdash; and in particular to ascertain the level of infection amongst the heterosexual population &mdash; as a basis for a more systematic and targeted approach to the development and provision of services and programmes at all levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Voluntary, linked testing will continue to be available as an important element in the programme for the diagnosis, care and management of individuals.</P>
    <P>The broad headings under which specific action has been taken are in accordance with the areas identified by the National AIDS Strategy Committee as follows: prevention, care and management, HIV-AIDS surveillance and anti-discrimination.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated the strategies for dealing with HIV-AIDS and drug abuse are closely interlinked.  Part of the strategy for preventing the spread of HIV involves targeting particular at-risk groups including homosexuals as well as drug abusers.  To this end I have allocated funding to a number of health boards to implement outreach projects, in association with voluntary organisations, aimed at reducing the spread of the infection amongst the homosexual community.  In addition, services have been provided at secondary and tertiary care levels to care for and manage persons who have contracted HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>I have secured the provision of substantial additional funding to give effect to the most important recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a total amount of £4.96 million was made available, in addition to the normal allocations for health agencies, to fund the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and in 1994 a further £3.4 million has been made available to continue the development of services in this area.</P>
    <P>Progress with the implementation of the recommendations under these headings is reviewed on a regular basis and a meeting of the National AIDS Strategy Committee under my chairmanship is scheduled for later this month.  This meeting will review any relevant issues in the HIV-AIDS area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in developing programmes and services to respond to the problem of HIV-AIDS and that the National AIDS Strategy Committee is the appropriate forum to respond to the <Col N="707" /> evolving epidemiology of the disease in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that orthopaedic treatment was one of the problem areas targeted under the 1993 waiting list initiative and that an additional 200 orthopaedic procedures, including 103 hip replacement operations, were carried out in the Western Health Board area in 1993.  I am pleased to say that the special allocation of £10 million announced in the budget will enable further inroads to be made in these areas.  The principal objective will continue to be the elimination of waiting times in excess of 12 months for adults in the problem specialties and six months for children in ENT and ophthalmology.</P>
      <P>A detailed review of the 1993 initiative has been undertaken and my Department is discussing the proposed 1994 arrangements with the individual health agencies.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in pursuing a policy of diverting patients from a predominantly institutionalised form of care to more appropriate community based care facilities.  Each health board has submitted detailed plans to my Department on strategies to be adopted in order to accelerate the development of this policy up to 1997.  I am confident that the funds to be made available to my Department under the health commitments of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will ensure that continued development of community psychiatric services.</P>

However, it has been decided to decentralise the General Register Office, which is responsible for records of births, mariages and deaths, to Roscommon town. The first step is the computerisation of the records held in the office to provide the basis for a proper service to the public throughout the country.  This work will be carried out in Roscommon and will provide employment for a substantial number of people from the area for the next two or three years.  After the office is decentralised a facility for genealogists will be maintained in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 68 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Estimates indicate that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer disease is between 20,000 and 30,000.  As Minister for Health, I have stated my desire to publish a Charter of Rights for the Elderly, building on the successful Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients which was launched in 1992.  I have asked the National Council for the Elderly for their views on the contents of a charter and have now received their submission.  The publication of this charter later this year, will be another important development in the care of our dependent elderly population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation.  The report was adopted as official government policy for the elderly.  Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of <Col N="713" /> the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care and respite services has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.</P>
    <P>In 1994, funding is being made available to provide specialist services for those with dementia in south-east Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  It is hoped that these services will be in operation before the end of the year or early next year.  My Department is also considering a request from the Alzheimer Society towards the development of the valuable services of the society.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September, 1993, widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.</P>
    <P>The report <i>Caring without Limits</i> which was published by the Alzheimer Society in July last year provides an important insight into the lives of those who bear the brunt of Alzheimer disease &mdash; the carers.  I was pleased that my Department allocated a grant to the Alzheimer Society to enable this important research to be carried out.  This report reflects the views expressed in <i>The Years Ahead,</i> namely that if carers are to continue giving care without intolerable cost to their own lives, more assistance is required from the health services for their support.</P>
    <P>The Government has expanded the eligibility criteria for the carer's allowance in recognition of the burden on relatives of caring for dependent elderly people such as those with dementia.  As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes, and I will continue to <Col N="714" /> encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, orthodontic services are provided by all health boards to persons, including persons who are eligible for GMS services, who are assessed as being in need of such treatment. The service is provided under guidelines issued by my Department which sets out the priority to be given to certain orthodontic conditions.  In implementing their statutory remit, health boards apply the services to persons on the basis of the assessments which are initiated through the national school dental programmes and having regard to the time at which the person was assessed.  In the light of the needs of the orthodontic services a development plan for the health board orthodontic services has been prepared for implementation over the period of the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have already made considerable progress in implementing improvements in services.  A number of health boards have been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists. Apart from their own direct clinical involvement the consultant orthodontists are putting in place, or already have in place, training programmes in orthodontics for health board dental surgeons which will enable them to provide orthodontic treatment at secondary care level under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant orthodontist. This will enable health boards to significantly increase existing service levels <Col N="715" /> for secondary care orthodontic treatments.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the programme, health boards will be provided with such additional resources as may be necessary to enable them to fully develop their orthodontic services in accordance with the development plan.</P>

I understand that the figures for prescribing frequency in the scheme indicate that the use of this drug has increased; however, because of a significant reduction in price in 1993, this increase has not resulted in a similar increase in cost.</P>

No. 40 of 1993).  Both companies are engaged in the distribution of a range of products commonly referred to as health food products such as vitamins <Col N="716" /> and mineral supplements.  These products may be classified as either food supplements or medical preparations depending on a number of factors including the daily recommended intake.</P>
      <P>In the case of the first company referred to, its product range was originally judged to be in the category of food supplements, but this range is now expanding to include products deemed to be medical preparations.  The company, accordingly, in January 1994 made application for a licence under the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1993 and that application is currently under examination.  Similarly, in the case of the second company, a number of its products fall within the definition of medical preparations and it was granted a manufacturer's licence in March 1993.</P>
      <P>I have received no representations on this matter, although companies dealing in these products regularly meet with officials of my Department for advice and guidance in the classification of these products.  There are no proposals for any changes in this area at present.</P>

    <P>Patients are referred abroad for specialised procedures such as bone marrow transplant, heart-lung transplant, liver transplant under EC Regulations.  Referrals abroad for bone marrow transplants were necessary due to the shortfall in facilities for such operations at the National Centre of St. James's Hospital &mdash; Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  There were 26 bone marrow transplants carried out in St. James's Hospital and 16 carried out in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in 1993.</P>
    <P>Additional resources have been provided in recent years to allow upgrading of the unit at Crumlin and a second consultant paediatric oncologist post has recently been approved.  Work is also well under way on the new <Col N="718" /> oncology/haematology unit, incorporating the new bone marrow unit at St. James's Hospital.  These developments when complete should allow the National Centre at the two hospitals to deal with almost all such cases arising in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to liver transplants, the National Centre (Adults) at St. Vincent's Hospital was fully established last year and has achieved a high success rate. Twenty-one liver transplants were performed on 18 patients.  This followed a considerable investment in services and staff training in co-operation with the liver unit at Kings College Hospital, London.  The children's liver unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin is still under development and additional funds have been allocated in 1994 to enable it to be operational as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Developments such as these will allow Irish patients to be treated nearer to home and avoid serious disruptions associated with travel abroad for such treatments.  However, it must be accepted that it will not be possible to provide the resources necessary for all highly sophisticated surgical procedures to be made available in this country because of the high cost of such techniques. It will continue to be necessary to refer patients abroad for treatment in some cases.  The position regarding referral abroad is kept under regular review in my Department and improvements to specialist services will continue to be made as resources allow.</P>

      <P>All persons, irrespective of their coverage under either the GMS scheme or voluntary health insurance, are entitled to opt for public hospital treatment as a public patient or as a private patient. The objective of Government policy is to ensure equitable access to necessary care. This objective is being pursued firstly through the operation of controlled admission arrangements and secondly through the waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>Patients who opt for private care may not be admitted to a public bed, except where an emergency admission is necessary but private or semi-private accommodation is not available.  This system, which was introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> allows the relative accessibility of the service to each category of patient to be monitored, and remedial action to be taken where necessary.  This process of monitoring and review is an ongoing one.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative, which commenced in 1993 and has continued in 1994, has had a marked effect in increasing equitable access for public patients. This initiative is targeted exclusively towards public patients and resulted in a reduction of 37 per cent in the number of people awaiting admission between July and December 1993.</P>

      <P>The latest consultant manpower survey carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal on 1 January 1994 indicates that there is a total of 236 Surgical and 79 Obstetric/ Gynaecology permanent consultant posts filled in the public health services of which seven (3 per cent) and two (3 per cent) are filled by women respectively.  Of the overall total of permanent consultant posts, 1,065, some 172 (16 per cent) are filled by women.</P>

    <P>The contraction in in-patient numbers has occurred as a consequence of the increased provision of community-based facilities in the East Galway catchment area.  These include psychiatric day hospitals, out-patient clinics, community-based local residences and community workshops.  In the period 1989 to 1993, the number of staff working in these community-based facilities has increased from approximately 20 to 50. Such developments should be seen as positive in terms of an increase in the quality of care for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also note that while in-patient numbers have decreased, the staff/patient ratio in the hospital has in fact increased between 1989 and 1993.</P>
    <P>Any decision concerning the future of St. Bridget's Hospital is a matter for the <Col N="724" /> Western Health Board in the context of continued development of services for the mentally ill.</P>

      <Quest>the claw-back clause that was written into the contract on the sale of the Verolme Cork dockyard to Damen Shipping Limited in view of the fact that it does not appear that the company will deliver on the 450 jobs promised at the time of sale; if he will publish the contract that was agreed between both parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Verolme Cork Dockyard (in receivership) was sold by the receiver to Cork Dockyard Holdings Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of a Dutch company, Damen Shipyards, in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the sale agreement contained no reference to the achievement of specified job targets, it was hoped that <Col N="728" /> up to 450 jobs could be realised within five years if shipbuilding were to be developed at the yard, in addition to ship repairs.  While I share the sense of disappointment that these hopes have not been fulfilled, it must be said that following Damen's acquisition of the Yard, the European shipping industry underwent one of its cyclical downturns.  Furthermore, following the recent political changes in Eastern Europe, that region's large ship building and repair industry has, for the first time, been aggressively pursuing Western business.  These yards have gained business because very low labour costs, combined with newly introduced Western management, have given them a major competitive advantage. These market changes, which could not have been anticipated when Damen purchased the Cork yard, have precluded the development of the yard as originally envisaged.  It may be that the effect of these changes will be felt in the long term.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that as the sale was a private one, I am not in a position to publish details of the contract.  I can, however, say that the contract contains an anti asset-stripping clause designed to inhibit the sale of the yard or the sale of major items of equipment for a period of five years from the date of sale.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department has carried out any research in relation to the likely yield from capital gains tax which would transfer the full capital gains from development of rezoned land in local authority development plans to the Exchequer.</Quest>

      </QRef>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by pointing out that the capital gains tax (CGT) code already contains special measures to ensure that those who realise gains on development land pay a significant proportion of the gain to the Exchequer.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, gains are generally chargeable to CGT at a rate of 40 per cent after indexation relief, and, following the alignment of the CGT rate with the standard rate of corporation tax, a similar tax treatment applies to gains made by a company in the course of its trade. However, in the case of gains made on development land, the application of indexation relief is restricted.  It applies only to the portion of the value of the land at the time of acquisition that reflected the land's &ldquo;current use value&rdquo;, i.e. the value of the land calculated on the assumption that it was at that time, and would remain, unlawful to carry out development on the land, other than development of a minor nature.  As a general rule, these special provisions apply where the land is sold for over £15,000.  Accordingly, the effective rate of tax for development land gains can be appreciably greater than for other assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any studies that would indicate the likely yield from a tax regime which would transfer the full capital gains from development of rezoned land in local authority development plans to the Exchequer.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the yield from taxation in this area is a function of <Col N="730" /> the level of disposals, and that this would itself be strongly influenced by the level of tax.  A regime that transferred the full gain from the disposal of any asset to the Exchequer would, the Deputy will appreciate, remove the commercial rationale for such disposals.  In those circumstances, and bearing in mind that tax arises on ongoing disposals, it is unlikely that an additional tax yield would accrue from such a measure.</P>

      <P>The existing child benefit scheme provides for payment of benefit at double the normal rate for each child, where three or more children are born together.  A special once-off grant of £300 is payable on the birth of triplets and £400 where four or more children are born together.  Last year I also introduced a special once-off grant of £200 on the birth of twins.  These arrangements give recognition within the child benefit scheme, to the special nature of these births and the additional costs associated with them.</P>
      <P>The extension of the provision of double the normal rate of child benefit in the event of the birth of twins would have substantial financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Christmas bonus is payable to recipients of long term social welfare payments such as pensioners and people who are long term unemployed or incapacitated. The payment last Christmas amounted to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments, subject to a minimum bonus payment of £20 for the first time. The bonus cost £33 million, an increase of £2 million on last year, and was paid in the first week of December at post offices and local offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the bonus to include families in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy, where they do not already qualify, would have cost implications which would have to be examined in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>Assistance to families where there are twins or other multiple births is available in a number of ways through the social welfare system.  The monthly rates of child benefit have been increased substantially in the past two years.  From September next, the higher child benefit rate will be increased from £23 to £25 and will apply to the third and subsequent children, instead of the fourth child on. A special grant of £200 was introduced last year for mothers on the birth of twins. This new payment complements the existing grant of £300 for multiple births of 3 or more children.  In addition, the family income supplement, which is designed specifically for families at work on low pay, has been improved in recent years through significant increases in the earnings thresholds.</P>

      <P>In 1993, I extended the special grant of £100 per child, which is payable <Col N="732" /> on the birth of triplets or more, to include twin births.  This grant is subject to a maximum payment of £400 for four or more children.</P>
      <P>Where a multiple birth involves three or more children, child benefit is paid at double the normal rate for each child so long as at least three of the children remain qualified.</P>
      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme, which I introduced in 1990, assists recipients on low incomes with meeting the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  The scheme is administered by the Health Boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The allowance payable is £35 for each child attending primary school and £50 for each child attending secondary school.  This year the scheme will commence on 1 June and will run until 30 September 1994.  Application should be made to the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme also allows health boards to make payments to eligible people where they have exceptional needs.  These payments are made to meet a once-off need and each case is decided on its individual merits.</P>
      <P>The introduction of additional measures to cover the cost of school expenses in the case of multiple births would have significant expenditure implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

Subsequently, on 21 March 1994, at the first meeting of the Paris Commission PRAM Group (Programmes and Measures), Ireland, Denmark and Iceland made strong statements condemning the UK's non-compliance with Recommendation 93/5 as it relates to the THORP plant at Sellafield.  However, the UK and France confirmed their reservations on this particular Recommendation.</P>

      <P>In relation to the standard of facilities available and the question of privacy for mothers, I understand that ongoing improvements have been made to accommodate in most units and that every effort is made to ensure that there is a maximum amount of privacy afforded to mothers. Many of the larger maternity units provide individual labour rooms, and in the relatively few cases where labour rooms are shared, curtains are used to allow privacy for patients.  These measures would be in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission for the Status of Women report of 1993 concerning single delivery units and privacy for maternity patients.  I am satisfied that the overall quality of service to mothers and babies in maternity hospitals and units is of a very high standard.</P>
      <P>In relation to family planning, health boards are required to provide a comprehensive family planning service.  I am aware that the level and range of services is variable in health board areas.  Future policy in relation to the provision of a comprehensive family planning service will be addressed in the health strategy document which will be published in the near future.</P>

      <P>A range of diseases can be transmitted by domestic pets such as dogs, cats and birds.  These are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Toxocariasis &mdash; caused by the ingestion of toxicara eggs passed in the excrement of infected cats and dogs.</P>
      <P>Toxoplasmosis &mdash; caused by the ingestion of infective eggs in the excrement of infected cats.  This disease can also be passed via the placenta and can cause congenital defects in a developing foetus.</P>
      <P>Psittacosis &mdash; Parrot Fever &mdash; caused by the inhalation of the infective agent from infected birds.</P>
      <P>Cat Scratch Disease &mdash; caused by a localised lymph node infection which occurs following scratching or skin puncture by a cat.</P>
      <P>Rabies &mdash; caused by an infected domestic dog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other diseases such as brucellosis and leptospirosis may rarely be caused by <Col N="744" /> domestic animals though usually by wild animals.  As regards preventing transmission of these diseases it is recommended that in homes with domestic pets the following precautions be taken: all vegetables should be thoroughly cleaned before consumption; all meat should be thoroughly cooked; dispose of all animal droppings promptly and hygienically; maintain pets in good condition and vaccinate where indicated.  Maintaining vigilance at ports and points of entry to Ireland is necessary in the prevention of rabies.</P>

    <P>Comparable information is not available for 1990.</P>
    <P>During this period the following additional services were put in place:</P>
    <P>1991: 20 residential places in Cheeverstown House.  In addition the commissioning of places in Áras Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo, freed up a further 12 places in centres in the Eastern region.</P>
    <P>1992: 63 residential places, 20 respite places, 20 emergency service places, six disturbed service places &mdash; including the replacement of Unit B. St. Loman's Hospital.</P>
    <P>1993: 30 residential &mdash; respite places, ten emergency service places and the commissioning of residential services at the Daughters of Charity, Navan Road, Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not clear, however, from this information the proportion of those on waiting lists who require immediate placement and those who, with the provision of improved support services could continue to live an independent life in the community.  At present my Department is involved in the establishment of a national database on the needs of persons with a mental handicap.  This database will provide information on an ongoing basis, on the number of people with mental handicap in each region, the number in services and awaiting services, <Col N="751" /> their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that an additional £12.5 million has been made available in 1994 for the further development of services for persons with a mental handicap and their families, which will become part of the on-going annual funding of the service.</P>
    <P>Of the £12.5 million I have made available, £2.5 million is to strengthen the funding base of some agencies and to meet some essential service needs; £10 million has been allocated to the health board regions to provide a very broad range of additional services from which the eastern region has been allocated £3.56 million.</P>
    <P>Additional services to be provided in the eastern region include: 78 residential places; 230 days care places; 16 respite care places; ten emergency places; further development and expansion of the home support services.  The additional residential and day services which will be put in place in 1994 should be adequate to meet the needs of all priority cases on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I have asked the health boards to instruct the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees to ensure that the additional funds are targeted to make the maximum impact on the needs of those wait-listed for services.</P>

      <P>There are a number of options open to children with disabilities leaving school. These include further education, open employment, mainstream training centres, special training centres, community workshops, temporary employment schemes, supported employment and day care.  There are no specific workshop places dedicated for children leaving school.  Access to places is determined on the basis of a person's vocational needs, <Col N="752" /> usually following assessment by the National Rehabilitation Board &mdash; NRB.</P>
      <P>In 1993, there were 3,753 European Social Fund &mdash; ESF &mdash; supported training places for people with disabilities.  An NRB survey in 1990 identified 689 non-ESF supported training places and 2,920 sheltered workshop places for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government is making a total of £12.5 million available in 1994 for the development of services for people with mental handicap which will become part of the on-going annual funding of these services.  Of this £12.5 million, £2.5 million is to strengthen the funding base of some agencies and to meet essential service needs.  Ten million pounds has been allocated to the health board regions for the development of new services.  From this, £3.5 million has been provided to enable up to 700 day places for a wide variety of community services to be put in place.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the issue raised by the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware I commenced <Col N="754" /> the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 on 1 September 1993.  The Act was accompanied by a number of regulations which also came into effect on the same date.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Subvention Regulations, 1993, a nursing home proprietor may not seek an additional payment from a person who is in receipt of a health board subvention for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in nursing homes.  A service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in most nursing homes under the regulations includes bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person, incontinence wear and bedding, laundry service and aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>
      <P>Cases where nursing home proprietors have sought additional fees for incontinence wear should be brought to the attention of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>Persons with medical cards in nursing homes before 1 September 1993 are entitled to apply for subvention under the Act and could be advised to apply to their local health board.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  Assessment is based on gross income less PRSI deductions.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the chief executive officers have introduced a number of measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment.  Weekly payments made under the FÁS social employment scheme and the new community employment <Col N="756" /> programme are excluded in assessing income.  Also, persons who held a medical card while on the live register are allowed retain the medical card for a period of two years after taking up employment if they qualify for family income supplement.  There are also special provisions for people participating in certain other schemes targeted at the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>On a final note I would like to point out that it is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition such as spinal injury, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief <Col N="759" /> executive officer of the relevant Health Board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that drug costs in the GMS scheme have shown a steady increase in recent years.  This increase, similar to that experienced by most developed countries, has been attributed to increased consumption, and the availability of newer more sophisticated and, inevitably, more expensive medicines. Given the changing demographic profile <Col N="763" /> of our population, and the developments in pharmaceutical technology, there can be no doubt that demand for medicines will increase in the years ahead with consequences for health expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances it is my strategy to ensure that the resources dedicated to expenditure on medicines are used in the <Col N="764" /> optimum manner and it is in this context that various initiatives in relation to improving prescribing practice have been launched over the last year.</P>
    <P>The impact of these initiatives can be seen in the rate of change in expenditure by health boards on the GMS in 1993 compared to previous year specified by the Deputy as follows:&mdash;</P>
