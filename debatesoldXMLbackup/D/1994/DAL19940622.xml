      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business proper I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies Seán Barrett and Proinsias De Rossa.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call first Deputy Seán Barrett to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Dáil be adjourned under Standing Order 30 to discuss the imminent lay-off of 850 workers at TEAM Aer Lingus and the consequences of such lay-offs for large areas of north Dublin, Meath and elsewhere, and make a further call on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to become personally involved to facilitate renewed negotiations on a settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the serious crisis facing TEAM Aer Lingus.  In view of the plans by management to start laying off 850 workers from today, the increasing danger of the <Col N="290" /> dispute spreading to Aer Lingus itself and the need for urgent Government intervention to secure a settlement to the crisis and in view of the importance of the company to the economy generally and to north Dublin in particular, I hope, a Cheann Comhairle you will agree to the request for this debate.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 8, 1, 15, 16 and 17.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight tonight; 2. Nos. 7 and 8 shall be decided without debate; 3. the proceedings on No. 1, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments thereto, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; 4. the proceedings on Report and Final Stages of No. 15, if not previously concluded, <Col N="292" /> shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; 5, the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine; 6. the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 17, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 midnight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and 7.

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the request under Standing Order 30 to have the crisis at TEAM Aer Lingus discussed in this House has been refused, I propose an amendment to No. 1: that one hour be set aside at the end of Private Members' time today to enable the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and Opposition Deputies to make statements on the crisis that faces TEAM Aer Lingus.  I believe that would be in order and I hope the Taoiseach will agree to it.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (16), lines 17 and 18, paragraph (f) deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  proceedings for an offence are concluded&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  when the defendant is acquitted on all counts;</P>
      <P>(ii)  if he is convicted on one or more counts, but no application for a confiscation order is made against him or the court decides not to make confiscation order in his case; or</P>
      <P>(iii)  if a confiscation order is made against him in connection with those proceedings, when the order is satisfied,</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(g)  an application under section 7 or 11 of this Act is concluded&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  if the court decides not to make a confiscation order against the defendant, when it makes that decision; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  if a confiscation order is made against the defendant as a result of <Col N="308" /> that application, when the order is satisfied,</P>
    <P>(h)  an application under section 8 or 14 of this Act is concluded&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the court decides not to vary the confiscation order in question, when it makes that decision; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the court varies the confiscation order as a result of the application, when the order is satisfied,</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  a confiscation order is satisfied when no amount is due under it,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 propose to insert new sections 7 and 8 in the Bill. The proposed section 7 will allow a court which has already determined, in the context of an application for a confiscation order under section 4 of the Bill, that a person who has been convicted of drug trafficking has not benefited from such trafficking to reassess that determination and to make a confiscation order in the light of new evidence presented by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The proposed section 8 will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to ask a court which has made a confiscation order against a person convicted of drug trafficking to reassess the value of that drug trafficking if fresh evidence becomes available.</P>
    <P>The other amendments are merely consequential.</P>
    <P>The net effect of these amendments will be to strengthen the Bill in two ways. First, it will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to go back to a court which has refused to make a confiscation order with fresh evidence and ask it to make a confiscation order in the light of that evidence.  Second, in cases where a confiscation order has been made for a certain amount and the Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently finds new evidence which suggests that the amount was insufficient, he can ask the court to reassess the order with a view to increasing the amount.  This is the kernel of amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and the other amendments are simply related.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of any provision which will ensure that those who deal in drugs suffer to the fullest extent possible.  I would be worried that a wrong assessment could be made at any stage and I welcome the provision which will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to come back to the court at a later stage with fresh evidence that the assets from the drug trafficking were more valuable than they first appeared. It is only proper that those who cause so much suffering and hardship to people should be made suffer to the fullest possible extent.</P>

As was pointed out on Committee Stage, there is no end to the creativity of the criminal mind.  Some criminals who have been convicted of serious crimes have stashed away large amounts of money and I welcome the power being given to the Director of Public Prosecutions to come back to court with fresh evidence at a later stage. I congratulate the Seanad for accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 7, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>7.&mdash;(1)  This section applies where an application has previously been made to a court under section 4 of this Act and the court has determined that the defendant has not benefited from drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>(2)  If the Director of Public Prosecutions has evidence&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  which was not considered by <Col N="310" /> the court in making the determination referred to in subsection (1) of this section, but</P>
    <P>(b)  which the Director of Public Prosecutions believes would have led the court to determine that the defendant had benefited from drug trafficking if it had been considered by the court, he may make, or cause to be made, an application to the court for it to consider that evidence.</P>
    <P>(3)  If, having considered the evidence, the court is satisfied that it would have determined that the defendant had benefited from drug trafficking if that evidence had been available to it, the court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  make a fresh determination of whether the defendant benefited from drug trafficking; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  make a determination under section 4 (4) of this Act of the amount to be recovered by virtue of that section; and</P>
    <P>(b)  may make a confiscation order under section 4 (4) of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  In considering an application under this section the court may take into account any payment or other reward received by the defendant on or after the determination referred to in subsection (1) of this section, but only if the Director of Public Prosecutions shows that it was received by the defendant in connection with drug trafficking carried on by the defendant or another on or before that date.</P>
    <P>(5)  In considering any evidence under this section which relates to any payments or reward to which subsection (4) of this section applies, the court shall not make the assumptions which would otherwise be required by section 5 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(6)  No application shall be entertained by the court under this section if it is made after the end of the period <Col N="311" /> of six years beginning with the date on which the defendant was convicted.</P>

      <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 7, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1)  This section applies where a court has made a determination under section 4 (4) of this Act of the amount to be recovered in a particular case by virtue of that section referred to in this section as &ldquo;the current determination&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that the real value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking was greater than their assessed value, the Director of Public Prosecutions may make, or cause to be made, an application to the court for the evidence on which he has formed his opinion to be considered by the court.</P>
      <P>(3)  In subsection (2) of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;assessed value&rdquo; means the value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking as assessed by the court under section 6 (1) of this Act; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;real value&rdquo; means the value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking which took place&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the period by reference to which the current determination was made;</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(b)  in any earlier period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  If, having considered the evidence, the court is satisfied that the real value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking is greater than their assessed value (whether because the real value was higher at <Col N="312" /> the time of the current determination than was thought or because the value of the proceeds in question has subsequently increased), the court shall make a fresh determination under section 4 (4) of this Act of the amount to be recovered by virtue of that section.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any determination under section 4 (4) of this Act by virtue of this section shall be by reference to the amount that might be realised at the time when the determination is made.</P>
    <P>(6)  For any determination under section 4 (4) of this Act by virtue of this section, section 5 (5) of this Act shall not apply in relation to any of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking taken into account in respect of the current determination.</P>
    <P>(7)  In relation to any such determination&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  section 3 (2) of this Act shall have effect as if for &ldquo;a confiscation order is made against the defendant&rdquo; there were substituted &ldquo;of the determination&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(b)  sections 3 (8), 8 (4) (a) and 10 (4) of this Act shall have effect as if for &ldquo;confiscation order&rdquo; there were substituted `determination'; and</P>
    <P>(c)  section 6 (2) of this Act shall have effect as if for &ldquo;confiscation order is made&rdquo; there were substituted &ldquo;determination is made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(8)  The court may take into account any payment or other reward received by the defendant on or after the date of the current determination, but only if the Director of Public Prosecutions shows that it was received by the defendant in connection with drug trafficking carried on by the defendant or another on or before that date.</P>
    <P>(9)  In considering any evidence <Col N="313" /> under this section which relates to any payment or reward to which subsection (8) of this section applies, the court shall not make the assumptions which would otherwise be required by section 5 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(10)  If, as a result of making the fresh determination required by subsection (4) of this section, the amount to be recovered exceeds the amount set by the current determination, the court may substitute for the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order which was made by reference to the current determination such greater amount as it thinks just in all circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>(11)  No application shall be entertained by the court under this section if it is made after the end of the period of six years beginning with the date on which the defendant was convicted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" />&ldquo;(2)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the Director of Public Prosecutions from making more than one statement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are designed to finetune the legislation and to correct some defects which were spotted during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputies will be aware that under section 8 the Director of Public Prosecutions can submit a statement of evidence to the court that a person has benefited from his criminal deeds and showing the extent to which he has benefited. The defendant can submit a statement in reply.</P>
    <P>As the Bill was drafted, the Director of Public Prosecutions can submit one statement only since the section refers to &ldquo;a statement&rdquo;.  This amendment is designed simply to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to submit more than one statement if further fresh evidence comes to light and as a corollary, allows the defendant to submit more than one statement by way of response.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is directly consequential on this amendment because it provides that any follow-up statement tendered to the court by the Director of Public Prosecutions will be treated in the same way as his original statement, when the defendant can submit replies and so on.  Again, it is merely a finetuning exercise designed to strengthen the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments, again which are largely technical in nature, is to finetune certain sections of the Bill. They clarify further the procedure for the making of confiscation orders under section 11 (2) and (4) of the Bill.  Deputies will recall that section 11 (2) enables the High Court to make a confiscation order against a person who, in the first place, has been convicted of drug trafficking or <Col N="316" /> another offence on indictment but who dies or absconds before the confiscation order can be made.  Section 11 (4), on the other hand, enables a confiscation order to be made in the case of a defendant in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been instituted on indictment but who absconds before the proceedings have been concluded.  In other words, section 11 (2) deals with a person who has been convicted but who absconds or dies before the confiscation order can be made, whereas section 11 (4) deals with the case of a person who has been prosecuted on indictment for an offence that can lead to a confiscation order but who absconds before the proceedings have been concluded.</P>
    <P>At present both section 11 (2) and (4) provide that, where the appropriate conditions are fulfilled, the High Court may exercise the powers of a court to make a confiscation order &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo;. However, they do not refer to the specific powers under the Act which are involved. The Minister has been advised that it might be better to make it clear that in the case of a conviction of proceedings related to drug trafficking, the powers provided in section 4 will apply and that where other offences are at issue, the provisions of section 7 will apply.  In other words, we are just tying the relevant powers to the relevant sections which provide those powers.  This is the effect of amendments Nos. 9 and 11 which propose the deletion of the words &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; in section 11 (2) and (4) and their replacement by new words along the lines I have indicated.  What is involved is simply a clarification and an improvement of the existing text.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (3), line 39, after &ldquo;offences&rdquo;&ldquo;in respect of which a confiscation order may be made under this Act&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment makes it clear that a confiscation order will be made by the <Col N="317" /> High Court only under section 11 (3) against a person who absconds before the conclusion of their trial if that person is being proceeded against on indictment. The making of confiscation orders generally is being restricted to convictions and to proceedings for indictable offences.  It is desirable to amend section 11 (3) to make it clear that this principle would apply where a person has absconded.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 13, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;(1)  An appeal against the making of a confiscation order shall lie to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>(2)  If it upholds the appeal, in whole or in part, the court may, on an application by a person who held property which was realisable property, order compensation to be paid to the applicant if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a result of the making of the confiscation order; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  having regard to all the circumstances <Col N="318" /> of the case, the court considers it to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>(3)  The amount of compensation to be paid under this section shall be such as the court considers just in all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, this amendment is designed to improve the legislation and fill a gap we discovered therein.  Normally an appeal against a criminal conviction is made to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Strictly speaking a confiscation order does not form part of that appeal.  One can appeal the conviction or the sentence, but a confiscation is something different again from either the conviction or sentence. Therefore, we had to provide some mechanism for somebody who wanted specifically to appeal a compensation order, which is what this amendment is designed to do.</P>

      <P>An appeal against the making of a confiscation order shall lie to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>

In any event the amount of a confiscation order was appealable in theory to the High Court.  It was pointed out to us in the Seanad that there was no specific provision therefor.  Therefore, in response to the very good debate in the Seanad, we decided to insert a specific provision therefor.</P>

      <P>SECTION 14</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 14, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>(1)  This section applies where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the High Court has made a confiscation order by virtue of section 11 (4) of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the defendant has ceased to be an absconder.</P>
      <P>(2)  If, on an application by the defendant or the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the confiscation order, the High Court is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking or his benefit as mentioned in section 7 (4) of this Act in the period by reference to which the determination in question was made (&ldquo;the original value&rdquo;), or</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount that might have been realised at the time the confiscation order was made,</P>
      <P>was less than the amount ordered to be paid under the confiscation order, the court&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  may make a fresh determination of the value of the defendant's proceeds or benefit under <Col N="320" /> section 4 of this Act in the case of drug trafficking and under section 7 of this Act in the case of an offence other than a drug trafficking offence, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  may, if it considers it just in all the circumstances, vary the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order.</P>
    <P>(3)  For any determination under section 4 of this Act by virtue of this section, section 5 (5) shall not apply in relation to any of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking taken into account in determining the original value.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the court varies a confiscation order under this section it may, on an application by a person who held property which was realisable property, order compensation to be paid to the applicant if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a result of the making of the confiscation order; and</P>
    <P>(b)  having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the court considers it to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The amount of compensation to be paid under this section shall be such as the court considers just in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>(6)  No application shall be entertained by the court under this section if it is made after the end of the period of six years beginning with the date on which the confiscation order was made.</P>
    <P>This amendment enables the defendant or the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the High Court to vary a confiscation order made against an absconder under section 11 (4) where the absconder has returned.  I will sum it up in my own language; it enables the Director of Public Prosecutions or the defendant to apply to the High Court to vary the amount of a confiscation order made against an absconder in two circumstances in which (a) and (b) occurs. <Col N="321" /> Circumstances (a) is where the absconder returns and (b) in which the court is satisfied that the amount of his or her benefit was overestimated when the confiscation order was made, or that his or her assets are not sufficient to satisfy that order.</P>
    <P>Similar provision for the variation of confiscation orders is already included in section 13 where an absconder is not involved.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for the payment of compensation where the High Court varies a confiscation order made by virtue of section 11 (4) when compensation will be payable to a person who suffered loss as a result of the making of the order.</P>
    <P>It is a fairly simple amendment and deals with something which, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, should have been dealt with in the Bill as originally drafted; but it is a fairly long, complex Bill and we cannot think of everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the variation of confiscation orders raises the prospect of a whole series of civil cases being taken under this process.  While I know it is essential to have that provision, it is really quite a hybrid in that, first, we have the criminal conviction and now these civil proceedings entering the realm of civil litigation.  Does the Minister envisage the Director of Public Prosecutions finding himself involved in a whole series of civil variation orders, for example, if the wife or children of the person whose proceeds have been confiscated is or are suffering hardship of varying degrees?  In those circumstances does the Minister envisage that the Director of Public Prosecutions will find himself involved in a whole series of cases to change the original judgment of the court, which really forms part of the criminal justice system, in relation to the confiscation order?  Is there not a danger that we are drifting into the State's being involved in civil litigation which could be endless in relation to the person whose proceeds have been confiscated?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell.  We are dealing with a hybrid <Col N="322" /> are between the civil and criminal law. In order to succeed, the absconder &mdash; who obviously absconded in the first place with good reason &mdash; would have to convince the court they subsequently appear before that the original order was wrong.  I suppose that is only fair. Nobody's sympathy can be with someone who absconds because almost invariably they do not abscond for a good reason. A person may abscond for one reason or another &mdash; maybe through fear for his life &mdash; and may not have an opportunity to contest the amount of the confiscation order being made against him, so all the court will hear is the evidence on the State side.  This person may return as soon as humanly possible and if the order is too high and he does not have assets to meet it, or if he has not made much money from the nefarious activity we are talking about, it is only reasonable that he should be entitled to go back into court.  I would not share Deputy O'Donnell's fears.  I do not see this happening on a wide scale.  I would be concerned if I thought the courts were going to be clogged by a whole lot of applications but I honestly cannot see it happening.</P>

      <P>If a person absconds before he has been convicted of an offence, say of drug trafficking, and absconds from the country to avoid trial or for whatever reason and an order is made confiscating his goods and assets, is this confiscation order made on the presumption that he is guilty because he absconded?  Is it the case that if he comes back, faces trial, is found not guilty, the confiscation order will be revoked?</P>

      <P>The original section provides a specific mechanism where somebody is taken to court and a confiscation order is made against them by the Central Criminal Court.  You appeal that to the Court of Criminal Appeal if you are not happy with the way the court looked at the evidence presented by the DPP as opposed to the evidence presented by yourself, and you feel that the court came to the wrong conclusions on the financial situation.  This new section deals with a situation where you were never in any position to contest it because you had left the jurisdiction and you come back some time afterwards.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify this notion of the person who absconds or goes missing and is deemed to be guilty in his absence and, therefore, the confiscation proceedings are brought by the State.  Does the fact that one is absent and has absconded for whatever reason &mdash; it may not even be for the purposes of avoiding trial &mdash; mean that that is actually a verdict?  Does it stand as one being deemed guilty?  Does one have a criminal record for the purposes of the State records?</P>

      <P>Yes, you are actually treated as such.  I must admit that my initial understanding was wrong because I only came to this question recently. You do not have to be convicted if you <Col N="324" /> abscond.  A confiscation order can still be made and I presume that it will be made on the basis that you are guilty even though there is not any verdict against you.  As a result of what we are introducing now, you can go into court when you come back and have that changed if you have evidence on which it can be changed.</P>

      <P>(7)  Where a restraint order is made which applies to an interest in a company or to the property of a company, the registrar of the High Court shall furnish the Registrar of Companies with notice of the order and the Registrar of Companies shall thereupon cause the notice to be entered in the Register of Companies maintained under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990.</P>

Deputy Mitchell suggested that they should also be registered in the Companies Office.  We have taken that on board and have gone quite a bit further than Deputy Mitchell in his original amendment.  This is because we have to provide for a situation which Deputy Mitchell did not provide for, even though he gave us the original idea and I give him full credit for that.  He did not provide for a situation where notification has to be made of the variation or cancellation of a restraint order.  That has to be provided for as well and is so provided for in the amendment in the name of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 23 and 24, the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section shall apply in respect of the carrying out of one or more of the operations which are included in numbers 2 to 12 and 14 of the list annexed to Council Directive 89/646/EEC, activities to which Council Directive 79/267/EEC as amended applies or any other activity which may be prescribed in regulations made under subsection (9) (b) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 relates to section 28 which deals with money laundering. Section 28 places an obligation on certain bodies to take measures to prevent money laundering through, for example, taking measures to establish the identity of a person for whom they propose to provide a service.  The basic approach which this section takes is to specify in subsection (1) the institutions on which these obligations are placed.  As well as mentioning specific institutions there is a power to prescribe other persons or bodies in regulations.  As the House will be aware, the section arises primarily in the context of giving effect to the EU directive on money laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 28 there is general agreement that the approach it contains is basically sound, but certain improvements were suggested which we are bringing forward in the amendments. The main effect of these amendments is to enshrine in the section a specific reference to the services covered by the EU directive on money laundering.  The directive defines those services by reference to two other directives and both of these are mentioned specifically in the amendments.  This will put beyond doubt the ability of the legislation to implement <Col N="329" /> in full the money laundering directive. In addition a power is being given to prescribe by regulation activities which will be brought within the scope of the reporting requirements of section 28. This will mean that in practical terms if it comes to light that certain activities are not already covered by the section which are liable to be used for money laundering then the reporting requirements of section 28 can be extended to them. While the basic approach of section 28 is being retained, I believe the amendments are practical improvements to it and I trust they will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious what we are doing here.  In relation to money laundering, an obligation is placed on certain banks, financial institutions, etc., to report matters relating to certain activities but those activities have not been spelt out.  We are now spelling them our specifically and giving ourselves the power to prescribe others if other types of financial services come on stream which could, in effect, amount to money laundering.  That is simply what we are providing for there.</P>

      <P>This is a good and necessary amendment.  There was recent controversy about the procedures entered into when granting passports in return for investment in the State.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice asking what procedures are taken to inquire into the criminality or otherwise of anybody who seeks to invest in the State in return for a passport.  The Minister should clarify whether there are any procedures whereby the Garda, the IDA or the Department of Justice make routine official inquiries into whether people investing in Ireland with the purpose of obtaining passports have criminal records.</P>

This is important because investment coming into the State could be tainted with criminality.  The Bill deals with money laundering and it is relevant to deal with the dangers inherent in such schemes if there is no investigation of whether investors have criminal records.</P>

    <P>(3)  Any order under subsection (2) of this section shall authorise the continued detention of the cash to which it relates for such period, not exceeding three months beginning with the date of the order, as may be specified in the order, and a judge of the District Court, if satisfied as to the matters mentioned in that subsection, may thereafter from time to time by order authorise the further detention of the cash but so that&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make provision for the seizure of cash relating to drug trafficking which is being imported into or exported out of the State.  As Deputies are aware, large amounts of cash are generated by drug trafficking and supplies of illegal drugs are frequently purchased in cash. As a result, consignments of money which are derived from or intended for use in drug trafficking are moved across international borders.  With the removal of exchange controls in this country, our authorities are not in a position to seize these consignments where they are detected, which is an appalling gap in the law.  This situation needs to be addressed and this is what is proposed in these amendments.  I should acknowledge at this stage that amendments which are designed to have the same effect as the amendments in the Minister's name were put down by Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell for Committee Stage. However, their scope was effectively limited to the seizure of suspicious cash and they did not make provision for the additional measures such as forfeiture of such cash, which are also required in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister explained that she was not prepared to go down this road in advance of having available to her the report of a senior official of her Department, which, among other things, would consider whether customs officers or the Garda should have such powers.  The report has now been submitted to the Minister and it recommends that powers along the lines contained in those amendments should <Col N="334" /> be available.  While she has not completed her consideration of the other matters in that report, she is happy, having considered this aspect, to put forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendments comprise eight proposed new sections 34 to 41, which will form a new Part VI of the Bill.  The proposed new section 34 provides for the detention and seizure by a garda or a customs officer of cash which is being imported into or exported from the State, provided the amount is not less than a certain amount to be prescribed under the proposed section 40 and provided the garda or customs officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is derived from or intended for use in drug trafficking. An order from the District Court will be required to enable the cash to be detained beyond 48 hours.  An order for continued detention of the cash may be made by that court for a period of up to three months and further such orders may be made for a total period of two years.  A person from whom the cash was seized will be entitled to apply to a district justice for its release.  The cash will not be released if its forfeiture is being sought under section 35 or proceedings are being taken against a person for an offence connected with the cash.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section 35 allows a Circuit Court judge to order the forfeiture of cash held under section 34 if he or she is satisfied on an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions, while the cash is still detained, that it represents drug trafficking proceeds or was intended for use in drug trafficking.  The civil standards of proof will apply in respect of an application under that section.</P>
    <P>The proposed section 36 provides for appeals to the High Court against forfeiture orders made under section 35. Again, the civil standard of proof will apply.  The proposed section 37 requires cash detained for more than 48 hours to be placed in an interest bearing account. The interest will be added to the cash upon its forfeiture or release.  The proposed section 38 provides for the giving of notice of orders made by a district judge authorising the continuing detention <Col N="335" /> of cash under section 34 (2) and for procedural matters.  The proposed section 39 contains definitions for the purposes of the new Part VI.  The proposed section 40 sets out a procedure for prescribing the amount of cash in relation to which the power of seizure under section 34 will apply.  The proposed section 41 provides in standard form for the disposal of money forfeited under section 35.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, there is a need to ensure that appropriate action can be taken to deal with the importation or exportation of cash which is connected with drug trafficking and I believe the measures which are provided for in these amendments can play an important part in enabling the Garda and customs officers to deal with that problem.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We welcome the amendment because if the people who are making money out of drug trafficking can be hit, they will eventually be put out of business.  They are in business only to make money at the terrible cost of the lives of those who take drugs.  The provision for an appeal will protect innocent people who may wrongly be under suspicion because they have a large amount of money which may be thought to have been derived from the sale of drugs.  The amendment should help to deal with drug traffickers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. The Bill needed strengthening and I am glad the Minister brought forward this amendment from the Seanad and that we have the opportunity to mention how welcome and radical this Bill is.  It does not pull its punches.  It is draconian in the powers it gives to the State to deal with offences such as drug trafficking.  It reduces the burden and obstruction which can face the State in detecting and dealing with drug trafficking by reducing the burden of proof to the civil standard, which is on the balance of probabilities.  It is generally not recognised outside legal circles that the criminal standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt and the <Col N="336" /> civil standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities.  This at last tips the balance in favour of the State in its effort to counter the long-standing principle that crime pays.  The thrust of this legislation is radical and my party strenuously supports and endorses it.  It is absolutely necessary that such radical and draconian powers be given to the State in relation to the seizure of cash, given the style of this type of criminal activity.</P>
      <P>We are not only talking about moneys in suitcases.  We are also talking about huge sums of money which, with the aid of up to date technological advances, can be transferred by the flick of a switch right around the world and money laundered in a couple of weeks.  This enhanced power is to be welcomed given the territory with which we are dealing and the havoc in our inner cities which is a direct result of the greed of this type of criminal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) section 1 (3) (c) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is merely a technical amendment which arises because certain details in relation to extradition which were included in the Bill as originally published <Col N="341" /> have been superseded by the recent enactment of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994.  Section 13 (c) of the 1994 Act provides that in certain circumstances the changes to our extradition laws which were made by that Act shall not have effect for the purpose of section 24 of the Extradition Act, 1870 and of section 5 of the Extradition Act, 1873, both of which relate to the obtaining of evidence in the State for use in foreign criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, section 24 of the 1870 Act and section 5 of the 1873 Act are being replaced and repealed by section 39 of the Bill.

      <P>Section 43: In page 41, between lines 28 and 29, the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 50 of this Act shall have effect as if references in that section to drug trafficking or an offence in respect of which a confiscation order might be made under section 7 of this Act included any conduct which is an offence under the law of a country or territory outside the State and would constitute drug trafficking or an offence in respect of which a confiscation order might be made under section 7 of this Act if it had occurred in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This rather important amendment is filling a gap in the legislation which was brought to our attention during the <Col N="342" /> course of its passage.  It arises as a result of discussions which the Minister has had with the Garda authorities since the legislation was debated here and in the Seanad.  While the Garda authorities are happy with section 43 to the extent that it deals with searches for material relevant to foreign investigations, they have suggested that it would be desirable to make additional provision in that section in relation to the obtaining of access to information etc. which is held here and is required for the purpose of investigating an offence committed abroad where a strict search would not be required.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is drafted the Garda can institute a search to aid an investigation in a foreign country for a defined type of offence.  However, the Garda has no parallel power to look for information which might be of assistance to a prosecuting authority in a foreign country. The Garda decided that it was a parallel, that one was a mirror image of the other, and that we should provide for it which is what we are doing.  This is strengthening the Bill and providing for further co-operation with foreign authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it will for the purposes of co-operation with other countries. Obviously, the application will have to be made to the court here and the court will look at the law in the other country to see whether the offence is covered by the terms of what we are providing for here.  We are dealing here with foreign co-operation and we will ask whoever makes the application to justify it.

Is there any danger that offences in a foreign country which might not be regarded as a serious offence in this jurisdiction could be used, for example, to convict somebody in Saudi Arabia who was having a pint of beer on the quiet?

      <P>I know that this legislation was originally introduced to bring us into compliance with various EU directives and international conventions. However, this whole aspect of the blurring of borders and the need for Europe, in particular, to harmonise its drug enforcement agency laws is brought to light through this amendment.  As the Minister said, it will be necessary before such powers can be exercised by the Garda to clarify whether, for example, the law in Holland or Belgium on drugs is similar to our legislation.</P>
      <P>Are there not implications for perhaps a future directive on the harmonisation of drug enforcement in Europe, given that although we no longer have specific borders and the move is in Europe to do away with borders, there will remain culture differences between the member states on, for example, the use of soft drugs and the criminality of their possession? Will the Minister make a general statement on that point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Donnell on harmonisation.  If one looks at the various legislative provisions throughout the EU one will find that with regard to the sort of offence which we are talking about &mdash; a drug trafficking offence which could lead to a confiscation order here &mdash; the law is fairly similar in other countries. In some EU countries certain substances which are illegal here have been legalised. However, the provisions on the general law on trafficking in substances which are illegal are fairly similar across the EU.  I am not aware of any country which is wildly dissimilar to what we have.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 42, before section 44 (but in Part VI), the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Government may by regulations make such modifications of this Act as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of adapting any of the provisions of this Part of this Act to enable the State to provide co-operation under those provisions for an international tribunal or other body established for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed outside the State.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under subsection (1) of this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of such draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment from the international point of view.  The primary purpose of this amendment is to enable this country to comply with certain obligations which apply to us in relation to the establishment of a special international tribunal to deal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.  As Deputies may be aware, the tribunal has been established by a United Nations resolution which requires states to provide the tribunal with assistance in its investigation and other work.  A number of such forms of assistance are provided for in Part VI of the Bill in respect of international co-operation in criminal matters, for example, the taking of evidence for foreign courts and so on.  However, as Deputies will recall, Part VI only applies in the context of co-operation between States at present.  We thought it <Col N="345" /> best therefore to take the opportunity presented by this Bill to enable us enshrine in our legislation a capacity to co-operate fully with tribunals set up to deal with the type of unspeakable and horrific war crimes that have been committed in former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>We propose to amend the Bill to enable the modification of Part VI by way of Government regulation which will allow appropriate assistance to be made available to the United Nations tribunal and any body which may be set up in the future to prosecute persons responsible for war crimes or other serious violations of human rights.  Given that in particular circumstances fairly extensive modifications to Part VI may be required for that purpose, the amendment also provides that any regulations made by the Government in this respect must be approved in draft by each House of the Oireachtas.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting amendment.  I am surprised to see it in the context of this Bill although, as the Minister said, it is necessary particularly in view of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. It is also necessary if agreement is reached and a solution found to the problems in former Yugoslavia.  People who are interested in human rights here and throughout Europe believe there is a danger that, in the context of any agreement, an amnesty will be granted to those who committed war crimes.</P>
      <P>A similar situation exists in the North of Ireland.  If there is a settlement of the conflict there there is a danger of a general amnesty which would be very hurtful to those whose loved ones and spouses have been murdered in the context of political terrorism.  It is important that we, as a key member of the European Union, take a stand and enshrine in our legislation a commitment to involvement in and co-operation with any war crimes tribunal.  The horrific and unspeakable acts of genocide which have occurred are well documented, or are being documented, by a special committee of the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> There is a general worry that in any agreement there will be an institutionalised effort to forgive and forget. The scale of the horrors in former Yugoslavia cannot be obliterated from European consciousness by such an amnesty. We should stand firm.  All the parties in this House have, in debates with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, stood firm in a commitment that, if there is a settlement, there will be an international tribunal to bring to trial those who committed gross and unspeakable acts of inhumanity against their fellow citizens in former Yugoslavia.  I welcome this excellent amendment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>Section 44: In page 43, between lines 6 and 7, the following new subsections inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A report may be made to the Garda Síochána under this section in accordance with an internal reporting procedure established by an employer for the purpose of facilitating the operation of this section.</P>
      <P>(4)  In the case of a person who was in employment at the relevant time, it shall be a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section that the person charged made a report of the type referred to in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, as the case may be, to another person in accordance with an internal reporting procedure established for the purpose specified in subsection (3) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The purpose of this amendment is to enable reports of transactions made to the Garda Síochána under section 44 of the Bill, where there is a suspicion of money laundering, to be made in accordance with internal control procedures established by an employer to facilitate the operation of section 44.  Many employers will establish such formal procedures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell proposed a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  In response to that amendment the Minister indicated that she accepted in principle what the Deputy was trying to achieve and that she would be prepared, in consultation with garda authorities and other parties, to introduce an amendment to deal with the matter.  The amendment I am proposing today fulfils that commitment. I commend Deputy Mitchell for bringing this to our attention.  There is a strong need for it.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if financial institutions established procedures to operate section 44 where a designated person in the institution would make a report.  This would be infinitely preferable to having every employee ringing Garda headquarters or their local garda station whenever they saw anything they thought was suspicious.  Such a system would be unworkable.  We anticipate a situation where the financial institutions will provide their own mechanism and a designated person or persons who will make the report after compliance with the internal reporting procedure.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides a necessary corollary which is to protect an employee who makes an appropriate report in accordance with internal control procedures established by their employer from conviction for an offence of failing to make a report under section 44.  The employee will only have to bring it to the attention of somebody internally.  If it is found that an offence was committed and the gardaí were not appraised of the matter the employee should not be held responsible if a procedure was in place and the employee did what he or she <Col N="348" /> was required to do.  This provision gives employees a specific defence.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When we discussed this previously we expressed a worry that genuine employees might be found guilty of something of which they were unaware.  The debate centred on whether they should be aware.  A situation could arise where every employee would become schizophrenic while worrying whether money lodged was the proceeds of drug dealing or whatever.  I am glad the overall picture is that individuals may feel free to question whether money lodged came from an illegal source rather than having to quiz the person to know whether they had a winner in Gowran Park or acquired the money through another source.  This procedure should save individuals from embarrassment and the risk of committing a criminal offence.  They can talk among themselves and whoever is responsible can then weigh up the situation. I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage we had a protracted debate about the change in banking culture which will be brought by this Bill.  This Bill places an obligation and onus on the banking community to be aware of and be responsible and accountable for transactions in their institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feared that the bank official would be caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand he would be guilty of a criminal offence if he did not disclose information about a transaction he thought was suspicious while on the other hand the culture of banking for generations has been based on confidentiality. It is inherent in banking that everything which occurs in the bank is confidential even if there is a suspicion that something might not be above board.  Having worked in a bank I am aware of this confidentiality which was endorsed by management and at all levels in the bank. I am gald this amendment addresses this issue and provides that one person be accountable.  That person will take the matter further having conducted an <Col N="349" /> internal audit under the new procedural rules which I am sure the banks will draw up for their employees.  This is an important area.  Although the bank official will be criminalised for not reporting or disclosing a suspicious transaction he might also be afraid that he might leave himself open to a civil suit for slander or libel and we must address that.  Does the Minister believe there is adequate protection for the bank official from the possibility that the client might take an action in slander or libel against him if he, in good faith, reports what he deems to be a suspicious transaction under the Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 44 adds to the protection provided.  Deputy O'Donnell's fears are misplaced.  I envisage &mdash; and we are seeking this result through this amendment &mdash; each financial institution establishing a code of conduct and a reporting procedure.  The official will report to the deputy manager, supervisor or higher level official that a stranger deposited, for example, £50,000 in cash.  The official will know from the rules circulated by the financial institution that such a deposit should be reported.  The report will then go through suitable channels to somebody who has been designated, perhaps following a management conference, to bring it to the attention of the Garda.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the official need worry about the matter as he will simply be complying with the internal rules of the institution and will be able to state that if he did not act in accordance with the regulations he would put his employment at risk.</P>

    <P>We must get away from the view that money laundering is carried out by people who look like criminals.  It is highly sophisticated white collar crime carried out by valued and esteemed <Col N="350" /> members of communities throughout the world.  The criminal, whether a drug trafficker or a money launderer, need not look like a criminal.  That is why I fear that bank officials might be in fear of their lives and livelihoods about making an allegation if they are not protected from civil suit in that context.</P>

      <P>We will deal with internal regulations in the next amendment.  I cannot agree with Deputy O'Donnell. My local bank manager in Limerick recently informed me that two gentlemen from London attempted to deposit £2 million in his bank.  When he reported the matter to the Garda they contacted the police in London and discovered that there was drug money in London in search of a home.  Such things happen. People will go into a bank and take such a chance.  However, I accept the Deputy's point that some of the people involved are those one would least suspect of such involvement.  That would probably apply in Dublin and in large urban centres.  If somebody living in a rural area enjoys a good lifestyle and has no obvious source of income suspicions are aroused.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter with the financial institutions and I am confident that they will put regulations in place which comply with the terms of section 44 and which will be clear enough to let each employee know about their obligation to make a report in certain circumstances. If I am a bank employee and somebody sues me for libel as a result of a report I made to a designated person about a matter which, on investigation by the Garda, was innocent I will be able to say that as an employee of the bank I have obligations under money laundering legislation and under guidelines issued by the bank with which I must comply.  I do not think the official has anything to fear. We discussed this with the financial institutions and it is up to them to establish the guidelines and to make them workable and clear so that officials will know their responsibilities.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We appear to be able to protect the official <Col N="351" /> behind the counter who takes in the money.  What is the position of the designated person who reports me to the Garda on foot of a report that I lodged £50,000?  What if I discover that my reputation has been damaged?  Is the designated person covered?</P>

      <P>Rules will apply.  We are trying to get at extraordinary transactions which might indicate that the money came from nefarious activities.  The banks will take legal advice on the terms of section 44 and will be advised by their lawyers when drafting guidelines.</P>
      <P>To make this legislation work there must be an obligation on somebody at some time to report a suspicious transaction. If we pitch it too high and officials are only required to report obvious cases such as I outlined to Deputy O'Donnell earlier &mdash; where somebody arrived with bags full of money from no obvious source &mdash; the Bill will be unworkable. Money laundering is, in many cases, white collar crime slickly operated by apparently solid citizens.  The legislation will obviously be unworkable if we go overboard in trying to protect officials although I realise they must be protected. Working on legal advice and within the framework of the guidelines, personnel in financial institutions are now legally obliged to carry out certain functions if they are not to be prosecuted under section 44.  Their lawyers will advise financial institutions on what they must do and on the guidelines which will be issued to officials and to the designated person.</P>
      <P>There will always be some danger. However, officials are put under an obligation by section 44 and if they do not comply with its terms they will be criminally liable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is why this issue is so serious.  The gun is put to their heads and they must act on suspicion.  If it is discovered that somebody lodged ill-gotten money the official will be found guilty because it was his duty to act even though he was not suspicious at the time.  That happens when <Col N="352" /> one puts a duty on people to act on suspicion.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that section 44 compels them to act.  However, a person who wins £100,000 in the prize bonds might wish to keep it a secret from local people and lodge the money in a bank in a different town.  I am sure he will resort to court for defamation of character if he discovers that he, as an honest decent citizen, was investigated later.  If we oblige bank officials to report these matters there must be some means of protecting them from being found guilty in an action for slander or libel.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 43, between lines 13 and 14, the following new subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In determining whether a person has complied with any of the requirements of this section, a court may take account of any relevant supervisory or regulatory guidance which applies to that person or any other relevant guidance issued by a body that regulates, or is representative of, any trade, profession, business or employment carried on by that person.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposed that in determining whether a person has complied with the obligations to report suspicious money laundering transactions &mdash; perhaps that is incorrect phraseology and I should simply say suspicious transactions &mdash; to the Garda under section 44, a court may have regard to any professional rules or guidelines which apply to the person in the conduct of his or her business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that persons covered by section 44 are not obliged to take unreasonable measures to avoid prosecution under the section. Where a person takes steps to detect and report laundering, which are in line with the best practice in his business or profession, that factor should be taken into <Col N="354" /> account by a court in deciding whether a person has met his obligations under section 44.</P>
    <P>In this context, even in advance of this Bill becoming law, a steering group &mdash; with representatives of the Minister for Finance, the Department of Justice, the Central Bank and of the institutions most likely to be affected by the reporting arrangements in relation to money laundering specified in the Bill &mdash; has been established to begin the process of drawing up guidelines for the various sectors involved.  It would be appropriate to give statutory recognition in the Bill to the existence of such guidelines and I hope the steering committee will put the matter beyond any doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were debating this section on Committee Stage we referred to the equivalent legislation in the United Kingdom.  Because we are one of the last countries to comply with the directive on money laundering, we have the benefit of the experience of how legislation was implemented and enforced in other jurisdictions.  The proof of this legislation will be in its implementation and enforcement and, undoubtedly, there will be procedural problems. We have just discussed changing procedural cultures in banking and financial institutions.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister confirmed there will be a steering committee, which is essential.  A similar committee was established in the UK to pull together the various strands necessary to make this complex legislation work, because the Bill has many implications.  When our sterring committee meets and discusses the implications of the Bill, it will find it will need the flexibility to exist for a number of years.  The legislation should be constantly under review, based on how successful the authorities and financial institutions find the enforcement of the legislation.  I welcome the steering committee and the Minister's conformation of its existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of our discussions here and in the extensive debate on the Bill in the other House, there was a reference to the valuable and significant part the Naval Service played in helping to <Col N="356" /> combat drug trafficking.  We are all aware of its success in that area and all sides of the House hope it will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 37 is to strengthen and clarify the position of the Naval Service in preventing illegal drugs reaching this country.  In that regard I propose to amend the First Schedule to ensure the powers of an enforcement officer under section 31 of the Bill in relation to measures against drugs imported on ships will be specifically conferred on members of the Naval Service not below the rank of petty officer.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that section 31, in conjunction with the First Schedule, enables an enforcement officer to stop and board a ship and to search and detain it in connection with drug trafficking.  At present the definition of &ldquo;enforcement officer&rdquo; in the Bill applies to members of the Garda Síochána, customs officers and other persons specified by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>In the context of the report being completed by an official of my Department, which deals specifically with inter-agency co-operation in this area, the definition should be extended to include appropriate members of the Naval Service. This should be done in the Bill rather than in subsequent regulations so that clear recognition can be given to the vital role of that service in the fight against drug trafficking.  Accordingly, I would be grateful if the amendment could be considered favourably by the House.</P>

It gives the Minister an opportunity to acknowledge the important role played by the Naval Service &mdash; it plays an equal part with Customs and Excise in detecting and potentially seizing <Col N="357" /> drugs.  This is especially relevant because of our status and location as an island state.  Because of the many little inlets around our coast, especially in the west, it is easy to land drugs.  This is shown in the various seizures in the area.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that enforcement officers have the requisite powers to act and to board ships.  In the long term, because of our membership of the EU, the Irish Naval Service will play an increasingly important role in the monitoring and detection of drugs.  That role should be developed so the navy can play a full part in the detection of drugs coming into Europe via Ireland.</P>

The success of this legislation will depend on how it is enforced.  That is why it was important to scrutinise, at all stages, the technical and practical aspects of the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State for responding to Opposition amendments.

      <P>I dealt with these amendments on Committee Stage.  While I was sympathetic to the case put forward by the Deputy I cannot support them.  My principal objection to amendment No. 2 is that I do not see the need for a local authority or a private person to be approved by the National Museum which already gives advice on security and environmental controls and hopes to see this service continued and expanded.  The nub of the matter was that I did not want to impose a burden on individuals and local and regional museums, they should be assisted to achieve a standard and have the fullest co-operation.  This is not a fundamental objection to the spirit of Deputy Creed's agreement on Committee Stage but respect for the autonomy of the people involved.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 2, I also felt that local authority museums should become the repository of objects of real value and that those not of real value should be retained by the State.  As I said on Committee Stage I hope to see local authority museums reach environmental and security standards that would allow the National Museum to give them objects of first rank.  That is the thinking that led me to say I would prefer to rely on that strategy rather than accepting these amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 18, 20 and 21 are in my name.  They are grouped with amendments Nos. 19 and 22 in the name of Deputy Creed and are related.  The purpose of the amendments in my name is to address an issue raised by Deputy Creed on Committee Stage which is reflected in his amendment No. 22 relating to the presumption of guilt provisions of section 2 (6) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987. Deputies will recall that I had some sympathy with the spirit of Deputy Creed's <Col N="361" /> amendment but I was concerned that to accept it would weaken the State's ability to protect the heritage of the people. Nevertheless, I undertook to give the matter further consideration between Committee Stage and today.  My four amendments are designed to achieve an acceptable balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to detection devices, amendment No. 3 extends the seizure provisions of section 7 of the Bill to sites recorded under section 12.  Amendment No. 20 extends the prohibition on the possession of detectional devices contained in section 2 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, to sites so recorded.  With these added precautions I am sufficiently reassured to delete the presumption of guilt provisions of section 2 (6) of the 1987 Act.  I hope Deputy Creed and other Deputies see this as a satisfactory compromise which meets the concerns expressed in amendment No. 22.  As a consequence of amendments Nos. 3, 20 and 21 there is no longer a need for section 12 (5). Amendment No. 18 deletes that proposal.</P>
    <P>A further consequence of acceptance of amendment No. 18 is that Deputy Creed's amendment No. 19 regarding the exemption of detection devices on agricultural machinery would fall.  I sought specific advice on the interpretation of detection devices which I gave on Committee Stage and this has confirmed my interpretation that a detection device attached to a machine such as a combine harvester, the primary purpose of which is to protect the machine, would not come within the scope of the Bill.</P>

It is our responsibility to put good legislation in place; this is legislation which can and will be enforced and yield the results intended.  As originally drafted, I was <Col N="362" /> concerned that this would not be the case on these specific issues and for that reason I am glad the Minister has tabled his own amendments.  As a result we have a better Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, it is a matter of general law that anything seized by the Garda should be returned to its rightful owner in the event that it is decided a prosecution is not to proceed.  I also indicated that I had some sympathy with Deputy Creed's point, that an express provision of this nature might strengthen the Bill, although it is clear from the provisions of section 7 that it is the courts which will decide if equipment seized is to be forfeited permanently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is designed expressly to clarify that items seized under a section of this Bill are to be treated in the same way as any other item seized by or which comes into the possession of the Garda in the course of their duties and must be returned if a <Col N="363" /> prosecution is not to take place.  I hope Deputy Creed will accept that my amendment provides sufficient reassurance.</P>
    <P>The Police Property Act, 1897 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a person may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for the return of property which has come into the possession of the police.  Section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 provides that an order under the Police Property Act, 1987 can be sought by the Garda in respect of the disposal of equipment which has come into their possession, although no person has been charged with an offence in connection with it.  I was anxious to say on Committee Stage that this matter was covered by general law but I wish to respond in the same generous spirit in which Opposition Members have sought to contribute to the debate on the legislation and I am offering this amendment in clarification. Amendment No. 7 deals with the substance of amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The powers of the Garda Síochána under this section:</P>
      <P>(a)  shall be related to the commission or suspected commission of an offence under section 3 of the Act of 1987,</P>
      <P>(b)  shall not be exercisable if the person has a valid licence issued by the Commissioners under subsection (5) of section 3 of the Act of 1987,</P>
      <P>(c)  shall be limited to the time necessary to bring a prosecution under the Act of 1987,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  shall be subject to an obligation <Col N="364" /> to return the equipment if no prosecution is brought within a specified period of the seizure,</P>
    <P>(e)  shall not be exercisable on the ordinary equipment of the sports diver who is merely interested in seeing what is under water and be limited to the more specialised equipment used by a person attempting to detect, survey or recover underwater objects whether from wrecks or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason I have tabled this amendment is that I believe the powers given to the Garda in this respect are excessive.  I acknowledge that looting of items of great archaeological importance has taken place off our coast during the past few years.  While we have come to terms with the problem of looting of national treasures on land we have never confronted fully the problem of illicit maritime activity.  As a result some fine treasures have been looted from ships off the Kerry coast which formed part of the Armada.  These fine items which ought to be the property of this and subsequent generations were stolen &mdash; it was theft on a grand scale &mdash; and sold in property houses in London and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister in this Bill to come to terms with this problem and to bring this black market to an end.  This theft takes place under the mantle of respectability.  It is considered to be an arty crafty activity and somehow or other is not treated by the public with the distain and contempt it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only should we confront this problem in law but we should also try to organise public opinion so that it is seen for what it is &mdash; theft of the lowest order.  Property houses which deal in stolen material should be the object of public odium.  We should do to them what Parnell asked the tenant farmers of Ireland to do to landlords who engaged in widescale evictions at the end of the 19th century and treat them with contempt. <Col N="365" /> I am satisfied the Minister has confronted the problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted is draconian as it applies to sports divers and members of diving clubs who engage in this activity for recreational purposes.  It is for that reason that I have tabled this amendment. Members of diving clubs have been of great assistance to the National Museum in trying to recover treasure and have an important role to play in ensuring that the provisions of this Bill are fully implemented in the years ahead.  As Deputy Browne said, we should not seek to visit guilt where there is none or make criminals out of people who are engaging in this legitimate activity for recreational purposes.  I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support the concept that the guilty should be dealt with severely.  There is a huge difference between someone who appreciates the value of a tombstone or cross and is prepared to export it to make money or uses their skill as a diver to remove hidden treasure and, on the other hand, someone who may unintentionally destory valuable artefacts.  Often in land reclamation people can do damage. When people are doing things for amusement, not for gain or for the sake of ripping off the nation's wealth, a distinction must be made.  It might be difficult to get the balance right because when people are caught they can always make an excuse.  However, in the case of exporting some of our antiques which can never be replaced, no mercy should be shown to the people flouting our standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attemping to grapple with a situation that is not easy to deal with effectively.  In the last few years we have seen a series of newspaper reports about the exportation to America, England and other countries of important archaeological artefacts of sentimental and national interest.  There has been a series of robberies and desecration of our churches and gravestones in various parts of the country which are <Col N="366" /> impossible to police effectively.  Because of their location and geography professional rustlers find it easy to &ldquo;case the joint&rdquo; at any time of the day and come back at night or at some quite time.  The more famous a place becomes the greater the incentive to remove something from it.  Good examples are the Pyramids of Egypt and the Berlin Wall where people want to take away pieces for sentimental or other reasons.  Professional collectors of antiquities are prepared to pay vast amounts of money for headstones, church stones and window stones.  I know the Minister is trying to deal with this problem effectively.</P>
      <P>I also support the calls by Deputies Browne and Quill in regard to underwater divers and those training in the pursuit of this important leisure activity who have no intention of removing something of interest that belongs to the nation.  I hope, when the first offenders are brought to justice, that the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear and that this legislation will not be seen merely as a piece of paper lying on the Statute Book collecting dust while those engaged in their unlawful pursuits laugh wherever they congregate.  This section of the Bill has a specific purpose.  It is a legal deterrent and should be seen to be enforced. I fully support the Minister's actions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Kenny.  What I have to do as Minister &mdash; and I believe this legislation will go very far in that regard &mdash; is to protect our heritage now and in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I believe I have struck a balance between protection of something very valuable on the one hand and liberty on the other.  Deputies will note I have already gone to considerable lengths to meet the legitimate concerns of divers.  The text of the Bill when originally drafted was never intended to presume guilt on the part of divers. However, in so far as any reference to the diving community might be construed in any needlessly negative way, I sought to meet the representations made to me by diving clubs, Deputies and spokespersons <Col N="367" /> to whom I was grateful, and I included a number of amendments that avoided any specific targeting of divers and limited enforcement action to those caught in the act of committing an offence.</P>
    <P>I again stress that the powers of the Garda are already related only to the commission of an offence and would not apply where a licence has been issued under section 3 of the 1987 Act.  There are already time limits set out in general law for the taking of charges and I do not think it desirable to have them reiterated in a specific context.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 already deals with the issue of the return of equipment if a prosecution is not pursued.  Any further concession, particularly in relation to the activities of sports divers would, in the first instance, be discriminatory and do the very thing which we were asked by the diving clubs not to do &mdash; mention them specifically.  Much more important it would make the provision unenforceable and undermine its spirit.  My overriding concern must be the requirement for effective protection of such sites.  The legislative provisions struck the appropriate balance between the right to liberty, which has been invoked as the rights of divers, and the rights of all our people to the effective protection of our heritage.  Accordingly, I have gone as far as I can in retaining adequate protection. I am opposed to the inclusion of this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a matter on which I spoke on Committee Stage.  I am inclined to come down in favour of Deputy Creed's amendment.  If a gentleman from, say, the National Museum arrived in my back garden in the middle of an afternoon without giving prior notice as to what his business was I would automatically regard him as a trespasser and treat him accordingly.  It would not be in the interests of this Bill if that happened on a larger scale.  If a similar gentleman arrived in a field of corn on an early September afternoon when a farmer was planning to harvest, I think I know what the farmer would do &mdash; John B. Keane would also know what the farmer would do &mdash; in those circumstances.  To facilitate the smooth operation of this Bill there <Col N="369" /> should be a requirement in law to give minimum notice to the owner of a property that is about to be entered by somebody authorised to do so in the context of this Bill.  In the interests of making this Bill work well that should be put in place in law.  If it is not, we will have legislation that is very good on paper but which will not work as efficiently as it should.  I would be fearful for the operation of the law if what I now say is not taken on board and formalised in the context of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A balance must be struck in this area.  I assume the intention of Deputy Creed's amendment is to draw a distinction between trespasing on property and the right and necessity of officers of the State to protect an archaeological site or an entity of it which may be in imminent danger of destruction or decay. Because of our history and geography, many of our archaeological sites and items of interest are located in remote areas or in areas in which there is not a high density of population.  Given the population structure in many rural areas, a stranger may cause a legitimate and genuine fear among owners or occupiers of property.  Having listened to the Minister's fine contribution in Achill recently, I know he is aware that a higher percentage of people over 65 years are living alone along the west coast and the appearance of a stranger close to their households or property could cause them genuine fear.  Unless the owners or occupiers of a property are unaware of the value of an archaeological site or entity on their property, there should be no difficulty with the State informing them in writing that officials will be calling at a certain time to investigate, say, the ring fort or castle on their site.  The position might be different if a report were submitted stating that tombstones or church arch stones had been removed and an officer of the Office of Public Works or the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht had to investigate the site with a view to protecting it.  However, a balance must be struck between frightening <Col N="370" /> legitimate landowners or occupiers and protecting our heritage and culture.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Creed's amendment. I assume it was his intention in tabling it to draw a distinction between trespassing on property and the legitimate concern of officers of the State in protecting and enhancing our heritage.</P>

Benign images such as that presented by Deputy Quill in regard to her garden &mdash; which I am sure is a pleasure not only to her but to many people in Cork &mdash; is generally used to justify amendments such as this.</P>

      <P>I must also deal with people who discover an object which is part of our national heritage.  If we insert a requirement of notice in this regard in the Bill we could render the protection requirement of the section nugatory. Nevertheless, it is fair to assume that the Director of the National Museum or a designated person would operate with similar propriety to that which we would expect from anybody else.  The Director or designated person will produce identification. Officials of the Office of Public Works have had authority since the 1930s to enter land and inspect monuments. The Bill will not introduce entirely new provisions in this regard.  The Director or a designated person will be named and if there is improper use of powers the matter can be raised in the Dáil.  If we insert a requirement relating to a notice in writing we would facilitate the concerns of the Deputies, but we would also make <Col N="371" /> it more difficult to execute protection of archaeological sites.  In accepting this amendment we would allow more time for those who might not be willing to accept responsibility in respect of an object of interest and its context.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I stated that the physical context of a find is often much more important than the object.  Therefore, it is necessary to move quickly, not only to recover or note an object, but to preserve the site from damage so that the significance of an object can be read. That is why we need this power in the legislation.  To require a notice in writing would defeat the purpose of this section and, because of the delay, increase the possibility of irrevocable damage to a potentially important site through weather, vandalism or the natural deterioration of ancient objects exposed to the elements.  I have no doubt these powers will be exercised with sensitivity and the co-operation of landowners and occupiers sought in all cases.  Identification will be produced by the office holder who will be either the Director of the National Museum or a designated person.  I expect such co-operation will be forthcoming in the majority of cases.  If I am to protect our heritage we must retain in this section the power of an immediate investigation.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. The intention of the amendment is not to cause undue fear to the owner of the property on which there is an object of archaeological interest.  I recall when I was Minister of State at the Department of Labour receiving claims from three members of a family for damage arising from injuries they received from a pothole in the vicinity of their house.  It is not beyond the bounds of the Irish mentality that if a person trips over wire or sprains an ankle on a stone on his or her way to view, say, a round tower, a claim will follow.  The Taoiseach stated twice this week that the public liability Bill is receiving fast track treatment from the Government and I welcome that.  The matter is being taken to a new plane every month with an increase in the number of tourists and those taking part in pursuits such as walking, orienteering and so on.  The intention of this amendment is that the owner of a property on which a monument is located or through which people must go to view a monument should not suffer unduly as a result of injuries to people gaining access to the monument in question.</P>

If the possibility remains that in the event of an accident occurring the farmer will be liable to pay compensation charges, nothing will make farmers open up their land.  I would ask the Minister, perhaps not in the context of this Bill, to use his influence within the Cabinet to ensure that the public liability issue is confronted quickly so that the matter is finalised. Otherwise the provisions of the Bill will not be operable on the ground.</P>

While my officials were working in the Department on the text of this Bill and responding to amendments, the final report was received from the Law <Col N="373" /> Reform Commission.  This enabled significant progress to be made on the occupier's liability legislation which is now at an advanced stage.  There is a need for such legislation, but this Bill is not the measure with which to deal with it.  I am in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, on this matter and I am happy that this legislation will meet the concerns that motivated these amendments.</P>

This is one of the most significant Bills protecting the heritage of Ireland.  Sums are paid to individuals or groups as a reward for good and responsible citizenship rather than by way of compensation.  That is a crucial point. We are not dealing with levels of compensation because the heritage of Ireland belongs to all the people.  We are speaking here about appropriate rewards to individuals who behave responsibly.  If, however, an owner or occupier of land, as referred to in the amendment, is dissatisfied with an administrative procedure, <Col N="374" /> they have the right to utilise the law &mdash; for example, by appeal to the High Court against any diminution or unfair treatment of their rights.</P>

    <P>The first part of section 11 refers to the right of the Minister to acquire, by agreement or compulsorily in accordance with the Schedule, ground or land around a national monument but it is impractical to expect that the Minister would acquire the national monument as a distinct entity without providing a portion of ground around it for the purpose of viewing the monument or to provide a leisure facility for the use of people who would <Col N="375" /> visit the national monument.  Deputy Creed's intention in putting down the amendment is that a huge tract of ground would not be acquired compulsorily by the Department but that the ground to be acquired would be leased by the Department, with proper compensation given to the owner in respect of it.  In the case of a number of properties maintained by the Office of Public Works ground in the vicinity of the properties is in the hands of the Department but is retained for specific use such as grazing by the landowner involved.  The intention behind the amendment is to ensure that such land is still available for these purposes. Where a monument is taken over by the Department on behalf of the people there should be adequate access to it and sufficient ground from which people may view the monument.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because it seeks to delete paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of section 11. We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I am at a loss to understand Deputy Creed's persistence with it.  I am trying to establish a balance between the rights of private property owners and the rights of the people of Ireland to their heritage.  The powers in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) are necessary for the provision of appropriate facilities to ensure clear possession of the lands involved and access to monuments.</P>
      <P>The powers in section 11 relate to acquisition by agreement as well as compulsory acquisition.  These powers are constrained by the requirement that the commissioners must obtain the consent of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Finance. Where an owner objects to an acquisition the consent of both Ministers must be obtained before the land can be compulsorily acquired and both Ministers will be directly accountable to the House for their actions.  These powers are further constrained by the provisions of amendment No. 12 in my name.  I believe the concerns are met in this case.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage during which Deputies expressed concern at the nature of the facilities which might be provided under this section.  Deputy Quill, in particular, was worried that ice-cream parlours and dance halls might be provided by the Commissioners of Public Works in the vicinity of national monuments.  I appreciated the Deputy's concerns and agreed to examine the provision again to see if it could be tightened so as to allay the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is designed to address this point in that in the vicinity of a national monument land can only be acquired for the provision of facilities which are deemed appropriate by the Minister.  It is worthwhile reflecting on the safeguards built into this provision. Land for the provision of facilities can only be acquired with my consent and the consent of the Minister for Finance.  As I said, both the Minister for Finance and I <Col N="377" /> are accountable to this House for our actions in the exercise of these powers.  In addition, only facilities that are deemed appropriate by me can be provided and it is implicit that my consent to any acquisition will only be forthcoming when I am satisfied that the proposed facilities are appropriate.  If a landowner objects to the acquisition of land by the Commissioners of Public Works, my consent, and that of the Minister for Finance, must be obtained for the compulsory purchase order and, in addition, any facilities which the commissioners propose to provide will require planning permission. There are adequate safeguards which should allay all reasonable fears held by Deputies.</P>
    <P>Under the section, as amended by my amendment, it will be a matter for the commissioners to specify the facilities they propose when they seek my consent to the acquisition of the property and it will be my role as Minister to decide whether such facilities are appropriate.  I do not believe that it will be necessary to bring all such decisions to the Oireachtas for individual ratification in view of the safeguards I mentioned.  Of course, I continue to be accountable to this House.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for taking my concerns on board and tabling an amendment in response to the very real concerns I expressed on Committee Stage.  Having done the right thing by preserving and protecting our national monuments, my fear is that in the years ahead buildings may be constructed in the vicinity of national monuments that would negate all the good we are seeking to achieve in this Bill.  If I could be assured that the Minister will live as long as many of the monuments in question, I would not be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>In support of his amendment the Minister said that nothing could be built without the consent of the Minister. On a number of occasions I wished <Col N="378" /> he had said nothing could be built without &ldquo;his&rdquo; consent.  Those who are concerned about these matters would wish that this Minister's consent would be required because even his detractors &mdash; I am not aware of any &mdash; acknowledge that the Minister cares very deeply about these matters and will ensure that the monuments will be preserved and passed on to future generations intact and in all their splendour.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, being a realist I do not anticipate the Minister will be in office for ever and, for that reason, I will press my amendment.  My fear is that when we have passed on some &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; of a politician will give planning permission for a commercial enterprise in the environs of a national monument.  It is not outside the bounds of possibility that this could happen &mdash; we can enumerate instances where this happened in the past.  If that were to happen would it not be the ultimate irony that in 1994 we had passed a package of measures to protect our national heritage and later a Minister would give permission to erect a building, the use of which might be in total contradiction with the spirit of this Bill, for example, an ice-cream parlour, a souvenir factory, a ballroom of romance.</P>

      <P>It is not outside the bounds of possibility that a building, the scale, design or architecture of which would not be in sympathy with an adjoining national monument would be constructed.  I will not cite examples but under the planning Acts buildings have been erected in the wrong location.  I have learned to be very cautious about these matters and, for that reason, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.  What we are doing today is of fundamental importance and will stand to the credit of this House for generations. I want to ensure that in future Members will have the final say on the facilities to be located in the environs of national monuments when people like us will have long since passed on.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support the thrust of Deputy Quill's amendment. Obviously, one cannot desecrate the area around a national monument. The effect of the Deputy's amendment is stronger than that of amendment No. 12 in the name of the Minister.  Under the Minister's suggested wording it is left to the judgment of the then Minister, but Deputy Quill's amendment provides that the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas is required in addition to the Minister's approval.  That is an extra protection. We are trying to ensure that the environs of national monuments are not desecrated.</P>

      <P>One of the fastest growing tourist attactions is architectural heritage and discovering one's ancestors. They are very important.  I sympathise with what Deputy Quill is trying to achieve, but it is the function of the planning authority as distinct from &ldquo;a cute hoor&rdquo; of a politician to grant planning permission for any facility.  The Minister of the day may decide to acquire a monument in the national interest but it is a function of the local authority and its members to decide on the appropriate facilities in the vicinity of the national monument.  The Minister can certainly object and make the case that it would be a desecration to have machines dispensing &ldquo;99&rdquo; ice-cream cones in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a scheme of assistance for the marketing and promotion of the six privately owned regional airports in 1993, to be funded by the Exchequer at a cost of £1.5 million.  A provision of £250,000 was made in the Department's Vote in 1994 in respect of the balance of expenditure on this scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, a provision of £1.25 million Exchequer funding has been made in 1994 for the introduction of an essential air services programme for the six regional airports, aimed at ensuring a minimum level of air services within Ireland to the parts of the country served by these airports.  This programme has recently been approved by the European Commission and the Commission will shortly invite tenders from Community airlines for the operation of the services. No State assistance has been allocated to any of the State airports in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the viability of each airport, the Deputy will be aware from the Aer Rianta Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 1993, copies of which were laid before the House on 23 May 1994, that the viability <Col N="382" /> of the State airport is not in question. The regional airports are private companies and their ultimate viability does not come within my remit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan cannot be here and he asked me to take these questions. In relation to the Minister's reply and his programme of support for regional airports, will Cork Airport qualify for this aid?  As the Minister is aware, the airport is owned by Aer Rianta and there have been complaints from those in Cork Airport that they have not been treated fairly in conjunction with other regional airports.  Given that the airport is viable and economic, will the Minister ensure there is a level playing pitch and that Cork is given a fair crack of the whip in regard to this support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork is not a regional airport in the accepted sense of the term. Regional airports in Farranfore, Galway, Sligo and Carrickfinn are operated by private companies.  A totally different situation pertains in Cork.  One must examine the level of traffic, the total level of traffic of all those regional airports would not compare with Cork Airport which, in conjunction with Shannon and Dublin, is operated from the budgets of Aer Rianta.  Central budget allocations are a matter for the Aer Rianta board, which is a commercial semi-State body, and operational matters of this kind are the responsibility of Aer Rianta management and board, not mine.</P>
      <P>I am aware that representations were made and that there was some improvement in terms of allocating direct marketing funds to the people in Cork for the purpose of promoting Cork as part of the State airport regime.  That was done at the behest of representations received. As far as I am concerned, therefore, there is no other State assistance for State airports and the issues raised by the Deputy, and which have been raised by other Deputies in the past, have been dealt with.</P>

      <P>I refer to the statement by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to this House on 16 June last, when she stated that the EU Commission had approved in principle the Community Support Framework for Ireland for the period 1994-1999 and that the Operational Programmes which will implement the sectoral objectives of the National Development Plan are being finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the operational programmes are finalised and agreed it will not be possible to give project details other than to say that the key elements of the National Development Plan relating to the transport, energy and communications sectors will be implemented and that the effect of a <i>pro-rata</i> adjustment in EU resources <Col N="386" /> on aggregate expenditure in the sectors concerned over the lifetime of the CSF will be negligible.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of uncertainty about the light rail project in Dublin.  We have been told that not all three of the routes will go ahead.  Will the Minister say which route will not go ahead and what the timescale is for the other two routes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative does not envisage completion of its total policy requirements until 1999.  Decisions about the light rail project will be made in due course by the Government and brought into the public domain at the relevant time.  The final report will be to hand presently.</P>
      <P>I have said on numerous occasions in the House that the impact of any adjustment of EU aid on project completion depends mainly on the dependence on EU funding in the particular sector.  In the energy and telecommunications sectors, the national plan set out quite clearly that over 90 per cent of the funds required for investment over the lifetime of the Community Support Framework will be provided from sources other than the EU.  In the case of postal services dependence on EU funding is marginally greater.  In these circumstances it is naive to believe that the impact of any <i>prorata</i> asjustments in EU funding will be anything but trivial.</P>
      <P>In the transport sector, 75 per cent of the investment envisaged in the airports will be from non-EU sources and the same point applies there.  In the case of mainline rail, the vast bulk of funding is coming from the Cohesion Fund which has not been subject to any <i>pro rata</i> adjustment.  Therefore, the impact of aid adjustments here is minimal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 8 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Paris Commission, which deals with the prevention of all types of marine pollution, is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  However, as on previous occasions, officials from my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland attended <Col N="389" /> the meeting for agenda items concerning the discharges of radioactive substances into the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland was to the forefront in discussions at the meeting and again raised its long-standing grave concerns about the reprocessing activities at Sellafield and, in particular, the increased emissions arising from the operation of the new THORP plant.  Most delegations supported Ireland in expressing anger at the UK and France's non-acceptance during the year of an Irish-sponsored recommendation on nuclear reprocessing plants, which had been adopted in 1993. The effect of this recommendation would be to oblige States to adopt all possible measures, including the application of best available technology and the precautionary principle, for the reduction and ultimate elimination of radioactive substances in the sea.  The recommendation also stated that authorisations for radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing options had also been considered and a full environmental impact assessment was undertaken in advance. This year's meeting urged the UK and France to immediately reconsider their stance and to comply urgently with the provisions.</P>
    <P>The Paris Commission at its meeting all last week in Sweden also adopted an Irish-sponsored recommendation for the carrying out of a study to assess both the reprocessing and non-reprocessing options for nuclear spent fuel management. The Irish view was that the non-reprocessing option, such as dry storage for spent fuel, constitutes the most effective, least environmentally damaging and best manner to achieve the aims of reduction and elimination of radioactive contamination into the sea. A third recommendation, sponsored by Ireland and the Nordic Countries, focused on the environmental impact resulting from discharges of radioactive substances.  The Paris Commission agreed that, as a matter of urgency, a detailed examination should be undertaken of the further measure that can be adopted for the reduction and elimination of radioactive substances to the <Col N="390" /> marine environment.  My officials have taken a leading role in all of these Paris Commission discussions.</P>
    <P>I am having Greenpeace's recent paper on arbitration under the Paris Convention examined, in consultation with the Attorney General.  I must say, however, that this question has been considered in detail before and it has been found that there are limitations in such an approach in that there is not a lot of legal weight to that convention in relation to discharges of radioactive substances. Its usefulness is largely as an international forum for putting political and moral pressure on the UK, not as a source of legal obligations.  Indeed, the Greenpeace organisation identified and recognised the disadvantages of the convention when it presented a different submission in 1990 to previous Ministers for Energy and for the Environment.  Furthermore, the Paris Convention has no binding regulatory or authorisation functions in relation to the planning, building, commissioning or operation of industrial or nuclear plants such as THORP on territories of individual states.</P>
    <P>As in the past, I and my officials will maintain unremitting international and diplomatic pressure in every appropriate forum and at every possible opportunity to highlight our concerns and to request the cessation of Sellafield's reprocessing facilities.  Our opposition to Sellafield has already been raised at EC level, in the International Atomic Energy Agency, at the OECD-Nuclear Energy Agency meetings and at the Paris Commission and the London Dumping Convention. In addition, at Energy and Environmental Councils of the EU, responsible Ministers have persistently raised Ireland's concerns about the dangers arising from Sellafield's discharges and operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that by proceeding with THORP without the environmental impact study and without consultation with the Paris Commission and this country, which was recommended by that commission in 1993, the UK authorities have ignored <Col N="391" /> the 1993 Paris Commission recommendations and are, therefore, in breach of the Paris Convention?  If he accepts those points, has he notified the British Government that this country is in dispute with it due to its non-compliance with the Paris Commission recommendations and has he also notified the Paris Commission of this?  If he has declared that this country is in dispute with Britain over these matters, what does he propose to do about that dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Recommendations are not binding on contracting parties which do not accept them.  This principle of international law is a constraint in terms of the mandatory action one can take on points which are put and accepted by the majority of contracting states under the Paris Convention and similar international agencies.  One can have serious disagreements with another country but when it is a non-binding recommendation one cannot, realistically, be said to be in dispute in legalistic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The term is in the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is regrettable as the other 11 contracting parties have indicated acceptance of the recommendation. The UK has explained that although most of the provisions in Recommendation 93-5 pose no problems it could not agree that the Paris Commission had the competence or the appropriate procedures to be consulted about new or revised discharge authorisations for nuclear plants.  It believes the EURATOM Treaty contains the necessary provision for such consultations. The UK delegation also explained that following adoption of the recommendation last year it held a further round of public consultations on THORP and subsequently provided justification for the start-up of THORP's operations.  Consultation has taken place within the framework of the EURATOM Treaty.  France, another major nuclear reprocessing nation, supported the UK <Col N="392" /> as it does on many nuclear matters in other fora.</P>
      <P>We will continue to maintain political pressure in all appropriate fora in our efforts to bring about the ultimate closure of Sellafield.  In the meantime we will insist that all regulations are adhered to. We keep a close watch on the situation at all times.  There is unanimity in the House on this issue and like successive Governments we will continue to voice our protestations and seek to reduce any perceived or potential threat to Irish people from the operation of the THORP plant.</P>

      <P>I am explaining the position. The purpose of Question Time is to impart information.  I am giving the Deputy the technical, detailed information if he wants to hear it.  If he wants to make noises to be published in the evening papers, he can go right ahead.  If he wants the information, it is as follows. Arbitration under Article 21 would not seem to be possible as it specifically deals with the interpretation and application of the present convention.  Since Article 5 is sufficiently vague there would seem to be no reliable basis for dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom concerning interpretation or application. The United Kingdom claims to be complying with guidelines laid down by an international organisation, the International Committee on Radiation Protection. Therefore, it complies with the <Col N="395" /> Paris Convention on levels of radioactive waste disposal.  To challenge this on the basis of a legally weak obligation under Article 5 would be difficult, especially given the additional dispute on the ICRP standards.  Perhaps it could be argued that the United Kingdom is so derelict in its actions <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sellafield that it is not taking measures in good faith indicated under Article 5.1 to forestall pollution or to adhere to the recommendation of the Commission, but there is no real legal duty here on which to rely.  This argumentation was put forward in a Greenpeace document prepared by Dr. R.M. McGonagle on legal opinions for Irish action regarding United Kingdom radioactive waste pollution and forwarded to previous Ministers for Energy and for the Environment.  In my reply I referred to the change which has arisen there in relation to the most recent documentation we received from Greenpeace which is being considered in my Department in consultation with the Attorney General.  That is the position.  I assure Deputy Gilmore if there is any breach of a legal obligation on the part of any member state, including the United Kingdom, detrimental to this country's interests, I will not need his persuasion to fulfil my duty.  The officials in my Department would be acknowledged by activists in this area, by Greenpeace and others, to be the most vigilant and able people, who monitor at all times how we can bring further pressure to bear.  I will not accept from Deputy Gilmore or anyone else that they are in dereliction of duty in that regard.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>in regard to his comments quoted in the Irish Independent of 30 May 1994, the reason he favours the disposal by Aer Lingus of the Copthorne Hotel chain, particularly in view of the profitability of the hotels and the contribution they can make to the Aer Lingus group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale by Aer Lingus of any of its subsidiaries is primarily a commercial matter for the company.  One of the essential elements in the Strategy for the Future, which is designed to restore Aer Lingus to commercial viability, is the judicious disposal of a number of assets which are not essential to the core air transport business.  By disposing of these assets the Aer Lingus group can strengthen its currently weak balance sheet and management can concentrate its energies and attention on the core air transport business.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Aer Lingus board has received some offers for the hotel chain.  I am unaware of the details of these as it is primarily a matter for the board.  In my comments to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 30 May 1994, I simply stated that I would favour as early a disposal as possible of the Copthorne chain as the sale proceeds would go towards reducing the borrowings of Aer Lingus. Obviously, the sooner Aer Lingus can reduce its borrowings the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister set a deadline by which the Copthorne group is to be sold?  Can he explain to the House the logic of selling a subsidiary of Aer Lingus which is actually making a profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Cahill plan the <Col N="398" /> latest time for the sale of the Copthorne group is 1994-95.  The reason it has to be sold is that it is not essential to the core business of the airline.  The airline group is heavily geared and has borrowings way in excess of what is prudent in terms of its future viability and investment prospects. Given the seriousness of the position, it is a matter of prioritising what is necessary to the company's future.  Ownership of a hotel group is not central to the future strategy of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On what is a black day for the Aer Lingus group, and a particularly black day for the Minister, is he aware of the very heavy capital investment by the Aer Lingus group in the Copthorne hotels?  Will he assure the House that, in the acceptance of any offer, the taxpayer will recoup his investment, that there will be no question of a garage or discount sale of these hotels which would mean a substantial write-off of taxpayers' investments whereby we would reap less than had been invested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of the hotel group will be based on the market price available; it will not be a garage sale in any sense.  The value of the hotels is based on their current market value.  The value on the balance sheet is a matter for discussion with the auditors and so on, if there are to be any write-offs on the basis of a sale.  The financial crisis in Aer Lingus requires a cash-driven solution. Any prudent analysis of the position would require the sale of non-core assets not central to the strategy of the airline. Assets are acquired in good times and, in bad times, one has those assets to dispose of, to reduce gearing, borrowings and interest repayments and to achieve viability more speedily.  If the central purpose of the strategy for the future of Aer Lingus is to achieve viability, one reduces borrowings as quickly as possible and disposes of assets not central to strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that any profit-making sector of the Aer Lingus group ought to be valued as an enhancing factor in the overall <Col N="399" /> group and that he is cutting off his nose to spite his face by selling it off, particularly since so much taxpayers' money was invested in it initially?  Does he consider there is a painful lesson to be learned from the separation of the aircraft maintenance component of the Aer Lingus group into TEAM Aer Lingus when, at one time, the Aer Lingus aircraft flying and maintenance sectors were very much in harmony given the seasonal nature of both sides of the business?  Would he agree that this should be taken into account rather than perceiving it purely as a way of fragmenting the company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Copthorne hotel group was purchased there was no question of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications or any of his predecessors providing money.  The sale of the hotel group is required because of the heavy burden of debt on the overall company.  It is judicious to dispose of that asset, in terms of acquiring capital in a lump sum which will go towards the reduction of the debt.  That <Col N="400" /> is necessary in order to achieve viability. In better days one could say we will hold on to a hotel chain or other business making money.  In this case we have a problem so it is necessary to dispose of those assets that are not relevant to the resolution of the problem, one of which is the hotel group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I did not get an answer.  Does the Minister consider that the Cahill plan is falling apart, having regard to what is happening today in TEAM and the other difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cyclical problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that in future years they would have profits which would be sufficient to overcome those losses, one would say hold on to the hotel group.  The fact is there has not been a cyclical change, there has been a structural change in the whole aviation business worldwide.  Pre-liberalisation it was possible for profits from a hotel group to help the airline in the bad days but the fact is that both these businesses are cyclical.  The hotel group was not making the profit suggested by the Deputy precisely because the airline group was not carrying the numbers and getting the business.  That the hotel group was doing <Col N="401" /> well when the airline was going badly is not true.  Both were doing badly.  One was doing a little better than the other, making small profits but not profits that would justify retention given the overall size of the financial problem.  It is not true to say we have the luxury of holding on to the hotel chain and waiting for the good times when it will make a contribution. The burden of debt on the main airline company has to be reduced.  As part of the solution, and part of the Cahill plan accepted by all parties, there has to be cost restructuring and judicious disposal of assets, one of which is the Copthorne hotel group.  The financial problems of Aer Lingus will not be resolved without the sale of that hotel group.  That being my main priority, I have called for the sale of the Copthorne hotel group as soon as possible with a view to getting the best market terms available.</P>

      <P>Existing bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the UK for the transmission of information about radiological incidents in UK nuclear power plants are at present of an informal nature.  The EU Commission has stated that these arrangements should be substantiated in a more formal bilateral agreement between both countries. The recommendation was contained in the EU Commission's Opinion of 30 April 1992 concerning THORP discharges issued under Article 37 of the EURATOM treaty to the UK Government. The UK authorities presented me with a draft of such an agreement recently.  However, I consider it to be inadequate and I will be seeking an agreement that will deal with the wide-ranging aspects of nuclear safety, in addition to formalising the present informal arrangements for the exchange of radiological information on incidents at UK plants.</P>

Is there any possibility that the issue of THORP and Sellafield will be dealt with in a legal framework between Ireland and Britain?  Has any agreement of that nature been reached? At summit meetings it does not appear to make headlines, as other important issues of interest to Anglo-Irish relations do?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the option of availing of the arbitration procedure to which he alluded has been considered, despite the attempts of Deputy Gilmore to suggest otherwise.  As I indicated in reply to Deputy Gilmore who has a selective memory, I am having the recent paper by Greenpeace on arbitration under the Paris Convention examined in consultation with the Attorney General.  I also indicated that this question has been considered in detail and it has been found that such an approach would have its limitations in that the convention has little legal weight in relation to discharges of radioactive substances.  I am aware, as a one time law student, that international law places constraints on prospective plaintiffs or applicants in international fora.  Most international law is non-binding and the consent of states is required.  My Department continually examines the question of taking unilateral action showing causal effect which has the prospect of success and is seeking additional evidence in this regard.  I have said that if I am advised that sufficient evidence is available on which a legal case could be taken with a reasonable prospect of success I would have no hesitation in taking such action.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to the question tabled by Deputy Sargent which relates to the possibility of entering into a formal bilateral agreement between this country and Britain in relation to THORP.  In view of the fact that he has done nothing effective to stop THORP being commissioned will the Minister take up the suggestion in the question and enter into a formal arrangement, perhaps an institutional arrangement, between this country and Britain for the proper monitoring of nuclear installations and reprocessing plants in Britain so that we do not have to rely on second-hand, leaked information about leaks and accidents at these plants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought a more wide-ranging formal arrangement.  Under the present informal arrangements nuclear operators in the United Kingdom agreed to report all incidents involving the release of radioactivity to the Department of the Environment's inspectorate of pollution in England.  The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that relevant United Kingdom Ministers are informed quickly about incidents.  Such reports are then transmitted to my Department by the inspectorate of pollution. We believe that this arrangement is deficient in that only incidents where there is a discharge of radioactivity are reported to the inspectorate and, hence, to us.  Other incidents affect the safety of nuclear plants of which we need to be informed and aware in view of widespread public concern in this country. The Deputy may be aware that there are UK Ireland contact group meetings and an informal UK Ireland bilateral agreement on nuclear safety.  We do not accept the recommendation of the Commission that we should formalise the informal arrangements.  We want a wider remit so that we can get more information about other types of incidents apart from the specific incidents covered by the informal arrangements.</P>

      <P>Unilateral action is not the only option.  I am not referring specifically to a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom when I say this. Other member states of the European Union compiled submissions in relation to THORP which do not deal only with the question of discharges but also with procedural and planning matters.  These countries would be willing to join us in an action.  Will the Minister consider the possibility of taking multilateral action, to arbitration initially, and, possibly a legal action?  If it is decided to take unilateral <Col N="408" /> action where does the Minister stand on the question of providing £43 million of taxpayers' money to support the nuclear industry under the EURATOM Treaty?  Is the Minister happy about this at a time when he is vociferous in his opposition to Sellafield?  Is he happy that this should continue while he is vociferous in his opposition to Sellafield and has this option available to him? The Government should let it be known not only in words but in actions how dissatisfied and angry we are at the expansion of Sellafield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>While there were a number of significant achievements in many areas in 1993, the financial performance of the ESB was disappointing. The ESB recorded a net deficit of £21 million in 1993, the first such deficit in four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deterioration in profits is principally attributable to an increase in operating costs which arises mainly from the effects of devaluation of the punt in early 1993 and the introduction of a number of provisions for known future <Col N="409" /> liabilities, in accordance with standard accounting practices.</P>
    <P>Overall, however, the financial position of the company is strong, with net assets increasing by 7 per cent, up from £826 million in 1992 to £884 million, in 1993 and the debt-equity ratio now stands at a very respectable 52 per cent, compared with a debt-equity ratio of 81 per cent in 1983.  The ESB has also reduced its currency exchange risk by significantly increasing the Irish pound content of its debt portfolio.  There was a steady increase in the number of customers and sales of electricity and demand for electricity increased by 4.4 per cent compared to 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When and by how much does the Minister intend to increase the price of electricity?  Does he intend to do to the ESB what he has done to the other State companies under his control?  How many ESB workers does he intend to put on the dole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's propensity to ensure the ESB gets a price increase regardless of what the consumer thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely trying to get information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy information in respect of the present position.  A tripartite cost competitiveness review of the ESB involving my Department, management and unions is taking place to ascertain in what way we can ensure competitiveness of the company in terms of international standards given our peripherality and the importance for our economy of keeping down costs.  The recommendations of that review should be published in August or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be considering an increase or a decrease in the price mechanism of the ESB in the context of its size and the necessity to maintain maximum efficiency.  We are talking about a captive market involving one major operator. There is a responsibility on Government <Col N="410" /> and the company to ensure that cost increases are not passed on to the customer because the customer does not have an option of getting his or her electricity cheaper anywhere else.  In the context of a monopoly supplier, we must ensure that costs are not passed on.  Prior to consideration of any such proposal, we would have to ensure that the company is efficient enough to absorb such increased costs.  That is the purpose of holding a cost competitiveness review.</P>
    <P>The ESB has been seeking an increase for some time but that has not happened. Had a price increase been acceded to on every occasion on which it was sought our economy might not be as competitive as it is.  Energy costs have been a major factor in stimulating competitiveness in our economy.  One must not pass on costs to the consumer before being satisfied that a full review of efficiency has taken place.  It is in the interests of the consumer and the economy in general that costs are not passed on in a captive market position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that he is telling the ESB consumers &mdash; who will be relieved &mdash; that there will not be an increase in the price of electricity?  In regard to electricity supply, is it true that it is the Minister's intention to allow private companies to compete with the ESB for the supply of electricity and that in so doing it is his intention to allow those companies to purchase electricity at cost from the ESB, to distribute it through the ESB network and, effectively, to act as an electricity brokerage system competing directly with the ESB without carrying its overheads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not take it that there will be an increase or decrease in the price of electricity until the cost competitiveness review is completed and we are in a position to make rational decisions.  A reorganisation of the ESB is taking place based on the McKinsey recommendations which I approved this time last year.  I intend to introduce an electricity Bill early next <Col N="411" /> year when the necessary legislative provisions are in place.  It is envisaged that there will be transparency in the generation, distribution and supply of electricity of the ESB.  Individual cost centres will be set up to monitor efficiency and assist the ESB, as a corporate body, to deliver the best possible service to the consumer.  A peat fired electricity generating station is proposed and I have to consult with Government in that regard when tenders for the building of that station will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the comments of the chief executive at the publication of the annual report of the ESB that it would be seeking a price increase?  As was the case yesterday with the TEAM Aer Lingus workforce, the Minister is capable of being very macho when he wishes.  Will he, in his inimitable macho style, instruct the ESB that no price increase will be sanctioned in view of the negative effect it would have on employment and competitiveness and the hardship it would impose on householders who cannot afford an increase in the price of electricity this winter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know who is jumping and it is not me.  I am aware of the statement of the chief executive.  Not only will the ESB be applying for an increase, it lodged an application with my Department some time ago.  As Minister I am responsible, on behalf of the shareholder, to ensure that price increases are not always passed on to the captive customer. A cost competitiveness review and a capital expenditure review are being undertaken in an effort to ascertain in what way we can maximise the use of the existing plant which would result in deferred capital expenditure and reduce costs in the future.  In fairness to the ESB, <Col N="412" /> it must also assess its investment plans and projections for the future and be able to finance them.  We have to make decisions on the basis of what is necessary and prudent and in the best interests of everybody concerned.  As soon as those reviews are completed we can have a rational discussion at Question Time and I will not pre-empt their outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the Government's commitment to low inflation?  Today I heard Mr. Conlon say he was seeking an increase in bus and rail fares and now there is a request for an increase in ESB bills.  Can the Minister not get a grip on the semi-State bodies, tell them that Government policy is one of low inflation and that increases will not be given?  Will he assure the House that he will protect the interests of consumers and thoroughly resist any proposed increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's attempt to be macho.  It was not convincing, but he is doing a good job.  The question of semi-State bodies is a separate matter.  However, applications for price increases will be made and should be properly considered.  As said by Mr. Conlon and others, the semi-State bodies have to pay the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> rates, incur costs, maximise efficiency, look to their revenue capacity and how it can make a bigger contribution given the public service obligations imposed upon them. Compared with the rather sheltered view the Deputy has of the semi-State sector &mdash; I know he is not a great friend of that sector &mdash; I would have a far more balanced approach and the consumer can be sure that I will uphold their interests in dealing with proposals that have come before me, all of which will be justified, if necessary, in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent claims made by a former plutonium chemist at Sellafield (details supplied) that the proposed underground nuclear waste dump at the Sellafield plant in Cumbria could turn into an uncontrollable plutonium-fuelled nuclear reactor and could result in serious water pollution in view of the implications for radiation levels in the Irish Sea; the representations, if any, he has made to the British authorities regarding the dump; the response, if any, he has received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent claims, by a former plutonium chemist at Sellafield with regard to the proposed underground waste repository at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>UK Nirex Ltd. the British nuclear industry's waste disposal executive, has delayed the submission of a planning application for the proposed repository because of the need to carry out further research into the complex geology and water flow beneath Sellafield.  The possibility of water being contaminated and plutonium being concentrated in the way described in the recent claims will be investigated by Nirex before a final decision on the construction of a repository is taken.  The investigation will take place in a rock characterisation facility in the vicinity of the site proposed for the repository.  The intention is that the results of this investigation will be taken into account during the planning of the repository and during the appraisal of any subsequent application.</P>
      <P>In our submission on THORP of October 1993, the Government expressed grave concern about the construction of such a facility at Sellafield.  My Department, with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Geological Survey of Ireland, will continue to monitor developments with regard to the proposed repository.  If the repository is to proceed an environmental impact assessment and a public inquiry will be an intrinsic part of any planning permission process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is <Col N="414" /> aware of the claims made by the former plutonium chemist at Sellafield that this Nirex dump could result in serious water contamination, pollution of drinking water and so on.  Since the report became public knowledge last January, what attempts have been made to have a study of these claims carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute, the Department or an independent body?  Is it the Minister's intention to rely on the doubtful validity of any examination carried out by Nirex which, clearly, has a vested interest in proceeding with the dump?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Environmental radioactivity monitoring is carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to determine the effects of radioactive discharges on the Irish marine environment and on the Irish Sea.  The effects are quantified by the institute in some detail through their analyses of fish and shellfish collected from the principal fishing ports and of seaweed, sediment and sea water from selected locations around the Irish coastline.</P>
      <P>There were significant reductions in radioactive effluents from Sellafield during the early 1980s.  Since then there has been a further slow decline in contamination levels.  Even with the start-up of THORP, Sellafield will still represent about 0.2 per cent of a person's present total radiation dose from all sources of radiation, the great bulk of which are natural.  Although the principal objective of our monitoring programme is to obtain an estimate of the radiation exposure of the Irish public, it also enables us to detect unrecorded discharges, examine trends and generally relate quantities reported as having been discharged with the institute's monitoring results.  This information is regularly published in the form of reports by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the repository going ahead, there is a delay relating to a planning application on which some work is being done.  If a planning application is made, we will oppose it and will be involved in making submissions on the environmental impact assessment in the <Col N="415" /> public inquiry if they proceed.  At the moment there is no decision to proceed but we will monitor developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of reading the second page of his brief, will the Minister answer the question I put to him?  What has he done since last January to have the report of the Sellafield chemist examined by the appropriate Irish agencies? Am I to take it from his reply that nothing has been done to examine this report other than normal, ongoing monitoring and to which the second page of his brief referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question, presumably, arises from the newspaper report.  The RPII continues to monitor the situation and in the event of any development we will make our position clear.  We already noted in October 1993 that we objected to the notion of such a repository and we will stick to that in the event of any developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that although the radiation levels in the Irish Sea are low they are still, particularly in the Carlingford area, about four times what they are on the west coast, and that there is no basis for celebrating the RPII report?  Will he also accept that THORP and this particular repository represents the possibility of a much greater level of contamination, whether by continuous discharge or accident?  Instead of simply opposing it, will the Minister propose the option of dry storage &mdash; hardly a solution but a stopgap &mdash; rather than a repository? Will he try to pre-empt the planning application so that we are not faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> as we have been until now in regard to other nuclear industry products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says with regard to the levels of radioactivity between one coast and another.  The absolute levels in terms of what is and is not safe are what concerns us.  On the question of the RPII report, it is not for me to either celebrate or denigrate it.  Its findings are scientifically based.  The RPII <Col N="416" /> gives the facts based on its monitoring the position.  Its independence must be assured and I would not interfere with what it publishes based on the scientific data it collects.  The percentages I am giving are based on the scientific data compiled by the RPII on our behalf.</P>
      <P>On the planning application, whether we like it or not there is a nuclear industry in Britain which has the right to make a planning application to the relevant planning authorities but whatever third party rights are available to us will be taken up.  They will undertake an environmental impact assessment and a public inquiry and we will make our views known based on the facts.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has advised me that the Irish Sea contains 13.7 units of radioactivity per kilogram.  This compares with 14.6 units in the eastern Mediterranean, 15 units in the Red Sea and 22 units in the Persian Gulf.  There were significant reductions in radioactive effluents from Sellafield during the early 1980s and since then there has been a further slow decline in contamination levels.  A new £600 million complex of five clean-up plants, known as low-active effluent treatment plants, recently started operations at Sellafield which is expected to reduce yet further the radioactive content of discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea. As I indicated, the Government expressed grave concern about the proposed repository at Sellafield.  If it is to proceed, both an environmental impact study and a public inquiry will be necessary and we will make our views known as that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the liberalisation process of recent years, the role of Governments in controlling and <Col N="417" /> regulating air fares has been progressively reduced.  Under European Union rules and the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement, which apply to most air services to-from Ireland, airlines serving Ireland are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment, subject to certain safeguards. I have no statutory function in relation to the determining of fares for services provided by ferry operators.  This is a matter solely for the commercial judgment of individual operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that access costs are still a major barrier to growth in the tourism industry?  For example, a flight from San Francisco to Dublin during the high season costs up to $900 whereas a flight from San Francisco to London by Leisure Air costs $541.  The incentive is there to travel through other destinations, and London is certainly more competitive than Dublin.  I am sure the Minister agrees that people spend some time in the place at which they arrive.  Surely, as Minister responsible for Aer Rianta, the Minister has control over landing costs here which are way out of line with other airports such as Luton.  Will the Minister comment on landing costs which form part of the access costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Landing costs are reasonably competitive with those in other airports &mdash; the Deputy picked one airport that is more favourable than our State airports.  Aer Rianta, in a recent marketing initiative, sought in certain circumstances to reduce landing charges to increase traffic and I understand that initiative has been reasonably successful. If the Deputy puts down a separate question on that matter I will give him details on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the common rating, realistically Aer Lingus is the only Irish carrier for the purposes of common rating because of its network of routes and its access to Heathrow.  However, common rating is a matter for the airlines to decide.  The pricing policy of Aer Lingus must be in line with its commercial mandate and at <Col N="418" /> the same time it must try to attract as many passengers as possible.  The rationalisation, in seeking to reduce the cost structure, has provided much more competitive access fares, particularly on the New York route.  The number of people travelling to Dublin and Shannon by Aer Lingus on transatlantic routes increased by more than 21 per cent up to June this year.  That is a significant increase considering that in previous years the numbers were static or declining.  Progress is being made, but we must not become complacent.  Cheaper access fares contribute to the suitability of Ireland as a tourist destination.  These are matters we will continue to consider, but in the main they are management matters for the airline to decide.  As regards ferries, again these are matters for the operators to decide.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Carey &mdash; the fact that Aeroflot's presence has resulted in the availability of cheap aviation fuel at Shannon, thus giving the airport a competitive edge; and whether the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications considered the consequences for the airport if this competitive edge is lost in deciding not <Col N="450" /> to grant Aeroflot pick-up rights, thus resulting in the possibility that it may withdraw its presence in Shannon; (2) Deputy Connaughton &mdash; the lack of tunding for the Williamstown sewerage scheme, County Galway, and the progress, if any, to date on the matter; (3) Deputy Moynihan-Cronin &mdash; the confiscation of privately-owned boats on the Lakes of Killarney; (4) Deputy Durkan &mdash; the action it is proposed to take to resolve the dispute with directors of community care in the various health boards having regard to the hardship being caused to the disabled, the handicapped and the most vulnerable in society as a result of this dispute; (5) Deputy Connor &mdash; the need to make new regulations to protect fisheries such as the River Lung, County Roscommon, from acts of destruction such as the major fish kill recently on the river; (6) Deputy Frances Fitzgerald &mdash; the care arrangements for a 15 year old boy (details supplied) in the past three weeks; and the need to address the crisis in the provision of appropriate residential care for young people; (7) An Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív &mdash; an gá atá ann go dtabharfar deontas méadaithe réachtála do na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta le cuidiú leo obair fhorbartha atá ar bun acu a dhéanamh go sásúil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Quill refers to the necessity for approval by both Houses of <Col N="451" /> the Oireachtas for developments in the vicinity of national monuments.  The Deputy rightly said that there is a possibility that a monument could be taken over by one Minister while permission to use the land in its vicinity could be granted by another.  Responsibility for planning permission rests with the local authority and that is its function alone. My understanding from the most recent controversies is that the Department must apply for planning permission and, therefore, it is not a case of a Minister deciding that a certain building is a national monument and that he will give one of his cronies planning permission for a fast food restaurant in the locality.</P>
      <P>We have to rely on the planning process and the discretion of local authority members to interpret what is appropriate to provide in the vicinity of a national monument.  Deputy Quill's point is valid to the extent that a number of serious mistakes were made in the planning process over the years.  Perhaps the developments may have been perceived as genuine initially but the practical result of what has transpired in a number of cases has been wrong.</P>
      <P>If we wish to promote our heritage, it is necessary to make planners and members of local authorities aware that the setting is intrinsic to a national monument. The Minister needs to address that concern clearly.  People must understand that the designation of a national monument is very important for a number of specific and traditional reasons and it should not be destroyed for irrelevant or political considerations, for instance, by a development by which someone sees the opportunity to make a fast buck in the locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 addresses some of the issues.  Under this section there is accountability in the process.  The permission of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is required in addition to the agreement of the Minister <Col N="452" /> for Finance, both of whom are accountable to the Dáil and beyond both is the planning process.  If amendment No. 13 was accepted it would create such a cumbersome process that the norm would be impeded in the interests of seeking to deal with the unusual.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 22, to delete &ldquo;The Commissioners may establish and maintain&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Minister shall ensure that there will be established and maintained&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We usually debate the question of using &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;, but as the Minister uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in amendment No. 16 there is no need to waste time debating that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne is very helpful.  Deputy Creed's amendment No. 15 sought to create an obligation to have a register in place but if amendment No. 16 is accepted, the register will be mandatory and the Commissioners of Public Works will be primarily responsible for it.  In so far as they are the people primarily involved, it is appropriate for the onus to be laid on them to keep the register that Deputy Creed sought.  Amendment No. 16 addresses the need adverted to in amendment No. 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  The consequence of setting up a register is that it is used and that the people are made aware of its existence.  It is necessary to inform tourism promotion <Col N="453" /> outlets of this.  The schools in the locality and in the county should also be made aware and schoolchildren encouraged to visit local national monuments so that they become imbued with a sense of their history and tradition.  We are aware that ring forts and other areas of historical interest are destroyed on a constant basis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a register. Its display and use is critical, otherwise it is like having a book on a shelf, if it is not thumbed through, read and understood it is of little value.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  When the owner or occupier (being the Commissioners) of a monument or place which has been recorded under subsection (1) of this section or any person proposes to carry out, or to cause or permit the carrying out of, any work at or in relation to such monument or place, he shall give notice in writing of his proposal to carry out the work to the relevant local authority and shall not, except in the case of urgent necessity and with the consent of the Minister, commence the work for a period of two months after having given the notice.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a precautionary measure to ensure that notice is given to the relevant local authority so that it will be made aware of any proposed work to be carried out.  An exception is made for work of urgent necessity where the Minister's consent only will be required.  Perhaps the period of notice of two months is a little long but it gives notice to the local authorities so that people will not arrive and start <Col N="454" /> work overnight that nobody knows about.  The local authority may have strong views about the work that needs to be carried out and the owner also may like to plan the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the point being made but I am not satisfied as to the practicality or desirability of the amendment except as it concerns work to be carried out in significant heritage buildings owned by the public authorities.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said that the principle raised by the Deputy in this amendment would be more appropriate for forthcoming legislation on the Heritage Council and I have included a section in the recently published Bill to deal with heritage buildings owned by public authorities.  With regard to national monuments apart from heritage buildings in general, section 90 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, already provides that nothing in that Act shall restrict, prejudice or affect the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under the National Monuments Act in relation to national monuments.  The change requested in this amendment would be a radical departure in procedure and I am not satisfied that a compelling case has been put forward that necessitates such an important change. In any event, the Deputy might be satisfied to note that the Heritage Council will provide a committee structure within which I can be advised on policy priorities for national monuments and I am satisfied that this matter could be appropriately examined in that forum.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of amendment No. 17 might defeat its purpose because two months' notice would be required before carrying out essential normal work, and that would be impractical.  I believe I have addressed the spirit of the amendment in the other legislation published since we first discussed this amendment.</P>

      <P>If I recall correctly, when we discussed this issue on Committee Stage we moved from Deputy Creed's amendment to discussing whether the four day requirement in section 16 was too onerous, taking into account weekends and bank holidays.  I have looked at the provision again and I am satisfied that it represents a reasonable balance between the need for early <Col N="456" /> reporting and the circumstances in which individuals could find themselves.  The four day requirement, which was established in the National Monuments Act, 1987, came from a recommendation of the National Monuments Advisory Council which advised on the original provisions of that Act.  It has struck the right balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's clarification, I agree that a reasonable balance has been struck.  A 100 year old wreck will obviously be located in a remote place.  Many people who might take part in weekend or four day diving expeditions may make such a discovery at the end of the expedition. Their base may be located on an offshore island and, perhaps due to inclement weather conditions, it might well be two or three days before they can properly draw up their report.  Even mobile telephones may not operate in such remote areas.  It would be difficult, therefore, to report such a find immediately.  This is a reasonable compromise from the Minister and we will withdraw the amendment in the light of the Minister's clarification.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 18, after &ldquo;objection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;written, oral or both)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It might appear unnecessary to insert the words &ldquo;written, oral or both&rdquo;, but I am currently dealing with a problem that arose because a telephone message was not accepted, although the person who made the call was of the view that a telephone message was sufficient.  Perhaps this amendment may not be necessary but it clarifies whether the objection is written, oral or both.  We are simply suggesting that an objection can be made orally or in writing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Browne.  The old saying in rural areas is that an agreement is not binding unless it is in writing.  Whether a county council <Col N="457" /> is acquiring a patch of ground or there is an agreement between two people, two organisations or an individual and an organisation, it is imperative such agreements are in writing.  The Programme for Government is in writing.  The elements of it that have been recommended orally have not been delivered on and it is important, therefore, that any such notice be given orally, in writing or both. I recommend strongly to the Minister that he accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not willing to accept the amendment although I can support it.  I believe objections should be in writing and, given the nature of the decision required by both the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Finance, any objections raised will have to be specific.  There will also be a need for clarity and transparency throughout the entire process if public confidence is to be maintained.  I appreciate the support for this that Deputies opposite have offered.</P>
      <P>For example, third parties may be involved and if we are to enhance public confidence it is useful that if there are to be objections, they should be in writing. It is necessary for the adequate implementation of the legislation that any objections to be taken into account should be in writing.  That is not unreasonable because objectors have two months following notice being given to make such objections.  Within the two month period one should indicate the grounds for the objections.  Anybody else affected has the right to object in the interests of public transparency.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the positive contributions of Deputies, particularly the spokespersons, Deputies Browne, Kenny and Quill, and the spirit <Col N="458" /> they brought to the different Stages of the Bill.  I sought to address the points raised by them because they were made with the intention of improving the legislation. I hope I addressed many of the points raised in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>I sent our Front Bench spokesperson to America on important cultural duties, namely, to support our national team.  For that reason, Deputy Browne was asked to deal with the amendments before the House.  I hope this legislation will prove to be beneficial in its intent and in its effect and that where transgressions occur, the rigour of the law will be brought to bear by the Minister.  In so far as the protection of our valuable archaeological sites and important antiquities is concerned, the Minister can be assured of our support in the implementation of this Bill.  I wish the Minister well and I hope the Bill will prove to be successful legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister also on the manner in which he has brought this legislation before the House. He has been open to ideas and suggestions from members of the Opposition and I appreciate the manner in which he has accepted a number of amendments tabled by me on Committee Stage.  This legislation gives effect to the Supreme Court judgment in the Derrynaflan case and from now on it will be more difficult for any citizen here or elsewhere to take any item of heritage and convert it into personal gain and, by so doing, deprive our citizens and future generations of their natural birthright.  That is to be commended.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains provisions for the protection of archaeological objects.  I am not so certain that it provides the same level of protection to archaeological monuments.  Perhaps this is a matter for wider debate later because, apart from the other implications, most of the archaeological objects about which we speak tend to be found in the environs of national monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we have four national monuments Acts and I would be <Col N="459" /> reassured about the future of our heritage if those Acts were consolidated in one Act.  The Minister is a little more than a year in office and already he has made great strides in introducing new legislation but I ask him to consider the possibility of having one Act dealing with all items of heritage, whether they be archaeological objects or monuments.  I do not wish to have another debate on the terms of my amendment No. 13 which were concerned about any buildings that might be erected in the environs of national monuments.  There are no more than 60 or 70 national monuments of huge significance that need to be protected, with their environs, from undue development which would take from their importance.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing in amendment No. 12 in which he has made it a condition that only facilities deemed to be appropriate by the Minister will be permitted.  I considered &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; a loose term in the Bill as originally drafted and this is a major improvement.  It is an area which I may have to again confront depending on how this develops.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the nature of developments that might be put in place in the environs of national monuments in the years ahead.  Perhaps this matter can be dealt with in the context of a more comprehensive and integrated Bill which I hope the Minister plans to bring forward in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>As well as having the legislation in place, it is important to have voluntary bodies who will create the conditions that will enable the provisions of the Bill to be fully implemented and observed.  It is time to set up the Historical Monuments National Council which was promised in 1984.  The National Heritage Council must be given statutory functions to enable it to play its part in preserving our heritage and creating a culture that will give it the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Director of the National Museum will not have the resources, manpower or money, to ensure that all the provisions in the legislation <Col N="460" /> will be fully met.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this does not happen.  If it does, we will be left with law which will be very convincing on paper but which will not achieve its aims, which will be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works does very little to draw attention to the existence of our national monuments.  Usually there is a plaque which states: &ldquo;this is a national monument.  It is in the ownership of ... and any attempt to deface it will be punishable by law&rdquo;.  It is a pity that plaques do not explain the history, background and importance of a national monument to those &mdash; probably most of us &mdash; who do not know about it, its historical importance, the period to which it belongs, its artistic importance, etc.  Such a plaque would add greatly to public appreciation of our monuments.  I ask the Minister to ensure that finance is available to carry out such work.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the extraordinary amount of work he put into bringing the legislation before the House. I hope it is successful and wish good luck to the Director of the National Museum, on whose shoulders it falls to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their co-operation.  The core of the legislation, which will go to the President for signature, is that it takes the Finlay judgment, the case of Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland, and in bold print states that the heritage of Ireland is the property of its people and affirms that.  It sets up mechanisms to protect our heritage in areas of uncertainty and extends matters of registration. It should be seen in context with the heritage council legislation which I have just published and which will establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Having put legislation in place and used the heritage council legislation to generate policy and assist public consciousness, we will spend money on improving public awareness of what people own in their own name and what they must protect in the name of future generations.</P>

The way in which this is done will be a matter for discussion at that stage.  The interim board is limited in its scope and lifespan and some of its main functions will be transferred to the new authority once it is established.</P>

      <P>The guarantees and facilities of the interim board to obtain grant aid are regarded as a way of giving the Dún Laoghaire project a kick start. Will these facilities remain in place under the new authority and, if so, will similar facilities be available to other harbour authorities?</P>

      <P>It is a matter for other authorities to come forward with their proposals.  When I was Minister for the Marine I made special arrangements for the development of Waterford port &mdash; the Waterford port authority put forward <Col N="463" /> proposals for consideration by the Government and the Department of the Marine and special financial facilities were arranged.  The guarantees and financial arrangements of the interim board are long term and obviously one has to provide for their continuation.  When I say they will be subsumed into the new authority I do not mean this will be done on a line by line basis but rather they will be continued and subsumed in principle into the new authority.  This will not happen for some time and there will be an opportunity to discuss how this should be done at that stage.  By continuing this facility the Department of the Marine will be able to proceed with the work at the harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I can refer to it during the debate on a later amendment.  My amendment sought to insert the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;.  Later amendments in my name propose that the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority should be established on a statutory basis rather than establishing a funding mechanism to raise a loan for one development. I say this for a number of reasons. The interim harbour board has already been in existence for a number of years and its membership is out of date &mdash; a number of members were nominated by the previous Dún Laoghaire Borough Council prior to the 1991 local elections and the establishment of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I am not in any way reflecting on the ability of these members or on the way they <Col N="464" /> carry out their duties &mdash; they are doing a very fine job &mdash; but it underscores the fact that the composition of the interim harbour board is somewhat dated.</P>
      <P>There will be two interim boards in Dún Laoghaire.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour is managed by the Department of the Marine.  Policy for the harbour is being considered by the interim harbour board and the finance for the project will be raised by another interim board.  It is the height of absurdity to have three different arms of State dealing with one harbour. The harbour authority should be established now instead of waiting for the more substantial legislation dealing with all the major harbours and the establishment of semi-State companies for them.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour is in a unique position in the sense that it is owned by the Department of the Marine and the parameters for its future development have been under consideration for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced to facilitate the development of the new ferry facility, which I support.  However, the definition of development in section 1, which is fairly wide, does not relate specifically to a development for the new HSS vessel.  Is it intended that this legislation will facilitate further developments in the harbour?  I strongly agree with the development of new ferry facilities, but I would not be prepared to give a <i>carte blanche</i> agreement to other possible developments which might occur and which this legislation could be used to facilitate.  Specifically, will it be possible under this legislation for the fund which is being established to be used effectively to give State guaranteed loans to the developers of private marina facilities within Dún Laoghaire harbour?  During the term of office of the previous Taoiseach controversy arose about the development of a private marina in the coal harbour, the part of Dún Laoghaire harbour used by the general public.  I would not like to see a situation arising whereby the very generous definition of development contained in the Bill could be used to facilitate the funding of developments in Dún Laoghaire harbour <Col N="465" /> which were not intended by those of us who support the development of the ferry facilities.  I would like the Minister to address that point and to put on the record that the sole intention of the Bill is to facilitate the development of the ferry facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim board has suggested various developments in the harbour generally.  Any developments within the harbour area will be subject to full planning permission, so they will be totally transparent and subject to a fairly painstaking process of consultation.  The Minister is being very forthright about that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a funding mechanism for development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  There is no point in endeavouring to limit or circumscribe the Minister in any way. The Deputy need have no fears in relation to development because of the approach of the Minister and his Department. That procedure is in line with the Government's policy generally to engage in maximum consultation and subject any proposed developments to full planning permission.</P>
      <P>The purpose here is to allow us get on with the job.  As we near the end of this parliamentary session, if the arrangements are put in place for this development and if planning permission is granted, we can move ahead.  If planning permission is not given there can be no progress.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board about which we had had some discussion before he came into the House.  The arrangements for the final board are nearing completion.  I expect they will be dealt with in the autumn session.  Certainly the Bill will be published by the autumn session.  We can have the full, final board as soon as is desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies can bear in mind the experiences of the interim board, even the experiences of people who were appointed representing local authorities. That presents the problem of when those representatives change and what one <Col N="466" /> does in the new circumstances.  The people who served on that board were dedicated local representatives, who put much time and energy into the development plan, in addition to overall consultation. Lessons will have been learned which can be discussed when finalising the arrangements for the establishment of the full board.  I always had in mind that there should be representation of the local authority on that board.  There may be people who would have a different view from mine on how that representation is arranged to ensure reasonable continuity.  The Deputy raised issues which must be addressed when it comes to the establishment of the final board. For example, what will happen when somebody is no longer a member of the relevant local authority?  All those matters can be discussed in full on the main Bill which will be published very soon.</P>
    <P>Members on both sides of the House have said how much they appreciate the work undertaken by the interim board and what they have achieved in the overall process to date.  There is no questioning the bona fides of the people who participated in that interim board.</P>
    <P>In the case of the board we are now discussing, the Dun Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board, one possibility, when the Minister makes appointments, is that he will provide a link with the interim board.  That arises on a later section.</P>

What guarantee do we have that the people who will be appointed to the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board will be members of the interim harbour board?  There is no provision in the Bill to ensure that will be the case.</P>

      <P>The history of the management <Col N="467" /> of Dún Laoghaire Harbour leaves an awful lot to be desired.  This harbour had been managed by the Office of Public Works.  Then, for some strange reason, rather than establish a harbour authority, the management was transferred to the Department of the Marine which then established the interim board which has been in existence for a long time.  Rather than introduce legislation establishing a harbour authority to perform the functions outlined in this Bill, we are to have another board called the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board and there may not be any link between the two.  The reason there should be a link between them is that, in the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; the interim harbour board has acted as though it was set up statutorily.  It has prepared a development plan which has been on public display, presented to the local authority and so on.  The importance of having the interim harbour board responsible for the disbursement of moneys for development is evident because that board will guarantee that work will proceed in accordance with the development plan whereas, if there is to be a different group of people, they may not agree with the proposals of the interim harbour board.  I should like the Minister to give the House a guarantee that the members to be appointed to this finance board will be members of the interim harbour board.  This should be written into the Bill, therby ensuring continuity, with the harbour authority or harbour board being linked to the finance board, so that we will not have another body operating separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not stipulate that this development will be confined solely to the building of the new ferry terminal facility.  The Minister has accepted that it could relate to other developments.  We want to ensure that any other developments comply with the development plan already prepared.  There is not much point in stipulating that each application will have to come before the planning authority.  The point is the manner in which the harbour will be developed and <Col N="468" /> what exactly will be put in place.  Will the Minister give the House a categorical assurance that the members of the finance board will be members of the interim harbour board and, if necessary, have this written into the legislation?</P>

      <P>We had some discussion on this last evening.  This Bill is principally a device for raising the money to undertake the things the Minister wishes to do resulting from the plans prepared by the interim board.  As time goes on and the board comes into being these functions will be subsumed.</P>
      <P>In appointing members to the board the Minister would take into account its specialist financial function.  To some extent it is like the National Treasury Management Agency.  It is a separate body whose purpose is to raise moneys for the development of the ferry terminal project.  The Minister would then consider people with the necessary specialist financial expertise as well as management expertise and would, presumably, take into account the fact that the harbour is owned and operated by the Department. He would also look at the linkage with the existing interim Dublin harbour board.  It is only a short term arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising a very specific point about the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; because the term runs through the Bill.  The proposed development of the new terminal facility is before An Bord Pleanála.  In the event that An Bord Pleanála gives it planning permission, the Minister is anxious to proceed with the development because of the deadline of summer 1995 by which Stena Sealink wishes to commence the operation.  I am happy to agree with that and to facilitate it.  For a variety of reasons it is necessary to set up this mechanism to raise the loan and to provide the funds.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the ferry facility which is currently before An Bord Pleanála.  What I am concerned about is that the mechanism we are establishing in this Bill could be used afterwards to provide funding for other development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour which might not enjoy the same degree of support from the general public and which certainly would not enjoy my support.  I will strongly oppose developments of the type proposed some years ago when the area which is used by local boat owners and so on was avariciously earmarked by private developers for a private marina.  I would like an assurance from the Minister, given the broad definition of development, that it is the intention to confine the use of this Bill to the ferry facility.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister for the Marine has done in making a planning application for the ferry development. As the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, has said, there was not a legal obligation on the Minister for the Marine to do that.  That is appreciated and I acknowledge that it was an open way of approaching the matter.  We should have some assurance that this Bill will not be used beyond the development of the ferry teminal facilities which will proceed in the next 12 months if approved by An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that there are no plans for anything else.  That is the position at present.  In the event of anything coming up both the interim <Col N="470" /> board and the long term board have the facility to deal with it and the Minister has the power to put matters before the planning process.  When you leave aside some powers you can create technical and legal problems.  That matter will come up later.  There may be small tasks to be done at the harbour occasionally.  If you go out and look at harbours you will see all sorts of activities taking place which are relevant to the current state of the harbour.  That is normal.  There are no plans for anything else and the Minister has made it absolutely clear that as far as he and the Government are concerned any developments would go through the full planning process.  Nobody need have any fears or worries about that.</P>

      <P>Here we have amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Bradford, Gilmore and Keogh. I observe that amendments Nos. 1a and 1b are related.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 1a and 1b together if that is satisfactory.  These amendments can be found on the white additional list of amendments of 22 June 1994.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;, and be deemed always to have had,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment relates to the retrospective nature of the Bill and is at the kernel of my concern about the passage of this legislation.  A person reading through the explanatory memorandum would be informed that section 2 confirms the development powers of the Minister in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  When one examines the Bill in greater detail not only is it clear that the Minister's powers are confirmed but he is deemed &ldquo;always to have had power to carry out ... development in Dún <Col N="471" /> Laoghaire Harbour&rdquo;.  In that regard it is major retrospective legislation.  People are concerned about this section for a number of reasons, not least that the An Bord Pleanála jury is still adjudicating on the appeal.  It would appear that certain parts of the argument before An Bord Pleanála relate to whether the Minister had or had not certain powers to do certain works.</P>
    <P>The Bill is putting in place a section which will state that the Minister did have these powers.  In a sense it could be seen as an attempt to second guess An Bord Pleanála and to put in place a mechanism whereby, regardless of what An Bord Pleanála may decide, section 2 will have taken care of the problem long before it occurs.  My amendment proposes the deletion of the retrospective provision of the Bill, that we remove from section 2 the provision that the Minister always had the power to carry out developments and provide in its place that the Minister shall have powers for future developments. I am concerned about the retrospective nature of this section.  Many people who have contacted me have also stated that concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured us that the purpose of this straightforward legislation is to put a mechanism in place to fund development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  If that is the case we should not insert a provision under which it will apply retrospectively.  I appeal to the Minister to accept our amendment as this would reassure many of these who have doubts about the legislation and certain development works.  It would also help remove any conspiracy theory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have complimented the Minister for the Marine on his decision to seek planning permission for development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour, but in this instance he is adopting a belt and braces approach.  One could argue that if An Bord Pleanála turn down the application for planning permission for this development the Minister could say he did not need permission in the first <Col N="472" /> instance and proceed on that basis.  That fear has been expressed.  On the other hand, people may say that because the Minister did not need to obtain planning permission it is invalid and there is a fear that it may be challenged through the appeals process.</P>
      <P>There is a suspicion about this section that there is a wish to circumvent the planning process.  I do not necessarily hold the view but if we are to be assured that there is openness and transparency we need to have our fears allayed.  The easiest way to do this is to accept the amendment and delete the offending phrase.  I do not believe in conspiracy theories given that I am aware that the planning decisions of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council of which I am a member are subject to intense scrutiny. The Minister would go a long way towards allaying our fears by accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Bradford and Keogh.  As a matter of general principle, it is bad to introduce legislation which will apply retrospectively and which states that the Minister has always had a certain power.  I am at a loss to understand what this is all about.  The Minister applied for and was granted planning permission by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for a development in Dún Laoghaire which is now the subject of a third party appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  This will be decided in the course of time.  The purpose of this legislation is to put a mechanism in place to fund that development if it is approved by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this legislation the Minister will have the power &ldquo;to carry out, or procure the carrying out of development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour&rdquo;.  I am seeking to amend that provision to ensure that the Minister would have to apply for and obtain planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. While I appreciate the Minister for the Marine applied for planning permission for the ferry terminal development I am not sure that he did not have to, that it was a cut and dried case.  I recall that <Col N="473" /> there was a long debate on the question of whether planning permission would be required for a marine development.  It centred on the question of whether the land ended at the high water mark. Absurd distinctions were made and it was claimed that planning permission would be required for the portion of the marina adjoining the land while it would not be required for the floating apparatus. There should be a general obligation on the Minister for the Marine to apply for permission for developments at this harbour.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation it will be deemed that the Minister always had this power to carry out development at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  What work has the Minister carried out at the harbour for which he requires retrospective approval?  I am not aware of anything the Minister might have done for which he requires retrospective approval from the Oireachtas.  If there is something that is troubling his conscience I do not think this is the way to deal with it.  We should not be asked to give <i>carte blanche</i> retrospective approval because, as Deputy Keogh said, it is fuelling speculation that there is a hidden agenda being pursued, that things are being done or have been done behind people's backs for which blanket retrospective approval is required.</P>

That is the reason I am facilitating the quick passage of this legislation which was <Col N="474" /> landed on our desks at short notice. However, I am not prepared to insert in it a provision which will apply retrospectively. I do not see what the purpose behind it is.  I am not aware of any development carried out by the Minister at Dún Laoghaire Harbour for which he requires retrospective approval.  I do not see the necessity for it and it is unhelpful in the context of the public debate now taking place to insert it in the Bill.  It should be removed.</P>
      <P>There is a need in the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour for transparency and openness.  Nothing should be done behind closed doors, it should be above board.  The Minister is in a unique position in that the three Deputies on the Opposition benches, each of whom represents the constituency, support the development and want it to go ahead but I do not want this legislation to apply retrospectively.  This provision is unnecessary, unhelpful and unwanted and should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am confused as to why this section was inserted.  All five Deputies in the Dún Laoghaire constituency have publicly supported this development.  I consistently fought for the establishment of a harbour authority that would produce a development plan which would be publicly displayed.  I accepted that every development would have to be approved by the planning authority.  That is what has happened in the case of the ferry developments.  It is regrettable that some people found it necessary to appeal the decision of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to An Bord Pleanála.  We cannot deny people their right in law to lodge an appeal in respect of a planning permission. However, we do not want whispering campaigns about the Dáil passing legislation to ensure that if it does not get its way with An Bord Pleanála the development will proceed regardless.  In the past eight or nine years, we fought long and hard for the establishment of a harbour authority, for transparency and for local people to have an input into any development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> I do not see the necessity for the inclusion of section 2 because if power is transferred to the harbour authority in the future, it will submit the planning applications.  At present the Minister is responsible for the management of the harbour because the interim board has not been put on a statutory basis and he has lodged his planning application.  Why do we need this section?  Will the Minister take into account the points we have made?  We are not opposed to the development or trying to make life awkward for the Minister.  We are trying to maintain something we fought long and hard to achieve, namely, a sense of openness and transparency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no hidden agenda in this regard and Deputies should be clear about that.  This is an open, up front and direct agenda for the speedy development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. One could sit back and say to those who wish to invest in the area that legislation will be introduced later, but that is not the way I view matters.  If the development can be completed by May 1995, we should endeavour to meet that deadline and introduce flexible arrangements if necessary.  Great credit is due to the House for dealing with the issue in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the points made by Deputies Gilmore and Barrett in respect of whispering campaigns and so on.  Members from both sides of the House must be clear that nothing underhand is taking place.  Legislation is complicated and at the end of the day we do not want loopholes that will lead to difficulties later. Deputy Barrett referred to what people outside the House might say about the development going ahead regardless of whether we receive planning permission. The Government has made it clear that if planning permission is not granted the project will be taken elsewhere.  I am a northsider and as Minister I fought to develop that corridor, and Dún Laoghaire as part of it.  There has been a strong lobby in favour of this development in an area where there is an abundance <Col N="476" /> of land and a new road network, as is the case in Dublin port.  I have fought to bring about a harmonious development on both sides of the corridor which involves developing Dún Laoghaire Harbour mainly for passengers and cars as is happening.  If planning permission is not granted the development will not proceed and we will not have a similar opportunity next May.  That is the inevitable outcome.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2, and the definition of development in section 1, is to put beyond any doubt that the Minister for the Marine may carry out development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. It will put beyond doubt that the Minister may undertake works on or under the seabed but, as Deputy Gilmore said, people will not be able to see what is happening.  The first stage of the development is to drill holes in the seabed and that is covered under the Bill.  We must be sure that there cannot be a challenge to works which are generally not challenged, but if people wish to be particularly legalistic, they can search Acts to find a provision that will put a doubt over an aspect of the project.  The legal advice available to me is that the Minister has such powers.  Nevertheless, it is felt that it would be prudent to ensure that any risks in this regard are removed so that the Minister may, subject to planning permission, proceed with development of the harbour.  This is especially true in the case of the major project envisaged and the financial and economic risks involved for the harbour, the State and the economy in general.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 relate solely to Dún Laoghaire Harbour and not to any other foreshore.  The reference to foreshore in section 1 is merely a convenient means of defining the seabed as distinct from land in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  It also states that those provisions do not relate to the planning process or change the rules.</P>
    <P>The phrase, &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo;, in amendment No. 1 which the Opposition wish to delete from the Bill should stand.  This is a standard legal formula which appears, for example, in <Col N="477" /> section 2 (1) of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993 which states that a State authority shall have and be deemed always to have had power to carry out or procure the carrying out of development.  This is not an unusual phrase in legislation.  There is no element of retrospection involved. The subsection without this phrase would imply that a new power is being granted where none existed &mdash; this is not the case here &mdash; and rather than removing doubt it would introduce a doubt as to the validity of preparatory exploration and design work which underpin the project. This section provides that all actions taken by the Minister since 1990 towards development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour are valid and confirms beyond doubt that the Minister had and has power to undertake them.  The section merely removes any doubt in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment would remove the temporary exemption enjoyed by the Minister for the Marine and other State authorities from the need to seek and obtain planning permission under section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993. This transition measure applied only up to 15 June and now all new proposals are, by statute, subject to the requirement to first obtain planning permission.  In view of the importance of the present project to Dún Laoghaire Harbour, to the local community and to the national economy, the Minister for the Marine voluntarily submitted himself to the planning process and undertook to abide by the outcome, although he was exempted by the 1993 Act.  This he did in the interests of local democracy and transparency of action.</P>
    <P>I am proposing instead amendment 1b which provides:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) A permission granted under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, for development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour shall not be, and shall not be regarded as ever having been, invalid by reason of the fact that the Minister was by virtue <Col N="478" /> of section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, not required to apply therefor.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The problem is that people will use any legal instrument to delay a project. Rather than amend the Bill to remove the Minister's exemption which he has voluntarily set aside I would propose instead the insertion of a new subsection (3) to ensure that any permission granted could not be regarded as invalid by virtue of the fact that the Minister was not required to apply for such permission under section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>I propose this amendment solely to remove doubt because we are fully satisfied that in spite of the exemption he was legally entitled to apply for the permission in the way he did and that a permission granted on foot of that application would have full statutory validity. We are talking about major investment and a major development and this amendment is being moved in order to remove any element of doubt.  There is nothing sinister about it.  It is logical in the context of the size of the investment in the area and confirms that the Minister was within his rights in doing what he did and cannot be challenged for having so done.</P>
    <P>It would have been easy to say that it was not necessary to go through this procedure.  However, it was wiser to confirm that the Minister had the authority to waive his own right in regard to planning permission.  Everybody outside the House can be assured that that is all that is involved and it does not take in any way from the planning permission that has been applied for, the outcome of which will influence the decision on the development.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said about amendment No. 1b which removes any doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept also what he said about amendment No. 1a in the name of Deputy Gilmore.  Amendment No. 1, tabled by me and Deputies Gilmore and Keogh, is important in the context of the need to pass the legislation quickly. <Col N="479" /> I listened to what the Minister said about other legislation to give retrospective propriety to certain actions of the Minister.  However, this Bill deals with a development which has caused controversy, the rights and wrongs of which I will not go into.  We must signal clearly that this Bill is not designed to second guess decisions of the planning process.  The removal of the Minister's retrospective powers would be helpful in that regard.  I feel strongly that the amendment should, therefore, be agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said in regard to amendment No. 1b. It would be ironic if somebody mounted a legal challenge to the planning permission purely on the basis that the Minister was not statutorily obliged to apply for the planning permission in the first place.  It would be highly vexatious if that were to happen and it is wholly appropriate that that possibility should be closed off in the legislation.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 1a in my name, I am seeking to have it unambiguously stated in the legislation that in any future development at Dún Laoghaire Harbour the Minister for the Marine will have to apply for planning permission.  I understood the Minister to say that that is the position from 15 June.  However, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other.  It could be omitted from the legislation on the basis that there is such a requirement on the Minister or, as we are dealing with a Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill, the Minister could accept the amendment and make it clear to all and sundry that that will be the requirement specifically in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about deleting the retrospective power contained in the first amendment.  The Minister has made no case for including a retrospective power other than that it is not unusual.  The only justification he offered was the 1993 Act dealing with developments by State bodies.  That most unusual legislation was introduced after the Supreme Court case on Mullaghmore in which the court <Col N="480" /> decided that the State did not have the right to proceed with the development of the interpretative centres and that it should have applied for planning permission. The Government then stated that it was in a new situation where every school or Garda station in the country might be found to have been constructed without planning permission and have to apply to each local authority for retention. It was to avoid this possibility that the Government introduced this legislation which gave retrospective clearance to works previously carried out by State bodies.  It was, therefore, a highly unusual set of circumstances that gave rise to the 1993 Act which was passed after lengthy debate.</P>
    <P>It does not follow that the same principle applies to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. I heard no specific reason that retrospective approval should be given to works already carried out in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  Works associated with the new development will be covered by the planning process under way and by this legislation when enacted &mdash; future works will be covered by section 2.</P>
    <P>The Minister explicitly stated that if planning permission is not granted there will be no development.  I share Deputy Barrett's regret, although I accept the right of all citizens to lodge a planning application, that the matter has been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  However, we must accept its decision and there can be no question of trying to circumvent it. Concerns have been expressed that the purpose of this phrase in the section is to circumvent a possible negative decision of An Bord Pleanála.  However justified those fears may be, no case has been made here for this retrospective provision. It should be deleted and I appeal to the Minister to do so.  The legislation is sufficiently strong without it and there is no necessity for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment should be accepted.  It would be ironic if the Minister did not have to apply for planning permission in regard to the development and a total negation of everything we <Col N="481" /> fought for in the planning process.  I sympathise with Deputy Gilmore's proposal in amendment No. 1a.  I am glad the Minister stressed that from 15 June last planning permission will be required for developments.  It is important to be as clear as possible in legislation.  There are always difficulties inherent in the planning process and any provision that allays fears is welcome.  I do not know whether we will put this amendment to a vote, but I ask the Minister to accept the principle behind it.</P>
      <P>I already referred to fears of circumventing the planning process.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say it is not unusual to include such a provision.  I do not think it is usual to have a retrospective provision in a Bill because it raises fears which may be totally unfounded &mdash; as in this case.  The planning process must be as transparent and open as possible.  I do not know of any incident that resulted in this retrospective provision.  Maybe deep sea divers carried out work at the bottom of Dún Laoghaire harbour in the distant past, but I do not believe in putting structures in place to deal with circumstances about which we are not aware.  I do not believe anything has been done that requires this retrospective solution.  We should allay the fears of those who appealed planning decisions &mdash; and others concerned about the planning process &mdash; by deleting this provision from the section.  We should press this amendment if the Minister does not reconsider his views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a doubt about some matter it should be brought into the open.  If trial holes were dug before it was decided to proceed with this development &mdash; maybe there is a doubt about whether the Minister was entitled to do that &mdash; we should hear about it and try to overcome that difficulty.  There could be a legal loophole to delay development in the event of permission being granted and if that is the case it is better to say so openly because it would help us to answer the queries, suggestions and innuendos put to us.  It appears from amendment No. 1b that there is no need for the <Col N="482" /> retrospective provision in section 2.  If there is a reason for it, we should hear it.</P>
      <P>We are all racking our brains to know what development took place in Dún Laoghaire without permission being sought or contrary to existing legislation since the Department of the Marine took responsibility for it.  I recall no such development.  Perhaps the reason relates to the tests carried out and, if so, let us hear about it.  I do not think the vast majority of people we represent would object to trial holes being dug or investigations carried out prior to deciding whether to go ahead with a development. That is part and parcel of normal development activity and is reasonable, particularly when it involves the investment of taxpayer's money.  It would be wrong to undertake a development that would have to be undone in five or ten years' time because of a problem under the seabed.  I have no difficulty about justifying the need to have such trials carried out but if that is the case we should hear about it.</P>
      <P>I am not in the business of helping people to delay a development on technical points which will not stand up in a court of law.  I am in favour of proceeding in accordance with the law, of going through the planning process and giving people the right to appeal against decisions if they wish, even though it may not suit me.  We do not want to have to justify what is contained in section 2 unless it is necessary and deals with a technical point.</P>

      <P>On legal advice, it is preferable to close the possibility of people challenging the legitimacy of design work and preparatory exploration work under the seabed.  These works underpin the whole project and the provision is included to remove all possible doubt. One may say we need not worry, we are all reasonable people and if a major problem arises we will deal with it at that stage.  However, when an investment of £15 million is involved it is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware that this investment <Col N="483" /> is non-Exchequer funded.  Section 2 confirms the Minister's development powers for Dún Laoghaire Harbour and that all actions taken by him for the development of the harbour since 1990 are valid.  It confirms beyond doubt that the Minister shall have, and be deemed always to have had, power to carry out development.  It does not introduce retrospective powers but confirms the power, which everybody understood the Minister to have.  There is an element of doubt and legal advice is that it should be closed off.</P>
    <P>The section does not try in any way to circumvent the planning process.  It has been made very clear that the planning process is independent and that we will have to await its outcome.  The legal advice is that it is preferable in the meantime to cover the works done under the seabed since 1990 in preparation for this <Col N="484" /> development because they underpin the development.  If someone wants to challenge them, they challenge also the development in the future.  I ask Deputies to let it stand because it is wiser and safer from the point of view of the development.</P>
    <P>The major question is the decision An Bord Pleanála will reach on the whole development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This issue may never arise, but very complex legal issues have been raised from time to time.  It even goes back as far as seeking to define the foreshore, the high water mark, the seabed and other elements.  We are trying to put that completely beyond doubt and give that underpinning to the project if it goes ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join speakers from <Col N="504" /> all sides of the House in sincerely commending the Progressive Democrats and Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell on putting together comprehensive legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994, containing 59 eminently sensible sections, many of which introduce long overdue fundamental changes which, if adopted by the Government and taken through Committee as it should be in the interests of consensus politics, will do much to enhance the justice system and tighten up the law in a number of areas which badly need it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes introduced in sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in relation to bail.  Too often people come up with the necessary finance for bail &mdash; money is not a problem &mdash; and crime recurs again and again.  I welcome in particular the section which puts an obligation on the person putting up the bail to take an interest in the behaviour of the accused person while on bail.  It is a sensible suggestion, as are the other sections, particularly the one which allows the court to estreat the bail in the event of the accused person committing a crime while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see one fundamental change in the Bill which is particularly borne out by a pending case which was the subject of a Dáil question by me to the Minister for Justice yesterday.  I asked the number of court appearances made to date by a person, the number of personnel involved in respective journeys conveying the person to and from court, the total cost of the appearances and the proposals, if any, the Minister had to change the legislation covering the place in which similar court appearances are held.  In reply the Minister said that the number of court appearances to date by the person in question was seven; that it is not the normal practice to provide details concerning the number of gardaí engaged in particular operations; that the total cost of these appearances, including court appearances, was estimated to be in the region of £2,000; that the figure did not include Garda pay but did include the cost of overtime, subsistence allowance and petrol.  The Minister went on to say that with regard to the question of <Col N="505" /> changes in existing legislation, any legislative proposals she might bring forward to deal with the matter raised by me would be announced in the normal way in due course when considered and approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>The defendant in question made his eighth appearance today, this time in County Galway.  It is ludicrous that a defendant should be hauled, week in and week out, on a journey of up to 150 miles to a court hearing lasting three or four minutes, and back to his place of detention. The relevant legislation is the Courts Act.  Because of the construction of the Act, and because of time constraints, the defendant must, until the Book of Evidence is produced, be taken back to the District Court in the jurisdiction in which the crime is alleged to have been committed.  It is obvious that the sections which dictate this course of action are outdated and archaic and the necessary amendments should be introduced to transfer routine District Court hearings nearer to the detention or remand centre.  While the accused is being brought several hundred miles across the country for a court hearing of a few minutes' duration, District Courts are held within one mile of the place of detention or remand.  I call on the Minister for Justice, therefore, to introduce the necessary amending legislation to ensure that such interim court hearings will be held as close as possible to the place of detention.  The point is further underlined when one considers that when a trial does take place it will be in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the case I referred to the defendant was remanded to a further hearing at Banagher District Court on Tuesday next.  Again there will be a cross-country trek of 100 miles or so with the attendant heavy Garda security involving Garda vans and patrol cars, overtime payments, subsistence payments and the deployment of additional gardaí who are badly needed elsewhere.  Let nobody tell me that this outdated farce is in the interests of the plaintiffs.  It is certainly not in the interests of the defendant.  I cannot see how it could be in the interests of justice <Col N="506" /> and it is certainly not in the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Garda.  This case is one of many which have occurred over a period of time.  I do not have legal competence but as an ordinary independent civilian, as a legislator, as somebody observing from within and outside this House with the detachment of an observer, it is difficult to see why these procedures cannot be suitably amended. It is something the Minister for Justice might well take on board in the foreseeable future because there is a certain amount of anger and anxiety and a failure to comprehend on the part of many people.</P>

      <P>None of us disagrees on the amount of time and effort put into this Bill by Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell and no doubt the legal advice available from Deputy McDowell and that available in the House to Deputy O'Donnell was of major assistance to them.</P>
      <P>The Government's performance in introducing so much legislation in the past 18 months to update the criminal law is to be admired.  We have seen changes which, if agreed by the majority in this House, are for the betterment of the operation of the legal system within the State.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins about the circus when people have to be brought, on a weekly basis, from Mountjoy Prison to District Courts in other parts of the country.  This is a very expensive exercise. The locals are interested to see whether the prisoner's appearance has improved or disimproved during their term of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Law Reform Commission will recommend that prisoners be allowed appear in the court nearest to their place of detention&mdash; that may not necessarily be Dublin.  With the provision of the new detention centre in Castlerea, <Col N="507" /> it would be ridiculous to take a prisoner from there to Cork for a court appearance. I hope this matter will be dealt with in legislation which the Minister intends to introduce.  It should be adequate that a person appear before a District Court anywhere within the State.  The circuses we see on a regular basis on television whereby prisoners are brought from one part of the country to another must have a great effect on the families involved, both the family of the person charged and the family of the victim.  I hope this problem will be remedied in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>We all have mixed views on the right to silence.  In some cases we believe it should be allowed and in others it should not, but where do we draw the line? There is a case to be made on both sides of the argument.  I hope that a common ground can be found in terms of the right to silence of defendants.  That right is necessary to protect the innocent.  If people do not have the right to silence they may not be able successfully to defend themselves at a later stage when they may be totally without blame.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that the legislation which the Minister has promised will deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Bills are brought before this House on a regular basis. They give Opposition Members an opportunity to express their views and in many cases help to improve legislation introduced at a later stage.  The Law Reform Commission, in its report on the bail laws, will present to this House and the Department of Justice the basic elements of any changes to be made to the bail laws.  Nobody can condone some of the things done by people while on bail.  Those of us living in parts of the country that were once relatively free from crime now find that every weekend gangs travel from the city with the intention of robbing and plundering.  In some cases these people are apprehended but in others they are not.  We read in this morning's newspapers about the horrific incident where a man was tied to a tree for three or four days after being robbed. <Col N="508" /> Nobody can condone such crimes and whatever laws are necessary to deal with them should be put in place.  However, we should not make a rash decision on changing the laws.  People who offend while on bail should be automatically detained until such time as their case comes before the courts.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about people's rights.  There are the rights of those outside this House who are not in a position to make their case other than through their public representatives and the rights of those who need to be protected from criminal gangs.  Legislation should be put in place to deal with criminal gangs who pose a major problem in regard to organised crime.  Under the present law it is not possible in some cases to apprehend those gangs.  Some of the laws with regard to age are being flouted and need to be considered.  I hope the Government will bring forward legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of positive moves have been made in recent times in the criminal justice system.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1993, in many ways protects the victim. For example, for the first time sentences that are unduly lenient may be appealed. The court is obliged to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim and may request the offender to pay compensation to the victim.  These are welcome improvements in the criminal law which will benefit the citizen.  Perhaps the most important legislation introduced is the Criminal Law Jurisdiction (Public Order) Act, 1994, which gives power to the Garda and the courts to deal effectively with those who misbehave in the community without regard to the rights of others.  All of us as public representatives have had such cases brought to our attention. I hope the new law will deal with those cases.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill will for the first time enable the court to confiscate their profits from the godfathers of crime.  We are all aware of criminal gangs who own large tracts of property. The international laundering of money concerns all of us.  We are aware it is happening but it is difficult to prove. Garda intelligence is making enormous <Col N="509" /> progress in this area and is pursuing every opportunity to investigate these matters. Decisions such as that made recently on the confiscation of a yacht used for the importation of drugs will help deter those involved particularly in drug importation. We are all aware of the damage that can be done as a result of drug taking.  Many people endure misery and hardship when members of their family become involved in drug abuse.  The real beneficiaries are the drug pushers. Measures to deal with those who make profits from criminal activity have long been needed.  We all hope that the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill which was recently discussed in the House &mdash; amendments were dealt with earlier today &mdash; will ensure that those involved in crime do not benefit from it.</P>
    <P>This Government more than previous administrations has shown its commitment to reform of the criminal law and we can be proud of the progress made.  Deputy Michael McDowell may think we are not progressing fast enough. No doubt he perceives that his Private Members' Bill will serve as a back-up to the Government's proposed legislation which will be introduced following deliberation of reports from the Law Reform Commission.  I believe the debate on this Bill will help those who will draft the Government Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that legislation is never perfect. The Minister gave a commitment to the House that if as a result of the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission it is necessary to introduce a constitutional amendment to deal with the laws of bail, she will do so.  The Government has a record of trying to put a stop to criminal activity.  More places of detention are being provided and this acts as a deterrent.  Some may argue that detention is only part of the solution and that may be so, but it is imperative to have more places of detention if people are being released because of overcrowding. I am glad that the proposed prison in Castlerea is proceeding and it is hoped it will be ready in 12-18 months' time.</P>
    <P>The services for juvenile offenders are <Col N="510" /> inadequate.  They are not being given an opportunity to reform their behaviour and, in some cases, learn criminal tactics in some institutions.  I hope that in future those detained for petty crime will be rehabilitated and taught to be better citizens. It is important that places of detention rehabilitate prisoners.  We know it is hoping for miracles to try to rehabilitate some criminals, nevertheless, we should try.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to deal with crime and much of the recent legislation will help to deter people from committing it.  At this late stage I appeal to Deputy Michael McDowell to withdraw his Private Members' Bill &mdash; having received maximum coverage during the debate in the past two weeks &mdash; and wait to see the common ground in the Minister's Bill.  I accept that is not what he would like me to say but it would lead to better legislation, from which everybody would benefit.</P>
    <P>I presume Deputy Davern is substituting for Deputy O'Keeffe and, if that is the case, I ask your indulgence, Sir, to allow him to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for facilitating me.  I compliment Deputy Michael McDowell for introducing a Private Members' Bill.  It is important that we point out to the general public that Members are concerned about criminal law.  Sometimes it may appear that this House is not interested in what is happening outside this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bail is one of the most important issues in the context of criminal legislation.  The Supreme Court decided in 1966, unfortunately, that bail could be refused only on the following grounds: (1) that the defendant would not attend court or would abscond; (2) that the defendant might interfere with witnesses or jurors; or (3) conceal evidence, and it would be up to the Garda Síochána to have proof. Since 1966 there has been an escalation in crime and we need to examine the section of the Bill that deals with bail. The public is rightly annoyed when it sees people on bail committing two or three more crimes.  Offenders consider it <Col N="511" /> worthwhile committing more crime while on bail because in any event they will have to serve a sentence and most sentences run concurrently.  That is frustrating, not only to the general public and the victims of crime, but also to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the number of Bills brought before this House in the past 12 months.  The Minister has undertaken to consider whether a bailsperson should lose his bail money if an offender commits a crime while on bail.  That is vitally important. The Minister asked the Law Reform Commission to examine this area and it would be improper to ask that august body to form an opinion and yet proceed before receiving it.  I compliment Deputy Michael McDowell for highlighting these issues but it is important to hear from the Law Reform Commission before we legislate.  I agree that the bail laws need urgent attention and I hope the Law Reform Commission will respond more quickly than it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about victims of crime.  I have no doubt that the presence of someone, while on bail, on the streets of our cities and towns who has committed serious crimes is intimidating for witnesses and would discourage people giving evidence.  They would not be directly intimidated but knowing that the accused is free to have a go at them at any time intimidates the witness in many cases.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with Deputy McDowell's proposal on the right to silence.  That right should have been abolished years ago.  If one is charged with a serious offence but is not guilty, there is nothing to fear.  The Garda Síochána spends many hours compiling evidence to bring a case to court only to find that the suspect gets off on a technicality because they will not co-operate with the Garda.  Circumstantial evidence must then be produced and that is judged in another way by the law.  As somebody once said, &ldquo;the law does not know justice or justice does not know the law&rdquo;.  That is a common <Col N="512" /> concept outside this House and outside the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's proposal in this regard has been promoted in this House on many occasions.  Criminals can commit the most horrible offences and have the right to remain silent during their interrogation.  This has arisen particularly in regard to the IRA which trains its members to stare at a point on the wall and not to speak to anyone or look in any direction for a period of up to 48 hours.  I am sure the benefits of that training have passed on to the modern criminal class.</P>
    <P>People who have committed serious crimes should not have the right to remain silent.  That should be regarded as a further offence against the victims of such crime.  I am sure many people in the legal profession will not agree with that and will not wish to see this proposal introduced because of the legalities and the terminology of law but it should be considered from a victim's viewpoint. The average person pays tax, VHI insurance, health bills, car tax and so on. When people become victims of crime the criminals, in many cases, are not caught.  If they are, they get off with a warning or a light sentence.  To the victim the impact of the offence is then doubled because they feel they have been contributing to a system that does not protect them.</P>
    <P>There has been too much emphasis in the past on the rights of the offender and not enough consideration has been given to the rights of the victim.  I met constituents recently whose homes were burgled and the mere fact that somebody was in their bedroom, their kitchen and their sitting room has destroyed their way of life.  The lady of the house will not stay at home on her own at night.  The older children who are capable of looking after the younger members of the family do not wish to stay at home at night to look after them.  The parents are worried also about the possibility of being burgled again.  The original crime, therefore, has an ongoing effect.  When the Minister introduces her Bill I hope the right to silence will not be sacrosanct.  In the case <Col N="513" /> of more serious offences it cannot be allowed to remain.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with proposals to update the procedures under which preliminary examinations of indictable offences may be carried out in a District Court.  I recently had discussions with someone from my constituency who is familiar with the Australian court system.  I hope to receive further details from that person which will outline how court cases have been dealt with more speedily there and how they deal with minor offences. I am looking forward to receiving this documentation and to see whether we can adopt similar measures here.  Perhaps on the spot fines could be imposed for speeding offences.  One Garda sergeant recently brought 163 speeding offences before a court while two or three serious cases were waiting to be heard.  Many minor cases could be dealt with without even going to court if liability is admitted.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of preliminary examinations.  One case which comes to mind is that of the Marlhill murder which took place in my constituency in 1941.  The matter was preliminarily dealt with by a local court and from what I have read of the evidence given during that hearing, the case should never have gone beyond that.  It came to trial in Dublin, however, and the man was convicted and subsequently hanged. There is now ample proof that there was more than reasonable doubt that the man in question was not the person involved in the murder of the victim, Mary McCarthy.</P>
    <P>I agree with some preliminary examination of cases provided the court has the time to deal with it.  I compliment the Deputy on the Bill.  I am sure he will be disappointed that the Government intends to reject it.</P>

More importantly, we must ensure that victims as well as those accused of committing crimes are treated justly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some points on certain aspects of the Bill, which I welcome.  In the true spirit of legislating for the common good I hope that the Minister of State will agree to allow a Second Reading.  I do not believe Deputy McDowell would expect the Bill to be given the <i>imprimatur</i> of the House without any opportunity to amend it.</P>
      <P>This is the basis for important legislation. Members of the House had an opportunity only three weeks ago of participating in a similar debate on crime and that is an indication of the level of seriousness with which we regard the level of crime in our constituencies.  Any survey of the political issues of the day undertaken in the community will show that crime is a major fear.  This matter has been debated in this House far more than other activities and it is regrettable, therefore, that worthwhile legislation such as this will not see the light of day following this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago I referred to the right to silence and I do not intend to repeat points made by other Deputies in this debate.  This right is giving rise to serious concern and, in many ways, is obstructing the course of the criminal procedures in attempting to determine the truth.  There <Col N="515" /> is an onus on every citizen to participate in the orderly running of the community. The right to silence is not in keeping with that civic spirit.  We have a duty to update and reform the law.  Perhaps at the time it was introduced there were sound reasons for allowing an alleged offender to choose not to engage in a truth finding process.</P>
    <P>The reform of the bail provisions has become something of a chestnut in this House.  In the aftermath of serious offences, particularly the use of armed violence in bank robberies, there are calls for reform of the bail laws.  In 1990 there was a serious crime committed in Athy where people were killed by armed bank robbers and it was subsequently discovered that two of the criminals were on bail.  How long will we allow this loophole to exist?</P>
    <P>The Minister could quote statistics but suffice to say that thousands of crimes are committed annually by those free on bail. This is unsatisfactory.  The 1966 rules must be updated.  It has been said that this could only be done by way of constitutional referendum.  We have no problem holding referenda on issues imposed on us by the EU.  We find £1 million and campaign on the issue.  This matter warrants immediate attention by the Government.  If we must hold a referendum let us do so.  It could be held in conjunction with the referendum on divorce.  It could have been held in conjunction with the Euro and local elections at minimal cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred briefly to the prison system.  The Minister for Justice recently embarked on a huge prison programme at a cost of £70 million.  Are we spending taxpayers' money wisely by building new prisons and placing people in custody?  Vast sums are spent on their accommodation.  There is a need for secure prisons.  I realise, coming from Portlaoise, the effect and cost of a high security prison on a town.  It costs in the region of almost £1,000 a week to keep a prisoner in custody in Portlaoise Prison which is a big drain on our finances.  We must look at alternatives, particularly in <Col N="516" /> cases where criminals may not be engaged in serious criminal conduct.</P>
    <P>I accept that restrictions must be placed on the liberty of an offender because the public must be protected and re-offending must be curbed by society. However, a court order could confine an offender to his or her home during specified hours; for example, habitual young offenders engaged in unacceptable behaviour in bars, clubs and so on could be confined to their homes at night.  I have seen district justices at the end of their tether and left with no option but to impose custodial sentences in Mountjoy Prison.  The concept of imposing a barring order restricting people from going to clubs, pubs or other areas in the community where they are likely to engage in unacceptable behaviour should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Has the concept of tracking been considered? Various schemes could be organised by the probation and welfare services to maintain regular and frequent contact with offenders in the community. An electronic tag is used in many states in the US and pilot studies in Britain in recent years have shown it can be used to good effect.  The probation and welfare services and the Garda would know where a person was by the transmission of a signal.  Consideration should be given to this matter.  It could be looked at as an alternative to spending money on prisons.</P>
    <P>A court decision was made yesterday to impose a custodial sentence in Mountjoy Prison on a 15 year old.  Where is the accommodation which was promised for young offenders?  Where is the juvenile justice Bill we have been promised for years?</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice cannot cope with the need to update the criminal justice system or with the crime problem. The Garda is losing the battle against crime.  They do a good job but they can only act within the laws we make.  The Department of Justice is too big and the Minister should admit that.  All we hear is that they are awaiting the report of the Law Reform Commission.  We are awaiting their report on bail and on occupier's <Col N="517" /> liability.  Everything grinds to a halt while we do so.  As Deputy Ellis said, we can shrug complacently and say the matter is with the Law Reform Commission, we cannot do anything until we receive its report.  The Law Reform Commission is run off its feet.  If we act on as much as 60 per cent of the reports it issues it is as much as we have done in the last 14 years.  We have a great day's discussion on the latest report, engage in discourse on the national media and elsewhere and forget about it.</P>
    <P>Further assistance could be given to the Law Reform Commission if the work was divided between a civil law reform commission and a criminal law reform commission.  If we had a criminal law reform commission we could at this stage, mid-1994, have enacted the appropriate bail legislation, as advised by the Law Reform Commission.  If we are serious about engaging in the process of reforming the criminal law we have to ensure that the Law Reform Commission is given targets and terms of reference which will speed up the process and assist the Department of Justice, which needs assistance and does not have the capacity to meet all the changes.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to community service. People should be confined outside the community only for the most grievous and serious criminal offences.  Aspects of community service need to be tightened up, updated and given extra assistance. In spite of an overall lack of national standards, the concept of community service is working well; community service orders and programmes are working well in various areas.  However, there is a certain lack of consistency in this area which needs attention.  For example, statutory effect needs to be given to the works undertaken in the community service area, for example, painting, decorating, gardening, the provision of meals on wheels, working with the disabled, etc.  We need to spell out the type of work we as legislators would like to see undertaken by those engaged in community service.</P>
    <P>Community service should at all times <Col N="518" /> be rigorous and demanding; after all it is a punishment and should not be seen as anything else.  One of the major problems with community service is that the public does not see the benefits or the results of community service orders.  The concept of community service works will not gain the confidence of the community until such time as people can see that it is of advantage to the community as a whole. National standards should be applied, targets set and guidelines formulated on the type of work to be carried out.  This would ensure a better system of punishment within the community area.</P>
    <P>In spite of a certain degree of haphazardness, compensation orders are working quite well.  These orders have not been introduced in some areas and where they are being imposed the compensation is paid at the end of the period, whether it is six, nine or 12 months.  This is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill has provoked a welcome and necessary debate on the criminal law by Members on all sides of the House.  The Minister should give this Bill a Second Reading at 8.30 p.m. instead of imposing a hammer-like blow with the huge Government majority on what is basically good legislation.  The Bill could then be dealt with by the appropriate committee during the summer recess.  The Minister would have an opportunity at that stage to tighten up some provisions which may be of concern to him.  I am sure he would not allow the Bill to be dealt with by a committee which did not have a majority of Government Deputies present.  Unlike last Friday, all he would have to do is ensure that enough Government Deputies were present to vote in favour of any amendments he proposes.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this debate on aspects of the criminal law, which regrettably have not been addressed to date by the Government for the reasons put forward by Deputy McDowell and his colleagues, is being brought to a close.  I plead with the Minister to allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where all Deputies will have an opportunity to contribute on legislation which is for the common good.  Nothing has been said in <Col N="519" /> this debate which should lead to this Bill being rejected by the Government, which it will do in half an hour.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell for the work they put into the Bill and for affording Members of the House an opportunity to discuss the criminal law.  This substantial Bill covers a number of areas in the criminal justice system of concern to many people.  The promoters of the Bill are anxious to ensure that all areas of concern are adequately dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced an unprecedented number of Bills in the criminal law area since it came into office. It has made great strides forward in addressing areas in need of urgent attention. I welcome the commitment given by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, that the Government will bring forward legislation dealing with the matters covered in the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The sponsors of the Bill acknowledge that its provisions dealing with criminal insanity have been copied from the Henchey report &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; in order to deal adequately with any specific area.  But many developments have occurred since the publication of that report which should be taken into account.  I hope Deputy McDowell will not mind my referring to his professional capacity beyond this House.  I have no doubt that he would have professional knowledge of such developments and the necessity to take them into account to ensure that we produce effective, appropriate legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions in relation to bail.  I have no doubt that there is not one Member of this House who does not have concerns about our <Col N="520" /> present bail laws.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister or made inquiries by way of private letter in this respect.  We know that the Government is equally concerned about the law in this area and has referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. Most members will have had recourse to the Law Reform Commission in other areas where there is need for legislation and have been guided by it.  The Minister has assured the House that the Government will have no hesitation, if necessary, in holding a referendum on this matter if it is felt that is the best way to proceed.  Indeed, it makes no sense at this point for us to endeavour to tinker with the law in this regard before the Law Reform Commission has reported.</P>
    <P>Part V contains a number of provisions about the right to silence.  I do not accept it is the right of a career criminal to go about his business without hindrance because most of them know very well how to use or abuse the protections at present provided in our laws for the innocent. At the same time, I wonder whether the provisions in this Part of the Bill do not go somewhat too far since one interpretation would lead one to the conclusion that they would turn this into a police state.  For example, I would be very worried by the proposals to involve our courts in the investigation of crime before anyone is charged.  Those are two matters I should like clarified when Deputy Michael McDowell is responding or, if he has not sufficient time, perhaps he would put pen to paper in order to do so.  While all of us want to see the guilty convicted we must be careful to avoid incorporating anything in our laws which would achieve nothing more than rendering it more likely that we would convict the innocent.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of this Bill have provided us with a very useful opportunity to discuss a number of matters of concern to us.  I accept the Minister's view and that of the Government expressed in her contribution earlier, that the most effective approach would be to await Government proposals in these areas.  Anybody familiar with the record of this Government <Col N="521" /> on criminal law reform will be confident that such proposals will be produced as speedily as possible.  I might remind the House of that record.  For example, we have had the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 which in many ways represents a victim's charter in our criminal justice system when, for the first time, unduly lenient sentences can be appealed.  A court is obliged to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim before deciding on a sentence for a violent crime.  In addition, the courts now have statutory power to order an offender to pay compensation to the victim.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important criminal law reform, for which all Members of this House had pressed, was the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1993, whose provisions, at long last, allow the Garda and the courts to deal effectively with those who misbehave in our society without any regard to the rights of others.  Another legislative measure worthy of mention is the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, the provisions of which, for the first time, enable our courts to confiscate the profits of the so-called godfathers of crime.  That legislation will also enable us play a proper role in the fight against international crime.  The Bill had long been awaited and was welcomed by most Members of the House.  While we may have concerns about any one aspect of any Bill before the House &mdash; and it is only natural that we would &mdash; the confiscation of profits of the so-called godfathers of crime represented a very welcome step.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned those three examples but there are many more which might be cited as evidence of this Government's commitment to a major programme of criminal law reform.  In such circumstances I am more than happy to accept the Minister's assurances that, where the present Bill deals with areas in need of reform &mdash; which we all recognise &mdash; the Government will bring forward effective proposals as speedily as possible. Those of us who have been involved in reform of the criminal law system since this Government assumed office will recognise the Minister's willingness to <Col N="522" /> accept suggestions from all sides of the House in relation to amendments and so on.  We have witnessed that willingness in particular in the committee of which I am convener, that is the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Here I should like to record my appreciation to the Minister and the Minister of State, present this evening, who have devoted much time and effort, who were open and frank with Members of the House on all aspects of legislation with which they have dealt and which should not go unnoticed.  It is only proper that I should record their great achievement in getting all Deputies to participate enthusiastically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>While joining many other Members in commending the sponsors of this Bill it is my belief the House will accept the approach outlined by the Minister for Justice, that it would not be appropriate to accept the Bill as presented to this <Col N="523" /> House.  I hope Deputy Michael McDowell will comment on Members' concerns about the capacity of the Bill to deal adequately and effectively with matters on which we appear to be united.  It is only a matter of bedding them down in a correct and proper fashion and waiting for the Law Reform Commission to report on other areas on which they have been asked to report.

      <P>Like other Deputies I am glad of the opportunity to debate the issues in the Bill.  It gives us all an opportunity to influence the proposals which the Government intends to bring forward.  One of the greatest causes for frustration for the Garda and the general public are our bail laws.  As a result of the Supreme Court decision, bail can only be refused on two grounds, where a person is unlikely to turn up for trial or is likely to interfere with witnesses.  The fact that an accused is likely to commit further offences, no matter how serious, cannot be used by the courts as a ground for refusing bail.  We have one of the lowest figures in the Council of Europe countries for the number of prisoners on remand per head of population and the obvious explanation for this is that we have one of the most liberal bail regimes.</P>
      <P>This is why I am glad the Government recognised the serious problems in this area and referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission.  I suspect that the only real solution in this area &mdash; rather than tinkering around with existing law as the Bill proposes &mdash; is to change our Constitution.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Government will have no hesitation in putting an amendment to the Constitution before the people if it concludes that this is the most effective approach.  I am sure the people will have no hesitation in supporting such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our laws on criminal insanity date back to the last century and are clearly in need of reform.  This is a very complex issue and I am pleased to note the Government <Col N="524" /> is giving priority to bringing forward proposals which will go beyond what is proposed in the Bill.  People are worried that a guilty or insane verdict is a soft option. I am not sure that that is the case in practice but there is a pressing need to update and clarify the law in this area.</P>
    <P>I accept the objection the Minister for Justice had to the section which would require the keeping of a register, to be available for public inspection, on temporary releases.  This would go against the grain of the process of rehabilitation and would serve no social good.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on publishing last week a five year plan for the management of prisons.  This is the first time such a document has been published. It is frank and enlightened and contains proposals to put an end to the so-called revolving door syndrome of unsupervised releases.  I hope we get an opportunity at an early stage to debate that plan either in the Chamber or in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill on criminal procedure contains some worthwhile proposals which merit further consideration. For example, the provision on depositions in the District Court is open to abuse and, indeed, is being abused.  I understand this is a matter the Minister will deal with in a miscellaneous provisions Bill which she will be bringing forward in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I am worried about some of the provisions in that Part which impinge on the right to silence.  In particular I oppose the idea of involving our courts in the investigation of crime before anyone has been charged.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could doubt the Government's commitment to criminal law reform.  Only this morning the House dealt with Seanad amendments to the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill and that legislation goes to the President for signature. This was the latest in a long line of criminal law reform and contains draconian sanctions particularly against drug pushers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised further measures and, on a personal level, I <Col N="525" /> regard the introduction of a new juvenile justice Bill as a priority.  I understand that this will be a substantial Bill and will replace in its entirety the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    <P>I commend the sponsors of this Bill but, for the reasons the Minister gave in her response, I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy O'Keeffe has been excluded by the bell from contributing but doubtless he will find another opportunity when the much heralded ministerial Bill comes before the House to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this debate.  I was surprised by the reaction because apart from aspirants to the office of Minister of State who took the departmental line, I noted carefully that the general thrust of Private Members' contributions, particularly those who spoke without the assistance of scripts, was supportive and positive towards the Bill.  It would be difficult to reply to many of the points made in the short period available to me but on the bail issue there is no doubt that there is grave dissatisfaction on all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>The O'Callaghan decision, which was much criticised here, was handed down at a time of greater innocence, greater optimism and jurisprudential development when the Supreme Court was in an activist stage.  Doubtless in the 1960s it made sense to experiment with a more liberal regime when many people were spending up to a year in custody awaiting trial.  We should bear this in mind in the context of any proposal to amend the Constitution.  To remand somebody in custody and at the end of six, eight or 12 months to put them out on the street and say to them you are sorry you cannot go ahead with the case or, alternatively, say that the person has got a verdict of not guilty, is a huge injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> It is easy for people to demand further incarceration of people in custody while their trials are pending.  From my perspective I am dubious about the desirability of a referendum.  It may be macho to suggest we will reverse all this but it would be far better to experiment along the lines proposed in Part II of this Bill, to make bail more realistic and to put a legislative mechanism in place.  To deny bail simply on common sense that somebody will not go bail for a person whom he or she really believes will commit an offence while on bail is much more sensible than allowing bail to be denied wholesale because the Garda tenders evidence to the court that there is a fear the accused would commit a further offence while on bail.</P>
    <P>A point worth bearing in mind on the bail issue from the civil libertarian point of view is that the greatest cause of injustice is where somebody makes a false confession.  Experience has shown that the greatest single factor in inducing people to make false confessions is the suggestion that they will not be going home to their wife and children that evening.  If a bullying garda &mdash; I hope there are not too many of them &mdash; or an over-zealous garda tells an individual that if he or she does not make a statement they will be in jail for the next six months irrespective, because the granting of bail will be opposed &mdash; it happens in jurisdictions where the police have a significant role in deciding whether people do or do not get bail &mdash; there is a huge danger that people will make confessions to offences they did not commit.  People are genuinely frightened about bail being denied to them in those circumstances. That is my one concern about a referendum which would sweep away all of the O'Callaghan decision and throw the baby out with the bath water.  It was an over optimistic decision and was defective. In general terms, the principle that people should not be put into custody merely because they are accused of a crime is an important one.  At the same time, the proposals set out in Part II of the Bill make a significant shift against abuse of bail which, when taken in conjunction <Col N="527" /> with the consecutive sentencing provisions of the 1984 Act, would reduce substantially the possibility that people would commit further offences while on bail.</P>
    <P>On the contributions made about the right to silence, it is peculiar that those who took the departmental line expressed views in their scripted comments which were dubious and cautious on any change.  The right to silence is a misnomer.  What is recognised by our law is the constitutional right not to be forced to incriminate oneself by one's words.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is loose phraseology which is misunderstood.  Nobody is suggesting that people should be put on a rack and forced to confess to their offences; what is being suggested is that if a person does not mention something when an investigation is ongoing and produces it as an explanation to rebut circumstantial evidence at his trial the jury should be entitled to ask why the person concerned did not give this explanation at a time when it would have been much more rational to do so.  That would be a reasonable change and we should adopt it.</P>
    <P>An accused person has the right to sit through a criminal case on indictment, which is a serious and solemn matter, and say at the end of it that he does not propose to respond or participate, that he should be counted out of the process, that it was very interesting to listen to the case against him.  This leaves a jury wondering whether the person has an explanation or what it could possibly be. Bearing in mind that an accused person was not allowed to give evidence until the 19th century, we have now reached the stage where it would be entirely rational to tell an accused person that he is obliged to participate in the trial and asked at the end of the case to give his side of the story.  No substantial injustice would obtain if such a provision formed part of our law.  The courts would protect people and ensure that they would not be prejudiced unfairly by reason of their being compellable to give evidence at their own trial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> All a jury would be entitled to do, if they do not give evidence, is draw an adverse inference against them.  It would not be unfair to draw such an inference from their silence.  If somebody wants to give an explanation as to why they will not answer questions &mdash; perhaps they want to protect somebody else &mdash; let them say that under oath and let the jury draw an inference as to whether they believe it but somebody should not be allowed to sing dumb at the end of a long trial and escape justice due to non-participation. I agree with Deputy Flanagan in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned a number of alternatives to a term of imprisonment. Perhaps this is due to the absence of a statutory framework but I am convinced that the judicial system does not deal adequately with the possibility of handing down partly suspended sentences.  It would make sense and cure recidivism if accused people were sentenced to four years' imprisonment plus four years for a spate of burglaries and if they realised, having spent four years in prison, that they would be &ldquo;done&rdquo; if they committed another serious offence thereafter when the second period of four years would be reactivated.  Creative sentencing would have a more significant effect than many of the proposals which have been suggested from time to time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the record of the Department of Justice, it has been stated that this Government has been more active than previous Governments, which is true.  During the term of office of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats' Coalition I was vocal about the absence of legislative activity on the part of the Department.  I am aware that I riled some of the civil servants in pointing this out. To be fair it all depends on the political masters of the Department but its record has been patchy in reforming our criminal law.</P>
    <P>I agree with several of the contributions that we would be better off if we had a specialist criminal law revision committee along the lines of the English model rather than a general Law Reform Commission.  The English experience <Col N="529" /> proved beneficial.  By contrast our Law Reform Commission would have plenty of work to do in other spheres.  The Whitaker report contained a specific recommendation that a specialist body should be charged with the responsibility of reforming our criminal law.  This would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats brought before the House a Private Members' Bill which dealt with the question of public order.  It received a frosty response initially from the Minister but by the end of the two week debate there was a change in tone and we were informed that she would introduce her own Bill. Although some of her remarks about our Bill were tough the Bill produced by the Minister mirrored much of what we had said.  I do not say this with rancour; the issues which are important in reforming our criminal law are not those which are media driven such as appealing lenient sentences.  As far as I am aware, no lenient sentence has been appealed since that Bill was introduced.  It is a dubious change in our law that a particular sentence may be increased when there is a public outcry, especially when it is driven by ignorance of the facts which determine the judge's decision.  However, it has had no practical effect.</P>
    <P>I am also dubious about the law which provides for the confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers, not that I am against it &mdash; I am in favour of it &mdash; but I do not believe that the money will be found to be confiscated.  Compensation orders have now been put on a statutory basis but everybody who has practised criminal law during the past 20 or 30 years and before knows that the Judiciary made compensation orders on its own account for decades and that the practical effect of that change is not as significant as the real issues such as bail and the right of silence which relate to serious crime.</P>
    <P>Every single portion of this Bill was tendered seriously.  If it is possible to bring a suspect into a police station and interrogate him or her for four hours on the trot and produce a record at a criminal trial I can see nothing wrong with bringing them before a district justice and <Col N="530" /> asking them the same questions in open court where there can be no arguments about inducements or threats.  There would be clear evidence as to what the questions and answers were.  It would be far better if the businessman who cannot produce any satisfactory explanation as to what happened to the £100,000 that disappeared from his company's accounts was confronted with that question in open court in circumstances where the jury would know that the account given was verbatim taken in fairly controlled circumstances and that there were no inducements.</P>
    <P>People speak about civil liberties; I am mindful of these.  Given my background as a barrister I am more mindful of them than people who think that lawyers are too concerned with these issues.  Civil liberties apply to everybody; to the woman in her 70s living in an estate off the South Circular Road in Dublin who does not open her door any more at night and to old age pensioners who are beaten on the streets by young muggers feeding a drug habit.  They also apply to those who live in corporation flats in this city whose lives are blighted by anti-social behaviour on the part of a small minority who live in the same place.  Civil liberties apply to the victim as much as to an accused.  The balance is wrongly struck against the victim and in favour of the perpetrator of crime.  It is time this House stood up to the perpetrators of crime and redressed the balance in favour of the victims.  That would not involve sweeping away centuries old and much cherished civil liberties, but would be a conscious effort on the part of a group of people who represent the victims of crime to address the real issues.  This Bill does not address notional issues, but real problems with our criminal law and should be given a Second Reading.  The Government should stop looking to review bodies on matters such as this.  It is time it introduced legislation to deal with the crime wave and stopped avoiding its responsibilities because, to use the Latin maxim, <i>salus populi lex suprema est,</i> the welfare of the people is the supreme law. If the Government is not willing to counter <Col N="531" /> the crime-wave, it ought to accept proposals from those who are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is deemed out of order as it extends the provisions of section 2 to allow for payment of an allowance to the Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  This amendment involves a potential charge on the Revenue and must be adjudged out of order.  However, the Deputy may comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad is an office holder of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  His office is a constitutional one which has not been recognised in this Bill.  The holder of that office is a very busy person and an examination of the number of meetings of the Seanad and the number of times the Leas-Chathaoirleach must be in possession of the Chair and, therefore, in control of the Seanad indicates clearly that he is certainly as busy, if not busier, than many chairpersons of committees.</P>
      <P>I understand that the allowance for the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach has not been reviewed since 1938 when it stood at £750 &mdash; it is of a higher order than that now.  I also understand that this was not referred to specifically in the independent report which looked at these allowances. Although it might not be possible to have it dealt with now, it should be noted and included in any future re-examination of these allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that in the next section of this Bill under subsection (2) it is possible to give retrospective effect to payments.  In that context the upgrading of the allowance paid to the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the <Col N="534" /> Seanad to the same level as that of chairpersons of committees could be attended to.  The amount of remuneration necessary to bring it up to that level is small and, given the work carried out by the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, I would have no hesitation in recommending to the Government Whip that it be attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with what Deputy Kenny says about this.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad is currently paid an annual sum by way of salary in respect of the duties pertaining to his office.  I accept he has onerous duties but it is not necessary to include a provision in legislation because the amount he is currently receiving may be varied under existing legislation.  I take the point made by the Deputy and perhaps in any future review of remuneration such as the Gleeson report a submission may be made in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to hear that.  Perhaps I will be allowed to comment on it.  The point was made to me by a number of people that if we accept the findings of the Gleeson report in respect of the various allowances to be paid arising <Col N="535" /> from officerships and responsibilities held by people, payment should be made from the date of publication of that report.  I have spoken to the Minister about this matter and it is the Government's intention that payment be made from 12 January 1993 when the new Dáil committees were formed.  The Minister made his point clearly and obviously there is no point in my pursuing the matter further.  The reason I put down this amendment was to seek, for those who held chairmanships of existing Dáil committees, remuneration from the date of publication of the Gleeson report, which recommended that payment be made to these people.  If the Government intends to make payment only from 12 January 1993 there is no point in my trying to make it retrospective to 30 January 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have sympathy with the intent of this amendment, it would be unusual to make the provision retrospective to a period that related to a previous Dáil &mdash; payment will be made from the date of formation of the current Dáil, 12 January 1993 &mdash; and on that basis the Government cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's Second Stage speech before Christmas he said that the Bill deals with the removal of the statutory provision applicable only to Members of the Oireachtas who reside within ten miles of Leinster House which restricts the payment of travelling allowances to such Members to days on which they attend sittings of the relevant House or meetings of House committees.  Since many deletions have been made from the Bill, is this provision being deleted from section 4 or is it covered elsewhere in the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but I wish to address the sections together because they are all relevant to secretarial assistants.  When the Bill was initially introduced it was intended that the position of secretarial assistants to Members of the House would be regularised and legalised because of the court case.  Discussion of the Bill was stopped on Second Stage to allow negotiations and it was decided, following discussion with various people in the House, to remove the three sections relating to secretarial assistants.  That is the reason for the deletion of sections 7, 8 and 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the way the Minister made this proposal. I can think of very few cases where it was proposed to regularise the position of people in the way it was proposed to regularise the position of secretarial assistants in this Bill.  The Minister glossed over many points in this issue. Pressure in this Chamber from a number of Deputies and resolute action by a trade union was required to get us to the stage <Col N="537" /> where these iniquitous sections will be removed.</P>
      <P>What was proposed by way of regularising the position of secretarial assistants to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas was nothing less than their abandonment to chance.  It was proposed that any small element of job security they might have would be dispensed with, and I find that unacceptable.  The fact that the Government proposed these changes is eloquent comment on its views on equality and the position of women working in positions such as these.</P>
      <P>In the original Bill it was proposed to make secretarial assistants no more than appendages of the Members of this and the other House.  They were to be totally dependent on Members and their fate dependent not only on the fate of Members, which is the case to some extent, but on their whims.  For people who have given valuable service in very difficult circumstances, that was a most insulting proposal.  It should never have been proposed by anybody let alone by the Fianna Fáil Party and least of all by the Labour Party.  I am glad these provisions are being taken out of the Bill but I am concerned about what might be put in their place.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this matter because in a previous incarnation, before my elevation, or re-elevation to the back-benches I spent some time trying to get clarity on the position of secretarial assistants, which was difficult.  I hope the Minister and his advisers will not come back and propose a system that is based on, or comparable with, a system in any other parliament.  That is not good enough.  We are not dealing with another parliament, we are dealing with the Oireachtas and with people who perform very valuable work.  It is not good enough to model ourselves on parliaments where they seem to do these things more conveniently or where the employment climate is less difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 May I tabled questions to the Minister for Finance asking him to comment on the continuing uncertainty about the position of secretarial assistants at <Col N="538" /> that time and when his officials would be dealing with the matter.  In reply, the Minister made a number of very revealing remarks.  He said the Bill, including these offending sections, was drafted &ldquo;to ensure that such employment&rdquo;&mdash; that is the employment of secretarial assistants &mdash;&ldquo;was on a constitutionally unimpeachable basis and to eliminate misunderstandings of the status of such staff which had come to light during High Court proceedings&rdquo;.  I would hate that anybody should worry about the constitutional unimpeachability of my status and remove misunderstanding by simply casting me adrift, as the Bill had proposed to do to secretarial assistants.  We could all do without that kind of concern. I hope the Minister and his advisers will take a different view of how they make the status of secretarial assistants &ldquo;constitutionally unimpeachable&rdquo; in the future because this does not mean to me that they have to be left entirely at the mercy of the electoral fortunes of Members of either House or of the passing whims of Members.  That is not the way to employ people.  This is a very difficult area with which to deal.  Unless we change matters substantially there will be, until further notice, 166 Members in this House and we would need to pass a referendum, if one is required, or the necessary legislation, to change that number.  There will continue to be the constitutionally prescribed number of Members of Seanad Éireann.  The balance between parties changes quite a bit and I have the great ambition of ensuring the balance changes in favour of my party in the future, but that is another day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That creates problems but we should not exacerbate them in the way that sections of this misbegotten Bill, as initiated, intended to do.  To treat the payment of secretarial assistants as an allowance to Members of this House puts the assistants in the category of being mere extensions.  As it were, of Members as well as making Members responsible <Col N="539" /> for employing staff.  The last thing I want to do, Sir, and the last thing my constituents would expect me to do, is to spend time worrying about whether my secretary's P35 is in order and making the proper returns of PAYE and PRSI and dealing with leave and other matters that inevitably go with employing somebody. I know there are Members who do it, that is their choice, but I have no interest in doing so.  It is not what I got elected to do.  My secretary is based in Leinster House because that suits my work.  I choose not to deal with other matters concerning her employment not because of any difficulty with my secretary, whom I will not embarrass by describing as the best I ever had &mdash; she has been with me for the past 11 years &mdash; but simply because Members should not have to deal with that.  Under the provisions of this Bill it was intended that we would all have to do that whether we liked it or not.  Now it is an option but it was intended to take that option away from us.</P>
      <P>We should not allow this Bill to be passed in what Deputy O'Donnell described as its gutted form.  It has been modified and is now a respectable Bill, but we should not let it pass without marking the occasion in a way that puts the Government on notice that we will not put up with what it intended to do in the first place.  The Government had better not come back after the summer recess with a Bill that treats this important matter in the same way that it intended before.  If it wants &ldquo;constitutional unimpeachability&rdquo; it better find some other way that does not interfere with the rights or prejudice the careers of people working in this House. Whatever the difficulties in the courts, and I have not seen any complete explanation of all that, another way had better be found other than putting secretarial assistants on the hazard as had been proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Bill is more or less agreed it is a tradition to be complimentary to the Government and it would be churlish of me not to say that I am delighted, in that <Col N="540" /> time-honoured phrase, that even at the eleventh hour the Government has chosen to mend its hand.  It would be wrong, however to let this occasion pass without saying that the Government should be thoroughly ashamed of itself for ever having proposed such a cockamamie way of dealing with this question in the first place.  I hope we have seen the last of this nonsense and that when it comes back with a scheme to deal with the undoubted problem that exists, it will be a fair, just and equitable scheme that does not treat people in the insulting way this Bill started out to do.</P>

      <P>Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, caused a great deal of controvesy earlier when the Bill was initially introduced. I have no intention of making a Second Stage speech but there has been a great deal of movement towards the protection of rights and the status and security of the existing secretarial staff in Leinster House.  A number of meetings have taken place between the Whips together with union and staff representatives. As the sections have been removed it would be everyone's intention &mdash; and certainly that of my party &mdash; to ensure that the good and loyal staff who have given excellent service are looked after so that they have no fears of being cast on the unemployment heap.</P>
      <P>This Bill is proceeding with the agreement of the Whips on the basis that the relevant sections are being removed from it and I hope when we next come to deal with it, it will be effective and fair.  I hope we will deal with it in the next session.  A cloud hangs over all secretarial assistants and staff which they are anxious to have removed and be secure in their positions. In that context this Bill will go ahead having removed the sections relating to the employment and security of secretarial assistants.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party supports the Bill in its new form.  We are very pleased that commonsense has prevailed and that those sections will be deleted from the Bill.  I regarded this initially as an attempt by the Department of Finance <Col N="541" /> to dump the responsibility for secretaries, and indeed other categories of staff, onto the shoulders of the Members.  That might have worked had it not been for the strong opposition on the part of all parties in the Dáil, particularly at back-bench level.  Our staff in the Labour Party have separate contracts with SIPTU and individual categories within the staff have different arrangements dating back many years.  This is a complex problem and one that must be addressed not just collectively but individually within the parties in the Dáil, including both Government parties.  Any resolution that emerges must be with the agreement of the union.  I am not sure whether the secretarial assistants of other parties are members of SIPTU or any other trade union but all our staff members are in a trade union.  On their behalf I wish to express appreciation to the Minister for the sympathetic way in which he received the recommendations made to him.  I am sure he has played a major part in achieving what is before us this evening.</P>
      <P>In relation to staff matters, the Department of Finance should not be allowed get away with that type of activity again. It was a most deplorable approach to take to an industrial relations issue involving hard working people in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the men and women who work equally hard in the constituency offices and who were not consulted by anybody on that occasion.  A mistake was made; I am glad it has been corrected and I thank the Minister for that.</P>

      <P>As someone who vociferously opposed Second Stage of this Bill because of the offending sections, I am glad they have now been deleted.  Some action will have to be taken, however, in relation to a change in the contractual relationship which exists at present between the Department of Finance and the secretaries.  This matter must be dealt with in a sensitive way and by agreement with the people concerned, our valued secretarial assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we have been able to proceed with this Bill having deleted the offending <Col N="542" /> sections.  The manner in which the Bill was introduced constituted a unilateral severance of the contractual relationship between the Department of Finance and the secretaries.  The approach taken to this issue constituted part of the offence in addition to the substance of the offence.  Since then there has been a certain loss of trust and confidence on the part of the secretaries because they feel they are under threat.  There are no grounds for many of their fears but it is important for them to know that the Whips of all the political parties are on their side in this matter.  We have been at pains to stress that and avoid a situation where the secretarial assistants regard us as the aggressors in this matter.  We as individual Members and collectively as the Whips representing our individual parties care deeply about the economical and emotional welfare of these women who work for us so loyally.  The secretaries of this House need have no fear because we are batting for them on this matter and if it comes to the point where an agreement has to be reached, we will negotiate the best type of agreement which will not diminish their status or their entitlements.  My party in particular would not stand over any agreement which would allow for a diminishing of those entitlements.  Contracts may be entered into in the future and that will be a separate category but the status of those secretaries currently on the payroll will be maintained.</P>
    <P>While we are addressing this problem we should avail of the opportunity to examine the salary scale of secretaries and perhaps revise them upwards.  The work carried by the secretaries at all levels, whether they are working for Members of the Front Bench, the back-benches or in the Whips office, and are extremely busy, must be examined.  I have never experienced such a workload as that undertaken by the secretaries in this House.  Their hours are long and they are very giving of their time and energy.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have proceeded with the remainder of the Bill.  In many ways we have cherry-picked the Bill and removed sections which would not have allowed <Col N="543" /> the committees to work effectively, which is important.  The problem has not disappeared, however, in relation to the contractual relationship between Members and their secretarial assistants. Many Members are very resistant to change and, as Deputy Dukes said, many of them do not want to become employers.  They do not want the administrative hassle and the responsibility of being an employer.  In making these changes we must consult with each Member of the House in relation to any new legislation which will redefine the contractual relationship which exists between secretaries and the Department of Finance or, as might well be the case in the future, between secretaries and individual Deputies.  This legislation represents a whole new horizon in terms of the industrial relations landscape of this House and we must get it right.  The rights of these employees that are in place now must not be diminished in any way.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further negotiations by the Whips but this matter should not be left to them because the issue is broader than the cosy relationship with the Whips.  Other Deputies, such as Deputy Dukes, must be given an opportunity to make a contribution and I am sure other Members have strong views on championing the rights of secretaries. They may wish to champion their own rights also by not being burdened with the responsibility of being full-time employees.  I hope the current mediation is progressing and that in due course an arrangement will be proposed with which we can all agree and which will lead to a more harmonious relationship than is evident at the moment because of uncertainty. Many of the women are experiencing a sense of gloom and with the prospect of an election in the next 18 months or two years, they are wondering what will happen to them at that time if they do not have security of tenure and if their rights and entitlements are unclear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my views on this matter clear on Second Stage and I do not see any point in prolonging the <Col N="544" /> debate now by repeating those views. The views I advanced at the time were as a result of discussions I had with secretaries of all parties, at their request, who came to me presumably because of what Deputy Dukes described as a previous incarnation.  I put those views on the record of the House at that time but it is important to recall that both parties in Government sponsored this Bill.  It did not emerge from the Department of Finance.  It is true that when it was finally brought before the House, certain colleagues who sit behind me in the Chamber recovered their trade union credentials and objected to the Bill.  As a result progress on the Bill slowed down. It was ill judged, unfortunate and wrong that we should have dealt in the way we did with the status of secretaries and their careers.  It is wrong that they should be regarded as appendages of Members of the House.  Is the judgment which triggered this available?  When we last dealt with the matter there was no written judgment but the Whips would be interested in looking at it if it is available now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we will pass the Bill tonight there is continuing uncertainty about the secretarial staff.  I agree with Deputies Dukes, O'Donnell and Kenny that this should not be taken as lessening the need for urgency in clarifying the position as soon as possible in the new session.  It would be right if whatever change we make allows us to look at secretaries remuneration.  It is all very well for us to praise them but the only praise they are interested in at the end of the day is their weekly pay cheque.  It is not commensurate with the work they do. Anyone who praises 100 per cent of the staff unreservedly is a hypocrite.  By and large the overwhelming majority of the staff perform work which, of its nature, is above and beyond the call of duty for wage scale which is not commensurate with that duty.  It is a bit late in the day to continue admitting it is a bastardised scale which cannot be related directly to any other grade in the public service and which is still on a permanent <i>ad hoc</i> basis. <Col N="545" /> We should take this opportunity to correct that.</P>
    <P>It is a complex issue and difficult to tackle.  To some extent secretaries are dependent on the Member for whom they work continuing in the House.  The modicum of security they enjoy should not be dispensed with in the manner proposed in the Bill originally.  We should look at a more reasonable basis for the employment of staff whose contribution is valued by all Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will revert to the origins of the Bill.  Most Members are aware of the circumstances which gave rise to the Bill.  Advice was given that the scheme in operation was not in accordance with Article 15 of the Constitution which states that the Oireachtas must make provision by law for any facilities that are made available to Members of the House.  There was a secretarial scheme in place which was not covered in law.  Following the 1992 general election, the secretary of a Member who was defeated in that election took a court case to establish that she was employed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and since the overall number of secretarial assistants had not been reduced her employment should continue.  In support of her claim she argued that in the absence of legislation as specified by the Constitution she must be regarded as being on the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The court decided that she and other secretarial assistants were employees of the political parties of individual Deputies.  That is all we can go on.  The judgment is not available to date but the note taken by the staff of the Chief State Solicitor is available and confirms the position I outlined in my speech on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amendment to delete section 13 (3).  Commitments were given to the union at a meeting on 25 November that, although the Bill would be put in place as we were anxious to have the Chairman's allowances and Leader of the House allowances for the Seanad, sections 7, 8 and 9 would not be put in place until agreement was reached with the union.  That commitment was sought <Col N="546" /> from the Whips and agreed to by the Minister for Finance.  It was not intended to steamroll it through without agreement and discussion.  Perhaps it was unwise to tie the two together.  I wish to put it clearly on the record that it was never the Government's intention to steamroll it through and cast the secretaries aside who have given such loyal and dedicated support to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The secretarial assistants were not satisfied with that and were afraid that if the Bill were passed it would be put in place.  That is why we withdrew it.  I understood their fear.  It was my intention, had the Bill gone to Committee Stage as originally intended, to insert another amendment that, even with the commencement date and so on, sections 7, 8 and 9 could not come into force without an agreement being debated and voted on by Members.  The Whips were anxious that the secretarial assistants should not feel they were abandoned.</P>
    <P>The reason the Bill was brought in and the sections were inserted was the fear that the position of secretarial assistants was unconstitutional.  Deputy Dukes took a particular attitude towards being an employer and having the responsibility of employers and his view was echoed by members of my parliamentary party.  There are some Deputies who would not be happy to act as employers of their secretaries.  In some cases they would not have the necessary skills and in others they would not want the bother. I can understand why this is the case. Under the Bill as originally drafted, it was possible for parties or individual Deputies to make arrangements so that they would become the employers.  This issue must be addressed under whatever new arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to salaries.  Deputy Rabbitte was honest in his remarks &mdash; most secretarial assistants are excellent but some are not.  This is the case in every job &mdash; some Members are excellent while others are not.  I agree that the salary scale is not very attractive for good secretarial assistants; I have no argument with that point.  I can only speak from experience and my constituency secretary <Col N="547" /> is not paid half enough.  That is an issue for another day.  The issue of salaries was addressed by the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission and an independent examination was carried out by agreed assessors some years ago.  As a result, the salaries of secretarial assistants were substantially increased.  There are pluses in having a salary attached to a Civil Service grade but there are also pluses in not having it attached to a grade: one could gain on the swings but lose on the roundabout.</P>
    <P>This issue will not go away and must be addressed.  From the contacts I had since last December in endeavouring to reach an agreed position with the secretarial assistants &mdash; I was assisted in this by the Law Reform Commission &mdash; I am aware that even with the best will in the world the party Whips will not be able to resolve some issues, for example, pension schemes, the way in which secretaries are to be paid and who the paymasters will be.  These issues will have to be resolved by the union and the Department of Finance.  I think all the Whips experienced difficulties in trying to resolve the problems about pension schemes.  We are not competent to deal with this issue which will have to be dealt with at official level.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that every assistance possible should be offered to the secretarial assistants and the Department so that the matter can be resolved.  I will be more than willing to do this.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise the issue is the serious position which has arisen with regard to boat owners on the lakes of Killarney.  It was recently brought to my notice that boats had been confiscated by the Office of Public Works who is now requesting £50 for their return.  The owner of one particular boat has been using the lakes of Killarney for over 20 years, like his father before him.  Such <Col N="549" /> people use their boats usually at weekends for personal purposes, particularly for leisure.  I am not speaking here about commercial operators.</P>
    <P>A lottery is held each year when 20 permits are allocated for the operations of private boat owners on the lakes, which is not a satisfactory manner in which to deal with the people of Killarney who have had boats on the lakes for their personal use for generations, in some cases, such people and their ancestors have had exclusive use of the lakes for leisure purposes before the Office of Public Works took charge.  This confiscation of boats belonging to the local people will have to stop immediately. The Office of Public Works will have to devise a system to accommodate the needs of local boat owners who use the lakes for a few hours at weekends and on summer evenings.  I understand that the position must be monitored but not at the expense of people who, for generations, have been using those lakes.  It is a sad day when a man who has used the lakes all his life, like his father before him, cannot take his son out on the lakes without having his boat confiscated and being advised that he can no longer go on the lakes until next year's lottery is held when he may be successful.</P>
    <P>I am requesting the Office of Public Works to deal with the position as a matter of urgency because it will not be long before the winter is upon us.  I realise I am exceptionally fortunate to live in a beautiful town like Killarney but I regret that my fellow Killarney citizens cannot avail of the natural amenities we are so fortunate in having.</P>
    <P>These boat owners are merely seeking fair play.  They are not causing any problems, and never have, on the lakes of Killarney which are very dear to them. The Minister of State will appreciate how aggrieved they feel that on this beautiful evening they cannot take their boats out on the lake as they have done for generations.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister of State to look after the traditional, private boat owners of Killarney and issue them with permanent permits to allow them to continue <Col N="550" /> the only leisure facility or pastime they have enjoyed for generations.  I appeal to the Minister to issue these people with licences and resort to the lottery for some other boat owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for having raised this matter because it affords me a chance to explain the system in greater detail. Indeed I agree with her that she lives in a very beautiful town.</P>
      <P>This system was not imposed on people.  In 1987, the Office of Public Works, in consultation with local boating interests in Killarney, introduced a system of licensed commercial boating on the lakes of Killarney.  This system was introduced to control the operation of commercial boats in the interests of safety and to conserve the special amenities of beauty and tranquility of these internationally renowned lakes.</P>
      <P>When a system of licensing was subsequently introduced from 1991 onwards in respect of private boating &mdash; for the same reason as commercial ones &mdash; additional mooring facilities were provided by the Office of Public Works, principally in the Ross Castle area.  This was done to accommodate the maximum number of privately-owned boats that could be licensed for the lakes.</P>
      <P>This allocation of licences was made by the Office of Public Works in consultation with local angling clubs and took into account the length of time the licence applicants had previously used the lakes.  Applications for licences were sought through advertisements placed in local newspapers.  The number of applications received far exceeded the number of mooring spaces available.  It was not possible to accommodate all applicants. A waiting list of unsuccessful applicants has been retained and spaces are allocated from this list as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To provide some opportunity for some of those awaiting licences to gain access to the lakes, a &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; was held in January of this year, as a result of which 20 mooring spaces were provided for a <Col N="551" /> period of one year.  The lottery draw was in the presence of representatives of local angling clubs.  These licences will continue to be advertised on an annual basis. Boats operating from privately-owned lands adjoining the lakes have also been licensed with the agreement of the landowners involved.  Further mooring spaces cannot be provided without adversely impacting on the amenity of the lakes and the conservation objectives of Killarney National Park.</P>
    <P>The system of licensing boats on the lakes of Killarney has now been in operation for a number of years and has been accepted by the local community.  The Office of Public Works has gone to great lengths to ensure that the system of control is supported and accepted by the local community.  Regular meetings are held with angling clubs to discuss and agree matters pertaining to the operation of the system.  Therefore it cannot be claimed that the requirements for a licence are not widely known throughout the area.</P>
    <P>In implementing the boat licensing system, the Office of Public Works removed a number of unauthorised boats from the lakes.  These boats are released to the owners when they provide an undertaking not to place their boat back on the lakes, unless authorised to do so by way of licence.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has made extensive efforts to facilitate as many private boat owners as possible consistent with their obligations and responsibilities for the protection of the amenity of the lakes and the conservation of the natural resources of the national park.</P>
    <P>A licensing system is essential for the safe and orderly operation of boating activity on the lakes.  It also prevents the introduction of unsuitable and undesirable craft such as jet skis and power boats.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this licensing system is a necessary measure and is implemented equitably by the Office of Public Works.  I am also satisfied that there is, with the co-operation of the individuals involved, a system in place <Col N="552" /> whereby craft which have been removed for unlawfully using the lakes, can be returned to their owners.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the very serious matter of the pollution of the Lung River in North Roscommon last week when, one morning, thousands of fish were discovered in the river, belly up.  The extent of the pollution was not realised at first but, as time went on, it became apparent that seven miles of the river had been very seriously polluted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, the fisheries board and Roscommon County Council, the people involved with the local environment, have taken tests of the water the results of which have not yet come to hand.  Consequently, <Col N="553" /> no person or persons can be pointed to as being the culprits of this pollution.  However, in the locality it is estimated that there were three possible sources of pollution on this occasion.  The first arises from farmyard activity, another from factory waste and a third from the town sewerage system.</P>
    <P>I know the farming scene in that area and in my opinion if all the farms were put together they could not possibly have caused the pollution that has become apparent in the river during the past few days.  That rules out the possibility of farmyard activity causing the pollution.</P>
    <P>In regard to factory waste, the factory management has spent enormous sums of money on upgrading its treatment plant in recent years.  This seems to indicate that the pollution did not arise from that source.  That leaves only the town sewerage system, which was put in place 30 years ago.  In May 1993 Roscommon County Council submitted plans to the Department of the Environment for the upgrading of the existing sewerage system in Ballaghaderreen and also to cater for double the capacity of the present plant, bearing in mind that the population of the town has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. However, the Department of the Environment did not accede to that request and today there has been severe pollution of the river.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, an inter-provincial fishing competition organised for next weekend has had to be cancelled. That very prestigious fishing competition has been sought after for the past four years by the fishing folk of Ballaghaderreen. This year they thought they were lucky in having it come to the shores of the Lung River but unfortunately it has had to be cancelled.  I understand that without any further pollution it will take a minimum of two years before the river will be restored to its former state.  The answer to this problem may lie in the hands of the Department of the Environment who can provide the funds for the total replacement of the sewage treatment plant in Ballaghaderreen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>(Wexford)</i>: I thank Deputies Connor and Foxe for raising this matter.  Summer months represent the peak risk period for our rivers and lakes when water levels are generally low and when accidental spillages, if they should occur, will have their greatest impact.  The River Lung incident is an unfortunate reminder of the need for extreme vigilance in relation to the discharge of effluents to rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>While documentation on the circumstances of the River Lung incident has yet to be completed.  I understand that the fish kill is thought to have occurred late on the night of Wednesday, 15 June.  The incident was reported to both the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and Roscommon County Council on Thursday morning, 16 June, and the council and the fisheries board immediately commenced investigations.  Estimates of the number of fish killed range up to 10,000 &mdash; mainly roach and bream &mdash; over a seven mile stretch of the river.</P>
      <P>On being made aware of the incident we immediately requested the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the causes and circumstances and make a report.  Investigation by all of the agencies concerned is still continuing and full analysis will take a few more days.  I expect the Environmental Protection Agency to complete its report very shortly.</P>
      <P>While fish kills represent a serious ecological loss, the numbers of such kills has been falling steadily in recent years.  In 1987 there were 122 fish kills and in 1989, 111.  This fell to 60 in 1991, 51 in 1992 and 29 in 1993.  The numbers reported to date in 1994 are also very low &mdash; some five or six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very gratifying feature of this overall trend is the decline in the level of fish kills caused by farm-related activities which traditionally were the main cause of fish kills.  These fell from 95 in 1987 to an all time low of three in 1993.  This fall can be attributed to the thousands of farm <Col N="555" /> surveys carried out since 1988 by the local authorities at the request of my Department, which led to the identification of high and medium risk farms and appropriate remedial action programmes.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution, 1989-1993, some £94 million has been provided by way of grant assistance to farmers in the period 1989 to 1993 representing a total investment of some £200 million in improved waste storage and animal housing facilities.  A follow up scheme is currently being prepared by Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The new rural environment protection scheme and the implementation of the EU nitrates directive will further assist the control of agricultural pollution.</P>
    <P>The River Lung incident has been an untimely reminder of the constant threat of water pollution.  Without prejudice to the detailed results of the investigations taking place, and the prosecutions which may arise, all persons concerned in potential water polluting activities should now take extra care to manage and secure their operations in a way that will protect the environment.  I call on farmers, industrialists, local authorities and others to manage effluent wastes and exercise the maximum care for the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of this matter.  He is not responsible, but he inherited the causes of this problem.  Unfortunately the situation is getting more serious as time passes because of the number of directors of community care who are either acting, acting temporarily, part-time or whatever, on a variety of scales of appointment that is obviously unsatisfactory. They are unsatisfactory from the point of view of those attempting to fulfil their role and obligation to the health boards and there is a concern that the dispute is likely to be ongoing in such a fashion as <Col N="556" /> to disrupt services.  The problem is that the ongoing needs of the handicapped, the disabled and the elderly in the normal course of events, require the attention of the directors of community care on a daily and hourly basis.  These services are administered by the directors of community care in each health board area.  I accept that it does not apply to the same extent in all cases.  Those of us who operate in the Eastern Health Board know there are some variations.</P>
      <P>The problem was brought to my attention in the past few weeks in a way which gave a graphic description of what is happening. An unfortunate person awaiting a decision on a disabled person's grant could not get a decision, because of the particular problem that exists.  The Minister may say that should not cause a problem, but unfortunately these problems have a habit of turning up at the most inopportune times, causing serious difficulties for the people at the receiving end.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Minister, without interfering in the negotiations in which he has to become involved, to use all his powers and influence to bring about an early resolution of the dispute with a view to ensuring the maximum delivery of the broadest possible range of services is made available to the general public unimpeded.  Failure to do so could cause serious hardship, considerable stress and strain of both a financial and physical nature.  Failure to respond now could have much more serious consequences for the morale of the people involved and the services generally.  We should take whatever steps are necessary immediately to resolve the difficulties.  This would be in the interests of staff in the health services and of those who expect services to be delivered through the health boards.  As an emergency measure the Minister should ensure that the delivery of services to the most vulnerable in society is not impeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I regret that this dispute has been in progress for almost five weeks <Col N="557" /> despite the best efforts of the management side to find an equitable solution. There are 33 posts of director of community care in the health board service. Seven of the post holders are employed in a permanent capacity and continue to carry out their duties.  The remaining 26 are involved in the dispute and have reverted to their substantive senior area medical officer posts.  The Deputy will understand the reason the posts were not made permanent &mdash; total restructuring of public health medicine was envisaged and there was an ambitious plan to achieve this.</P>
      <P>My Department is in constant contact with the health boards to monitor the effects of the dispute.  In particular I have been anxious to ensure that interruptions of service that could give cause for concern should a medical input be withheld are closely watched so that alternative coping mechanisms can be put in place at short notice in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation agreed from the beginning of the dispute to provide cover for emergencies.  However, I took the precaution last week to write to the IMO formally requesting a continuation of the emergency cover provision in the continuing absence of a resolution of the dispute.</P>
      <P>The emergencies which, on both the public health and humanitarian grounds, demand medical involvement would be cases of child abuse or neglect, outbreaks of infectious disease or serious pollution incidents.  To date, there have been no emergency-level incidents of either infectious disease or pollution and occurrences relating to child welfare have been successfully dealt with under the agreed emergency provisions.</P>
      <P>A public health medical service continues to be provided.  The normal duties of public health doctors not affected by the dispute continue to be carried out. These are permanent senior area medical officers and both permanent and temporary area medical officers.  I have sought an assurance from the IMO that these doctors will continue to work normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> The management side in this dispute has made strenuous efforts to being about a successful resolution but so far to no avail.  Proposals for settlement which I regard as both reasonable and equitable have been put to the Irish Medical Organisation in negotiations and subsequently in writing and clarifications have been provided on request.  The management side have formally proposed to the IMO that, should it not be possible to reach agreement, the matter should be put to a third party.  To date, the IMO has been unable to agree to this.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that no hardship has been caused to any member of the public arising from this dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I urge the members of the Irish Medical Organisation to carefully re-examine their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I wish to raise the case of a 15 year old currently on remand to Mountjoy Prison.  I understand that for the past three weeks this young boy has been looked after by two security staff and a psychiatric nurse at an address in my constituency.  He has been in the care of the health board for some time.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case represents a complete policy failure and the Minister must take responsibility for this.  It is not good enough that all we have to offer our most vulnerable young people, particularly in our capital city, is a choice between bed and breakfast accommodation, the criminal justice system or the care which <Col N="559" /> this boy has been receiving.  This represents a primitive policy and the Minister should be ashamed to preside over such a system.  This flies in the face of good practice.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that some of these children are falling between the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, that appropriate services are not being provided and money is not being given to the Minister's Department to develop the services that the children need.  As a consequence, they are being dealt with under the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with one case; this case highlights weaknesses in the system and forms part of a pattern of policy failures.  I hope the Minister will not tell me that the circumstances of the case dictated the results.  In reality we are failing vulnerable adolescent children.  It is ironic that under the Child Care Act we have responsibility, in theory, for children up to 18 years of age but we have not developed the services that children between 12 and 18 years of age need or intervened in the cycles of disadvantage that they face.</P>
    <P>An ostrich like approach to policy in this area has been adopted.  I challenge the Minister to address this because this is a catch 22 for young people caught in this situation.  Inappropriate placements lead to deteriorating behaviour.  Appropriate placements would give these children an opportunity to force an alternative pattern.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take a deep interest in this matter which has been with us for some time.  He should tackle it and prioritise the development of services for these young people.  It is clear that with many residential units closing down we need a small number of specialist residential units for adolescents most at risk. The test of the service will be how it provides for the most needy children. How much of the £10 million which the Minister recently announced for the implementation of the Child Care Act is being spent on preventive services for <Col N="560" /> adolescents?  Where are these services being provided?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; this is relevant &mdash; to produce a national strategy for the development of foster care.  How many foster parents have been recruited in each health board area in the past five years? I think the Minister will be surprised by the answer.  This area is not being given priority.</P>
    <P>How much has it cost the health board to employ two security staff and one psychiatric nurse to look after this boy? Every civilised city has to cope with cases like this.  We can do better.  How many other children must come to our attention in this way before this serious gap in the services is dealt with?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to give the Deputy, and the House, the facts of this case; perhaps the Deputy will change some of her views when she hears them.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is one of three young people on whose behalf proceedings have been initiated in the High Court claiming that they are not receiving proper care from the Eastern Health Board under the Child Care Act. The Deputy will appreciate that I am somewhat constrained in what I can say about his current care.</P>
      <P>I understand that the community care services of the Eastern Health Board have had contact with this boy since 1979. He has been placed in a number of residential centres by the Eastern Health Board since then.  I understand from the board that his conduct has been characterised by serious episodes of violence and damage to property, including setting fire to some of the residential places in which he has been residing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times his conduct deteriorated to the extent that none of the existing residential services available to the Eastern Health Board was able to cope with him.  The Eastern Health Board decided that, as it could no longer contain him in any of the range of accommodation at present available, it had no option but to make special arrangements for him &mdash; and one other boy &mdash; in a house <Col N="561" /> owned by the board in the Ranelagh area of Dublin.  During the June bank holiday weekend, the board had the house, which had been idle for some time, cleaned and made arrangements to install a television, video, etc.  The board provided four staff, having experience in the area of child psychiatry, to provide 24 hour care on a rota basis for the two boys.  In view of their behavioural problems the board also found it necessary to provide for private security personnel to be present at the premises.  I am advised that the two boys were provided with their meals, all necessary washing facilities, pocket money, leisure activities and asistance in relation to their general welfare.  The board also made arrangements to have the boy in question admitted to a FÁS course.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that an episode followed which resulted in the breakage of all the windows and furniture in the premises and the smashing of the television.  Subsequent to this, the board repaired the damage done and continued to try to provide care for the two boys.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will agree that the Eastern Health Board has gone to great lengths to try to provide for this boy. To talk in terms of primitive policy is inappropriate in the extreme in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the problems encountered by the board, it must be <Col N="562" /> recognised that there are limits to what we can expect from our health services. Under the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards do not have power to detain individuals within institutions or to compel them to accept the care or accommodation on offer.</P>
      <P>I recently unveiled the child care action plan for 1994 detailing further developments of child care services within each health board costing £10 million in a full year.  Among the new services to be put in place are a range of developments relating to the care of young homeless which will cost almost £2 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The allocation which I approved for the Eastern Health Board includes provision for the development of the board's carers for young people scheme.  This will involve the assessment and selection of an additional 50 families who will be trained to care for and manage difficult adolescents.  The moneys provided will also help the development and expansion of foster care services, including the recruitment of an additional 30 foster places this year.  This will facilitate the transfer to family settings of children currently in residential care.  A total of 75 per cent of all children in care are in foster care, a growing part of the child care service.  The moneys will also fund the development of a six to eight bed special unit which will cater for the particular needs for children with behavioural problems who require intensive care and the provision of additional residential places for homeless youngsters.</P>
      <P>By any reasonable yardstick, this is a major programme of investment in residential child care and associated services. As I said, the full year cost of the developments I outlined is of the order of £2 million.  With the expansion of our community care and family support services, they will go a long way towards filling the gaps that exist in our current service levels and will assist the health boards to respond more effectively to children in need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During my address to the House on 16 June last on the Community Support Framework for Ireland, I indicated that the broad thrust of the individual <Col N="419" /> transport investments listed in the National Development Plan, which includes £200 million for the development of a light rail system in Dublin, would be dealt within the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999. The programme is under negotiation with the European Commission at present and I expect that it will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The basic light rail system recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely &mdash; via the Harcourt Street line &mdash; and Ballymun and would cost approximately £300 million to implement.  Possibilities for further extensions to the basic network will also be reported on in the final report of the DTI which will be completed soon.  The basic network cannot be constructed within the EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the national plan.  Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the plan will be needed to complete the basic DTI network.</P>
    <P>Anticipating the agreement of the European Commission to these proposals, my Department is engaged in detailed work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links, based on the recommendations of the DTI, which should be constructed over the plan period.  All of the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are co-operating with my Department in this work.  I expect that decisions on these issues will be taken by the Government soon.  The Government's decision on the choice of light rail links will be influenced by major factors such as financial viability, congestion alleviation, levels of peak and off peak demand, social need and ease of construction.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, Bord na Móna operates a policy of transferring to the Wildlife Service all peatlands under its control which are of scientific interest to ensure their proper conservation.

The Wildlife Service has been invited by Bord na Móna to examine all bogs of interest to them with a view to their purchase.

Following negotiations with the ten companies in the groups a total of 28 blocks have been awarded under five licences, with commencement dates of 15 March 1994.

      <P>The position in so far as exploration wells are concerned is that, while no company has a specific obligation to drill in 1994, I have indications from some companies of their drilling intentions and expect that three wells will be drilled this year.  It is not possible to speculate as to the prospects of a commercial discovery being made in 1994.  When the wells have been drilled and all the data acquired has been lodged, a full assessment of the drilled prospects will be made by the company and by my Department.  In the event of an oil or gas discovery, additional appraisal wells would almost certainly be required to fully evaluate the discovery and it could be expected that commerciality could only be established after some months of further work.</P>

      <P>The aim of Directive 93/76/EEC is to limit carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency and requires member states by 31 December 1994 to introduce programmes or measures including, <i>inter alia,</i> the promotion of energy certification of buildings.  In anticipation of this requirement our Department has been involved in a pilot project to develop this concept in Ireland and to provide the necessary information on which to base a voluntary scheme in the existing house market.  This project has enabled the development of an appropriate rating mechanism for Irish conditions and will provide information on the best approaches to promoting a voluntary scheme in this country and these will be developed over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Operating a house certification procedure under the building regulations in tandem with a voluntary scheme for existing houses might be beneficial and while this is primarily a matter for my colleague, Deputy Smith, Minister for the Environment, officials from both Departments are actively pursuing this aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the management and efficiency of balances held by Government Departments in commercial bank accounts, my Department keeps such accounts under continuous review. On the question of the Collector General's account in the Bank of Ireland, this account was reviewed last year and improved terms were put in place.  The opening of such accounts, which are designated &ldquo;public bank accounts&rdquo;, must be approved by the Department of Finance, as required by section 18 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.</P>
      <P>In respect of other public bodies, there are standing instructions to Departments with regard to bodies under their aegis. These instructions refer to the need for Departments to maintain proper control and accountability mechanisms in order to ensure that public bodies making deposits with financial institutions manage their assets and their banking relationships to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government, which provides for the creation of a third banking force to increase competition in the banking sector and to cater for the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, also envisages an enhanced role for such a third force in servicing part of the requirements of Government Departments, local authorities, and State enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The Deputy will be aware that these matters are under review at present and will shortly be considered by the Government. Whatever decisions are ultimately taken, it will remain the case that any bank which operates to a commercial remit will take deposits on terms established by reference to commercial criteria.</P>

      <P>The policy underlying the Registration of Title Act, 1964 was the gradual extension of registration of title to the entire State through the compulsory provisions of the Act.  In 1964, registration of title covered most of the agricultural land and it was decided to extend the benefit of the system to the remainder of such land and to all urban areas as resources would permit.  As a first step, the compulsory provisions were applied from 1 January, 1970 to Counties Meath, Carlow and Laois.</P>
      <P>A combination of the Land Registry's increasing workload and restrictions on Civil Service recruitment in the 1980s, which resulted in a build-up of arrears, has meant that it has not been possible as yet to extend compulsory registration to other counties.  It is envisaged that, when the arrears are cleared and conversion of the registries to a semi-State commercial enterprise is accomplished, there will be further extension of compulsory registration.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda <Col N="428" /> authorities that the existing Garda office in Donaghmede is providing a satisfactory service to the local community and, in the circumstances, there are no proposals to change this arrangement. The Garda office, which is two miles from Coolock station, has been recently relocated from the rear entrance of the Donaghmede Shopping Centre to a location within the centre.  The opening hours for the office are 10 a.m.-12 noon, 2.30 p.m.-4 p.m. and from 7 p.m.-8 p.m., Monday to Saturday inclusive.  There are currently three community gardaí allocated to the Donaghmede area.  They are responsible for manning the Garda office and also carry out community policing duties in the area.</P>
      <P>The Donaghmede area is regularly patrolled by foot and mobile units from Coolock Garda station, with back-up support from the Regional Crime Task Force.  In addition, mobile units from the Special Detective Unit, Drugs Squad and other specialist units patrol the Donaghmede area on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would absorb manpower which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties.  The essential point the Garda authorities make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up manpower indoors in manning a new Garda station and taking up the additional burden of administrative work which this would inevitably involve.</P>
      <P>The current strength at Coolock Garda station is 96.  This includes one sergeant and nine gardaí assigned to community policing duties.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional figures for indictable crime to date in 1994 in the Donaghmede area indicate that there will be a reduction as against the figures for 1993.  The policing arrangements for the Donaghmede area are being kept under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

    <P>Bovine viral diarrhoea &mdash; BVD &mdash; is not a scheduled disease under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  There are no funds at my disposal out of which <Col N="434" /> financial assistance could be given to cover outbreaks of this disease.</P>
    <P>Eradication of BVD in Ireland or elsewhere is not a practical proposition. When serious outbreaks occur, advice should be sought by the owners of affected herds from their veterinary surgeons.

      <P>The Government's aviation policy and the background against which it has been framed is set out in the document &ldquo;Irish Aviation Policy&rdquo; which was published by my Department in February, 1994.  The key objectives of the policy are clearly laid out in the document, which acknowledges that Government policies to realise these objectives have been continually adapted to take account of changes in the international aviation market.  Further changes will be necessary from time to time but these will be implemented within the current consistent policy framework which should allow Irish operators in the aviation sector to plan ahead with some certainly.</P>
      <P>In summary, the Government, in adapting and developing its policy framework, will ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to cater for the continually changing needs of the industry's customers and the range of services provided to meet these needs.  It will also seek to ensure that the policy provides opportunities for public and private sector operators to earn an adequate return on capital invested, both as a reward for risk taking and to finance the continuous increments in investment needed to maintain the competitiveness of the industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two distinct roles in relation to the sector &mdash; one as regulator and one as <Col N="437" /> shareholder for the major players in the sector.  My role as regulator is governed by the single market regulations which provide greater freedom and opportunity for EC licensed airlines in relation to fares, access and establishment.  My immediate priority in this regard is to push at EC level for a follow-up to the suggestions of the <i>Comite des Sages</i> report to the EC Commission regarding measures to improve the competitiveness of European airlines.</P>
    <P>In my shareholder role, my immediate priority is to ensure the return to financial stability of Aer Lingus through effective implementation of the key objectives in the company's strategy for the future.</P>
    <P>My other short term priorities include the introduction of an essential air services programme within Ireland to guarantee a minimum level of service to the regions served by the six privately owned regional airports; examination of proposals to seek extra traffic opportunities for Shannon airport; ensuring that the three State airports are cost competitive and have in place a programme to provide adequate, high quality infrastructure to meet projected demands; promoting direct job and wealth creation in the Irish airline and aviation industry as a whole through opening up new market opportunities for Irish based aviation operators, both in the public and private sector.  In this connection, air transport negotiations have been sought or are underway with a number of countries including Armenia, China, Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Saudi Arabia.  In line with the Government's aviation policy, the scope of these bilateral negotiations extends beyond mere traffic rights to actively seeking business opportunities for Irish operators across the whole spectrum of the aviation sector.</P>

      <P>The entry of An Post into new areas of business is a matter for the board and management of the company in the first instance. However, I would like to point out that since its establishment in 1984, the company has shown a capacity and willingness to expand into new areas of activity appropriate to its core business, as is apparent by its involvement in ventures such as the national lottery, the prize bond company and PostGEM Ltd, its subsidiary operating in the electronic mail market.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in its efforts to protect its current revenue base and generate new revenues, An Post is committed to the development of new services and business opportunities.  The most recent example of this strategy is the establishment of a joint venture company, Printpost Limited, commencing operations in July 1994, which will provide to a range of corporate customers high volume electronic printing and enveloping services for the production of documents such as invoices and statements.</P>

      <P>The present Government and previous administrations have, for many years, been seeking the closure of the Sellafield reprocessing plant and a halt to expansion plans there.  This culminated in two very detailed and wide-ranging submissions sent to the British authorities in 1993 by the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 December 1993, the British Government granted the discharge authorisations to British Nuclear Fuels, BNFL, to allow the THORP plant to <Col N="440" /> operate.  At the time, the two British Ministers involved informed me that they were very conscious of their great personal responsibilities in arriving at their decision and both set aside a significant part of their time to consider with great care the points raised by the Irish Government in the two comprehensive submissions.  They further told me that their decision was reached after long and detailed study of all the information and arguments received during the long consultation process.  They concluded that the new discharge authorisations for Sellafield would ensure compliance with national and international limits and constraints and would not lead to unacceptable risks to human health or the environment.  Nevertheless, having considered all submissions, the UK Ministers informed me that they had decided to impose a number of additional constraints and requirements on BNFL to ensure that all discharges from the site are minimised.  They informed me that all their international commitments were carefully examined and concluded that all relevant obligations were respected.</P>

      <Quest>the latest information in the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland regarding atmospheric emissions from the Sellafield plant in Cumbria.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, with the assistance of the Meteorological Service, operates eight stations at which the levels of atmospheric radioactivity are measured. These eight stations, which are distributed around the country, operate on a continuous basis.  The data from these monitoring stations indicate that the ambient levels of artificial radioactivity in the Irish atmosphere have not been elevated by the routine operation of the Sellafield or other nuclear plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute has, since late last year, been monitoring the atmospheric levels of Krypton 85 at its Dublin laboratory. <Col N="441" /> Because nuclear fuel reprocessing is essentially the only atmospheric source of Krypton 85, and because it is released from reprocessing plants in relatively large quantities, this isotope acts as a sensitive indicator of atmospheric emissions from the Sellafield plant.  The data from the Dublin measurement programme indicates that the levels in Dublin are in line with those expected in temperate latitudes of the northern hemisphere.  No enhancement with respect to other monitoring stations in western Europe has been found.  Any increases resulting from THORP coming into full operation will be monitored by the institute.</P>
    <P>Actual levels of atmospheric discharges from the Sellafield plant are measured at each of the authorised discharge points at the Sellafield site by British Nuclear Fuels Limited, BNFL. The UK regulatory authorities require BNFL to publish this information annually. The institute has such information for 1992 &mdash; 1993 data are not yet available &mdash; and has incorporated it into a table which compares the levels of discharges since 1980.  I will arrange to forward this information to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In general, according to the institute, the levels of discharge of gaseous radioisotopes such as tritium and krypton have remained relatively stable over the period, certain isotopes such as caesium and iodine, peaked in the late seventies and early eighties but since 1982 have been reduced considerably.</P>

      <P>Circular No. 21/85 issued by my Department to the chief executive officer of each health board sets out in detail the provisions of the scheme and the procedures to be followed in relation to the referral of patients for treatment abroad.  Before an E112 from can issue medical evidence must be provided by a hospital consultant giving details of the condition from which the patient suffers and the type of treatment envisaged.  It must be certified by the consultant that: (a) the treatment concerned is not available in this country; <Col N="444" /> (b) there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; (c) there is a reasonable medical prognosis; (d) the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment; (e) the treatment abroad is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.

Referrals in excess of this amount must be referred to my Department for approval.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received an application from Colvay joint national school, County Donegal, to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme; if this application is being considered in her Department; and the reasons the school has not as yet been selected in view of the disadvantages under which it is functioning.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question <Col N="449" /> has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socioeconomic indicators.  Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the view of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>Data under each of the above headings is collected from applicant schools and, having regard to available resources, schools are then selected for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I regret that it was not possible to include the school referred to by the Deputy on this occasion.</P>
