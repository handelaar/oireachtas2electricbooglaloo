      <P>Before commencing the business of the day I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Gay Mitchell. I call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter of public importance requiring urgent consideration: The personal involvement of the Minister for Justice in the movement of a Garda district headquarters from Oughterard to Salthill in Galway West, her constituency, by use of powers to direct the Garda Commissioner under section 6 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, as the Commissioner would not otherwise agree to so do; in addition, to consider reports that the Minister for Justice personally deals with applications for all prisoners from Galway who seek temporary release, early release, compassionate release or transfer to open prison while other prisoners are dealt with in a different manner and to seek the investigation of these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking the Adjournment of the House so that these allegations can be made in a substantive motion, enabling the Minister to reply as to whether they are accurate.  If they are accurate, they constitute a gross interference with the Garda Síochána and the prison system.  They are very serious, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

I am now proceeding to deal with the by-election writs, items Nos. 4 and 5 on the Order Paper, in accordance with the Order of the Dáil of Thursday, 12 May 1994.  I call on the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to move the writ in respect of the Mayo West constituency.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are in tatters.  They are moving in about six different directions, as was very clear at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis in Limerick last weekend when there were a couple of performances behind Deputy John Bruton's back.  The Government is building on the foundations laid over the past five or seven years and doing so very successfully.  I know it is very difficult for <Col N="1697" /> the Opposition because, until recently, all the Opposition ever had to do was listen to the claims made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Enda Kenny will listen to me it might be just as beneficial. In accordance with what his party Leader asked when we were discussing Dáil reform, I am not using a script.  I am using some notes, as I have done previously.  I would expect that the Opposition would do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Opposition, it is very difficult for them to oppose this Government.  All the Opposition ever had to do until recently was listen to claims made by a Government and then produce the facts.  The problem for the Opposition is that the claims and the facts are one and the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great country and this is a great Government as I keep telling Deputies opposite.  One of the arguments I have heard used by the Opposition, particularly by Fine Gael, in relation to these elections, is that the Government has too big a majority and that almost by default Fine Gael should get two Deputies elected to this House. I heard Fine Gael accuse us of a begging <Col N="1701" /> bowl approach but that is about the worst possible approach to an election: give us two seats because the others have too many.  The only reason anybody should vote for Fine Gael is if he or she believes it would do better than the Government.  I can fairly say &mdash; and any objective person would say &mdash; that the performance of Fine Gael in Opposition is so bad that you would not put them in charge of an under 14 football team.</P>

I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that I, as the Fine Gael Whip, will be presenting two new Fine Gael Deputies to you soon after 9 June.  The by-election in Mayo West was caused by the acceptance of a position in Brussels by an elected Deputy, the former Minister for Justice, Pádraig Flynn.  It is obvious from the Tánaiste's remarks that he is inviting former Commissioner Sutherland to state his view and that he may well be appointed to the Presidency of the Commission if he can be appointed as a Commissioner. That is a matter for the Taoiseach on which I am sure he will deliberate long and hard during the next few months.</P>

      <P>What happened in the past 15 months is the result of complacency: £6 million was spent on refurbishing Government offices, £3 million on public relations to massage the message being sent by Government.

      <P>Obviously the lines of communication are open in some quarters. Ministers and Ministers of State have been making off the wall statements <Col N="1703" /> on promises for a number of years. Fianna Fáil failed to deliver a general hospital and a regional technical college in the constituency.  It has also failed dismally to win the war on potholes begun by the then Deputy Flynn who received a three minutes standing ovation at an Ard-Fheis when he said they would be eliminated.  However, the potholes have increased and multiplied all over the country.</P>
      <P>The regulations of this House are being abused.  The Chair, quite rightly turned down my question on the upgrading of several roads in County Mayo, he said it was a matter for the National Roads Authority and for which the Minister for the Environment had no responsibility to the Dáil.  Yet in <i>The Western People</i> of 27 April 1994 it was reported that the Minister for the Environment upgraded the Ballina and Westport roads.  It was stated that the Minister, Deputy Smith, told the action group in Ballina last Thursday that the news was positive, he had agreed to upgrade the roads to boost the economy of the area, he had submitted his plans to the European Union and was confident of a positive decision within weeks.

      <Col N="1706" /> On a number of doorsteps the Government has been likened to &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo;, with its Government jet, accommodation in fabulous hotels, PR consultants, the mohair suits, employment of members of their families in jobs or accompanying them.  Everybody sees the reality.  The Government has lost its sense of public service.  It thinks that with its 35 seat majority it can do what it wants but the people think differently.  Members are elected to do a job and the Government is not doing the job for which it was elected.  The Labour Party, in particular, promised to bring about change and was given a mandate for it but it went into Government with a party whom, in Opposition, it criticised week in, week out and caused the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.  The people voted for change but the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs did not give them change.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to send a message to it.  It will certainly not change the Government, which has a majority of 35 seats but I think a clear message can be sent to it by the voters of those constituencies. It is a pity that in Mayo-West voters have had to wait for 18 months to replace a former Deputy and that in Dublin South Central they have had to wait for 17 months.  It is time to review the way we fill by-elections because a Government with a majority can refuse to move the writs, oppose their moving and in one sense retain an almost false majority.  I am certain there is a better way of automatically filling vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier the Minister of State made reference to the performance of the Government. There is a number of issues on which the Government needs to be taken up on and given an answer by voters in these constituencies.  In its first budget the Government announced a tax amnesty which yielded £250 million from tax dodgers who were not even required to bring their money back to this country.  The Government also announced the introduction of a 1 per cent income levy &mdash; another tax on work &mdash; which was removed in its second budget.  This year the Government announced the extension of the famous residential property tax.  The Taoiseach would not answer questions in the Dáil on comments he had made on this issue.  The questions that I and <Col N="1708" /> others tabled to him were transferred to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Many of us find it impossible to ask questions of the Taoiseach, the leader of the Government.  Frequently questions are transferred to other Ministers who do not have responsibility for the Taoiseach's remarks.  I find it very difficult to understand how a Government which was given a mandate for change, particularly the smaller partner, can constantly refuse to be held accountable for its actions in this House.  While I welcome the fact that £10 million is to be spent in improving facilities in the Oireachtas, it is more important that we change the procedures in this House which are out of date and do not allow the Government to be held accountable.  As you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, questions are either ruled out of order if a matter has been referred to in the preceding few months or transferred to other Ministers. This is not good enough from any Government but particularly from a Government which has a majority of 35 seats.</P>
    <P>During the past 15 months the Government has signed contracts with communications consultants to the tune of £2.5 million.  I note that the Government is to spend approximately £6.2 million on ministerial offices.  In advance of the spending of Structural Funds, many companies are concerned about the manner in which Government contracts are awarded.  There is no transparency, fairness or equity.  We need to change the tendering procedures.  Many people have asked me how a company which owes this country £11 million can be given a C2 certificate and can compete with others and get away with only paying 20p in the pound.  This is not fair and is causing much concern among companies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach rightly criticised bank interest rates, but the answer is not for the State to become involved in banking. A State fertiliser company owes £180 million, a State telecommunications company owes £1 million, while the State owes £28 billion.  The State should not become involved in banking.  We have a competition authority and its powers to <Col N="1709" /> deal with unfair practices should be enforced.  The Central Bank has to approve all bank charges and interest rates and those powers should be used fully.  I do not support the idea that the State should become a third banking force.  Lame-duck companies and those with political clout would be given loans that the taxpayer would have to pay back at the end of the day.  There are 39 licensed banks and the two main banks dominate the market.  However neither dominates more than 25 per cent of any segment of the market.  What we need is consolidation and greater competition in the banking sector.  The Government should encourage this and ensure that the powers that exist are fully enforced.</P>
    <P>We had the Structural Funds debacle when there was a failure to tell the truth in this House about the sum of money involved.  The Government was established on the basis that the famous £8 billion was in the bag.  The President of the Commission was drawn into the debacle and we sought to use his influence to get us a good deal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's remarks in relation to Peter Sutherland.  The Taoiseach misled the House on two occasions recently when he said that Mr. Sutherland had told him he was not interested in the job.  I do not believe the Taoiseach discussed the matter with him.  I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste intervened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Tánaiste who was given a mandate for change, and for whom many people have enormous <Col N="1710" /> respect, that if there is a chance that Peter Sutherland can become President of the Commission he and the Government must use all their power to bring this about.  I hope they will have an early meeting with Mr. Sutherland to establish how this can be made possible.  I am aware that the present Commissioner is a close friend of the Taoiseach and people do not abandon their friends lightly, but in the national and European interest this country should be prepared to put aside personal friendships and move to support the candidacy of Mr. Sutherland.  From informed sources in Brussels I believe he has a great opportunity, if his name is put forward, of being selected.</P>

      <P>The main issues in these by-elections will be tax and unemployment. There are high levels of tax on work and business.  Enterprise groups, task forces and development agencies have been set up; we are paralysed by bureaucracy as most business people are aware.</P>
      <P>Another issue in the by-elections will be the spiralling level of crime.  I put it to the Minister for Justice that morale in the Garda Síochána is at an all time low.  I do not want to make the matter more difficult but it is important that the force has confidence in itself and is not dispirited if it is to deal with the crime wave. It is also important that the public has confidence in the force.  Will the Minister accept the recommendation of the Commissioner that a mediator be appointed to deal with the difficulties in the Garda Representative Association?  If she fails to do this there will be a split on 25 May which will lead to many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first question to the Minister for Justice today Deputy Callely asks the Minister if she will consider birching and <Col N="1711" /> flogging &mdash; this from a Deputy who opposed a battered wives home in his constituency.  I find it hard to accept that a Deputy who could do this could table questions and encourage this kind of behaviour.  That is not the answer we need.  We need modern legislation which would be enforced on a fair and equitable basis.  People should serve their sentences and should not be let out through the open door policy which now exists because of a lack of space and the failure to introduce modern criminal law.</P>
    <P>I hope that voters in the two constituencies will vote to strengthen Opposition in this House.  This is very important if we are to protect our parliamentary democracy.  My party will be fielding a woman candidate, Caít Keane, in Dublin South-Central.  People might say that the Progressive Democrats pick many women candidates.  I would like to think the reason we have so many women is that we pick people on their merits.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has at last been forced to move the writs for the two by-elections in Dublin South-Central and Mayo West.  I wonder to what extent the move today is motivated by the fact that in Mr. Eugene Dudley's case in the High Court today a judgement is to be given on whether the Government is obliged to hold these by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both seats have been vacant for almost 18 months and the failure of the Government to hold the by-elections is a scandal <Col N="1712" /> which strikes at the heart of the democratic system.  These are the longest unfilled vacancies since the Second World War and this is the only time in recent decades that the Government parties voted down motions to have the writs moved on two occasions, in April last year and February of this year when the Democratic Left moved the motions. When a Government with the biggest majority in the history of the State starts to show such a cavalier disregard for the need to hold by-elections and such contempt for the rights of the people in the constituencies concerned it is understandable that the alarm bells should ring.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory that vacancies can be left unfilled and constituencies under-represented for so long.  This approach is in stark contrast to the approach adopted in the United Kingdom where by-elections are usually held within a matter of weeks and almost always within three months.  Under existing legislation there is nothing to stop an Irish Government with sufficient voting power in the Dáil defeating attempts to move writs time after time, leaving seats unfilled until a subsequent general election.</P>
    <P>This is a flaw in our electoral legislation which needs to be dealt with.  Democratic Left has tabled a Private Members' Bill under which the Ceann Comhairle would be required to automatically direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue a writ for a by-election 90 days after a vacancy occurred, unless the Dáil had passed a motion that the writ be issued at an earlier date.  Is there a logical reason that Bill or a similar measure should not be enacted to prevent a Government in the future from abusing its majority, as has happened in Dublin South-Central and Mayo West?</P>
    <P>The principle of equality of representation is clearly enshrined in the Constitution.  Leaving vacancies unfilled for almost 18 months &mdash; more than one-third of the life span of a normal Dáil &mdash; flies in the face of that principle.  A logical explanation or defence has not been offered by the Government for its determination to block those by-elections.  The only reasonable conclusion that can be <Col N="1713" /> drawn is that the by-elections could be politically embarrassing for the Government and that it attached greater priority to avoiding political embarrassment for itself than to representing the democratic rights of the people of the two constituencies. Time has run out.  Even this Government can no longer hide and must face the verdict of the people on 9 June. It will face an angry people.  People in the two constituencies are angry not alone at the contempt that has been shown for their democratic rights for almost 18 months, but also at the failure of the two parties in Government to deliver on the lavish promises it made when first elected.</P>
    <P>I predict the Government will take an electoral hammering in the by-elections. In Dublin South-Central we are fighting to retake the seat Eric Byrne lost in the marathon count in November 1992.  I am confident we will do so not alone because of the enormous work Eric Byrne did in that constituency as a TD and councillor, but also because the people recognise that he is the only Opposition candidate who can defeat the Government in that constituency.</P>
    <P>Those who hoped that this Government would deliver on real political change have been bitterly disappointed. The impact of the Labour Party, in particular, has been minimal.  Can anyone point to a policy, particularly in the economic area, where this Government differs significantly from its Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat predecessor?  The Minister of State has told us that this Government is continuing the economic policies of the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat administration. Nowhere has the performance of the Government been more disappointing than in regard to unemployment.  While there has been a small reduction in the numbers on the live register, that is due more to renewed emigration than to policy initiatives by this Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may trot out the figures, but he <Col N="1714" /> should talk to the people in my constituency and in Dublin South-Central who do not have a hope of getting a job. The most they can hope for is a place on a community employment programme and even in that case they must be at least 12 months unemployed and on the live register.  Thousands of women in my constituency do not qualify because they have been denied the right to sign on the live register.  Those are unemployed people who need jobs.</P>
      <P>Despite the supposed commitment of the Labour Party to the public sector, the pattern of privatisation started by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrative Government has continued.  The fiasco of the Greencore-Davy affair has been followed by the apparent determination to privatise the Trustee Savings Bank, despite the fact that this will effectively sound the death knell for the development of a third banking force promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>This Government has also continued to pile on the tax agony.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, put the political gun to the head of the new Dublin county councils and forced them to introduce service charges.  Dublin Corporation will almost certainly receive similar treatment next year.  In addition to the new service charges, thousands of families living in modest dwellings will, for the first time, find themselves in the residential property tax net as a result of the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to deny tens of thousands of women arrears of social welfare transitional payments to which the European Court said they are entitled.  I am not surprised the Government continues to deny those women their entitlements, there are various political reasons for that.  However, it is regrettable that the Dublin media cannot find an inch of space in the <i>Irish Press, the Irish Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Times</i> to report on the debate on this issue which took place in this House yesterday and which effects more than 75,000 married women.  It is a disgrace that the Dublin media should ignore such an <Col N="1715" /> important issue regardless of its editorial view on the matter.</P>
    <P>The failure of the farming sector to make a reasonable contribution to the Exchequer is a political scandal which, it appears, not any Government has the courage to tackle.  Between 1989 and 1992 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £3,122 to £3,662. This represents an increase of 17 per cent, more than twice the rate at which wages and salaries increased in the same period. In the same few years the average tax paid by farmers decreased by 9.3 per cent.  Farmers now pay less than one-fifth of the average tax bill of a PAYE worker. Despite this, the Taoiseach apparently believes that farmers are overtaxed.  At a recent Fianna Fáil agricultural conference in Kilkenny he stated that the &ldquo;future should bring an easing of tax burden, which could only be of benefit to the farming community&rdquo;.  Did he mean that it will be of benefit only to the farming community because that seems to be the trend?</P>

      <P>In the forthcoming by-elections and European elections the people will have an ideal opportunity to deliver an electoral cold shower to Fianna Fáil and Labour, to demand change and insist that the Government starts delivering on its promises.  The Minister trotted out many statistics this morning about how glorious the Irish economy is, but he should tell that to those who do not have a home or a job and to those who watch the Government spending up to £3 <Col N="1716" /> million on promoting itself, despite the Minister claiming this morning that the Government is too modest to tell us what it is doing.</P>

      <P>A number of statements were made by the Opposition about the Government being afraid to move the writs for the by-elections.  In tandem with those allegations the Government has been accused of spending money all over the place.  When the first attempt was made here to move the writs the Government stated they would be moved at the appropriate time.  What times would have been more appropriate to move those writs than in tandem with other elections which we knew would have to take place?  We are accommodating the public and the political system.  It is not a case of being afraid to put our policies before the people.  It would have been a greater scandal if, knowing that an election was going to take place, the Government spent money holding by-elections prior to the holding of the European elections.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa talked about service charges and the residential property tax, but he omitted to mention the 2 per cent wealth tax his party proposed for all of us on top of the already heavy burden of taxation which this Government has tackled in the last number of budgets. Deputy Harney talked about bureaucracy for small firms and the amount of paper work involved.  I agree that the less bureaucracy small firms face the better. In that regard a total of 21 separate measures were introduced in the budget to facilitate small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has nothing to fear in facing the electorate.  We have improved and are continuing to improve prospects. Our policies are geared towards facilitating and helping those who do not have jobs and need housing.  The figures and facts exist no matter how much members of the Democratic Left or others try to deny them.  The key factor <Col N="1717" /> underlying the improved prospects has been the Government's prudent management of the economy during the recent recession.  Ireland is the only EU country to have maintained significant economic growth.  Despite Britain experiencing the deepest recession since the war and the problems in the European Union, we succeeded in maintaining previous employment gains. Unlike employment gains in the 1970s, the ESRI made the positive point that the objective of sustaining those made in the 1990s should be achievable.  Those gains have been made within the Maastricht guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Government parties are looking forward to continuing the campaign. Unlike some members of the Opposition who do not appear to have been out on the hustings, we have been there and we are getting a warm and friendly reception, not a hot one.  We look forward to the elections on 9 June.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Rabbitte on Tuesday, 17 May 1994:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, noting the out of court settlement by the Department of Social Welfare of a case taken by FLAC on behalf of 1,800 married women claiming arrears of social welfare payments as required under EU equality directives,</P>
    <P>&mdash; calls on the Government to make full payment to all other married women who were similarly discriminated against,</P>
    <P>&mdash; deplores the refusal of the Department of Social Welfare to inform women of their rights, thus forcing many to take legal action, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; calls on the Minister to make a full disclosure on all such cases settled and claims pending.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, noting:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the introduction of restrospective legislation in June, 1992, which made good the default arising from the delay in 1984 in implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the extensive efforts of the Department of Social Welfare in identifying all potential beneficiaries and issuing personalised claim forms to all of those involved and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the payment of all entitlements under the retrospective legislation six months in advance of the statutory deadline,</P>
    <P>recognises that claims made for payments in addition to or over and above <Col N="1748" /> those provided for in legislation would involve double payments to the same households in many cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Social Welfare.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Fine Gael spokesman on Social Welfare for pursuing this matter and Democratic Left for tabling the motion.  It is important that we discuss the issue.  This and previous Governments have always had something better to spend their money on than equality or developing equal rights for women.  This case is the latest in a long series where Governments have been forced, usually protesting, to develop and put in place rights for women.</P>
      <P>Individual women and women's groups very often fought long and hard in European Courts for their rights.  The list is long and the women fighting this case illustrate yet again how women must band together and go to court in order to take their rightful place in this democracy. We do, indeed, have half a democracy. Is it acceptable that this case should drag on for eight years and that an organisation, FLAC, which itself receives money from the Government has had to continue to fight in the courts and outside over a period of years to gain these rights?  Why do we have this minimising, delaying, begrudging approach to equality?</P>
      <P>The following rights were only recognised after women fought long and hard for them in the courts: the equal right of mothers to custody of their children; the right of women to work; the right of women to sit on juries; the right of women to contraception; the right of married women to be taxed separately and the right to free legal aid in family law cases.</P>
      <P>In many cases the rights of women have been recognised only when it became necessary to do so in order to comply with obligations under EU Treaties.</P>

Who imposed those terms of confidentiality on the women?  What is the legal standing of that request or demand for confidentiality and what are the reasons for it?

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for transparency in Government.  I pay tribute to FLAC for its work and the constant attention it has given to this case.  As well as to other cases and individuals.  I remember many years ago going into a cold empty office in north Dublin where I was doing some voluntary work with FLAC.  I have never forgotten the spirit of social justice with which they worked then and which they still seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FLAC has consistently argued, and I agree, that women entitled to arrears of <Col N="1750" /> welfare payments should be paid their full entitlements without being forced to institute lengthy and costly legal proceedings against the Department.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister said that the payments sought would result in double payments and, therefore that it would be unacceptable that they be paid.  He said that payments over and above those provided for in the 1993 repayment scheme would result in double payments to households in many cases.  However, at the time, adult dependency allowances and child dependency allowances were paid to married men, not to households. These were made automatically and without any reference to the circumstances of the wives concerned.  Under the repayment scheme, a married woman was deemed not entitled to arrears of adult allowances where her husband had claimed a welfare payment between 1984 and 1986 or where he had been working and earning more than £56 per week.  In this latter case, it is not true to say that the adult payment has already been paid to the household.  Rather a woman is disqualified by reason of a means test which was not applied to a man in the same situation prior to 1986.  The Minister ignored this totally in his speech.</P>
    <P>As for the child dependency allowances, again these were paid to the husband and not to the family.  In the first case of McDermott &amp; Cotter, the European Court of Justice stated quite clearly that in the absence of measures implementing Article 4 (1) of the Directive, women are entitled to have the same rules applied to them as are applied to men who are in the same situation, since, where the Directive has not been implemented, those rules remain the only valid point of reference.  In the second reference of this case to the European Court, they ruled that &ldquo;... if after 23 December 1984 a married man automatically received increases in benefits in respect of persons deemed to be dependents without having to prove that those persons were actually dependent upon him, a married woman in the same circumstances was also entitled to those increases, and no <Col N="1751" /> additional conditions applicable only to married women could be imposed&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The court went on to state:</P>
      <P>According to the Irish Government, to grant such a right to married women could, in certain circumstances, result in double payment of the same increase to the same families, in particular where both spouses received social security benefits during the period at issue.  Such payments would be manifestly absurd and would infringe the prohibition on unjust enrichment laid down by national law.</P>
      <P>To permit reliance on that prohibition would enable the national authorities to use their own unlawful conduct as a ground for depriving Article 4 (1) of the directive of its full effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply to the first question must therefore be that Article 4 (1) of the directive must be interpreted as meaning that if, after the expiry period allowed for implementation of the directive, married men have automatically received increases in social <Col N="1752" /> security benefits in respect of a spouse and children deemed to be dependants without having to prove actual dependency, married women without actual dependants are entitled to those increases even if in some circumstances that will result in double payment of the increases.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this statement that the 1992 regulations do not, therefore, entitle married women to the payments which they would otherwise have received if the Directive had been implemented on time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the issue of transitional payments.  While it is true that these were designed to compensate for a loss of income suffered as a result of equality being introduced, his conclusion that this excludes women from arrears of these payments is incorrect.  Only married men could show that they had suffered a loss of income in 1986 as they had previously benefited from the automatic dependency allowances which ended in May 1986.  As married women did not get these allowances automatically they, therefore, did not lose out in 1986.  Thus, if they had been treated equally with men they would have suffered the same losses in 1986 and thereby qualified for transitional payments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, these payments are totally ignored by the 1993 regulations and, therefore, the only law on them remains the decision in the Cotter and McDermott II case on which the European Court of Justice stated:</P>
    <P>. . . where a member state has included in the legislation intended to implement (the Directive), adopted after the expiry of the period allowed by the directive, a transitional provision providing for compensatory payments for married men who have lost their entitlement to an increase in their social security benefits in respect of a spouse deemed to be dependent because actual dependency cannot be shown to exist, married women in the same family circumstances are entitled to the same payments even if this <Col N="1753" /> infringes the prohibition on unjust enrichment laid down by national law.</P>
    <P>Again these payments were not made to households but to the men directly.  In the case of women who were claiming and whose husbands were working at the time no such payment was made to the &ldquo;household&rdquo; at all.  Yet a married man whose wife was working and earning more than £55 per week received a transitional payment of £10 per week.  Unfortunately, it appears that because of the stance of the Minister and the Government women welfare claimants who are claiming arrears of these payments will have to continue to rely on the courts to vindicate their rights under EU law.</P>

In addition, the first legal proceedings that arose from the delay in implementing the provisions of the necessary legislation were taken as early as 1985.  Those and subsequent court proceedings gave rise to complex legal issues.  On three occasions the Irish courts referred to the European Court of Justice for preliminary rulings.  In the light of the legal clarifications provided by the European Court, the Government introduced retrospective legislation in 1992 which provided for equal treatment in respect of the period of delay.

      <P>Subject to certain provisions, designed to avoid double payments, the legislation entitled married women to payments they would have received if the directive had been implemented on time, but the Deputy's party failed to do so.  The legislation retrospectively implemented the provisions of that directive.  The Department of Social Welfare made extensive efforts to identify all potential beneficiaries under the retrospective legislation and issued claim forms to the women concerned. All claims have been processed and in excess of 70,000 women with an entitlement under the retrospective legislation were paid in full by the end of 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, if a couple were in receipt of a social welfare payment in the delay period it would involve paying each of them an increase for their spouse, as an adult dependant, in addition to their personal rate of payment and paying each of the couple the full rate of increases for children.  This would involve paying him for her, as a dependant and, at the same time, paying her for him, as her dependant, and paying them both for the children.  Effectively this would mean paying the same family twice, two personal rates, two adult dependant payments and double rates for the children.  It would also mean compensating people with transitional payments for a loss they did not incur.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Fine Gael to come clean and Democratic Left, who make much of the need for high standards in politics, should stop its campaign of deception and dishonesty.

It was implemented at various stages in 1986 when men who would otherwise have lost social welfare payments were granted ameliorating payments. <Col N="1763" /> A number of court cases were taken successfully by women to establish their entitlement to the proper date of implementation, December 1984 and to establish entitlement to so-called compensatory payments.  As a result of the European Court decision various payments are due.  The question a woman must establish is, if she were male, what payments she would have received because she is now entitled to them.</P>
      <P>Married women who were in receipt of unemployment, disability and injury benefits and invalidity pension between December 1984 &mdash; the date the directive should have been implemented &mdash; and 15 May 1986 received a weekly rate less than that payable to their male counterparts. They also received unemployment benefit for a shorter period, the amount owing there was paid in 1992, which is not in question.  Married women who were eligible for unemployment assistance only in very limited circumstances from December 1984 to November 1986 should have been eligible on the same basis as men.  Payments due under this heading were made in 1993.  Various problems arise.</P>
      <P>Married women who received any social welfare payment between December 1984 and November 1986 &mdash; there are various dates in December for the different types of benefit &mdash; did not receive an adult dependant allowance in respect of their husbands unless the husband was incapacitated.  A man always received an allowance for his wife if she was living with him or was maintained by him.  Those women who were living with their husbands at that time are now entitled to claim an adult dependant allowance in respect of their husbands. The same women are entitled to claim a child dependant allowance in respect of their dependent children.  Payments were made in 1993 but the women involved were not treated in the same way as men and the new provisions may well be found to be in further breach of the directive.</P>

      <P>Compensatory payments were made to certain married men who had been receiving adult dependant allowances in respect of their wives at the date on which the new rules on adult dependency came into effect, i.e. November 1986.  The amount of these payments varied depending on the circumstances. Men who ceased to get an adult dependant allowance because their wives were getting a social welfare payment received £20 initially.  Those men who lost the adult dependant allowance because their wives earned over £50 per week, got £10 per week and the full amount of the child dependant allowance.</P>
      <P>Women who were receiving social welfare payments on the relevant dates are now also entitled to those payments. There are no proposals to actually pay these amounts to the women concerned although there is little doubt that they are entitled to receive them.  The compensatory payments were paid until July 1992.</P>

      <P>The manner of implementation of Statutory Instrument No. 152 outlines the way in which the retrospective payments were to be made. There is no problem with this directive but there are problems with some of the other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic position which has been adopted on Statutory Instrument No. 152 is that the current position regarding entitlement to adult dependant allowances and child dependant allowances and the split of unemployment assistance between spouses and cohabitees is applied retrospectively to the period from December 1984 to November 1986. Men and women may be entitled to a household supplement for this period on the same basis.  Men were effectively treated differently and even though, theoretically, the adult dependant and <Col N="1765" /> child dependant allowances which they were overpaid could now be taken from them, the legislation allows the Minister not to recoup this money.  The theoretical legal position as applied retrospectively treats men and women equally, the actual position is quite different.</P>
    <P>Some examples of how women's retrospective payments were calculated show the actual position.  Married women who were unemployed between December 1984 and November 1986 could have applied for unemployment assistance for the period in question.  In order to qualify they had to show that they met all the requirements i.e. they were unemployed, available for and actively seeking work and so on.  They also had to pass a means test.  They did not receive unemployment assistance on the same basis as married men at that time &mdash; their wives' income was assessed in the means test and they qualified for adult and child dependant allowances.  Instead, the women got unemployment assistance on the same basis as it is now awarded to married and cohabiting couples.</P>
    <P>Married men received adult dependant allowances in respect of their wives regardless of the income of their wives. Married women were not treated in that way in respect of the period in question. Instead the married women concerned could get a household supplement.  It is based on the rules now in force rather than on the rules that applied in the relevant period.  They could get the household supplement if the husband had an income of less than £50 per week or if he did not have a social welfare payment in his own right.  I will give some examples.</P>
    <P>A man getting unemployment benefit in 1985, whose wife was employed and earning more than £50 per week, got a personal rate of unemployment benefit, plus adult dependant allowance, plus child dependant allowance.  Theoretically his entitlement to adult dependant allowance and child dependant allowance is now withdrawn but it is highly unlikely that the money will be recouped.  A woman getting unemployment benefit at the same time, whose husband was earning more than £50 per week, received <Col N="1766" /> only unemployment benefit.  The retrospective legislation does not entitle her to adult dependant allowance but it does entitle her to half the child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>A man getting unemployment benefit in 1985, and whose wife was also getting unemployment benefit, also got a personal rate of unemployment benefit, plus adult dependant allowance, plus full child dependant allowance.  She got a personal rate only.  The retrospective legislation disentitles him to adult dependant allowance. She does not get adult dependant allowance but is entitled to half the child dependant allowance.  However, the husband has already got full child dependant allowance so the payment is regarded as a payment on account to the wife.  She got no retrospective payment in respect of that.</P>
    <P>A man getting unemployment assistance in 1985, whose wife was unemployed but not eligible for unemployment assistance, got a personal rate of unemployment assistance, plus adult dependant allowance, plus child dependant allowance.  Even if the wife established entitlement to unemployment assistance she did not get any money because of the rule&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no easy answer to the problems.  Everybody recognises that the law as it pertained originally was inequitable and nobody argues about that.  The second principle we all appear to accept is that prior to the 1984 directive the law was inequitable. Nobody is saying we should go back to the introduction of social welfare to pay retrospection to make up the losses. Everyone accepts that while it was wrong we cannot go back to the position as it applied then.  It would have been much more simple if in 1986 legislation had been introduced to deal with this matter <Col N="1768" /> because the question of retrospection would not have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that did not happen.  In the interest of families alleviation payments were introduced.  I do not criticise the Coalition Government of the day for introducing alleviation payments because the theory behind them was to soften the landing from one set of circumstances to another, where household income would decrease dramatically, affecting the whole family. That was a reasonable step to take at the time.</P>
      <P>The question which now arises has two implications.  The first concerns cost, where the money would come from and what else could be done with that amount of money.  To put the cost of this provision in context, it is equivalent to the 1 per cent income levy, or if we introduce the £9,000 exception, it would be considerably higher, equivalent to a 4 per cent increase in the standard rate of tax or a 9 per cent increase in the top rate of tax, the option I favour.  No one is suggesting surely that it should come out of the social welfare budget because every penny is badly needed to keep the system going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of equity will arise if we decide on the double payments option. Because of the delays in introducing the legislation some families will receive double payments, that is double the child dependant allowance and a dependent allowance; a man would get paid for his wife as a dependent spouse and she would get paid for him as a dependent spouse. Families where both spouses were in receipt of social welfare during that period would be far better off than where only one spouse was on social welfare. That would create further inequities.  If we take that option I envisage queues of people asking me in what kind of a State do families with both spouses on social welfare receive double payments?  This problem has not been highlighted because it is not the flavour of the month but we as politicians have to take the <Col N="1769" /> problem more seriously.  The reality is that a mess was made in introducing equality of treatment.</P>

      <P>In 1992 a Fianna Fáil Minister set about putting the matter right and paid out a great deal of money in retrospective payments.  There is no easy answer but the Opposition sees only one side of the argument.  The question is whether to pay double payments to some people because of a quirk in the law.  Would it be more equitable to use that money to help widows, dependent spouses or others?  It is a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that we have not had an open debate on where equity lies in the situation and where the amount of money would best be spent to help the most needy in society.  I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; if there was ever a reforming Minister in his Department it is Deputy Woods.  He has introduced a range of schemes.

      <P>In supporting this motion I suggest a slogan that sums up the Government's performance on this and related issues is &ldquo;never mind the equality, see the title&rdquo;, the title being the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  This Government seems to be convinced that a Department dedicated to equality is all that is needed and that action does not matter.  It thinks what matters is the mission statement, the Programme for Partnership Governments which states that we are committed to equality.  This Government is not committed to equality and that is proved by the lack of action. That is why we are having this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Europe has dragged this and previous Governments into the 20th century.  It is relevant in the run up to the European elections that we are discussing how equality legislation is dependent on the European Union.  It is amost ten years ago since the equal treatment legislation was implemented.  It was implemented because we had to comply, not because the gentleman Members of Dáil Éireann thought we should.  Until that time men were paid social welfare at a higher rate and for a longer period and women could not claim for dependent husbands. Everything was supposed to change.  The intent changed but the actions did not. Women were entitled to the payment but they did not get it, a variation of live horse and you will get grass.  This Government is supposed to be committed to equality and it does not make sense that it should push women to the limit, to the extent that FLAC, the free legal advice centres, had to take a case against the Government.  At first glance that is very difficult to understand but it fits into the pattern of postponement and contempt for real people, particularly women, which is characteristic of this Government.  This Government is an administration of systems, structures, score sheets and wall charts.  It might be news to some Members but I have heard that the brightest of the programme managers <Col N="1771" /> has a chart on his office wall of the Programme for a Partnership Government so that anybody visiting the office cannot miss the things that have been ticked off.  No doubt when the refurbishment of Government offices is completed he will have an electronic wall chart.  It is a general view that if the matter is not included in the Programme for a Partnership Government it does not exist.</P>

    <P>I have in front of me a press release issued by the Department of Social Welfare on 12 April.  The Department was so happy one would have thought it had won a prize.  It confirmed that a settlement had been reached despite the fact that 1,800 women had been driven to sue their own Government in order to get their rights, that the Minister of State had indicated <Col N="1775" /> to the House a few months before that everything was proceeding in an orderly fashion and that these women would not have to resort to legal action.</P>

I am afraid the Minister has no discretion; we have moved beyond that point.  The time for waffle has passed.  The issue has been clarified and all that remains is for us to make the payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to make these payments as the issue is not going to go away.  The European Court of Justice ruled that these women are entitled to the payments in question.  This judgment was backed up by the Irish courts.  Last <Col N="1776" /> April the Minister reached a settlement in respect of 1,800 women on the steps of the courthouse in advance of a hearing as he knew that if the hearing proceeded the case would be lost.  In doing so, he conceded that the outstanding payments are now due.</P>

      <P>It is deplorable that the Minister has failed, and continues to fail, to discharge his liabilities in respect of the most vulnerable section of society, namely, women claimants in the social welfare system.  The majority of those claimants are mothers of large families with many mouths to feed.  I have day to day contact with many of those women in my constituency and I can assure the House that the money would be put to good use in supplementing small family budgets.  If that money were owing to a more organised pressure group in our society, such as the farmers, it would have been paid out long ago.</P>
      <P>It is pointless delaying the matter any longer.  There is no legal, moral or administrative justification for further delay. The Minister should square up to his responsibilities and make those payments this year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I am one of the few who has been a Member throughout the period concerned and, therefore, can speak with direct knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Government in this sorry débâcle has been less than honourable. It has blatantly attempted, by legal and other means, to avoid a clear obligation to pay those women their entitlements, an obligation which it conceded indirectly in the courts.  I share the annoyance of others in regard to Deputy Ó Cuív's concern about where the money will be found to pay these women.  I also share the view of Members from this side who stated that money can be found for other types of payment.  If, say, headage payments were involved, money would be found.  Media reports in the past 24 <Col N="1779" /> hours indicated that beef premia would be worth twice as much to farmers this year because they were previously set at a figure which anticipated much lower livestock prices.  However, those payments will not be cut back.  If money needs to be found in that area, it will be found.  The Government should concede in principle on this issue and then decide how to pay.  It will involve a large sum of money, but it can be paid on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>I agree with much that Deputy Callely said.  The matter was not dealt with in 1984, 1985 or 1986 because of the huge costs involved.  At that time it included a negative cost, a huge political cost. Equalising up the payments would have led to a permanent position of double payments; therefore, equalising down was the only option.  It would have been difficult for any Government to tell people that £20 or £40 would have to be deducted from their weekly payments. The matter was put off because it had negative as well as positive consequences. It was a matter of bringing equality into a paternalistic social welfare system and that was difficult to do. Eventually this was done, but an entitlement had built up because of the delay and we all accept that.</P>
    <P>At the time of implementation we correctly decided on alleviation payments. In the last two budgets the Minister introduced taxation on social welfare benefits and as a result people lost up to £15 per week in take home pay.  One can imagine how difficult it would have been to ask people to suffer a loss of £40 or more per week, depending on the size of their families.  While the alleviation payments were all well motivated we did not anticipate the consequences of maintaining an element of discriminatory treatment in the system.  When first introduced the alleviating payments were paid to male recipients and that continued to be the case.  It is only in the last year or two it received the new title of &ldquo;household subsidy&rdquo; because that suits the argument the Government is using to avoid its responsibility.  For the first five or six <Col N="1780" /> years an alleviating payment was paid directly to males and, unwittingly, another discriminatory element was introduced. That must be faced up to now. While it may suit the Government to say that this matter arose as a result of policies adopted between 1984 and 1986, many of the obligations to which we are referring relate to the period between 1987 and 1993.  During the period 1984 to 1986 the Opposition continually called for assistance for those families who were losing money and even with the introduction of the alleviating payments the public were very critical of the consequences. Perhaps in hindsight it should have been called a household payment and these obligations might have been avoided, but that was not the case and the obligations must be honoured.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat to blame for a lack of diligence in pursing this issue.  I took at face value many of the communications I received from the Department of Social Welfare in this regard.  When I made representations to the Department on behalf of individuals I received replies stating that X or Y had received their full entitlements under the law.  When I made inquiries about the second round I was told it was no longer an alleviating payment but a household subsidy.  The ground shifted, and it was only as a consequence of the successful court case that I became aware of the attempts of the Departments of Social Welfare to manipulate information on this matter. While many women have accepted their payments as total compensation, they were based on an assessment of their entitlements by the Department of Social Welfare which I am sure would differ greatly from an entitlement tested in court.  Many women received much less than they are entitled to and the Government fails to acknowledge any further obligation in the matter.</P>
    <P>Eight hundred women in Cork brought their cases to a successful conclusion which finally convinced me that the nature of the communications from the Department was deliberately obfuscating and prevaricating and that has been the case throughout this debate.  The <Col N="1781" /> Government has continued deliberately to mislead people.  Many women believe they have received all they are entitled to, but that is not the case.  Some of them may not even have got their full entitlements for the period between 1984 and 1986.  A case in respect of another large group of women is pending and the only advice we as public representatives can offer those women is to seek legal advice.  That is the only way they can be guaranteed their just entitlements.</P>
    <P>This matter did not arise as a result of what happened between 1984 and 1986, but because of the attitude of this Government and the failure of the Minister to accept his responsibilities.  I acknowledge that the Minister has introduced many reforms in the social welfare system, but in this case he is coming out less than glorious.  By using every trick in the book, the Government has fought every step of the way the legitimate cases of these women for their just entitlements. Women have contacted me about this and attended meetings organised by Democratic Left in my constituency. That money will not be pin money, but an additional income to supplement a family budget which in many cases is partly made up of income women earn from cleaning jobs, relatively low skill jobs, working long hours in a clothing factory or part-time work in shops. Money paid to this group of women who have family responsibilities will be used to good effect in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute and to put on record my acceptance that these obligations occurred unwittingly, but they did and must be honoured.  We accept our share of the responsibility.  It was a difficult issue.  The attempt to soften the blow of the consequences of the equality directive which was applied to a different system with a different philosophy led to those difficulties.  The Government cannot avoid its responsibility to deal with the problem which continued during the period 1987 to 1993 and it should face up to it.  We should accept the obligation and discuss with the women and their <Col N="1782" /> representatives how it can be met, phased in or otherwise dealt with over a period of time.</P>

      <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government is firmly committed to eliminating inequality for all groups in society who have suffered disability, disadvantage or discrimination.  Yet, thousands of women have been seriously disadvantaged and discriminated against, but there is no commitment to do anything about it. Official Government obstacles have been put in their way, including a despicable attempts to use the courts against them. Is that justice?  How does the commitment to equality stand now?  We have a Minister for Equality, but what good is he to those thousands of women?  Does he feel uncomfortable sitting around the Cabinet table with a colleague who consistently obstructs the equal treatment of women?  If he wishes to live up to his name, he should actively defend the rights of those women.</P>

      <P>It is called a diplomatic absence.  In case the Minister happens to be found in the building and to avoid having to answer awkward questions he has been able to invoke the <i>sub judice</i> rule to cover his tracks.  He has not spoken openly about this issue, he has withheld information and refused to talk about public money.  He has ensured that women must keep the struggle going to win their rights.  The modern women's movement is more than 25 years old.  I listened to Deputy Callely earlier with interest.  He reminded me of the dog who listens to his master's voice and he certainly mimicked the Minister well today.</P>

      <P>It is not the prerogative of Fianna Fáil to obstruct women's rights, a Labour Minister manfully tried to prevent women winning their right to equal pay and equal pay legislation.  The Minister is in for the same battle.  The country cannot afford not to concede on this issue.  Thousands of women have entitlements and are willing to fight for them, through the courts if necessary. One Minister, backed up by his baying backbenchers, will not be able to withstand the justice sought by thousands of women.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate, Deputy Allen, his Fine Gael colleagues and Deputy Keogh and the Progressive Democrats for their support.  I was astonished that, with the honourable exception of the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, the other national newspapers did not consider last night's debate worthy of being recorded, despite the fact that almost 70,000 married women are owed substantial moneys by the State and deprived of their entitlement by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> The failure of the newspapers to regard the issue as one of any significance was surprising although the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare was not.  The reaction of the Government to this motion has been characterised by the same sort of equivocation, evasion, sleight of hand and downright dishonesty which have been features of the response of Minister Woods and Minister Burton to the campaign of tens of thousands of married women for the payment of arrears of social welfare and transitional payments to which they are clearly entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give the Minister a few facts, the first is that the European Court, in a judgment on 13 March 1991 ruled that under the European Union Social Welfare Equalisation Regulations two Irish women, Nora McDermott and Anne Cotter were entitled to arrears of transitional payments.  The Government accepted the decision and paid up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second fact is that legal proceedings were initiated in the courts by FLAC on behalf of 1,800 Irish women, also claiming arrears of transitional payments. On 12 April, before the case could come to a hearing, the Department of Social Welfare negotiated an out of court settlement with these women and agreed to pay up despite earlier denials.  Payments will be made to the women concerned over the next few months.  The third fact is that in a number of other cases taken by various solicitors on behalf of individual women or groups of women the Department of Social Welfare also settled out of court and paid up.  Because of the attempt of the Minister and his <Col N="1788" /> junior Minister, Minister Burton, to draw a veil of secrecy over the whole issue, we do not know how many people were involved in these cases, but it has been suggested that it is not less than 3,000.</P>
    <P>The fourth fact is that, despite having conceded the validity of the cases taken by these women, and having paid substantial amounts of arrears and interest, the Department is now refusing to make similar payments to tens of thousands of other married women who meet exactly the same conditions and who suffered exactly the same discrimination as the other women who have been compensated. Regardless of what gloss the Minister seeks to put on it, irrespective of what legal excuses he advances and attempts to shelter behind, the fact is that tens of thousands of married women have been treated in a shameful way.  They are being discriminated against and treated as second class citizens.  They are denied payments to which they are entitled as citizens of the European Union and being short changed.  Indeed, one could say the are being defrauded.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callely came into the House and claimed responsibility for rolling back some of the residential property tax.  All he could do tonight was to repeat extracts from the Minister's speech.  There was no promise to lead a deputation to any Minister to overturn the injustice to women.  At least his Labour Party colleague in Government, Deputy Seán Kenny, who alone of all the Labour Deputies attended in the House, supported the motion and argued strongly in its favour.  I do not know whether it means that when we call a vote at 6 o'clock Deputy Kenny will do the honourable thing and support the motion by voting for it as well as speaking in favour of it.  At least, unlike Minister Burton who is away in Greece, he had the guts to come into the House and argue on behalf of some of the women in his constituency who are being shamefully treated by the Government that he, apparently, will continue to support.</P>
      <P>Last night I was strongly critical of the refusal of Ministers Woods and Burton to disclose details to the Dáil of the number of cases taken, the number settled and the amounts paid in compensation. Once again last night the Minister used every possible excuse to attempt to justify his refusal to disclose information to which, as Members, we are entitled.  He said the matter is <i>sub judice</i> although cases which have already been settled could not possibly be <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <P>FLAC has no wish to become involved in a political row over the terms of the Settlement of the Agreement.

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity <Col N="1795" /> of raising this matter.  During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill on 1 March 1994, I raised the question of the proposals being put forward by the British Social Services Secretary, Peter Lilley, MP.  These proposals have angered and worried many of the advice workers in the social centres in England dealing with Irish emigrants.  They have been in touch with me to express their extreme concern at the proposed amendments to the British social services legislation which would have extremely damaging implications for Irish people emigrating to Great Britain and for those already settled there.  The proposals will greatly limit the entitlement to benefits for all Irish people who have lived in Britain for less than three years.  In addition, the proposed amendments to the British homeless legislation will mean that many Irish people will no longer be considered for housing under the priority need rules.</P>
      <P>It is likely that most new emigrants will be sent back to Ireland under these new rules.  I asked the Minister at the time to direct his immediate attention to these issues and to raise these matters with the British Government as a matter of the utmost urgency, given that the British Department of Social Services plans to introduce these amendments to benefit entitlements by early summer, which would have an immediate effect on Irish emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government is acting contrary to European law by forcing these amendments.  Some of the amendments smack of the most basic racist legislation imaginable.  I want to take this opportunity also to condemn in the strongest possible manner the anti-Irish remarks of Paul Johnson, a journalist at the <i>Daily Mail,</i> who made comments in that paper on 25 April.  That type of racist article creates a climate in the UK to introduce the racist legislation proposed by the British Government.  Those remarks pander to the base form of chauvinism.  I am surprised that a man of his standing holds and promotes such views and this is all the more disquieting.  The attitude of mind <Col N="1796" /> revealed by these remarks forms the basis of the proposed changes in the regulations operated by the British Department of Social Services.  These changes are fundamentally anti-Irish.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the British Government withdraws the proposed legislation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should request the Irish Ambassador in London to protest in the strongest possible manner at the article in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the publication of racist remarks and slurs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare gave an assurance in response to my raising the issue that he would get in touch with his British counterpart.  It seems Irish workers will have to wait for some time before they know if Ireland is to be exempt from British plans to curb what they call &ldquo;benefit tourism&rdquo;.  Last Monday in the House of Commons the British Social Services Secretary, Mr. Peter Lilley, declined an invitation from the Opposition to abandon what was described as his &ldquo;barmy ideas&rdquo; to introduce a habitual residency test for foreigners seeking to claim social services benefits on arriving in Britain.</P>
    <P>The British Labour Party MP, Mr. Max Madden, asked the Secretary to exempt Irish citizens from the proposals. I understand Mr. Lilley is awaiting a report from an advisory council regarding these recommendations.  He defends his proposals by saying they are in line with the rest of continental Europe.  It was his opinion that the present system is equivalent to giving housing benefit to people who go to England to learn English.</P>
    <P>I support the many Irish welfare groups in London who met the junior minister, Alistair Buet, who is responsible for the operation of the plan.  There are longstanding links between Britain and Ireland on social security matters and any moves to include Irish people in these proposals must be seen as an unfriendly act by the British Government.  If these proposals are implemented thousands of Irish people will be affected, as will students who have been forced out of this country by the Minister's decision to <Col N="1797" /> terminate unemployment assistance for students.</P>
    <P>The British Government proposes that before social security is paid to foreigners they must show they have lived in Britain regularly for three years.  The type of travel undertaken by many people to Britain means that thousands of Irish people will be affected if the proposals are implemented.  I ask the Taoiseach to take this matter up with the British Prime Minister without further delay.  Action speaks louder than words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which I have spoken to the House on this topic.  I first spoke on the Adjournment on 8 February shortly after the news broke that the United Kingdom intended introducing an habitual residence test in assessing entitlement to three important social welfare payments.  I made it clear then that I was very concerned at the implications of these proposed changes for Irish people.  I subsequently answered two parliamentary questions on this issue on 26 April and outlined to the House that I raised this matter both at EU level and directly with my opposite number in the United Kingdom, Secretary of State Peter Lilley, MP.</P>
      <P>As I previously explained, the main reason Irish people go to the United Kingdom is to take up or seek employment. In general, they are entitled to levels of social protection in Ireland which are equal to if not higher than those currently available in the United Kingdom.  They cannot be accused of engaging in benefit tourism.  Thus the recent offensive remarks by a columnist in the <i>Dail Mail</i> to the effect that &ldquo;The Irish exploit Britain's welfare state as a kind of patriotic duty&rdquo; are totally baseless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this issue was last discussed in the House, Deputy Allen raised the issue of Irish students going to Britain to seek work during the summer holiday period. As Deputies will be aware, I introduced the students summer jobs schemes last year.  It was an outstanding success with <Col N="1798" /> over 9,000 jobs being offered by the voluntary, community and public sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme enables various groups to carry out worth-while projects within their community while at the same time providing a part-time work for students during the summer holiday period.  I have made a number of enhancements to this year's scheme, including the increase in the maximum payment from £400 to £540 and the duration of the scheme has been extended from ten to 12 weeks.  I encourage all third level students who would at this time of the year normally be examining work options abroad during the summer period to strongly consider the students' summer jobs scheme, particularly those who do not have a firm job offer.  It has been advertised for a short time and there has been a strong response to it.</P>
      <P>I do not need to go over the ground I covered in my reply of 26 April except to repeat that I was heartened by the assurance given by the Secretary of State when we met that the new proposals were not intended to interfere with the traditional working arrangements and pattern of migration that has existed between our two countries for generations. We agreed that a group of officials would work together to find a means by which Irish people would not be adversely affected in the implementation of these proposals.  Since then officials from the two sides have met on a number of occasions and have also been in frequent contact.  As I stated on 26 April, my officials made a number of proposals designed to achieve the objective agreed by the Secretary of State and myself which the British side undertook to examine in consultation with their legal advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still awaiting a response from the British side to the proposals made by my officials.  We expect to have their response shortly.  Until this is to hand, I cannot definitively finalise the matter and say it has been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can repeat what I said on 26 <Col N="1799" /> April; namely that on the basis of the agreement between the Secretary of State, Mr. Lilley, and myself, I am hopeful that there will be no adverse impact on the right of Irish people to avail of British social protection while working or seeking work there.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased by the response of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to this issue at their meeting in Dublin on 26 April.  As those Deputies who were present can verify, there was unanimous support for maintaining the existing rights of Irish people to social security while living or working in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In addition to the direct discussions between the two Departments I have sought to keep in touch throughout this period with interested groups such as British-based Irish groups and the emigrant advice community here.  My concern has been twofold.  The Irish groups in Britain have been active in seeking the same outcome so it is only right that I should, in effect, co-ordinate my efforts with theirs.  Secondly, these groups are in the front-line of providing information to Irish people in Britain and to prospective emigrants here.  It is vital that our citizens receive up-to-date and accurate information on how changes in British social security could affect their rights; accordingly, it is important that they be kept abreast of developments on this front.  In this regard, an official of my Department will address a conference on pre-departure counselling services for emigrants to be held in Malahide on 31 May.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will continue to give this issue the attention which it so highly deserves and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise an important and urgent matter in my constituency.  It concerns an industrial dispute at Clondalkin <Col N="1800" /> involving one of the leading engineering companies, Airmotive Ireland Ltd. which overhauls and maintains aircraft. It employs over 600 people.  At present 60 workers remain suspended and there is a risk that the issue will deteriorate into a major dispute.  Such a dispute in this competitive industry could have disastrous consequences.</P>
      <P>Rival companies that previously serviced military aircraft are competing for civilian business.  There is urgent need to involve the industrial relations agencies and, if necessary, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to secure the earliest possible settlement.  Whatever the merits of the origins of the dispute, the unions have indicated their availability for discussions at the Labour Relations Commission.  I understand that the LRC indicated its availability to initiate such discussions yesterday, Tuesday, but that the company responded it was too early and proposed Thursday instead.  I would be very concerned about any delay in agreeing to get talks underway.  I sincerely hope that both parties will proceed with the meeting tomorrow under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission and, without prejudice, agreed to restore normality.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the unions are seeking the reinstatement of the suspended workers.  I understand the company is claiming it is not yet in a position to present a comprehensive set of proposals to the unions.  Notwithstanding that, I would strongly urge the company to reinstate the suspended workers to allow normal negotiations to take place.  This plant is too important for either side to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of a settlement of the immediate dispute. Unless an immediate resolution is found this already difficult dispute could become more intractable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers are afraid there is a hidden agenda to provoke a dispute which would inevitably result in redundancies while management is afraid that if valuable orders are not filled to meet deadlines essential business will be lost.  Unless both parties commence normal negotiations without delay the appalling prospects <Col N="1801" /> of job losses may become inevitable.  This subsidiary of Aer Lingus is a very prestigious company in its sector, with an experienced and highly skilled workforce.</P>
    <P>Since the weekend I have been approached by many of the workers and the wives of suspended workers explaining the difficulties this dispute has caused for them.  This is a very stressful and worrying time for them.  This very prestigious plant provides major employment in the area.  I call on the Minister to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that staff at the Labour Relations Commission are made available to mediate a settlement this week before irreparable damage is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who is unable to be present I am pleased to respond to this matter.</P>
      <P>Airmotive Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of Aer Lingus, employs more than 600 workers in the overhaul of jet engines at its plant in Rathcoole, County Dublin. The dispute at this company arose from the suspension of 69 workers last week after they refused to make themselves available for overtime.  Workers at the plant had been involved in unofficial work to rule and ban on overtime for over four weeks in protest at the dismissal of a worker for refusing to go on a training course.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, 12 May, management issued protective notice to all employees following the suspension of 15 workers who refused to make themselves available for overtime.  On Friday last, a further 54 workers were suspended.  The company defended its decision to issue protective notice on the grounds that it could not service its customers' engines without staff being available to work reasonable overtime as provided for in the company-union agreement.  According to management, staff unavailability for overtime working would result in a direct loss of engine overhaul business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions contend that the company's actions are unreasonable and complain <Col N="1802" /> that the workers are being asked to work overtime on top of 13 hour shifts.  In a letter to the unions on Friday management stated that it would be undertaking a comprehensive review of operations at the plant, including difficulties in the operation of the current agreement between the company and the unions, the impact of current operations on competitiveness and the effect of the 13 hour shifts.  At a meeting on Sunday, 15 May, the unions agreed to resume normal overtime working following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, which I understand is in the process of arranging a conciliation conference for the earliest practical date.</P>
    <P>As stated previously in the House, industrial disputes can best be resolved when the parties follow proper procedures with a view to reaching negotiated settlements.  The State provides machinery in the form of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to assist parties where there are difficulties in arriving at negotiated settlements. The services of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are designed to ensure that parties have impartial, expert and independent assistance to reach settlements and avoid industrial action.</P>
    <P>As a conciliation conference is imminent in this case I would urge both parties to adopt a positive approach to these negotiations with a view to settling the dispute.  However, responsibility for resolving the dispute rests ultimately with management and the unions.  It is imperative in their own interests that they resolve the dispute as soon as possible with or without third party assistance.  In view of the fact that further negotiations are due to take place under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission it would not be helpful to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé fíor-bhuíoch díot as deis a thabhairt dom an fhadhb seo a chur os <Col N="1803" /> comhair an Aire agus an Tigh.  Rud é seo atá an-tábhachtach do mo Dháilcheantar féin.</P>
      <P>The Dunkineely water scheme, incorporating Croagh, Meenbrock and Castlerea, has been in operation for more than 40 years.  This scheme was designed to supply 30,000 gallons of water a day. However, by 1980 the demand had risen to 60,000 gallons per day and temporary work had to be carried out by Donegal County Council at Croagh Lough and new pumps had to be installed.  The resultant decrease in pressure in the water mains had a terrible effect on the households connected to it.</P>
      <P>The present supply is not able to meet the demand.  The increase in water consumption, caused mainly by the increase in the number of tourists and new houses built and the additional connections to group water schemes, has led to the water supply being cut off by Donegal County Council at night.  This has had very serious consequences for householders and also gives rise to problems in the event of a fire.  Apart from one connection to a restaurant and guesthouse which had to provide 170 dinners every evening and could not operate without water, the water supply was cut off all last weekend.  This meant that there was no water within several miles with which to put out a fire in Bruckless or Dunkineely.</P>
      <P>This problem could be solved by linking the Dunkineely water supply scheme to the new Killybegs water supply network which has just been completed at a tremendous cost to the State of approximately £15 million.  From the point of view of householders and businesses in the area, the Minister should ensure that this scheme is included in the operational programme.  The contract documents are with the Department and the cost is not exorbitant.  I hope the Minister will see fit to approve these contract documents and to allocate money to alleviate this major problem in my locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy <Col N="1804" /> Coughlan for raising this matter.  As she is aware, work on stage 1 of the Killybegs regional water supply scheme is nearing completion.  This major project involved the construction of two dams, a new treatment works, reservoirs and trunk and distribution mains at an estimated cost of more than £16 million.  It will provide a reliable supply of quality water for existing and future residential, agricultural, industrial and fishing industry &mdash; related developments in Killybegs and the surrounding area.  Under the stage 2 development of the Killybegs scheme it is proposed to increase capacity at the treatment works to provide new storage reservoirs and extend the distribution main network.</P>
      <P>Donegal County Council have submitted proposals to my Department for a number of extensions, including Bruckless and Dunkineely, in advance of the full stage 2 proposals.  However, in common with many other worth-while proposals it has not been possible so far to provide financing for it due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out to the House that, in addition to the Killybegs stage 1 scheme, very much a flagship project under the 1989 to 1993 Operational Programme, considerable progress has been made in the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Donegal.  Over the past five years I have made over £17 million available in the county for the development of water and sewerage schemes.  Important projects have been completed at Cranford, Carrigart, Carndonagh, Letterkenny and Buncrana, to name but a few.  Notwithstanding such progress I am aware that we cannot meet all the demands for water and sewerage schemes at a pace we would like.  However, work is well advanced within the framework of the National Development Plan 1994 to 1999 on the water and sewerage programme over the same period.  The determination of priorities under this programme takes account of a wide range of factors, including the need to meet our obligations <Col N="1805" /> under the urban waste water and drinking water directives and the requirements of industry and the tourism sectors.  Until this process has been completed it will not be possible to indicate the schemes which will get to construction within the next few years.</P>
    <P>I will keep the Deputy informed of the position in relation to stage 2 of the Killybegs development in this regard.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht an rún seo a mholadh os comhair na Dála.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall an t-airgead a chur ar fáil chun an scéim seo a chur ar siúl.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>On 20 September 1993 a letter was sent to the Minister from the three teachers at Ballyowen Meadows School, Balgaddy, Clondalkin.  This is a small, special national school of 24 children under the patronage of the Eastern Health Board, caters for children with autism, language impairment, and children with various degrees of mental handicap and behavioural problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school had moved from St. James's Hospital in 1975.  Three years ago it was decided that, as the building needed major structural and decorative work, it would be preferable to move to an unused, or partly used, school in another area.  The teachers explained to the Minister that the building required major renovation internally and externally, perimeter fencing and security systems at an estimated cost of £50,000, that it was unsafe for staff and parents to use the school outside normal school hours because of the potential risk to personal safety.  They also explained that repeated burglaries and vandalism have rendered it impossible to keep equipment such as televisions, computers, photocopiers and so on, on the premises.  Finally they explained that the pupils needed social training within the community and that <Col N="1806" /> the surroundings rendered this impossible because of vandalism and drug dealings in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>The Minister was told that a suitable premises had been found at the Loreto School, Nutgrove, Rathfarnham which the Minister will know very well since it is in her constituency.  Apparently it was the Minister's decision that this school would be used by a multi-denominational school.</P>
    <P>On 17 November 1993 the Minister replied to a parliamentary question from me and others on conditions at the school and the need for alternative accommodation. In replying the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Further investigation of possible options is continuing on an urgent basis.  I can assure the Deputies that every effort is being made to provide a solution that will meet the special needs of this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the position has deteriorated in the past one and a half weeks during which there have been four incidents of vandalism, all the windows are now boarded up and it is estimated that it will cost £7,000 to repair them.  In addition, teachers, nursing staff and 24 pupils have been virtually under siege for some time.  Because of the damage to the building and, in particular, the threat to the safety of the children, the school has been closed since Friday last.  It is not known when, if ever, it will reopen.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning the desperation of parents who must now cope with the children full-time.  Some of the children are mentally handicapped, some have no speech, no sense of danger, are easily frightened and the condition of the school has increased their terror.  All of them are extremely vulnerable.</P>
    <P>If ever a situation demanded urgent action it is this but urgent action was promised last November.  In the meantime, suitable accommodation has been provided for another school in the Minister's constituency.  The suggestion that two schools could exist side by side at the <Col N="1807" /> Nutgrove premises has not been acted on.  Another suggestion that St. Thomas's school in Esker might be a suitable location and that spare classrooms there could be utilised on a temporary basis has also hit the dust and the space allocated to Bosnian refugees.  While I have the greatest sympathy for the Bosnians whose plight necessitates high priority, nonetheless so also do these unfortunate special children.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a meeting has been arranged for tomorrow morning in the Minister's Department.  I hope the Minister will be able to announce, either now or tomorrow morning the results of her investigation on an urgent basis promised six months ago and that this problem will be resolved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I can assure the Deputy of my Department's commitment <Col N="1808" /> to assisting the patrons of the school, the Eastern Health Board, in meeting its responsibility to secure suitable alternative accommodation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As part of this process a range of possible alternative locations for the school have already been investigated.  The investigation focused on a number of existing schools on the west side of Dublin with surplus accommodation. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, all of these options have been found unacceptable by the school authorities or by the health board.  Nonetheless, my Department has continued its efforts and will be meeting representatives of the health board tomorrow with a view to making progress in the matter.</P>
    <P>I might add, for the sake of accuracy, that the school in Rathfarnham is not in my constituency but rather in an adjacent one.  The Deputy might like to know that. In view of the concern expressed by the Deputy I will advise him of the position as soon as a satisfactory outcome has been reached.  I share the Deputy's concerns in the matter.</P>

      <P>The latest LFS estimates available relate to April 1993 when it was estimated that 230,000 people were unemployed out of a total estimated labour force of 1,375,000.

It is anticipated that preliminary results from the 1994 LFS will be available next October.</P>
      <P>Pending publication of the LFS results, the live register is taken as a short term trend indicator of the underlying changes in unemployment.

In accordance with these provisions the companies make contributions towards a fund to cover the future pension costs in <Col N="1728" /> respect of service given since 1 January 1984, vesting day.  Under the 1983 Act, the Minister for Finance has liability for the cost of benefits related to service given in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs before vesting day.</P>
      <P>As announced in my Budget Statement, £72.5 million have been allocated in the 1994 Transport, Energy and Communications Estimate towards meeting the Exchequer's liability under the Act of which about £50 million will be channelled to the An Post Superannuation Fund.  I also stated that ongoing costs in respect of the liability will arise in future years.</P>
      <P>The entitlements of individuals under the superannuation provisions of the An Post pensions scheme are a matter for the company responsible for the administration of the provisions.</P>

      <P>A number of schemes designed to encourage unemployed people or lone parents back into the workforce allow participants to retain the secondary benefits to which they were entitled prior to participating in the schemes.  The secondary benefits paid directly by my Department are the fuel allowance, Christmas bonus and butter vouchers. The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are paid by the health boards.  Entitlements to medical cards and differential rents are also included as secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>The schemes under which secondary benefits are retained by participants include back-to-work allowance, community employment programme, vocational opportunities scheme, third level allowance, and the allowances administered by the area-based partnerships set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which are payable to people taking up employment or self-employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some upper limits on entitlement to secondary benefits for participants in the back-to-work allowance administered by my Department.  That allowance is designed as a pro-active support for unemployed people and lone parents to return to the workforce as employees or self-employed persons.  It enables participants to retain 75 per cent of their social welfare payment for the first year and 50 per cent for the second year.  All secondary benefits to which participants were entitled to prior participation in the scheme are retained provided that the combination of income from the allowance itself, employment or self-employment and Family Income Supplement, where payable, does not <Col N="1730" /> exceed £250 gross per week.  A similar income limit applies in the case of people availing of allowances for paid employment under the area-based partnership arrangements.  In addition, the amount of rent or mortgage interest supplement payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for back-to-work allowance participants is limited to a maximum of £250 per month.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a free telephone rental allowance is that the claimant must reside alone or only with certain expected categories of people.  These categories mainly include children under age 15 and/or other people who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon assistance in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for a free telephone rental allowance in February 1994.  According to the information available to the Department, he resides with his wife and their young daughter. Under the rules of the scheme, his application had to be disallowed as his wife is not one of the excepted categories of people mentioned above.  He was notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this year's budget, I announced certain improvements to the free telephone rental allowance scheme. From July next, the excepted categories of people who may reside with a claimant for the purposes of qualifying for this allowance will be extended to include a recipient of a carer's allowance.  If the household circumstances of the person concerned change such that he satisfies this condition of the scheme, he should <Col N="1731" /> notify my Department so that his entitlement to the allowance may be re-examined.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the person concerned may wish to contact the community welfare officer at his nearest health centre where he might qualify for financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme towards the cost of obtaining a telephone.</P>

      <P>All of the operational recommendations have been addressed and are being implemented or have been implemented where practicable.</P>
      <P>The fundamental thrust of the hospital efficiency review group's report was to seek greater co-ordination of hospital services, particularly in the Dublin area and to develop funding and planning mechanisms which would relate available resources more explicitly to performance measurement and output.</P>
      <P>The Strategy for the Health Services which I have recently published has proposed a new organisational structure for the Dublin area which will provide for more coherent and integrated planning for all services, including hospital care, than has hitherto prevailed.  In addition, there have been significant developments on funding mechanisms which are now more appropriately linked to the case mix experience of major acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>Also, the strategy lays particular emphasis on establishing a new performance audit responsibility for the Department of Health which should allow for the agencies and the Department to agree on service priorities and objectives and measure the effectiveness of service delivery to the patient.</P>

    <P>A value for money unit was established in my Department in 1991 which succeeded the cost containment unit set up in 1989.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the <Col N="1746" /> enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1993 was 52 which warrants a staffing in the 1994-95 school year of a principal and one assistant.  The second assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that primary schools which are accommodating children with Down's Syndrome in ordinary classes have experienced a dramatic cut in visiting teacher assistance as in a case (details supplied).</Quest>

      <P>I do not accept that there has been any dramatic reduction in the general level of visiting teacher assistance provided to primary schools accommodating children with Down's Syndrome in ordinary classes.  In particular instances, circumstances may arise which result in a reduction in service for a particular child. The instance cited by the Deputy may be one such case.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in response to Question No. 77 of Wednesday, 11 May 1994, I am having the matter investigated by my Department.  I will advise the Deputy of the outcome as soon as inquiries have been completed.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the general position in relation to integrated children with disabilities will be improved from September next as I propose to appoint additional resource teachers which should reduce the level of demand on the visiting teacher service and enable visiting teachers to give more attention to existing cases.</P>
