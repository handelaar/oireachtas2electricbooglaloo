      <Quest>the estimate, if any, the Central Statistics Office has made of the size of the black economy in Ireland in view of reports that the inland revenue in the United Kingdom and the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimate that the black economy is worth between 6 per cent and 8 per cent of gross domestic product in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Central Statistics Office (CSO) does not estimate the overall size of the black economy in Ireland, it does endeavour to ensure that any incomes earned in the black economy are captured in the gross domestic product.  When necessary, the basic data on incomes are adjusted upwards to incorporate estimates for hidden economic activity.  An example is the adjustment made for non-reporting and under-recording of incomes by self-employed traders where the basic data on incomes are derived from the tax collection <Col N="1502" /> system.  These incomes are grossed using factors calculated by comparing the numbers of self-employed recorded in the census of population and labour force surveys with the numbers making tax returns.  This and the other quantifiable adjustments made to the national accounts for black economy activity amount to about three and a half per cent of GDP at present.</P>
      <P>Income earned from black economy activities is also indirectly captured in other components of the GDP but the amounts involved cannot be separated and quantified.  For instance, the labour supply approach used to estimate wages and salaries will capture earnings not reported to the tax authorities but the estimation procedures do not separately distinguish these amounts.  Also, income from agriculture is measured indirectly using the so-called output approach and is not dependent on the tax declarations of farmers.</P>
      <P>The CSO will continue its efforts to improve the coverage of the black economy in the Irish National Accounts although such activity, is of its very nature, difficult to estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How often are such estimates done?  Does the evidence available to the Minister show whether the size of the black economy as a proportion of the total economy has increased or decreased over time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Other estimates have been given, the most recent being an unofficial one last October by Mr. Gabriel Fagan which put it as high as 7 or 8 per cent.  However, the estimates are done on an ongoing basis by the CSO which tries to keep track continuously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the estimates of 3.5 per cent was arrived at taking certain factors into account that would not have been taken into account in Mr. Fagan's estimate.  I am asking if that estimate of 3.5 per cent, taken on the same basis as previous estimates, shows an increase or a decrease <Col N="1503" /> in the black economy as a proportion of the total economy.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if the difficulties in compiling the trade figures will be resolved in view of the fact that the latest figures available relate to January to July 1993; if so, when; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the completion of the EU Single Market in January 1993 customs declarations, the traditional source of almost all trade statistics, are no longer required for most movements of goods within the EU.  A new EU-wide system for collecting intra-EU trade statistics, Intrastat, was introduced on 1 January, 1993.  This Intrastat survey is conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, while estimation, data analysis and publication is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office. Trade with non-EU countries continues to be based on customs documents.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1993, trade statistics were far more timely than most other economic statistics because traders had to complete customs documentation in order to ensure the speedy movement of goods, and this documentation provided the basis for compiling the trade statistics. The new Intrastat data collection system for EU trade has lost this advantage, and is subject to the non-response and timeliness difficulties normally encountered in direct statistical inquiries.</P>
      <P>The timeliness of publication has improved in recent months.  However, considerable efforts will be required to significantly reduce the existing time lag. Over the coming year, it is planned to reduce the publication delay by at least three days a month on average.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not the only country experiencing publication delays.  The changes introduced by the new Intrastat system are of such magnitude that all EU national administrations are confronted by major problems in the collection, compilation and analysis of their trade statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the present time lag is hampering planning and preventing a proper analysis of our trade performance?  Will he consider providing more resources and personnel to ensure an earlier announcement of our trade figures in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the sooner one has statistics the easier it is to make plans.  That has always been a problem, <Col N="1506" /> but it is not related specifically to manpower and resources, rather it relates to a delay in people returning questionnaires. Previously the information was obtained from customs documentation, but questionnaires are now sent directly to companies. The delay arises as a result of people not sending back the questionnaires, the necessity to make follow up telephone calls and so on.  A similar problem is experienced throughout the European Union, but the Central Statistics Office will endeavour to improve the position here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's Department carried out a familiarisation or education programme to assist our exporters in adapting to the new system? Perhaps that could constitute follow up interaction between the Department and exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office undertook to give extensive advance publicity to the new survey, but it did not have the desired impact.  There is ongoing contact with importers and exporters by the Central Statistics Office and they have implemented an educational programme to keep people informed.  Prior to the adoption of the new system the Central Statistics Office indicated that there would be delays, but it is trying to improve the position and will continue its education programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As this question relates to the efficacy of collecting information on our trade figures, perhaps I might be permitted to ask a questions in that regard.  Has the Intrastat system contributed to a delay in the compilation of statistics?  On the other hand, does it measure the effect of transfer pricing as between this economy and economies where large companies have their origins and have contributed to some artificial account of output here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay was not caused by the introduction of the Intrastat system.  Following the completion of the Single Market a separate means of <Col N="1507" /> collecting statistics had to be introduced. I do not have the information the Deputy requested in the second part of his question, but I will arrange to have it forwarded to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 12, 40, 45, 62 and 64 together. Deputies will be aware that in a press release of 10 March 1994, I announced the initiation of a consultancy study to preview the structure and functions of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>On 14 March 1994, a number of consultancy firms, with extensive international experience in the tourism field, were invited to submit proposals for the provision of that advice, on the basis of the following terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the growth targets for tourism set by the Government for the rest of the decade, to review and make recommendations on the role and operations of Bord Fáilte Éireann, having regard, in particular to the suitability of its existing structures and functions in terms of strategically responding to the Government's targets; the compatability of its existing mix of functions with the priority exercise of its core promotional role; whether its involvement of, and participation with, the sector in its developmental activities is likely to promote <Col N="1510" /> an evolving level of sectoral self-reliance over time.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the consultants will need to take a view also on the effectiveness and efficiency of Bord Fáilte's various programmes and activities.</P>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of proposals in my Department is tomororw, Wednesday, 30 March 1994.  Following receipt of these proposals, it would be my intention to make an early decision on the appointment of consultants.  I would not envisage having a protracted consultancy, and thus all firms invited to submit proposals have been informed that a maximum period of 12 weeks is envisaged for the consultancy work.  I would, therefore, expect the review to be completed in early July.</P>

What criteria will the Minister use in appointing a consultancy agency to produce the report?  He has outlined the terms of reference but does he not consider they are narrow?  Will he agree that the consultants should examine the inter-relationships between Bord Fáilte and other agencies involved in promoting tourism including the Department of Tourism and Trade, Shannon Development, RTOs, the two county tourism boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes regarding the world equestrian games.  Regarding the criteria for selecting consultants, we asked a number of consultancy firms to submit proposals by tomorrow evening.  They will be considered by my Department's officials and hopefully we will be in a position to announce the appointment of consultants in the near future.  The terms of reference could be expanded to cover the wide range of activities referred to by Deputy Deenihan.  When I answered a question about Bord Fáilte during Question Time on 16 February I outlined my views on its role, matters I had dealt with and plans for its future.  I stated then that it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions in the absence of a comprehensive view of Bord Fáilte obtained with the assistance of consultancy expertise. I will engage consultants with limited terms of reference, consider their recommendations and make decisions.  I made that position clear on other occasions.</P>

      <P>The consultants' report should be submitted by the end of July and I will then consider their recommendations.  As I stated at an earlier Question Time I have formed some conclusions about the efficacy of various aspects of the functions of Bord Fáilte. The consultants will narrow the focus.  I hope any changes will be made well in advance of the 1995 season.  I would not like to give the impression that I would delay in considering and implementing the consultants' recommendations.  I am hopeful the matter will be wrapped up by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that several of his utterances in the press have led to uncertainty in the tourism industry, especially in relation to the role of Bord Fáilte, and to a fall in morale among its workforce?  Will he agree it is vitally important that the report is produced as early as possible to clear up that uncertainty?  Will he respond to statements made by Mr. Jimmy Murphy at the ITIC Conference yesterday where he condemned the Minister's attitude to Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants will be engaged to focus on particular activities of Bord Fáilte and to submit recommendations in a report.  I will make the decisions in respect of those activities and I will not be bound by the consultants' recommendations.  Deputy Deenihan referred to uncertainty in the industry and a fall in morale among the workforce in Bord Fáilte.  Other Deputies referred to tensions in the industry.  Deputy O'Malley stated during the debate on the Supplementary Estimates that many semi-State organisations produce institutionalised propaganda.  From my experience of dealing with agencies I agree with his view.  It is no accident that more than 15 members of the workforce of Bord Fáilte are also members of the NUJ and they have good contacts with newspapers and other areas of the media. I do not accept that this uncertainty has harmed Irish tourism.  The gentleman Deputy Deenihan referred to does not appear to know that a new Department of Tourism and Trade was set up under the Programme for Government.  People may have thought that matters would continue as before.  The manner in which matters were dealt with in the past was regarded as sacrosanct and it was envisaged that pattern would continue.  The change has not led to any difficulties in Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate regarding the role of Bord Fáilte and other functions pertinent to State organisations has been healthy. There is an ongoing debate about tourism. I opened a seminar this morning in University College, Dublin.  This debate <Col N="1513" /> which involves Bord Fáilte, regional tourism organisations, this House and commentators in the media and elsewhere has been healthy.  It highlights that tourism is no longer the Cinderella industry of our economy and that by the end of the decade it will be the main provider of jobs in most countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The prospects for improved performance in tourist numbers during 1994 is favourable with growth anticipated from all our principal overseas markets. A target of 245,000 for additional visitors has been set.  An increased emphasis on the marketing of new and off-season products including city breaks, golfing holidays and small company incentive meetings is paying considerable dividends. Air and sea carriers, Irish hoteliers and other tourism interests are investing increased resources in promoting these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a target of 245,000 represents a relatively small increase in the number of visitors in view of favourable conditions this year such as the strengthening of the dollar, our low inflation rate and other factors which combine to make this country, a more attractive location than for some time?  A more optimistic view of the 1994 season should be taken and efforts <Col N="1514" /> made to increase that target figure which I am sure will be reached.  Will these special proposals by Bord Fáilte and the Minister be aimed at attracting people who might not otherwise come here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 245,000 extra visitors, if achieved in 1994, will double the increase in 1993 over 1992.  It is too early in the tourist season to make predictions, but that would be a considerable increase on the 1993 figure.  The extra money put into the market will pay dividends and the figure of 245,000 is based on that investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear each of the steps listed by the Minister.  Is any one of them likely to bring in a larger number of visitors this year?  Will the hoped for increase of 245,000 visitors constitute a high proportion of ethnic visitors, for example, those coming from Britain for relatively short periods, or will they be genuine non-ethnic tourists who will spend larger sums of money here and stay for a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra measures are not aimed at people visiting friends and relatives.  For example, the extra money that went towards the United States is aimed at increasing the number of visitors from that country by 57,000. Other measures are aimed at increasing the number of high-spend, non-ethnic tourists who may come here for only a short period of time and those who would not otherwise come here.  The measures are aimed at attracting people who have never been here.</P>

      <P>Finalisation of the Tourism Operational Programme, 1994-1999, must await the conclusion of negotiations between the Government and the European Commission on the Community Support Framework.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the negotiations between my Department and the Commission on the draft programme are proceeding well, and I am confident that it will be possible to publish the tourism operational programme shortly after the Community Support Framework is finalised.</P>
      <P>I am aware that pending finalisation of the tourism programme, there is a desire on the part of the tourism industry that some interim funding arrangements should be put in place.  The marketing area has been identified for particular attention in this context.  My Department, in addressing this issue, sought to secure a specific commitment in this context for EU funding.  The formal agreement of the Commission on aspects of individual operational programmes in advance of agreement on the National Development Plan gives rise to practical difficulties.  However, the Government's decision to provide £8 million to my Department for marketing purposes in 1994 allows necessary expenditure to be undertaken at this important time of the year.  I am also making arrangements to ensure that following the agreement of the programme, eligible expenditure in respect of projects which are subsequently approved can be backdated to 1 January 1994.  These measures will alleviate the concerns of the vast bulk of businesses in the industry, and while I will obviously keep the situation under review, I do not believe that any further measures are necessary at this time.</P>

However, I accept that if the operational programme is not finalised for some time many projects in the pipeline <Col N="1517" /> will be held up, which would be very unsatisfactory.  We have spoken to the Commission in this regard and, even thought the programme will not be announced for some time, I can confirm that eligible projects will be paid from I January 1994.  At present I am not very concerned about the matter, but if the national plan was not finalised until the end of the year, some measures would have to be taken to overcome that problem.</P>

Fifteen projects have been granted approval for a total of £3 million and £1 million in respect of five projects has been disbursed.

      <P>The figure of £25 million is an indicative ceiling worked out by me and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  When the scheme of £100 million was announced by him an indicative sum of £25 million was set aside for tourism related projects. This sum can be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the demand for this funding and for the remaining £75 million.  It is too early to say whether we will reach that figure or exceed it; this depends on the demand.  The funding is adequate at present.</P>

On the provision of funding for golf courses on a restricted basis, when we were discussing the criteria governing <Col N="1520" /> the various activities which could be regarded as tourism related projects there was a reference to golf courses.  It was decided that their funding would be decided strictly on a case by case basis, it would be for &ldquo;pay as you play&rdquo; facilities and it would be working capital only, with a maximum ceiling of £250,000.

      <P>When I was speaking at the conference yesterday morning I said that local operators should consider the facilities available for tourists in their towns or villages on a wet day in March. The new operational programme is aimed at the provision of all-weather facilities to attract discerning tourists all year and to provide variety.  I am not in a position to announce the details of the new operational programme in so far as it relates to golf courses, but suffice it to say that there is an ongoing debate about the number of golf courses &mdash; some people say we have too many while others say we do not have enough.  I suppose this depends on whether one is addicted to the game.  I am not saying that my views on this issue are more coloured than those of Deputy Ahearn who probably does not play golf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not read the statement in this morning's newspaper, but there has been an ongoing debate over the past year or so about whether we have enough golf courses or should grant aid new courses.  The new operational <Col N="1522" /> programme will take account of this matter.  There are not enough golf courses in some areas while there are too many in others.  Usually market demand will decide the number of golf courses in an area, some courses built in the past few years will not survive financially while others will thrive.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that a ceiling of £250,000 would be placed on the loan for working capital for golf courses and that this funding will only be provided for &ldquo;pay as you play&rdquo; courses. Will the Minister say if that is the only assistance which will be given to golf courses from now on?  If so, approximately 95 per cent of projects will be ruled out.  Will any capital assistance be given to courses independently of this £25 million?  Will the Minister bear in mind that while we have a great many golf courses, golfers and golfing tourists, one very good course is perhaps worth ten not so good courses from a tourism point of view?  We have some recent good examples of this.  Will he bear in mind the great desirability of completing the course at Adare in County Limerick on which many millions of pounds has been spent but which, unfortunately, has not been completed?  If this course is not completed in the reasonably near future the huge expenditure on it will be irretrievably lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions relate to the £100 million business loan scheme. In my reply I referred to the criteria laid down for projects which qualify for funding; I referred to the loan scheme only as it relates to this aspect of business. The new operational programme will provide some assistance for golf courses, as it has done in the past.  The details of the programme have still to be worked out.  I agree with the Deputy that the course in Adare should be completed so that the expenditure to date will not have been wasted.  Hopefully, that project will be up and running shortly and further consideration can be given to it in the new operational programme details.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 24 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the conclusions and recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council with regard to tourism policy in their recently published report. The report is comprehensive and valuable analysis and will prove useful in the continuing formulation of strategy to achieve the Government targets for the sector.  Indeed, many areas covered in the report, such as tourism product, marketing, quality, etc. are already the subject of direct action by my Department and Bord Fáilte, while others such as access are also being looked into by the Tourism Council.  Of course, many areas have also great relevance in the context of formulating the new operational programme for tourism, which I am currently finalising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> In regard to the specific marketing area, the report identifies the US market as one which needs a greater focus.  The current special £3 million campaign to attract US visitors is a direct response to this.  The report also foresees the need for a greatly expanded marketing programme and Deputies will be aware how interested I am to secure support for a greater marketing effort.  An extra £8 million is available for promotions in 1994 and the promotional efforts being undertaken draw together the European Union, the private sector, the carriers and Bord Fáilte, as recommended by the NESC report.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledges this comprehensive report.  How can he reconcile his policy with some of the recommendations made in the report, in particular with regard to the upgrading of unregistered accommodation? The Minister's attitude is not to impose any regulations regarding unregistered accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations put forward in the NESC report overlap with work being carried out by my Department, Bord Fáilte and the Tourism Council.  Some of the recommendations in the report will be taken on board as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the the Minister for his views on one of the major recommendations of this report which concerns the question of seasonality? Does he acknowledge that considerable capital investments in facilities and in transport and so on may be money unwisely spent in that it would be greatly under-utilised if the seasonal nature of our tourism business continues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1525" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This did not arise only in the period of my remit as Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Various reports over the years recognised seasonality as the major constraining factor in the growth of Irish tourism and employment in that area.  Some of the recommendations in the report have been taken on board and the National Development Plan takes these matters into account also.  There is no doubt that we would alleviate many of the problems of Irish tourism and create many more jobs if the problem of seasonality could be overcome.  I hope some of the measures I have taken this year regarding the new marketing initiatives in the US and in other areas will help overcome this particular problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the report's recommendations concern access and quality control.  What progress is the Minister making regarding the common air fare rating of Dublin and other Irish airports with a number of world destinations that he referred to on the Estimates? What progress is he making regarding quality control, especially the enforcement of proper standards of hygiene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that I have said on a number of occasions that the question of a common fare rating is an issue to which I have given much consideration.  Bord Fáilte and my Department have had negotiations with a number of airlines in order to include more airlines in the common rating system.  We hope to be in a position later in the year to have agreements concluded. This is proving particularly difficult because it relates to agreements between airlines which impose some costs and less profits on certain airlines. In regard to quality control and hygiene, these are matters for other Departments but as Minister for Tourism and Trade, I must say that the increase in standards in those areas over the past number of years has been impressive.  We have many rules and regulations which are there to be enforced but the market also decides <Col N="1526" /> much of the business in that area.  The Deputy would agree that the standards in the past ten years have greatly increased and if people are not complying with proper standards of hygiene, for example, they will be put out of business because tourists will not return to avail of their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister taking measures to implement a further recommendation of the report, namely, that steps should be taken to combine the various agencies in such a way that they would communicate a single image of Ireland as a place to invest, a place to buy from and to visit?  In respect of whatever restructuring he is engaged in, is this one of the central recommendations that the Minister is taking on board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago I reconstituted the foreign earnings committee which is made up of an inter-departmental group as well as Bord Fáilte, the IDA and all other agencies who deal with people outside Ireland. One of its first tasks was to engage consultants to examine Ireland's image.  I have studied the recommendations of the committee in this regard.  There is a conflict between the image that the IDA and Bord Fáilte want to project.  The IDA sells Ireland as a country which is modern and which has an impressive workforce including all the various facilities, computerisation and, so on, while Bord Fáilte, in the same market, may be selling an image of Ireland which goes back perhaps 50 or 60 years.  Those competing images do exist.  Bord Fáilte believes that is the image which sells Ireland to the tourists while the IDA will say, and rightly so, that if such an image is projected it will not attract business to Ireland.  This is an ongoing conflict.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 49, 65 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has announced that the initial stages of its <i>Gateway to Japan</i> campaign will target small to medium sized companies in the furniture, mechanial handling, medical equipment and machine tools sectors. The programme will run in two separate phases involving information seminars in Europe and participation in trade missions and selected trade fairs in Japan. The second and final phase of the campaign, which will run between 1995 and 1996, will cover other sectors still to be decided by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Euro Chambres, the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has been awarded the contract for organisation and implementation and Euro Chambres have, in turn, arranged that the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland will handle promotions in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Activities will get underway on 26 May with an information workshop, organised by the chambers of commerce in association with An Bord Tráchtála and the relevant EC office and Irish business <Col N="1528" /> associations, with the aim of informing Irish industry of the full details of the campaign.</P>
    <P>This will be followed by participation by Irish firms in a series of trade promotions in Japan including: participation at Logis-Tech Mechanical Handling Fair in October; the JIMTOF Machines/Tools Exhibition in November and the Specialists Furniture Trade Mission in December.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála will be working closely with the chambers of commerce in relation to all aspects of the initiative and the Japanese External Trade Organisation will also be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this presents a great opportunity for many Irish exporters in the areas he mentioned?  Would he also agree that Japan presents a great challenge to and possibilities for Irish exporters, having approximately 125 million consumers with the second highest purchasing power world-wide?  Will the Minister ensure that Irish exporters use the provisions of this scheme to the maximum?  Does the Minister recognise that part of the scheme affords opportunities to young exporters and for the training of young personnel?  What steps are the chambers of commerce and agencies established to manage this scheme taking to ensure that young people are encouraged to benefit from its provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan is correct to place such emphasis on Japan since it is Ireland's second largest non-European trading partner after the United States.  The total two-way trade, imports and exports, in 1992 totalled £1.14 billion.  It is a market on which we must concentrate and which has enormous potential.  In addition, there is the problem of the Japanese market not being as accessible as other markets in the European Union and the well known Japanese reluctance to knock down trade barriers.  However, with the new GATT regime I hope we will be in a better position to exploit that market.  I cannot <Col N="1529" /> think of the name of the scheme to which Deputy Deenihan referred but there is a scheme which allows young Irish executives to participate in a programme and, if I recall correctly, three Irish people participated in that programme in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the initiative the Minister described might be welcome, in practice it will be like many other initiatives and efforts of this kind taken over the years without any success. Unless the European Union is prepared to use its political and economic muscle to get the Japanese to open their markets even to a moderate extent &mdash; much less than European or American markets are open &mdash; all the praiseworthy initiatives will be a waste of time.  Sending young Irish exporters out there will be like sending innocents to the slaughter because they will be wasting their time, unfortunately as did most of their predecessors in similar circumstances.  Will the Minister urge on the External Trade Commissioner of the European Union that Europe adopt a similar attitude to the Japanese as the United States took recently when it sought to invoke the famous or infamous super 30?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In an historical context what Deputy O'Malley said is correct, that the Japanese market is the one we have had greatest difficulty exploiting.  If one succeeds in making a break through, usually the Japanese find some excuse not to deal.  Our exports to Japan have been increasing.  Figures furnished by the Japanese authorities show that in 1993 Ireland was the only European Union country to show a growth in exports to that country.  I should like to think that the conclusion of the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations will liberalise the Japanese market to a greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At many European Union meetings and meetings to discuss the GATT negotiations and the Single Market, a kind of stand-off attitude has often been adopted <Col N="1530" /> to the Japanese market, in that we give out about them, they give out about us but nothing really happens.  Ireland has been increasing its market share in Japan albeit from a very low base.  I hope that under the new GATT regime &mdash; to be signed in Marrakech within the next fortnight &mdash; the Japanese market will become more open.  I was in Japan about seven years ago and when I visited that country late last year I found a changed attitude on the part of many Japanese bureaucrats. Their economy has not improved in recent years and many of their people are coming to the conclusion that the protectionist mentality &mdash; that has pertained there for a long time is not the way to proceed.  There is a growing realisation in that country that opening up trade constitutes the best way for the Japanese economy to grow.</P>
    <P>I hope that attitude will permeate deeper into the Japanese trading experience, affording the European Union, particularly Ireland, greater opportunity to increase trade with that country.  I noticed a change in attitude, as did many people who were there in 1993 which should be to the benefit of Ireland in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the young business personnel we are sending to Japan are very different from the business personnel to whom Deputy O'Malley referred?  We are sending out better trained and educated people who will exploit any opportunity presented them in Japan more so than did their predecessors.  When I was in San José recently I met some young people who following a visit to Japan are now working in the Silicone Valley. Would the Minister agree that there are exciting opportunities in Japan for young Irish business personnel?  I appeal to the Minister to obtain as much European funding as possible for the training of young business personnel, which is most important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That scheme is called the executive training programme &mdash; the ETP &mdash; for Japan which sends 40 young <Col N="1531" /> European business people to Japan for 18 months for intensive training in the Japanese language and business practices. This year there are three Irish participants in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Minister had to say about the mentality in Japan beginning to open up, but does he agree that the statistics do not show that, rather that the whole cultural mentality in Japan is towards protectionism, selling into other markets at a rate of penetration, for example in the United States, that has caused alarm?  Would he agree that mere goodwill or making pleas through some well-intentioned scheme is likely to fall on deaf ears unless very definite measures are taken as between the three great trading blocs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told Deputy O'Malley, there is no point in denying that that has been the position.  At the conclusion of the GATT round &mdash; I spoke to the GATT Director General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, recently &mdash; the Japanese did not prove to be as difficult as people expected.  As Deputy Rabbitte and others know, there is this marked reluctance to open up their borders to trade &mdash; that is part of the Japanese culture. It is not a matter of one government or one Minister being replaced, it is part of the overall Japanese experience no matter who happens to be in power. Deputy Rabbitte was right in saying it has caused enormous difficulties in the United States, for example, because their imports from Japan have not been reciprocated. Indeed, the former British Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, had many disputes with the Japanese Government over problems she foresaw for the British economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot be absolutely definite about this, at present it appears that things are changing.  Since the Japanese economy has been in decline, many people in Japan are of the opinion that they must now open up their markets. Ireland has been increasing its export trade with Japan over the years.  Therefore, <Col N="1532" /> we have been doing better than our European counterparts but undoubtedly, as Members said, there remains considerable scope for greater penetration on the part of European Union countries into Japan.  That formed part of the latest GATT negotiations and is a matter that our European Union colleagues raise regularly with their Japanese counterparts. I hope that at the end of this decade we will see a considerable opening up of the Japanese economy but we must remember that we are dealing with a culture that has held this attitude for hundreds of thousands of years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 48, 52 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware from replies which I already made to parliamentary questions on this subject that I favour using a carrot rather than a big stick approach.  I would like to see the greatest possible number of tourist accommodation premises within one listing system which assures quality to the tourist.  I believe that this should be based on a voluntary approach to the maximum degree possible.</P>
      <P>A compulsory registration system would entail significant administration costs and the introduction of a compulsory system would only be justified by very perusasive arguments.  Compulsory registration would imply penalties &mdash; fines or imprisonment &mdash; for the provision of unregistered accommodation; I am not prepared to go that way.</P>
      <P>The quality of accommodation in both approved and unapproved categories has risen dramatically, over recent years. Competition is driving the quality upwards and I would like to maintain competition as the spur to further progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyFox" hpid="Mr. J. Fox Mr. J. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree essentially with the carrot rather than the big stick approach in regard to many small bed and breakfast operations.  There is a great need for them and a desire that they should be in place.  Nevertheless, there is an anomaly regarding the accommodation that has to be approved.  Will the Minister clarify the exact size of bed and breakfast accommodation for which approval is required? Many local authorities are now asking <Col N="1535" /> whether planning permission is required for bed and breakfast accommodation, on which there are various opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem to which Deputy Fox referred.  There is confusion in some local authorities concerning the size of premises for which planning permission is required.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will shortly bring a Bill before the House which will deal with that problem and which will specify that if the rooms exceed a certain number planning permission will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's statement a reversal of the stated policy in the Programme for Government that all accommodation would have to be registered? Does the Minister have the support of the industry in regard to his policy for non-registered accommodation?  In regard to the carrot approach does the Minister think it should be made easier for people to register and that the philosophy should be that you get what you expect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>By the end of the year I hope to bring forward proposals which will encourage as many premises as possible to be in one unified system, at whatever level that may be.  In an ideal world, everyone would be registered and listed but the market levels out these matters. Having studied the matter and having had the Department of Finance analysis unit study the matter, it is clear it would not be worth while to impose compulsory registration now.  I will bring forward proposals which I hope will encourage the majority of people to register and to be graded at some level.  That is the idea of the carrot approach and we will see how it works before going down the road of the big stick.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 33, 54 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The rapid expansion of the tourism sector in recent years has seen a proportionate increase in the number of tourists with disabilities.  This had led to an increasing level of inquiries from tourists and potential tourists about accessibility of facilities in Ireland.  As a result, the National Rehabilitation Board, with the assistance of Bord Fáilte, held a conference on tourism and people with disabilities on 18 January 1994.  I was invited to open the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference was told by an expert speaker that, based on a report carried out by Touche Ross last year, tourism by people with disabilities in Europe is worth £31 billion, £22 billion of which is unsatisfied demand.  Ireland's share of this market could be worth as much as £160 million.  While some research may be needed in relation to both supply and demand, it is clear that this is a very <Col N="1538" /> valuable market which we cannot afford to ignore.</P>
    <P>The essential purpose of the conference was to inform the tourism sector of the commercial benefits of providing services inclusive of people with disabilities. At the conference, I announced my intention that all new or improved physical developments undertaken under all new EU-sponsored tourism programmes, managed by my Department shall be required to provide appropriate access for the disabled.  I also indicated that I would be seeking EU approval for a parallel programme of access improvements to existing tourist facilities, where these can be undertaken on a cost-effective basis.</P>
    <P>During my address to the conference, I requested the National Rehabilitation Board to liaise with Bord Fáilte and to submit to my Department a set of detailed proposals for support under the next round of EU Structural Funds.  I recently received their proposals which are now being considered in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are losing £80 million a year in tourism revenue due to lack of facilities for the disabled.  Will the Minister evaluate existing tourism projects paying particular attention to access facilities for the disabled and include them in any grant aid available from the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any future proposals for funding will have to take such measures into account.  There is a considerable niche market there.  An inter-departmental committee, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, looks at transport matters in so far as they affect disabled people.  Account will be taken of it and other areas in the next operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 50 million disabled tourists in Europe yet we make little effort to facilitate disabled people on our public transport.  Action is needed, not lip service.  We must think in terms of the great potential in this <Col N="1539" /> market.  Disabled people travel to other destinations where they are well catered for.</P>

      <P>One of the tasks of the Department is to liaise with other Departments in order to influence the formulation of their policies which impact on tourism.  I am satisfied that the arrangements which operate at present, both formal and informal, are adequate and effective.  I consider that a committee, as proposed by the Deputy, would simply involve an additional, and unnecessary, layer of bureaucracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is overlap in certain areas, for example, tourism, crime, sign posting, sanitary facilities, etc?  Fragmentation of services gives rise to problems and we should go forward in an integrated fashion.  There would be merit in having within the Tourism Council members from different Departments who would make a direct input to tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Tourism Council is to bring together in a co-ordinated way the various agencies and public bodies involved in the industry. My Department is represented on the various committees of other Departments which have to do with tourism related matters.  A proposed Bill is being <Col N="1540" /> brought before the Cabinet and observations are requested on it.  It is necessary that the various Departments and State agencies act in a co-ordinated and cooperative way to get over the problems raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to capitalise on and exploit our tourism potential we must have a more focused attitude. Surely the lack of co-ordination that is evident in, for example, carrying out public works in a tourist resort in the middle of the season affects the industry. There are several areas where there is overlap and a committee such as the one I am recommending could deal with those problems.  They already operate in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>At national level the plans we have put in train are all right. The Tourism Council fulfils many of the functions the Deputy mentioned.  There could be co-operation between the local authorities and the industry to ensure road works are not carried out at a sensitive time.  The county tourism committees which I set up could deal with such matters.  The structures that are in place should meet the problems raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The tourist information office network which is administered by the regional tourism organisations fulfill a vital servicing role by offering to tourists a range of information services related to visitor holiday needs.  The role of the &ldquo;user friendly offices&rdquo;, as envisaged by the Deputy, appears to be consistent with the activities <Col N="1541" /> already undertaken by the tourist information offices and, in the circumstances, new structures are considered unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider broadening the remit of the tourist information offices?  One potential area for development is genealogy and ancestry.  There are supposed to be 40 million Americans of Irish ancestry. There are eight million people in the UK who were born here.  I was recently in Des Moines in Iowa for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and met a number of people who were proud to claim Irish ancestry.  We should broaden the scope of the office that aspect.  There are many unemployed people with PhDs and MAs who would be delighted to offer their range of expertise to these offices.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know, my Department has, since its establishment in early 1993, shared the Kildare Street building with the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Transport, Energy and Communications. The reorganisation of accommodation in the building to facilitate the needs of the new Department &mdash; though provided for in the 1993 Estimate &mdash; did not actually materialise in 1993, but is certain to take place this year.

      <P>In relation to the increases in allocations for consultancy services and for advertising and publicity, the reason for the increase is that the Department in 1993 was in its first year of operation and expenditure under these headings was at a lower level than anticipated.  The 1994 Estimate provides for a reasonable level of expenditure for a full operational year. Although the abridged Book of Estimates shows a reduction in CERT's grant-in-aid, the total resources being made available to CERT in 1994, by way of Exchequer grant-in-aid and ESF contribution, show an increase of approximately 20 per cent over 1993.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that ESF funding has made up the deficit in the allocation to CERT?  Did he explain the reason for the 233 per cent increase in the subheads for office premises and the apparently larger actual amount for consultancy services?  What <Col N="1543" /> are the range of services for which consultants have been employed?  Is it just the one we know about or are consultants working on different dimensions of tourism policy?  The increase in absolute terms is more than the Estimate has provided for.</P>

      <P>I tried to explain in my reply that when the Department was set up in January 1993 a figure had to be subtracted from the Estimates of other Departments to arrive at the figure for my Department in the Book of Estimates. This matter was raised at a sub-committee dealing with the Estimates last year.  We made the best possible stab at the figures.  Under the subhead for office premises, we provided for £172,000 in the provisional Estimates for 1993 in anticipation that the building would be shared by the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade.  It was not possible to carry that out and therefore we spent only £26,000 in 1993.  The figure in the 1994 subhead is a carry-over from 1993 as we anticipate we will be able to do the work in 1994.</P>
      <P>The reason for the allocation under the consultancy subhead is similar and when we were preparing the 1993 Estimates we took a figure and allocated it to the Department of Tourism and Trade.  If the Deputy puts down a separate question on the different amounts paid out in consultancy fees, I will supply the information. He also can raise this matter at the Estimates meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 63 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992, 67 per cent of US holidaymakers considered Ireland fair or good value for money while 33 per cent rated it poor value.  In 1993 the proportion who gave a poor value rating fell substantially to 15 per cent.  Visitor satisfaction ratings are, however, higher with 93 per cent of US visitors in 1993 either completely or very satisfied.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that exchange rates have an important bearing on value for money perceptions.  For example, in 1993, after the devaluation of the Irish pound, the US dollar purchased 10 per cent to 15 per cent more Irish pounds than in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Value for money is crucial to tourism development in all markets.  Government policy has contributed to the improvement of the value for money aspect of Irish holidays.  The 1994 budget, in particular, included a number of provisions aimed at improving the cost competitiveness of the industry and Bord <Col N="1547" /> Fáilte and the industry has increased its promotion of off-season and special value holiday packages.</P>
    <P>The questions of product quality and price are among the issues being addressed by the Tourism Council and its committees. In addition, I have asked the industry itself to direct its attention to the related issue of customer satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the reasons for the decline in visitors from the USA in 1993 was reports of poor value for money from over 130,000 US visitors in the previous year?  Does he agree that word of mouth is the best form of advertising?  Does he agree also that news spreads alarmingly quickly throughout the tourism industry and that if we get a bad name, news of this spreads quickly?  What steps are being taken to improve the quality of the Irish tourism product, especially in the areas of hygiene, quality food and competitive pricing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that word of mouth is the best form of advertising. One might be able to encourage tourists to visit once by targeted advertising at a market segment but undoubtedly it is word of mouth when they tell their friends about how they enjoyed their experience in Ireland that will make them return with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could write a major opus on what tourists perceive as value for money.  In my reply I said that in 1993 one could purchase 10 per cent to 15 per cent more with US Dollars than in 1992 and perhaps that coloured perceptions of the value people got for their money.  However, hygiene, quality food and competitive pricing are very important in encouraging visitors to return.  Over the past decade standards have risen enormously.  There is no point in giving shoddy service or ripping off the tourist because he or she will not return and their friends, relations and family will not visit either.  There is a different culture now for dealing with tourists than 20 yeas ago.  People perceive that it is in their own interests to deal <Col N="1548" /> fairly with tourists and this has led to improvement in services all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the low level of repeat tourism in the local and foreign tourist markets does the Department have any policy on it?  Is it taking any measures to encourage visitors to think in terms of repeat tourism and encourage those involved in the industry to provide the necessary incentives for tourists to return to this country?  Does the Minister agree that we need to create a culture whereby people look at the benefits to be gained from repeat tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the plans, the last operational programme and the various measures taken by myself and previous Ministers for Tourism and by the industry is to encourage tourists to return.  As the Deputy is aware, tourist numbers have been increasing in recent years and much of the increase can be attributed to the fact that many tourists are returning because they have had wonderful experiences here.  I hope the measures that have been taken during the past decade and which will be taken to improve the product will lead to an increase in the level of repeat tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>There is a definite need for tourism industry personnel to develop and improve their European language skills. This need has become more acute in recent years, because of the remarkable growth we have seen in visitor numbers from the mainland European market.</P>
      <P>CERT, the national tourism training body, is aware of this need and has responded with a number of training initiatives, designed to improve the language skills of various categories of personnel who work in the industry.  These initiatives include: training programmes &mdash;for example, evening courses, in-company training and language training in conjunction with technical courses; interactive video and distance learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Language training is an integral part of all CERT tourism training courses held in CERT training centres and in regional <Col N="1550" /> colleges.  Both language training requirements and opportunities are consistently stressed to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Tourism Council is considering this issue and I also raised it, in direct discussions with the industry, most recently in my address to the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation Conference yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As only 1 per cent of those who leave Germany and France each year visit this country does the Minister agree it is essential that those involved in the tourism industry have European language skills?  Has the Department carried out any evaluation of the level of competence in European languages in the tourism industry to see if CERT's language training programmes are effective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue on a number of occasions in my discussions with the industry and CERT.  To tackle this problem CERT provides courses to improve language skills.  The industry is also conscious of this problem.  Since 1988 visitor numbers from mainland Europe have increased by 114.2 per cent.  While I can give the figures for the number of visitors from Germany, France and so on this is the one sector of the tourism industry where there has been growth.  It is in the interest of the industry to train staff to deal with visitors from these countries given that this sector is likely to expand further in they year ahead.  CERT will continue to provide these training facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that surveys carried out on an annual basis during the past three years show that out of 20 countries surveyed we are 19th on the list and lag hopelessly behind in terms of linguistic skills?  While I acknowledge that we have made a break-through in the continental market our incompetence in modern continental languages is a major barrier and deterrent, particularly for those who do not speak English although the majority of visitors do.  Is there any liaison between <Col N="1551" /> the Minister and the Minister for Education to improve language skills &mdash; by placing too much emphasis on grammar we kill interest in modern continental languages&mdash;and to broaden the range of courses available?  Ninety-two per cent of post primary schools only provide courses in French and the vast majority of students receive little or no instruction in German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese or other minority languages in the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that over-concentration on grammar kills interest in languages.

A sub-committee will present a report at the next meeting of the Tourism Council. Given the increase in the number of tourists from mainland Europe it is in the interests of the industry to improve language skills.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte has informed me that regulations for holiday apartments are being reviewed and will be submitted to me later this year.  There is little evidence of any sizeable demand for one bedroom holiday apartment units but under the regulations being prepared provision will be made for the registration of such apartments where the developer can identify an appropriate market.</P>

This does not accord with what I might describe as contemporary practice.  In view of the difficulties caused in the registration of a great many apartments which have been built specifically for holidays and tourist purposes &mdash; and the losses incurred by the providers of these apartments &mdash; will the Minister agree to amend the regulations forthwith rather than wait until the end of the year as he seemed to suggest in his reply?</P>

If any developer is badly affected I will amend the regulations in the interim but Bord Fáilte assures me that the matter can be resolved under the existing regulations.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill in many respects, particularly the measures <Col N="1689" /> proposed for large casual trading operations, but perhaps the Minister might simplify the procedures for small or traditional part-time traders.</P>
      <P>Many sites in this city have been designated for casual trading, but this legislation appears to set aside all our work in that regard because it does not provide for the continuation of the status of designated casual trading areas provided for under the 1980 Act.  It appears that all such areas will have to be designated again under this legislation and that, in respect of each new designation, people will have the right to go to court.  Will the Minister clarify that matter?  It would be rather silly to have to undo what has been in operation for the past 14 years and designate every square patch again.</P>
      <P>In being critical of the Bill in respect of too many provisions for small part-time traders, I may be contradicting myself by asking the Minister to introduce additional regulations for other traders.  Section 2 (2) lists the categories which are not included in casual trading and states that casual trading does not apply to selling to a person at, or at a place adjacent to, the place where he resides or carries on business.  In my constituency a small car salesperson wheels out a couple of dozen cars every morning, lines them up along the two sides of the road and puts a &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign on top of each car.  He is carrying on a casual motor trading business on both sides of the road day after day, to the annoyance and inconvenience of the residents of the area.  As those cars are probably not taxed, perhaps I should take up the matter with the Garda but that is another matter.  Basically we do not have a law to prevent this type of trading as he is operating close to his small garage.  The Minister should water down the provision in section 2 (2) (b).  It would be acceptable to carry on trading outside a person's premises, but it is not acceptable that a person should be allowed to use 100 yards of the road on both sides of his or her premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation introduces many regulations for casual trading on the public road, but the Minister may say this does <Col N="1690" /> not come under his remit.  We are homing in on only a small portion of this entire business because a great deal of casual trading takes place in private areas at Sunday markets and so on.  Is it proposed to introduce regulations to cover Sunday markets on private property?</P>
    <P>Casual trade for charitable purposes will be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  Such trade may include selling a daffodil or a rose for charity and regulations would not be desirable in such cases.  I know of a school that ran a car boot sale in a public place last year, the proceeds of which went towards a charity. Casual traders who participated in the venture were charged £5 or £10 and then they engaged in private business. The term &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; requires a tighter definition.  Such ventures may be for charitable purposes but they may take place on quiet roads and the individual casual traders make a profit on their sales.  I ask the Minister to respond to the points I raised.</P>

      <P>I have reservations about the Bill.  I recognise there is need for legislation on some activities in this area but for the majority of casual trading the implementation of this Bill will be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Many aspects of Irish life are worth preserving. Deputy Gregory spoke of the casual trading tradition in Moore Street stemming from the days of Molly Malone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gregory mentioned the impact of this Bill on the Moore Street traders.  It will remove a unique element of trade in Dublin which is enjoyed by Dublin people and many visitors.  As a child I was amazed by the activities of the Moore Street traders and, as a politician I still view them as novel. We should not make Moore Street part of Dublin in the &ldquo;rare auld times&rdquo; which <Col N="1691" /> effectively will happen if casual trading is discouraged there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory also stated that casual traders require a taxation clearance certificate while large farmers evade tax.  As a medium sized farmer I have admired the activities of traders in Moore Street and other areas of Dublin.  Many country people depend on proceeds of the casual trading of home produce to supplement their income.  Because of the implementation of EU law and the introduction of Irish legislation the sale of free range eggs, home baking and farm produce will be discouraged.  Many people who voted in favour of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty would not have envisaged that such casual trading would be prohibited.</P>
      <P>Many home based industries depend on country markets held on the village green or in the village hall on Saturdays and Sundays as the retail oulet for their produce, but such trade will be discouraged by the provisions of the Bill. Legislation is needed in cases where tax-paying businesses are adversely affected. Many businesses, such as supermarkets and multinationals, do not want casual traders to operate near their premises and are not concerned about the welfare of such traders.  Many multinationals do not plough back profits acquired from the labour of Irish people into the economy. The small entrepreneurs who set up home based industries to make an extra few shillings are being victimised by the Bill while others evade tax through anomalies in the system.  Will the Minister reconsider the position of casual traders whose business is in the interests of urban and rural Ireland and to take cognisance of those traders' livelihoods.  Officials of county enterprise boards have expressed concern that many industries under consideration for grant aid will be adversely affected by this legislation.  While I recognise some legislation in the area of casual trade is necessary I have some reservations about certain aspects of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the devolution of powers to local authorities in <Col N="1692" /> the legislation.  As a member of a local authority I am aware of the restrictions on local authorities in ordering business to suit the needs of the community.  It has been difficult to strike a balance between the needs of local established businesses, casual traders and consumers.  Extra resources have not been allocated to local authorities to enforce the additional powers devolved to them.  That is a general phenomenon in local authorities which will lead to major problems whether in the area of sanitary services, environmental controls or whatever. Additional responsibilities are being given to local authorities to perform complex functions without the allocation of additional resources to meet those demands.  In the last decade there has been a massive cutback in the level of employment in local authorities.  The thin spread of resources will not be capable of meeting new demands on local authorities. It is important for them to have facilities to make exemptions and make sure amendments will be tabled by both sides in that regard.  Local authority members are in the best position to know local needs and what areas should be exempt from legislation.  Under the Bill there is no direction to local authorities on fixing fees, although I am open to correction on this.  There is a danger of distorting the market unless there is some framework that is nationally applicable in terms of fees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fox raised the question of country markets.  I hope that well-established country markets that operate in parish and community halls will not be directly affected by this Bill.  The Minister should clarify whether this is so.  To specify how important this question is I will cite an article in the local paper:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Country markets are very much a part of rural life in County Wicklow, with popular markets located in villages and towns such as Blessington, Roundwood, Delgany, Arklow, Wicklow, Greystones and Kilcoole.  As well as providing a necessary outlet for many producers to sell home produce, such as cakes, jams and vegetables, <Col N="1693" /> these markets are now also regarded as one of Wicklow's main tourism draws &mdash; literally thousands of cars travel into the county from Dublin every weekend to experience this traditional aspect of Irish country life.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with that.  The headline of this article states: &ldquo;Country markets will have to close&rdquo;.  In that front page article there are a number of quotations from a member of the senior Government party who explains the legislation to the public by saying it is simply an exercise in bureaucratic craziness to close off potential businesses by crude and ill-thought out legislation.  He states that it is a classic case of both the baby and the bath water going out the window &mdash; I think he has mixed up his metaphors. He believes that the draconian red tape associated with this Bill will frighten lawabiding citizens from working at country markets.  Clarification is needed on this aspect.  This is either true or it is scare-mongering of the worst kind and very damaging because it greatly frightens people who see an important and vital role for country markets.  The Minister should respond on this matter.  Scare-mongering of this type should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Country markets in counties such as Wicklow have a very important role in village and town life as well as in sub-urban parts of the county which are included in the greater Dublin area.  They provide a focus for much activity relating not only to food and produce but to flowers and crafts.  This is the kind of development we should encourage. There is a huge number of attractive open air markets in Europe.  We cannot always operate open air markets due to weather conditions, but there is a certain open air dimension to the markets and we should ensure that is not destroyed by unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House recognises that something must be done about casual trading, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether draconian measures will create more problems than they solve.  I do not believe that is the Minister's <Col N="1694" /> intention.  When a Member of the Oireachtas makes extremely disturbing statements that are recorded in the local paper I have to make my case here.  I could not support measures that would have such an impact at local level.  I am satisfied that the indoor country market is secure, but it is important to put that on record.  The interests of people who work in traditional country markets and people who enjoy the pleasure of shopping in them must be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and acknowledge the urgent need for such legislation.  The Minister said that fair trading was defined in advance of the 1980 Act as &ldquo;reasonable and effective control, with a need for the casual trader to make a more realistic contribution to public funds&rdquo;.  As a member of a local authority I am very much aware of the contribution made by the trading sector to the economy and to the income of county councils.  It is reasonable that people make a contribution commensurate with the activity in which they are engaged.  The Oireachtas would do well to recognise the fair complaints that emanate from the self-employed, particularly small shopkeepers and rural publicans, about the difficulties they experience in undertaking their business. I recognise this is not a matter for this Bill but it should be favourably considered by the Government.  In so far as this Bill goes some way towards redressing an imbalance, I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shopkeepers and publicans frequently complain that they are under duress from excessive powers of the Revenue Commissioners and social welfare inspectors. While there is a need to keep tabs on illegal activity, there is a widespread belief that powers in this area are too great.  The 1980 Act provided that people employed by these traders should be fairly treated in terms of their employment, and that is to be commended. Some people believe that some of the major national and multi-national chain stores have become so adept at side stepping legislation on employment that the <Col N="1695" /> conditions of their employees have not significantly improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern and other speakers outlined the widespread concern about traffic and other environmental problems that have arisen from uncontrolled casual trading.  A recent case in my county was dealt with by Clare County Council on Monday of last week. In this case huge difficulties were created by casual traders at the Cliffs of Moher. In that location, which is visited by many tourists, people frequently played music, tape recorders and radios were played, generators from ice-cream and chip vans drowned out the noise of the sea and rubbish was strewn in the area.  Complaints were made that tourists were put under duress to purchase goods and to pay to look through viewing devices through which they would more clearly see the cliffs.</P>
    <P>The county council sought to regulate these activities but unfortunately there was strong opposition to its efforts. People who had been berated for the last 20 years for their activities in the area were defended and a lobby came to their rescue.  Great opposition was mounted to the efforts of the county council in regulating these activities.  Eventually the county council closed off the right of way, leaving free access for those who wish to visit the cliffs.  This is an example of the difficulties created by casual trading. There are countless examples of casual trading severely impinging on the commercial life of an area.</P>
    <P>Under the 1980 legislation a trading licence is required from the Department of Enterprise and Employment and a permit is required from the local authority. I welcome the fact that the Minister is not only giving power to the local authority to decide where trading should be permitted and the conditions involved but is devolving responsibility to the local authority for the entire system.  Some of the exemptions under the Act gave rise to difficulty for local authorities and the enforcing agents.  A number of cases which came before the courts illustrated <Col N="1696" /> the inadequacy of the legislation, and this is being dealt with under the current Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 2 to limit the exemption provision has been criticised by many sectors.  As I understand it, three of the original eight categories, the licensed auctioneer, the door-to-door salesman and people collecting for charity, will be exempt from regulation while the other five categories will be subject to it.  I welcome the provision which will allow local authorities to provide for other exemptions for certain activities in a specific place.  It is difficult to understand some of the concerns expressed about this provision.  I commend the Minister on his willingness to place this power in the hands of local authorities and hope his example will be followed by several of his colleagues.  There is a very great need to devolve more powers to local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the contributions that experience varies from place to place. Deputy Gregory referred to the position of street traders in Dublin.  These traders have certainly added to the colour of Dublin and I would not be sympathetically disposed to those major store owners who seek to get rid of them for certain reasons, one of which is very close to my heart.  I very much welcome the provision which will enable local authorities to provide for other exemptions as the Minister could not possibly have provided for the conditions which apply in different areas.</P>
    <P>The proposal that a licence cannot be issued within five years of two or more offences being committed was enshrined in the 1980 legislation.  While on occasion it came in for considerable criticism, fortunately it passed the test in the Supreme Court, something we have not come to expect in certain cases.  It is impossible to argue against this provision on grounds of justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's undertaking that tax clearance certificates will not pose a difficulty for legitimate casual traders and that the Revenue Commissioners will make suitable arrangements to ensure that, apart from <Col N="1697" /> exceptional circumstances, no casual trader will be refused a licence.  Unfortunately, this has not been the experience of many legitimate casual traders who have tried to get a C2 certificate: getting it can be very difficult and tortuous for many people.  On balance, I welcome this legislation which will amend what the Minister and many other people perceive as weaknesses and shortcomings in the 1990 Act.  I am very glad to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree in principle with the Bill, I should like the Minister to level the playing pitch.  It is appropriate that county councils should have direct control over the issuing of casual trading licences as the income from them will benefit the creation of jobs.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of casual trader, the first are outsiders who set up stalls in towns on market day and sell radios, televisions, electric tools, etc. Nobody in the town knows these people or from where they have come.  They do not contribute to the local economy in any reasonable way and in some cases their vehicles are registered outside the State.  They are a hazard to local shopkeepers who have to pay taxes and rates. The second category are local people who sell fruit, vegetables, home-made produce, fowl and garden produce at local markets on Wednesday or Saturday mornings; their fathers and grandfathers sold produce at these markets.  They sell their produce so that they will have a few pounds extra to cover household expenses during the week.  The Minister should differentiate between those two categories of traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fox said, Moore Street has been a trading area for centuries.  Dublin people have traded in Moore Street for generations and they have contributed in their own right to the State.  The Minister should differentiate between different categories of traders.  I do not understand why a young lad who sells newspapers or an old woman who sells herring or mackerel at a street corner on a Friday morning should have to have a tax clearance <Col N="1698" /> certificate.  These people are engaged in a traditional activity and the Minister should look favourably on them.</P>
    <P>The Limerick market, a beautiful place, is visited by many people on a Saturday morning.  Before Christmas people selling turkeys were approached by health inspectors and officers from the Revenue Commissioners to ascertain if they were registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and whether the places in which the fowl had been kept were up to EC standards. It is ridiculous that people selling 15-20 turkeys should be asked such questions. In general I support the Bill and ask the Minister to consider the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The 1980 Act attempted to introduce some order into the casual trading area. It is timely that we should review the operation of that Act in the intervening 14 years.  The 1980 Act had two distinct aims, one of which related to a loss of business by established traders to casual traders who, unlike established traders, did not contribute to State funding or pay local rates.  I recall very well the demand to rectify this anomaly.  At that time established traders experienced difficulties in keeping their prices as low as those of casual traders who did not have the same overheads, rates, income tax and VAT.</P>
      <P>There was also a demand from the trade union movement to rectify this anomaly. It believed that if established traders could not compete with casual traders employees would be made redundant.  In larger cities and towns employment was trade union organised and the rates of pay of employees in established businesses had to be kept at a certain level. There were good reasons for the introduction of the 1980 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though under the 1980 Act local authorities could introduce a licensing system, the then Department of Industry and Commerce also had the power to issue licences.  It is appropriate that local authorities be responsible for issuing licences and I do not see the need for any <Col N="1699" /> trader to apply to the Department of Enterprise and Employment now or in the future.  I am happy that this work is being devolved on local authorities.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Environment there was strong demand for devolving powers to local authorities. Speeches on this Bill indicate that some Deputies want to return power to central Government but it is appropriate that the issuing of licences be dealt with by those on the ground.  Circumstances in towns and counties may vary and, therefore, the members of local authorities are in the best position to judge what is right for their own areas.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputies McManus and Fox from my constituency, refer to country markets.  It would appear that some Deputies did not bother to read the Bill or even the Minister's speech.  This legislation does not propose to interfere with country markets.  We are well aware of the benefits of the country market system which has been built up over many years and is a great attraction for many people in the county as well as for visitors from abroad.  Because Wicklow is so near to the capital city many thousands of people will visit our county from now until the end of summer. Nothing in this Bill will interfere with country market operations.  I have read the Bill and the Minister's speech and I am sure he will confirm that nothing in this Bill will interfere with county market operations when replying to Second Stage.  Church hall sales and country markets are a feature of country life and will not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations, not about country markets, but markets which because of their proximity to main roads create traffic hazards in villages and towns.  On a Sunday people travelling home from Brittas Bay to Dublin for instance may experience severe traffic difficulties with delays of up to two hours because of large markets operated both from within the county and outside it. This affects not only people returning to their homes but people trying to get to hospitals, airports and so on.  It also <Col N="1700" /> affects fire brigades and ambulances that may be required to travel through rural parts of Wicklow where these markets are held.</P>
    <P>I hope local authorities, on being given these powers, will ensure that main roads such as the N11 will not be obstructed because of an overflow of traffic and the chaos created by these markets.  I realise this is mainly a matter for the Garda but because of the movement of gardaí from small rural villages, where these markets are generally held, there is not the manpower to introduce some order to these occasions.  I hope the Minister will ensure also that local authorities provide sufficient parking spaces and that no unnecessary obstructions can occur, particularly on any of our national primary roads.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister intends to considerably reduce the number of exemptions to approximately three, namely, selling by a licensed auctioneer, door to door selling and charity sales.  The selling of agricultural and horticultural produce, the selling of sweets and chocolates at public events, the selling of ice cream and newspapers, the selling of fish by crews and selling at markets or fairs held with the authority of a Statute or franchise will no longer be exempted.  It should be emphasised that these activities are not being prohibited in this Bill.  The licensing authority, which will be the local authority, will have the power to issue licences to people operating in that area.  If the licence fee is considered to be a way of raising funds for the local authority, there might be an inclination by members of local authorities, particularly at Estimates time, to increase those fees.  I hope the Minister will ensure that they cannot be increased unduly.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the selling of fish could have been exempted.  I represent two fishing towns, Arklow and Wicklow, and we all know that fish are not inclined to follow any law as to when they arrive in an area and when they can be caught. There is a glut of mackerel or herring at particular times of the year and selling fish on street corners has been practised in towns for centuries.  It is a long standing <Col N="1701" /> tradition which does not adversely affect the local fishmongers to any great extent because they usually make their own arrangements with the local fishermen. A person wishing to sell a few dozen herrings in a box on one or two Fridays in the year should not be required to obtain a licence to do so.</P>

      <P>I hope that there will be no interference in this practice.  If the activity was regular there might be a need for a licence but when it occurs on only one or two occasions the local authorities should understand that it is a longstanding practice, one which I hope will continue for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the requirement for a licence for the selling of strawberries and fruit, many areas in my constituency, and particularly in Wexford are known for their production of strawberries.  During the summer, when young children are not at school, they sell the excess strawberries on the side of the road.  That seasonal practice is welcomed by most people who travel through these counties and I hope there will not be much bureaucracy attached to such an insignificant level of trade.  During the summer before last, which was a good summer, commercial strawberry growers could not sell the excess strawberries to the factories and carried on trade in opposition to the small producer who sells strawberries at the side of the road.  The commercial growers moved strawberries from one area to another.  The issue became a major one, but the main trade so far as roadside trading is concerned is the sale of fruit from small plots.  There has been some criticism of the requirement of tax clearance certificates for these traders.  I do <Col N="1702" /> not think anyone in this House nor any of the many people in the PAYE system, would advocate that people be allowed operate a trade and make a profit without paying tax.  If that necessitates the production of a tax clearance certificate, so be it.  Whether you engage in trade in a small or larger way, if you make a profit on operations, then you have a responsibility to pay some in the form of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The best.  However, if you engage in casual trading, moving from town to town, you should add to the tax yield.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister does not intend to include festivals and regattas under the provisions of this Bill, some of which take place around this time of year. Yet the impression appears to have been given that casual traders at an event like the Wicklow Regatta, with which the Minister will be familiar, or others, fall within the provisions of this Bill.  On most occasions it is very difficult to extract money from people who travel from Dublin to Wicklow to participate in such events whereas many Wicklow people who travel to Dublin part with much of their money in shops and businesses in the capital.  I hope that no barriers, such as the payment of high fees or the necessity for licences, would cause us problems in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the removal of the dual system and the devolution of power to local authoriites under the provisions of the Bill.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill since casual trading has been part of our culture, particularly in rural areas, since pre-Christian times.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is present. I am glad that local authorities will have some say in issuing licences to casual traders since they are familiar with local happenings.  I might refer to the matter of casual trading at fairs, in particular to a fair day in Tubbercurry when casual trading takes place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed, and which has been the case for as long as I can remember in that town and for hundreds of years.  It is known as the old fair day, which takes place, I think, on the second Wednesday in July when casual traders from all around the country come to the fair.  I should not like to see that event removed from our calendar and I would very much welcome Sligo County Council granting licences for casual trading on that day.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I have seen casual trading on our national primary roads about which I am most unhappy because it causes great obstruction to passing motorists.  In that respect I am glad that Sligo County Council is doing its best to find a halting site for those who have been trading on our national primary roads in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the sale of religious objects.  The House will be aware that missions are held in all our churches every five years approximately when a stall is erected for the sale of religious objects.  It would be unrealistic to expect such traders to apply for a licence to trade outside all churches because they could be in Donegal this <Col N="1704" /> week and attending a mission in Cork in two weeks' time.</P>

Whenever we are at a seaside resort, we all like to buy fresh mackerel, herring or whatever other fish comes in from the fishing boats.  I hope that the Minister will continue to allow fishermen to sell fresh fish when they arrive with their haul.</P>
      <P>I also hope that the old fair days, when casual trading took place, will be allowed to continue, especially at festivals.  A number of people should have a designated area within which to sell their farm produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill whose provisions, in the main, are well-intentioned and practical.</P>
      <P>Markets and fairs have been a part of our history and heritage.  While they may have changed in nature over recent decades from the old fair days and markets held at the end of the last century and the first half of this one, they remain part of our history and should not be discarded.  It is important to preserve the very best of those markets within the new commercial trading conditions that constitute life in villages, towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have memories of visiting many great, and small, cities of Europe in which market-places form a central part of urban life.  We all have memories of those markets, their colour, life, vitality and the bustle around them.  We have often asked why we cannot have markets like those in continental Europe.  Despite the many changes in their many thoroughfares and buildings, and the damage to many city walls around Europe, their <Col N="1705" /> inhabitants have been sufficiently intelligent and practical to realise the importance of markets to their towns and cities and have retained them as constituting an important place in their commercial life.  We should do likewise, there is no reason we cannot do so and benefit.</P>
    <P>Representing Limerick, I have had a long interest in markets.  Limerick is the capital of the golden vale, the most fertile part of the country.  Indeed Limerick city could be described as a market town since it had an abundance of markets over the centuries.  When I grew up in Limerick they were very much part and parcel of the life of the city.  Indeed I have fond memories of the fowl market, the milk market, the hay market, the potato market and many more, some of which have died out.  However, one still survives, the main market in Cornmarket Row, whose name indicates that a market was held there.  Close by that market there was a laneway called White Wine Lane, white wine meaning milk, demonstrating how the commodities sold there influenced the names of streets and thoroughfares in the city around those markets.  The market in Cornmarket Row has survived to the present day.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Limerick Market Trustees, a body established in 1852, which for almost the past century and a half has served the city by owning and controlling those markets.  Therefore, I have an interest in this Bill.  Limerick Market Trustees comprise 27 members and a management staff: nine members from Limerick City Council, of whom I am one; nine members from Limerick County Council and nine members from Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  I have a keen interest in the provisions of this Bill because as a member of Limerick Market Trustees I am responsible for the ownership and control of the markets in Limerick.</P>
    <P>During the past three decades we have been bedevilled with the problem of trying to control the spread of the market.  The central market has moved from Cornmarket Row to a three-quarter acre site into the surrounding streets.  The problems referred to by Deputy Kavanagh <Col N="1706" /> abound in Limerick.  Other traders come into the side streets and there is great difficulty in collecting tolls from them, in controlling the flow of traffic and the nature of the goods sold there. By and large I support markets and I visit them as often as I can because I get a great buzz from going there.  One of our best Limerick poems, written about the market, &ldquo;Limerick Town&rdquo;, by John Francis O'Donnell, is one of my favourite poems.  I love the markets.  Many of our artists go there to paint it.</P>
    <P>Despite changes in city life and renovations in the market people go there in increasing numbers.  It is an old tradition that I would like to see continued and supported because it has much to offer. People like going to the markets, they like their exuberance and like meeting their neighbours and shopping from country folk.  It is a two-way exercise. People from surrounding counties come in to sell their goods and wares and people from the city buy from them.  I support the whole concept of markets.</P>
    <P>There is a need for flexibility, as Deputy Kavanagh pointed out.  Sometimes we have <i>ad hoc</i> or spontaneous trading on festival days, holidays or special occasions when traders come to the city and use the assembly of many people to sell their wares.  I am not opposed to that, I am not opposed to people using their initiative to increase sales of commodities.  By and large people behave well in the cities, they do not obstruct or harass people or interfere with the movement of people through our streets.  Sometimes people sell small goods, trinkets, metal pieces, leather work and so on.  They do not damage our city trade; they add to the bustle of city life and should not be excluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be interested to know we are in the process of completing work on the renovation of our city markets, including the impeccable restoration of the market house in Mungret Street, Limerick.  This has been a major task involving first class stone masons and bricklayers.  The market house has been meticulously restored.  Even though I am critical of some building work, of designs <Col N="1707" /> and restoration work, generally I am happy with the work there.  The market house has been restored to its pristine condition.  Work is almost complete and I hope the Minister will soon be invited to open it.  The architect, Roddy O'Leary, has been painstaking in ensuring that the work is done.  I hope the Bill, when enacted, will help us to control trading in side streets and also that those people will pay their due tolls to our city.</P>
    <P>I would like to see one amendment to the Bill.  I know this is not the time to speak on amendments but, perhaps, you would give me the liberty to ask the Minister to do it for me.  As a member of the Government I cannot be seen to put down too many amendments, as I may get my knuckles rapped by our Whip, Deputy Ferris.</P>

      <P>If I were to do a Jim Mitchell on this I would incur the wrath of my Whip or the Minister.  I am very meek in asking the Minister to take one amendment on board.  Section 11 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A local authority may appoint officers of the local authority to be authorised officers for the purpose of this Act, ...</P>
      <P>I suggest that section 11 (1) be amended as follows:</P>
      <P>A local authority may appoint officers, including officers of the local authority, to be authorised officers for the purpose of this Act, ...</P>
      <P>In other words, I want the local authority to delegate that authority to a member or members of Limerick Market Trustees to carry out that function for them.  If the Minister can accede to my request I would be happy and it would not alter the content or thrust of the Bill.  Apart from that point it is a good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Gregory speak on the Bill and perhaps it will be possible to accommodate some of his views.  He has <Col N="1708" /> had a long interest in street trading and has been loyal to Dublin street traders.  I would not have the same knowledge of street trading in Dublin although I admire their work.  Dublin street traders have a culture of their own which I have read about in sociological studies.  I have an interest in those kind of people and people who have different occupations, as they enrich our lives.  Those of us who are involved in humdrum jobs do not understand fully the difficulties people have in making a living.  We are often cocooned from the realities of life.  It is a tough life for people who try to make a living on the streets.  They have to live by their wits, they have to be ingenious, resourceful and determined.  While we see them as characters and people who are different in their attire and in their occupation, they are human beings, they have to struggle against their environment and market forces to survive. Despite the fact that I am getting older I am always on the side of the weak person. I am in favouur of people being allowed to live and let live.</P>
    <P>Street traders do no damage to the Chamber of Commerce or to the large multinational companies involved in retailing and wholesaleing.  This is a good Bill, the main provisions of which I welcome. If there are any further amendments I hope the Minister will take them on board on Committee Stage.  The Bill has my full support and I shall contribute further on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of casual trading which take place in towns and cities throughout Ireland. We have traditional market trading where people come to town and sell their farm produce or crafts.  I am not in favour of eliminating such trading and neither is it the intention of this Bill to eliminate such trading.  We also have another type of trader, the fly-by-night who comes to various towns, particularly in summer, to sell all types of goods in competition with shopkeepers.  The crib of shopkeepers and rate-payers is whether they have the same trading opportunities as those trading <Col N="1709" /> in a casual fashion.  Casual traders do not have to provide permanent accommodation and do not have overheads. They are resented in many rural areas. The section in the Bill which states that before a casual trading licence is issued a tax free certificate will have to be produced will be welcomed by conventional traders and will legitimise the street trader.</P>
      <P>Dublin Deputies spoke about street trading being a tourist attraction in areas such as Moore Street.  We should be slow to interfere with that.  For hundreds of years in Galway a farm produce market has been held on a Saturday morning.  It is also a tourist attraction.  Local people avail of it to carry out their agricultural type business.  The pitches in that market have been handed down from generation to generation.  The traders are well known and, in turn, they know the exact requirements of their customers.</P>
      <P>In other towns there is friction between casual traders and local communities.  In Clifden local traders are not happy with the influx of street traders in the summer. Hoteliers, guesthouse owners and shopkeepers depend on the short tourist season for survival.  There is a genuine demand for some form of control to be exercised over casual street traders who move in large numbers into the town where they compete unfairly with the local traders.  In other towns such as Gort, casual traders will arrive on a Friday when the town is full of people attending the livestock mart, they will move to Athenry on a Tuesday and, in general, follow the market around from town to town.  They have an unfair advantage over people trading in a conventional way.</P>
      <P>Roadside traders, usually highly professional travellers, are a new breed in many rural towns.  They are people of no fixed abode who travel from place to place.  They cause great resentment. While travelling to Sligo recently I saw a number of such traders trading in farm implements and other such items unsuited to roadside trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether the provision regarding the tax clearance certificate <Col N="1710" /> applies to trading in one place or whether it enables a trader to trade in one town on one day and another town on another. Such a trader could have a prime location every day of the week and trade at prime times under advantageous trading conditions. I am not sure how this provision will be implemented to ensure they do not have an unfair advantage over conventional traders.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that aspect.</P>
    <P>If there is a competing interest for a similar trading licence in the same location what will be the deciding factor in allocating it to one trader or another? Will the person be obliged to certify the items they will trade in or are they free to trade in different items on different days?  Will specific guidelines be laid down stating what items may be traded?</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity, which we may not get again for a long time, to raise questions and carefully analyse the points raised.  Members will be able to table amendments and tease out points on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the warm response to this Bill.  I regret that some Members have been slightly hysterical in their over the top reaction to some aspects of it.  Lest Deputy Gregory thinks I am referring to him, I am not, but to the former leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dukes who obviously did not read the Bill.</P>
      <P>Some Members commented on country markets.  A former Member commented on country markets and is quoted in the <i>Wicklow Times</i> of 11 March 1994: it is no wonder he is no longer a Member if he is so ill-informed on the contents of the Bill.  Let me nail the lie in the newspaper that country markets will be affected by this Bill.  Unfortunately, democracy has not been well served by its elected representatives.  Indications have been given to citizens, who would not read the legislation in draft form about certain matters which are not in the Bill. I am referring specifically to country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to <Col N="1711" /> achieve greater decentralisation.  It seeks to decentralise to local authorities certain functions which they have sought following the enactment in 1980 of the Casual Trading Act which was found to be unsatisfactory.  Following consultations with the local authorities and representatives of traders, this Bill was drafted.  On behalf of the Government and with the consent of the Oireachtas, I will give local authorities the right to decide what activities will be exempt.  It is proposed to exempt three categories but until the Bill is enacted its contents are no more than a proposition.  In section 2, casual trading is defined and the three categories exempted are outlined: (a) selling by auction; (b) door to door selling by a person; (c) selling in respect of a charity.  I want to draw Members' attention, particularly Deputy Gregory's to two subsections in section 2.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, amend (whether by the addition, deletion or alteration of classes) the classes of selling specified ...</P>
    <P>In other words, I or my successors can add to the number of exemptions set out in subsection (2).  Subsection (4) goes to the nub of the point: &ldquo;A local authority may, as respects its functional area&rdquo;&mdash; manifestly this would include Moore Street; &ldquo;by by-laws under section 7&rdquo;&mdash; and the local authority draws up its own bye-laws &mdash;&ldquo;add to the classes of selling specified in subsection (2)&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, add to the categories that are exempt and an additional number of exemptions &mdash;&ldquo;shall, in relation to the functional area, be construed and have effect in accordance with any such by-laws for the time being in force.&rdquo;  In other words, if a particular local authority believes it is the tradition and part of the culture of the area to exempt the selling of strawberries in Wicklow or in Wexford, to take the point made by Deputy Kavanagh, then it is up to the county council to decide to exempt such a category. That is in the Bill.  We will deal <Col N="1712" /> with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>No.  The trouble is that for years local authority members &mdash; I was one of them as I served my apprenticeship on a local authority &mdash; like youngsters growing up, were looking for independence and decentralisation to run their own affairs but when they begin to get that responsibility suddenly it is far less attractive than the possibility of being able to blame somebody else.  In section 2 the local authority has power by regulation, under section 7, to add to the classes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing it to the attention of the House because unlike Deputy Gregory other Members do not seem to have read the Bill with the same degree of attention to detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCormack said that we will have a chance to tease out the exact implications of the powers.  We will have to give considerable attention to that because Deputy Dukes's contribution was over the top and quite frankly what he deduced from his reading of the Bill was ill informed.  Deputy McManus welcomed the Bill but questioned who would have responsibility for fixing the level of fees.  A casual trader has to get a licence from the Department of Enterprise and Employment and then has to get a specific permit from the local authority which controls the areas in which he trades.  The fees for such permit vary considerably.  If Deputies want to standardise the fee that seems to be a negation of the principle of decentralisation. <Col N="1713" /> For example, Dublin Corporation provides a considerable cleansing service for street markets in certain areas, which is reasonable justification for the high level of fees, but a local authority somewhere else may charge a lower fee but may not provide such a service.  If the fixing of fees was centralised, the fees would be increased in some areas and reduced elsewhere. That goes against the spirit of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus spoke about the colour and tourism attraction of country markets.  In this Bill casual trading refers only to trading in areas to which the public has access as of right, in other words, if a country market is held in a church hall or a community hall, or in another place to which the public does not have access as of right, it is not governed by the provisions of this Bill.  Even if it were and the country market was held in a traditional area of the town, and Deputy Mattie Brennan referred to the market in Tubbercurry, there is nothing to prevent a county council from exempting this area.  This Bill gives to local authorities the power to make up its own mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern referred to the problems in existing designated casual trading areas and what their status will be in the context of the enactment of this Bill.  We can more usefully deal with this on Committee Stage, but there will be transitional arrangements to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the application procedure for obtaining licences.  These will be issued by the local authorities in accordance with the regulations.  While we will deal with these in detail on Committee Stage many Deputies have expressed concern about the way in which applications will have to be made and about whether a distinction will be made between the seasonal casual trader who trades in one commodity, such as fish, and the professional casual trader who moves from one place to another. I will address these issues in considerable detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> Like previous administrations, the Government, because it wants to widen the tax base, in issuing licences to run a pub or to act as a book-keeper, adheres to the principle that those who wish to engage in economic activity from which they will derive their main source of income have to be in the tax net.  Like everybody else in the tax net, they will benefit from the provisions in the tax code in terms of exemptions and if engaged in business activity they will be able to offset their running costs against profits.</P>
    <P>At the request of my party colleague, Deputy Costello, I met the casual traders in Moore Street whose concerns were articulated eloquently by Deputy Gregory in this House.  Given their socio-economic background they do not have the same resources as the professional casual trader operating in a modern business environment.  I am not concerned only about those who trade in Moore Street but also about those who trade south of the River Liffey in Thomas Street, Camden Street and parts of Meath Street who hold their pitch because of tradition rather than because of a licence issued by the local authority or a decision to get involved in business.</P>
    <P>For this category the application procedure will be the least of their problems. It is their perception that they will encounter difficulties in respect of the tax clearance certificate.  I have noted the concerns expressed by members of my own party and others.  Some people are worried about the requirements they will have to meet in terms of book-keeping to qualify for a tax clearance certificate and about who will mind them once they are told to wander through the corridors of Dublin Castle to seek out the sympathetic revenue commissioner to allay their concerns.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to take Committee Stage in this House until I am satisfied that I will be in a position to answer these questions.  An official of my Department met with a deputation from the Casual Traders Association yesterday, 28 March &mdash; I was not available to attend the meeting &mdash; at which they raised the following <Col N="1715" /> issues: the question of tax clearance, fee guidelines, the display of casual trading licences and, rather interestingly, the establishment of a tribunal at national level to resolve disputes between a casual trader and a local authority, particularly a casual trader who may be operating in a number of local authority areas and who believes he did not get a fair hearing from the local authority.  I am not adverse to this concept but I would like to examine the implications.  This could be administered in conjunction with the Association of Municipal Authorities, for example, as I want to retain the principle of decentralisation and local councillors being involved.  If we can allay the concerns which have been expressed by casual traders and allow the local authorities to be involved I will be open to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Casual Traders Association also suggested that the local authorities should be obliged to provide proper facilities for casual traders, for example, toilet and washing facilities.  The response of local authority members will be to ask who will pay for these facilities? Local traders who pay insurance and rates to the local authority are obliged under commercial and labour law to maintain safety and hygiene standards for their employees and the public.  Casual traders should be required to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Given the number of court cases, that dissatisfaction has been expressed by the local authorities and concern has been expressed to me directly by casual traders about the way they are being treated by one local authority as against another, the system has not been operating satisfactorily. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the 1980 Act and to give local authorities the power to decide how this activity should be conducted at local level.  I do not see central Government having an intrusive function in this matter; it will have a role to ensure fairness. I do not think the local authorities are so devoid of intelligence or creativity as not to be able to come up with imaginative ways to accommodate different kinds of traders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> We are talking here about the romantic side of casual trading &mdash; the Molly Malone syndrome &mdash; but there is a less romantic side as mentioned by Deputies McCormack, Bell and others.  It would appear that there is a certain kind of casual trader who arrives on market day but does not sell products such as home made products or vegetables but rather electrical goods, clothing and other commodities in direct competition with established traders.  It has been alleged and argued by established traders who have their rights that they compete on unfair terms.  There is no evidence that they pay any tax to this State; in some cases vehicles are registered in another jurisdiction. We must strike a balance between the needs of the commercial retail community, who make the only direct contribution by way of commercial rates to the revenue of existing towns, and those of existing casual traders.  We must also recognise those in traditional street markets in Dublin, Cork and other places who got much publicity because of points made by Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the contributions.  I am open to considering amendments and clarifications of regulations that are part and parcel of the legislation.  For that reason I suggest that we do not take Committe Stage for a number of weeks, with the agreement of the Whips.  I will have further consultations with interested parties to consider what changes and amendments could be brought in by me on Committee Stage, and I will be open to suggestions that might arise from all sides of the House in that respect.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act was a considerable advance on earlier legislation.  However, following representations from a number of quarters that Act was seen not to be working satisfactorily which led to the drafting of this Bill, also in consultation with interested parties.  Nobody seriously questions the principles of devolution and decentralisation, but fears have been expressed about how it will work.  Let us look at those fears about possible consequences.</P>
    <P>For the first time the activities of casual traders are being brought into line with <Col N="1717" /> those of anybody else seeking a licence to carry on business here by requiring some form of tax clearance certificate appropriate to the trade in which they are engaged.  Subject to that principle being accepted I am prepared to look at the detail of such clearance certificate and if necessary, in advance of the enactment of this legislation, have consultations with the Revenue Commissioners so that they understand what the parameters of a tax clearance certificate would be.  I do not want to put anybody &mdash; certainly not a legitimate trader &mdash; out of business because of legislation but I make no apology to those forced out of business because they want to continue to trade but not to pay tax.  I hold no brief for such people, nor do I think anybody in this House does. However, I invite the House to participate constructively in this debate and I will certainly not bring in legislation that will have an effect that I do not intend.  I am, therefore, open to amendments and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the neglect of our archaeological heritage in the Sligo area, an area highlighted in recent surveys as one of the richest in monuments and sites.  As a total of 4,500 such sites and monuments were in County Sligo in recent surveys, the neglect of that area is regrettable.  A primary example of that neglect relates to Knocknashee Hill Fort in south County Sligo, the third largest hill fort in the country with 30 hut dwellings dating back to 1000 BC and a megalithic passage tomb dating pehaps to the year 3000 BC.  This has been described as a prehistoric proto-town, possibly a major socio-economic, political and tribal centre of the day in the province. There are no signposts indicating the location of the site.  Once reached, there is no information about it.  I accept that the Office of Public Works has an extremely good record and I commend its officials for the work, but they have fallen down in this area.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news about the Knocknashee Hill Fort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in regard to the Armada wrecks found off Streadagh strand in the early 1980s?  Some of the finest Armada artefacts can be found under the sand a short distance out to sea.  I accept there are legal problems in that regard and I commend the efforts of the Minister and his predecessors, to ensure that those artefacts remain the property of the State.  It should be possible to reach an agreement whereby work can begin on taking up the 59 cannon and establishing an Armada museum and a regional folk museum in the area.  This is Yeats' country, a short distance down the strand from Lissadel House, beside Drumcliffe and in the shadow of Benbulben. A museum located in that area <Col N="1719" /> would be a major attraction for tourists. The Minister of State is familiar with the area and will probably become more familiar with it in the next few weeks and months as he campaigns to get further away from Donegal than he is at present.</P>
    <P>This Bill originated from the discovery of the Derrynaflan hoard and I concur with the Minister that there should be no loophole preventing all treasures discovered becoming the property of the State.  One of the saddest things I ever witnessed on television was the man who discovered that treasure celebrating with champagne following the first court case which ruled in his favour.  Fortunately, the decision of the Supreme Court was different and under this legislation we are underpinning the fundamental finding of the Supreme Court in the Derrynaflan case.  We should leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all treasures found belong to the State.</P>
    <P>The discoverer of the Derrynaflan hoard may not have been entirely to blame for the introduction of this legislation. The National Museum, perhaps because of lack of finance or attrition, was parsimonious in the rewards it offered for handing over discovered treasures. The finders of the Moylough Belt &mdash; one of the great treasures in the museum found in a bog outside Tubbercurry &mdash; received only a few pounds. We were too tight fisted and the National Museum, for whatever reason, was not prepared to offer proper rewards for such finds.  In contrast, during my term in office, when the National Museum came under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, in one week we found a satisfactory solution to the discovery of the Lough Kinale book shrine, another of the great treasures in the museum.  The finders were satisfied, the museum was happy with the payment made and all the legalities were wrapped up within one week of the treasure being discovered by a diver in a lake in the Westmeath-Longford area.  With common sense on all sides it is possible to reach amicable agreements.  The general perception <Col N="1720" /> among the public is that such treasures rightly belong to the State.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the staff of the National Museum have been dedicated, and work against the odds.  Regrettably the museum has been neglected by the authorities. The structure under which the museum is governed has been inadequate. The museum was merely an appendage to and an afterthought of the Department of Education.  While the Minister of the day attended the great ceremonial occasions when treasures were exhibited or to be transported abroad, little recognition was given to the museum and the institution was allowed to fall into decay.  The board of visitors, the institution governing the museum, was given no power and no cognisance was taken of its excellent recommendations. Will the museum be under the control of the Department of Finance or a board of governors, like the National Gallery?</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has acquired Collins Barracks for exhibition space.  In the past there was a lack of exhibition space in the artistic and culture areas but that problem has been resolved in Dublin by the acquisition of the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and recently Collins Barracks. Around the country excellent centres have been made available for museums and galleries.  We should now concentrate on the use to which they should be put.  The Minister should ensure that all the artefacts under the control of the National Museum will be displayed in a lively manner, using modern technology, in the various centres around the country. The Minister should not break up the great national collections but that should not prohibit the establishment of regional museums in Tipperary, Sligo, Galway, Donegal or other counties.  Departmental policy should be directed towards establishing such museums.</P>
    <P>Our national folk collection, one of the greatest in western countries, has never been exhibited.  It has been stored in boxes for 50 years behind ten to 12 foot high walls in the former Dangan reformatory. I presided over the opening of some <Col N="1721" /> of those boxes.  Due to the enthusiasm of collectors in the past that collection comprises four to ten examples of each type of artefact.  It would be possible to maintain the national collection and also to display collections in regional folk museums.  Presentation is important in the establishment of such museums. Modern techniques should be used and craftsmen should display their skills and work on the museum site.</P>
    <P>The Minister should establish regional museums which will benefit our heritage and our tourism industry.  Nothing is more attractive to foreign tourists and to Irish adults and school children than a well presented folk museum.  If the Minister is successful in this area I would be pleased to see an interpretative centre built in his honour.  There is great potential in that area and I urge him to concentrate on developing it.</P>
    <P>I have outlined what could be achieved in Sligo by the establishment of a folk museum and an Armada museum.  Sligo is a significant historical area due to its association with Yeats and is close to Lissadel, Ben Bulben and Drumcliffe.  It is one of the richest counties in respect of monuments with 4,500 sites listed.  Some, like Carraroe, are famous and Knocknashee Hill Fort is one of the great hill forts in the country and an area that should be well known but is not.  It requires immediate attention by the Office of Public Works.  If folk museums were established in Sligo and Donegal it would benefit the north-west region and tourists would flock to visit them just as they do the Céide Fields in Mayo.  I support the Bill which puts into legislative form a clear, unequivocal right to our heritage and provides for action against those who would seek to diminish it.  It is a worthy Bill and I am pleased to have contributed to it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on introducing it.  In future years this legislation will be viewed as an <Col N="1722" /> important administrative landmark in the identification, acquisition and preservation of our national heritage for this State and its people.  The Minister stated that the judgment by the Supreme Court paved the way for this important legislation in relation to the establishment of the right of the State to the ownership of important objects of antiquity or objects of archaeological interest of national importance.  The legislation outlines the State's obligation to protect and preserve our heritage.  The proposed restrictions on possession, sale, exchange or disposal of an archaeological object found in the State after the enactment of the Bill are welcome.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the power of the Commissioners of Public Works to gain access to national monuments and the rare need to resort to compulsory purchase highlights the need for legislation on occupier's liability.  It is essential that our people should have ready access to sites of national importance, but the rights of the landowner over whose property people may travel to gain access should be protected.  The fear of some landowners should be eased at the earliest possible date and I urge the Minister to pursue at Government level the need for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to introduce that necessary legislation with delay.  I realise that the legislation may be somewhat complicated and technical but I urge him to treat the matter with the utmost urgency.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has given the Minister and the Minister of State the opportunity to address the regional imbalance that has occurred in the establishment of art and culture centres throughout the country.  Everyone should have easy access to arts activities in all parts of the country.  Throughout the country it is realised that the arts contribute significantly to local economies and it is essential that approved facilities be provided nationwide.  The Arts Council in its Capital Programme for the Arts 1994-1997 identified the lack of capital investment as being a major barrier to necessary growth in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> I take this opportunity to request the Minister, when allocating Structural Funds, to redress the regional imbalance in the arts infrastructure and particularly to take into account the need for investment in Border counties.</P>
    <P>The identification by the Government in 1987 of tourism as a potential growth area for employment was timely and successful. The response of 65 per cent of holidaymakers to this country that they visited historical places while in Ireland underlines the importance of our heritage and the need to preserve and enhance it. The primary aim must be the retention of our culture and our national identity. The sites, artefacts and monuments provide for us and for future generations a mass of invaluable information.</P>
    <P>There is need for a greater regional spread of cultural facilities.  I welcome the development of a new county museum in Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan.  Many artefacts of importance from County Cavan are stored in the National Museum and I hope that when the museum opens in that town it will be possible to return those objects to the county.  Cavan County Council is to be commended on its initiative in commencing this project which will enable items of local and national importance to be preserved for the county in a permanent facility and will result in considerable enhancement of the area, thus contributing to the local tourism industry.  With the growing importance of tourism for job creation, it is essential that cultural facilities such as museums are provided to attract visitors. Mr. Wallace, Director of the National Museum, is committed to the enhancement of the museum and I believe he will do his utmost to facilitate the transfer of objects of particular interest and importance to the county museum in Cavan.</P>
    <P>One item that lies outside our jurisdiction is the great Mace of Cavan which was sold at auction in Dublin in 1967 and is held in the Ulster Museum in Belfast. My understanding is that this Mace was returned to the original donor's family and subsequently sold at auction.  That great Mace was presented to the Corporation <Col N="1724" /> of the Borough of Cavan on 29 June 1724.  I hope the Minister will negotiate with the relevant authorities in Belfast for the return of this item to another part of the province of Ulster, namely, County Cavan, when the county museum opens.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation should result in an increase in the number of sites and monuments to come under the care of the State.  There are many places of major historical interst in County Cavan, but, unfortunately, only four are classed as national monuments: the Church and Round Tower at Drumlane where the first monastery was founded in the early Christian period; the splendid Romanesque doorway built into the modern Church of Ireland Cathedral of St. Feidhleimieh, Kilmore, County Cavan &mdash; that doorway was removed from an early monastery on Trinity Island in Lough Oughter; the Double Court Cairne at Cohaw and Clogh Oughter Castle.  There is a need to take into State care Trinity Abbey on Trinity Island, Lough Oughter, County Cavan.  In recent years there has been contact between the owners of the land in question and the Office of Public Works in regard to the property.  I urge the Department or the Office of Public Works, whoever is responsible, to make a realistic offer to finalise these negotiations.  It is essential that this site of major national importance is taken into State care without further delay and preserved as a national monument.</P>
    <P>Trinity Island is the site of an early monastery and may have been the site of the Cathedral at Kilmore.  In 1237, the Prémónstrátensian Canons established a community there and an interesting ecclesiastical history leads up to the 17th century.  Trinity Abbey has long association with the O'Reillys who were the Chiefs of Breffni and the nearby Clogh Oughter Castle which was one of their strongholds.  Trinity Island is situated about six miles west of Cavan town and it is thought that St. Feidhleimieh trained for the priesthood there in the 6th century. Subsequently he was to become the patron saint of Kilmore.  The rich history <Col N="1725" /> associated with this island, with the presence of the Canons Regular of Saint Norbert and the O'Reillys and the sacking of the Lough Oughter Priory by the Cromwellians is ample reason for its inclusion under State care.  Thankfully, the sacking of the Lough Oughter Priory did not deter the Canons Regular of Saint Norbert from coming back to Cavan 400 years later, when they established a community at Kilnacrott, County Cavan.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and the Department officials on their work in framing this Bill.  I am confident that it will contribute significantly to the retention, preservation and development of our rich cultural values.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is an important step in copper-fastening the State's authority over our national heritage, whether it be in the form of archaeological objects, monuments or sites of archaeological interest.  I am glad the Bill encompasses a wide degree of control over parts of our national heritage that are of paramount importance to the nation.  If one travels to the Middle Eastern states of Turkey, Greece and Israel one realises that those countries have protected their heritage, archaeological sites and objects of interest.  It is vital that all nations ensure that objects of archaeological and heritage interest are protected for posterity.</P>
      <P>The onus is on the Minister and his Department to ensure that sufficient attention and financial backing is provided so that archaeological objects which are buried underneath the soil are recovered for the enjoyment of our citizens and of the millions who will visit this country in the future.  Treasure trove underneath the ground is a loss to the nation.  Every effort should be made to ensure that all venerable objects of past generations are displayed and maintained for the benefit of our citizens and visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for people such as Michael Webb and his son Michael Junior, who, on Sunday, 17 February 1980, discovered the Derrynaflan hoard, archaeological <Col N="1726" /> objects, monuments and sites of archaeological interest would never be discovered. People must be congratulated for the effort, time and attention they put into the work of recovery of these items. I urge the Minister not to introduce legislation that would make more difficult recovery work on such items.  It is vital that enthusiasts who are willing to pursue the discovery of archaeological objects are encouraged so as to ensure our heritage is preserved.</P>
    <P>Section 7 states that a member of the Garda Síochána, may, without warrant, seize and detain a detection device found in or at the site of a monument.  Will the Minister clarify how those who use metal detectors are to be treated?  In some cases they are treated worse than subversives or drug dealers.  No allowance is made for those who use such objects as a hobby. People who use metal detectors are doing their best to ensure that treasure trove is unearthed.  If it were not for this hard work very few finds of archaeological importance would have been made.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify why people who use metal detectors are deemed to be guilty until proven innocent?  Why does the law use terms which are so vague that any interpretation can be put on them?  What exactly does the term &ldquo;in the vicinity&rdquo; mean?  The definition of &ldquo;an archaeological object&rdquo; is so wide that it could mean an object of any age.</P>
    <P>It is utter nonsense that people cannot get a licence to use a metal detector in an area of no known archaeological importance. Many of these areas could, through the good work of these people, become historically important.  Many areas of archaeological importance will go undetected if people are not given licences to use detectors.  We would not have known about the importance of the Céide Fields if it had not been for satellites.  The Minister should adopt a more flexible attitude to the use of metal detectors.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 (1) (b) provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may without warrant seize and detain &ldquo;any diving equipment which he reasonably believes is about to be used or has been used in any waters protected by an underwater <Col N="1727" /> heritage order made under section 3 (1) of the Act of 1987&rdquo;.  I am not happy with the limitations proposed in this section. The power given to the Garda Síochána under this section is unrelated to any offence in the Principal Act.  It is similar to giving the Garda Síochána the power to seize a car simply because the driver was seen entering a pub, even though that driver was drinking Kaliber.  It is wrong to empower a garda to seize diving equipment merely became he believes an illegal act may take place.  It is not proper to give the Garda powers on the basis of supposition.  Apart from drug related and terrorist offences, there is no similar provision in our criminal legal code.</P>
    <P>We have a limited number of ports and harbours and divers may unintentionally dive into a section of water close to an underwater heritage site.  Under the Bill such divers can have their equipment seized.  The 1588 Armada wreck, the <i>San Marcos</i>, lies off Quilty Pier and Mutton Island in County Clare.  Will it be an offence under the Bill for divers to enter the sea in this area?  The Minister must clarify the point before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Antique dealers and coin collectors will find it very difficult to operate if the definition of &ldquo;an archaeological object&rdquo; is so wide.  The Garda will be able to confiscate diving equipment if divers dive in a lake which has an underwater heritage site.  The media has been manipulated to give the impression that thousands of people are using metal detectors to pillage sites of archaeological interest.  Has anyone asked the National Museum the number of metal detector users on its list?  The law makes no provision for people who use metal detectors as a hobby or those involved in meaningful projects.  The proposed arbitrary powers being given to the Garda, based on an individual's subjective belief, are draconian.  The Minister must re-examine this section to ensure it is not discriminatory.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (4) states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall impose an obligation on the Director to pay a <Col N="1728" /> reward unless he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>This is a very naive provision.  I should like to see included in the Bill a provision which would make it mandatory on the director to pay a reward if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. There is an obligation on the State to compensate people who spend their time trying to detect very valuable objects which lie underneath the ground.  There is also an obligation on the director to pay a reward to the person on whose land an archaeological or historical object was found.  It is vitally important that the Minister includes in the Bill a provision which will make it mandatory on the director to compensate an individual or individuals who have allowed their land to be used for archaeological purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Office of Public Works will be able to carry out the obligations placed on it under the Bill without adequate finance.  The Government is playing a game of hide and seek in this Bill.  The Minister is laying down the rules and regulations appertaining to historical and archaeological objects. Such objects must be preserved and the Office of Public Works must be given a free hand in carrying out the obligations placed on its doorstep by this Bill.  In effect, due to a lack of finance the Office of Public Works has been muzzled in its efforts to ensure that objects of archaeological and historical importance are maintained for posterity.  If it does not receive its rightful share of finance to carry out its functions and to play its part in the preservation of our artefacts and historical monuments, this legislation will be useless.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us are familiar with the axiom <Col N="1729" />&ldquo;nature abhors a vacuum&rdquo;.  Justice abhors a vacuum also and this Bill is brought before the House in an attempt to fill an unconscionable vacuum in the laws affecting families.  That vacuum specifically damages and denigrates women.  It also makes a nonsense of claims that equality matters in this society.</P>
    <P>The vacuum is caused by the fact that non-financial contributions such as child rearing and home making, do not entitle a spouse to any share in the family home.  When Government speakers are waxing lyrical about family values, those contributions are portrayed as important but in real terms they are of purely notional value.  The hand that rocks the cradle is not entitled to any share in the family home &mdash; not a room, a wall or a brick.</P>
    <P>Patterns of living are changing.  There are now men among the cradle rockers and home makers and that is welcome, but the vast majority of spouses who stay at home and enable their partners to go to work are women.  Their menfolk bring home the wage packet at the end of the week or month.  Some of his earnings will go towards financing the family home; he may contribute every month to the mortgage on the house.  Women support that but there is no payoff for that support.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Henchy summarised the present state of the law in 1986 when he stated:</P>
    <P>Where the matrimonial home has been purchased in the name of the husband and the wife has, either directly or indirectly, made contributions towards the purchase price or towards the discharge of mortgage instalments, the husband will be held to be a trustee for the wife of a share in the house roughly corresponding with the proportion of the purchase money represented by the wife's total contribution. Such a trust will be inferred when the wife's contribution is of such a kind and size as will justify a conclusion that the acquisition of the <Col N="1730" /> house was achieved by the joint efforts of the spouses.</P>
    <P>Where the wife's contribution has been indirect (such as by contributing, by means of her earnings, to a general family fund) the courts will, in the absence of any express or implied agreement to the contrary, infer a trust in favour of the wife, on the ground that she has, to that extent, relieved the husband of the financial burden he incurred in purchasing the house.</P>
    <P>More recently, in 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that &ldquo;anything that would help to encourage that basis of full sharing in property values as well as in every other way between the partners of a marriage, must directly contribute to the stability of the marriage, the institution of the family, and the common good&rdquo;.  In 1993, as we are all aware, an attempt was made to address this issue.  The Matrimonial Home Bill of that year provided that all spouses, with very few exceptions, were to have a half share in the family home.  This year the Supreme Court faulted that measure.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to understand that the Supreme Court sees the law as a disproportionate interference in the autonomy of the family. The Oireachtas cannot ram a legislative solution down the necks of couples who have freely decided to make arrangements that do not fit into this 50/50 scenario, hence the vacuum of which I spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>There is more leadership in the average playschool than from this strange, oversized Government with its mixture of skittishness and humourless rigidity.  I will return to the issue of non-leadership in a moment but I want to put this Bill in context.</P>
    <P>The significance of this Bill is that it demonstrates lateral thinking; it seeks to approach the real problem from a new and different angle.  The problem is that the role and contribution of the non-working spouse is unrecognised by our system and insufficiently protected by our laws.  This Bill sets out to redress the imbalance by providing that, in any litigation <Col N="1731" /> concerning the ownership of the family home, the courts would be entitled, under section 4, to inquire whether, and to what extent, the non-financial contributions made to a family household had &ldquo;directly or indirectly enabled or assisted&rdquo; the other spouse &ldquo;to acquire or enlarge any interest ... in such property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 empowers the courts to make a decision that the spouse's non-financial contribution will entitle him or her to an equitable share in the family home.  It represents a step forward on one of the objectives of the Matrimonial Home Bill because it says to the spouse who stayed at home, minded the children, if there are any, and generally created a situation which allows her husband to earn money to buy a house, that her actions have enabled her husband to acquire &mdash; or enlarge &mdash; an interest in the family home. By virtue of that contribution, she is entitled for the first time to claim a proprietary interest in that home.</P>
    <P>In making that legislative statement, this Bill elegantly walks a narrow line between two factors.  On one side is the reasoning of the Supreme Court in 1992 which acknowledged that &ldquo;... anything that would help to encourage ... full sharing in property values as well as in every other way between the partners of a marriage, must directly contribute to the stability of the marriage, the institution of the family, and the common good&rdquo;.  On the other side is the need to avoid straying into the area of unconstitutionality by including the element of legislative compulsion in the Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the Supreme Court rationale of 1992, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves that the Chief Justice at that time noted what he dubbed &ldquo;a very common modern habit&rdquo;.  He referred to &ldquo;... the very significant social and other values which are attached to what experience would indicate is a very common modern habit, whereby the parties to a marriage and the parents of a family, by agreement <Col N="1732" /> between them, become joint owners of the family home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a very common modern habit. There is an assumption that the proper and equitable thing to do about the home where they live with their children is to share it and to put on paper a clear and legal declaration of their shared understanding on this issue.  For many young couples that is the situation, but not for all.</P>
    <P>The issue of ownership creates odd throwbacks.  Even today, some men believe that the money they earn by the sweat of their individual brow, is what buys the house and that it should, therefore, be in their name only.  Some young women entering marriage today are naïve enough to believe that since he is earning the money the house should be in his name.  There will be women who can be emotionally blackmailed into not standing up for their rights, who can be persuaded not to find such apparent minutiae important in circumstances in which their spouse seems better able to cope with them, at a time when they are just about to live happily ever after.  What happens when they do not live happily ever after?  Under the provisions of this Bill each partner would have his or her real contribution to the purchase of the family home acknowledged in law.  I use the phrase &ldquo;real contribution&rdquo; because the essence of this Bill is that it does not just count money, it counts the context which allowed one of the partners to make the money that is paid into the mortgage.</P>
    <P>There might be fears that, within the provisions of this Bill, might be lurking an injustice waiting to happen.  For example, take the circumstances in which a couple may have signed themselves into joint ownership.  Could the provisions of this Bill mean that subsequently the courts could assess that the non-financial contribution of one partner &mdash; for argument sake, let us say the wife &mdash; entitled her to less than 50 per cent of the family home?  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the provisions of this Bill could not be interpreted in such a manner.  The provisions of section 4 (3) limit the power to create <Col N="1733" /> an equitable share to an overall cap of a 50 per cent interest in the property.  What that means is that property already in joint names would not be affected, that non-financial contributions could not reduce either spouse's interest in the home or its contents below 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Nor do the provisions of this Bill apply to cases of marital breakdown.  Rather they mean that the power to recognise an equitable share, based on non-financial contributions, exists independently of marital breakdown or judicial separation. Where a couple have no intention of separating but where, for example, there is an issue of succession rights, the present position would not obtain, that present position meaning that the non-financial contribution of a spouse is partly recognised only by the legal share provision of the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being proposed by the Progressive Democrats in the interests of justice, of equity but, above all, in the interests of equality.  What is strange is that the Progressive Democrats should have to take this action or fill this vacuum at all because, when this Government was joined together in an unholy partnership, it invented a whole new Department of Equality and Law Reform.  On the face of it this did not appear to be such a bad thing.  I would have thought not a bad thing at all, because we have a grossly unequal society.  It does not appear to be so unequal if one is young, male, monied and able-bodied but, if one is getting older, if one has a disability or is poor and if one is a woman, it appears fairly unequal.  We have equality legislation but it is driven largely from Europe.</P>
    <P>There are many laws on the Statute Book that speak to an Ireland no longer exists.  We have a need for a great many laws covering aspects of life that speak to the Ireland that does exist as we move towards the end of this century.  If we had a real, live Minister for Law Reform we felt things might change for the better. At the time the Progressive Democrats hoped so because we are not cynics; we are willing to give the benefit of the <Col N="1734" /> doubt.  We are not credulous but, having seen what might be called the rampant idealism of the Labour Party in Opposition, we though it would be interesting to see them in Government, and it has been very interesting.  Many times, for the wrong reasons, as Deputy Seán Haughey pointed out in a bijou example of the pot calling the kettle black, the Labour Party got into nest-feathering in a big way once given the chance.  What does it matter if a few nests are feathered when there will be £8 billion worth of readies to feather everybody's nest, to fill everybody's pothole, extend the DART up everybody's front path, train everybody to a level of skill that will be the envy of competing nations?  Eight billion green bottles hanging on the wall.  If one billion green bottles should accidentally fall, there might even be seven billion left, or there might not be.  This Government's arithmetic is not so hot.</P>
    <P>The one thing the Government does have &mdash; and it does not have £8 billion to play with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The one thing this Government does have is a plan, a Programme for a Partnership Government.  One cannot miss it because, everywhere one turns, there are references to it.  Whenever one tunes in to radio programme and hears a Minister speak, particularly a Labour Party Minister, one will know what it is about even if one has not heard the introduction.  All such interviews begin by stating that whatever factory it is they are opening or whatever grant they are distributing is a delivery on their promises in their Programme for Partnership Government.  There appears to be a fear we are not paying attention to how closely their work is following the homework plan they set themselves.  The only problem is that the great visionaries who dreamed up this homework plan did not factor in the possibility that all circumstances might not remain the same. <Col N="1735" /> That is not logical.  Once one reaches the age of reason one knows that things change, for example, that a law may be found to be unconstitutional.  In that case it is the duty of the Government to find a method of advancing their expressed policy that takes account of the changed circumstances and of the unconstitutionality of the law.  Unfortunately, we have just witnessed circumstances in which that has not happened.</P>
      <P>This Government supposedly is committed to a divorce referendum and to putting in place, in advance of that referendum, a corpus of legislation which would ensure that the people can vote on this major issue without fears being drummed up in relation to property, succession rights or anything else.  Were this Government genuinely committed to getting the divorce referendum right, when the Matrimonial Home Bill was found to be unconstitutional it would have moved clearly, cohesively and confidently to fill the vacuum, thereby ensuring that this gap in our legislation would not be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Minister, and the Government as a whole, behaved as it something unseemly had happened, that it was really better not to talk about it.  Over the past few months the Minister &mdash; and I have challenged him many times on this &mdash; seems to have been endeavouring to drop the whole issue and pretend it does not matter.  Never mind now that that Bill was positioned as one of several qualifying steps which would allow voters to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to divorce with an easy mind.  Suddenly that essential prerequisite does not exist any more, yet its absence does not appear to be important to the Minister or the Government.  I cannot remember much of an input from the Minister on the issue since the Supreme Court judgment was handed down.  When I think of pictures in the papers over the past few months what springs to mind are those of Ministers announcing the siting of new factories, the old story of positive photo opportunities, X marking the spot where jobs will be created.</P>

      <P>There are no photo opportunities in regard to the thousands of spouses left without legislative acknowledgment of their contribution to the purchase of the family home.</P>
      <P>This is a Government that can produce press releases in handfuls but not on this crucial issue.  It can haul in the best legal advice for all sorts of purposes, yet has not come up with any legal solution to this problem.  Maybe that is because it is not in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  When it comes to divorce, we do not have Ministers, Labour Ministers in particular, jostling with each other to come on the airwaves to announce how much progress they are making.  They are not making any progress. Certainly they are not coming up with solutions to people's genuine concerns, not coming up with interesting examples from other countries worth emulating.  They are not fighting back when the notion of divorce, plus women's liberation and anything else that can be added to the argument to falsely weight it, is slammed by a bishop.  They are not responding sensitively or creatively to emerging problems.  Does that mean that divorce is no longer part of the Programme for a Partnership Government? Does that mean that we should forget about equality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party seems happy that all the noises it made in Opposition, and the generalities of the programme, will protect it from having to deliver in any real way.  Their Ministers seem convinced that how they are perceived is more important than what they actually do &mdash; faith rather than good works.  Never mind equality &mdash; feel the myth.  They presented us, in particular the women of Ireland, with a package of legislative reform, all leading as logically as the alphabet to an orderly divorce referendum.  Yet when one crucial letter fell out of that legislative alphabet they presented it half-heartedly as if it were a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo;, as if it were not important.  They reacted as if it were no longer within their control <Col N="1737" /> or influence.  It is worth stressing at this point that it is neither outside their control nor influence but I am beginning to believe it is certainly outside their interest, that it is being left to the Opposition to come up with the legislation that will make sense of this complicated, sensitive area.  We are happy to do that.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats take democracy as seriously as it deserves, that includes giving credit where credit is due.  Recently, the Minister for Justice, showed herself to have courage and openness and did not adopt rigid positions to prove a point; she accepted amendments to legislation.  The Government could learn from that type of openness and approach this Bill in a spirit of openness and flexibility.  There are two good reasons for this.  First, because this is a good and problem solving Bill, and, second, if the Government is serious about divorce it needs this Bill to allay the fears and suspicions of so many women in Ireland.  The question is whether it is serious about divorce.</P>
    <P>Our efforts in recent times to have all-party discussions on the issue met with a blank refusal.  Our party leader, Deputy Harney, requested this many times on the Order of Business.  An objective answer to the question of whether the Government is serious about divorce is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, it is not being taken one step further. If the Government was serious about divorce the two parties in Government in a unified and cohesive way, would be outlining the priorities of the campaign in speeches since this is an issue affecting every constituency.  The parties should be setting out to persuade undecided voters to vote affirmatively in the referendum.  There has been a conspicuous absence of such activity.</P>
    <P>Ministers are making announcements and performing official openings every day but none of them on any of these public occasions avail of the opportunity to talk about the divorce issue.  It appears there is not a chance of that happening. The reason is that to talk about divorce would actually require moral courage, something which is in short supply on the Government benches.  Moral courage is <Col N="1738" /> shown by ownership.  What I mean by this is that if you ask people in the street who is proposing the divorce referendum and who is pushing it they will look at you blankly.  It simply will not occur to them that it is the Government who are &mdash; theoretically &mdash; committed to winning a referendum on divorce.  There is no evidence to support the notion that the Government is committed to winning such a referendum.</P>
    <P>Every now and then people talk in similes about moving chairs on the deck of the <i>Titanic</i>.  I hope the House will allow an extension of that metaphor.  It seems that the Government owns a ship called the &ldquo;divorce referendum&rdquo;.  It commissioned the ship and told everybody that it was a safe and seaworthy ship.  It must be remembered how it was claimed the <i>Titanic</i> was unsinkable.  Having done that, the Government then found the ship had hit an iceberg.  That was when the key aspect of the Government package was found to be unconstitutional.  That iceberg tore the bottom out of the boat and knocked for six the idea that the ship was safe and seaworthy.  What happened then?  Did the Government rally round and fix the ship so that all the passengers continued to feel comfortable on board?  On the contrary, the good ship, &ldquo;divorce referendum&rdquo;, continued to drift along in no particular direction without a navigator and nobody at the wheel.  It continued to take water.  The crew was nowhere to be seen, some seem to have climbed on to the iceberg and floated off somewhere else.  However, one thing is clear, the good ship, &ldquo;divorce referendum,&rdquo; is not being captained, navigated, or crewed, it is adrift, low in the water and I cannot see anyone manning the pumps.</P>
    <P>The electorate are entitled to ask what is going on and, as a Member of the mystified Opposition, I am entitled to speculate.</P>

      <P>I suspect that one of the <Col N="1739" /> things going on is the European elections. Moral courage in any Government party goes down in direct relation to how electorally exposed that party is at a given time and right now both Government parties are considerably exposed.  Lowest common denominator politics has broken out with candidates being vigorously assertive on absolutely safe issues and ignoring anything which is not cast iron guaranteed predictable.</P>
      <P>The divorce issue is not cast iron guaranteed predictable.  There is no safety in this issue which is why it requires moral courage and political maturity. Moral courage means facing up to the realities of Irish life at this time in our history and political maturity means not hiding behind circumstances.</P>
      <P>The realities of Irish life are that we have a substantial &mdash; not a huge &mdash; minority of married couples who cannot and will not continue as a couple and who wish to be legally freed to establish families with other individuals.  This is not a fashion.  This is not an impulsive, whimsical pattern that can be changed by a lash of back to basics mega-morality.  This is change, permanent change.  Those of us lucky enough to have found happiness in our marriages might wish that everybody could be as lucky, conscious that this wish, if fulfilled, would mean that we did not need divorce.</P>
      <P>I am always wary when I hear phrases such as &ldquo;family values&rdquo;, because something inside me doubts the sincerity of their use.  I have never heard a really happy family talk about family values and I have never heard a politician speak along these lines without having that coppery taste in the mouth that comes from something being wrong with the chemistry. Whatever about something being wrong with the chemistry, there is certainly something wrong with the logic when people suggest that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the divorce referendum will &ldquo;open the floodgates&rdquo; and create overnight a divorce culture.  The reverse is more likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter where you go in Ireland there are failed marriages.  Each of us <Col N="1740" /> has a friend, or several friends, whose marriages have failed.  Most of them, exemplifying the old saw about hope triumphing over experience, want to marry again; to publicly and legally make a statement about the validity of their second relationship and second family. They cannot do that.  They have to go to other countries and have to cope on a day-to-day basis with all of the humiliating bureaucratic hassles a society without divorce legislation puts in the way of second families.  There is some notion that this supports marriage.  It does not.</P>
    <P>An affirmative vote in the referendum and proper divorce legislation here would not only not create an instant divorce culture, it would make decent sense and show society's respect to individuals and couples who are marginalised into some limbo of the separated.  All of what I am saying should have been heard &mdash; and heard regularly &mdash; from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, because there are few inequalities that are so patently obvious, and so created by the inadequacies of our laws, than the completely false inequality of not being entitled to marry again under Irish law.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister has led no charge on this nor has his party.  They hoped to get credit for pushing the great rump of Fianna Fáil towards divorce: see us, little Lilliputians, fearless and liberal, pushing Gulliver ahead of us.  Somewhere along the line, they lost faith in what they were doing and Gulliver has always had his doubts.</P>
    <P>I would go further and accuse the Government of two profound failures. One of those failures is its complete inertia in the face of finding that what was perceived as a key aspect of its programme was unconstitutional &mdash; the inertia that has left the Progressive Democrats introducing this Bill.  The second is the failure to stand up to those who are setting out to frighten people away from divorce.</P>
    <P>Within the past few weeks, an archbishop in a pastoral letter said that divorce would, &ldquo;undermine stable family life&rdquo;.  No Government member moved to challenge this untenable claim.  That <Col N="1741" /> same pastoral letter moved decisively into the day-to-day administrative issues of the State, rather than staying on the moral issues of the faithful.  Among other things, its author threatened the nation with increased social welfare charges if divorce was introduced.  That is not what I would expect a bishop to concentrate on.  Did the Minister for Social Welfare or anybody else on the Government benches deal with this issue?  No, it was a case of head down and say nothing.</P>
    <P>We think we have developed moral courage in the past 20 years.  We laugh about old episodes of crozier-flailing: that was way back at the time of the incident concerning the nightdress on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  This is about an issue affecting the dignity, the children, the hopes, the fulfilment and the contribution of individuals and couples throughout this nation.</P>
    <P>Now we have a bishop supporting his moral stance, to which he is absolutely entitled, with highly questionable fiscal allegations and the silence from the Government is deafening, at a time when the Government is supposedly putting forward a divorce referendum and running a campaign to help us all make the right choice.</P>
    <P>That silence is a disgrace.  Someone in Government needs to spell out the financial and social welfare implications of divorce legislation.  The financial consequences of marriage breakdown must be faced and divorce must not be allowed to be blamed for all of these financial consequences.  They follow, inevitably, on the breakdown of a relationship between a man and a woman, not from divorce <i>per se </i> which just allows for remarriage and a formal dissolution of a union.</P>
    <P>Not only did a Minister not establish these facts but no Minister had the courage to point out that the Church grants a number of annulments every year in Ireland, that those annulments mean that, so far as the Church is concerned, the two people involved are not married, that they were never legally married, under Church law in the first place, that when one takes account of the number <Col N="1742" /> of Church annulments in the past 30 years, one realises there are hundreds of people who, according to the law of the Church, are now entitled to marry and start again, that divorce legislation would permit those people to get on with their lives but that the bishop is condemning divorce legislation.  Nor did any Government Minister complain about the reference in the pastoral letter to &ldquo;an extremist movement from women's liberation that can also injure the family&rdquo; by &ldquo;its promotion of an exaggerated view of the self-sufficiency of wives&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Government has decided that this is one campaign it will not win easily and there will be less embarrassment later if nobody takes a courageous high profile right now or does anything noticeable in the way of creative thinking; let the Opposition show courage and tease out the issues.</P>
    <P>I do not know about the rest of the Opposition, but the Progressive Democrats are deeply unhappy with the unchallenged myth that is growing up that divorce legislation is an attack on the family, largely driven by addicts of the &ldquo;liberal agenda&rdquo;.  Divorce legislation is not an attack on marriage or the family.</P>
    <P>The Government, by virtue of its majority, is in a position to give almost risk-free leadership on this isssue but it is giving no leadership at all.  It is allowing bogey-men to be created like the notion of an instant divorce culture.  A nation does not suddenly develop a culture because of the passing of long overdue legislation or because a referendum succeeds. At the moment we have a culture of deceit and despair on the issue of marital breakdown which conceals the truth. It is time we grew out of that culture and that this House behaved with dignity and with vision.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to do the job it is supposed to do.  If the Government says it wants the voters to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in a referendum, then the Government should show us which of the overseas models provide an example of the worst &ldquo;divorce culture&rdquo; and which give us the best example of support for families in trouble, primacy of concern for the needs <Col N="1743" /> and rights of children, and the supportive taxation and social welfare arrangements to ensure that women do not come badly out of divorce, as is undoubtedly the case in many countries.</P>
    <P>For a divorce campaign to be successful, we must be absolutely sure that we have all the mechanisms in place to support marriage and especially children. There is no indication that the Government has either the openness, vision, or legislative competence to put all those mechanisms in place before the referendum, and there is every indication that, as a result, it will be all too easy to frighten people by parading the worst scenarios which see Ireland as socially disrupted and financially bankrupt.  This process is already under way, unchallenged by the Government.</P>
    <P>The lack of vision, clarity and courage by the Government on this issue is likely to have two effects &mdash; one long term, one short term.  The long term effect is the loss of the referendum.  The short term effect is that, in the forthcoming elections, the divorce issue will degenerate into an unthinking and polarised slanging match in the interests of shortsighted political gain.  No politician will gain from that.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, in bringing this Bill before the House, are conscious that it is oddly archaic.  It seems ironic that after 20 years of waiting for a joint ownership in the family home to be secured for women, it is only to be bestowed to wives by the Matrimonial Home Bill, as it were, in the mouth of a divorce referendum.  For very many women contemplating divorce, this new Bill will reassure them of their equal status in marriage and it is good for those women who are currently in good marriages to feel that they have a share in the collective wealth of the family.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that, in many cases, the family home is the main asset of a family and acknowledgment of ownership gives recognition to wives and mothers.  This is one of the items, of course, which the Minister had on his pre-divorce agenda since the legitimate <Col N="1744" /> uncertainties of many people on this matter at the time of the last divorce referendum were obvious and significantly contributed to the defeat of the referendum.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that such a major plank be achieved in the run up to divorce.  The perception is that we need this new Bill. It is a practical, thoughtful yet speedy response to a problem which might well sink the divorce referendum &mdash; perhaps it is too speedy for the Government judging by what the Taoiseach said today. It is brought before the House by the Progressive Democrats as a clear indicator of our belief that both marriage and divorce must be based on principles of equality and must not thoughtlessly infringe upon the rights of either party.</P>
    <P>We believe that a yes in the divorce referendum will be a generous, mature and informed acknowledgment of human and demographic realities and will help to create an Ireland which values both individuals and the family.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes a considerable way towards allaying the fears of many women who saw the Matrimonial Home Bill declared unconstitutional and looked to the Government for a way out of the mess.  What we are putting to the Government is sane and secure.  Within the context of the divorce referendum there should be a legislative framework in place.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill designed to deal with court disputes between spouses in relation to the matrimonial home.  It purports to empower the courts in such proceedings to give recognition, where the need arises, to non-financial contributions by spouses to the acquisition of the matrimonial home.</P>
      <P>The Government does not propose to accept the Bill because it would have no practical effect on the law in this area which already contains comprehensive provisions for distribution of ownership of family property between the spouses based on non-financial considerations such as working in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before turning to the serious defects <Col N="1745" /> in this Bill, I want to address the divorce issue.  I do so because of the probability that some Opposition Deputies will attempt to link that issue with this Bill, as did Deputy Keogh.</P>
    <P>In recent days, there has been a great deal of talk in the media and in other places about the so-called &ldquo;liberal agenda&rdquo;.  One is supposed to believe, on the basis of at least some of this commentary, that it is not possible to be concerned with issues that involve pluralism and tolerance, and at the same time to be concerned about the need for more jobs and tax reform.</P>
    <P>There are, it appears, some who believe that the &ldquo;liberal agenda&rdquo; constitutes a set of obsessions, rather than issues, which so preoccupy the Government that it cannot attend to its normal business.  That is just rubbish.  All of the issues involved in the liberal agenda have their right and proper place in the scheme of things, and are properly open for public debate and action.</P>
    <P>One of these issues, obviously, is divorce. To listen to some of the critics, one would think that the Government's intention was to ram change down the throats of the people in order to turn Ireland into a suburb of Reno, Nevada. This kind of analysis is utter rubbish. The Government is committed to moving towards a situation, through the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce, whereby people whose marriages are irretrievably over will secure the opportunity to remarry, provided certain reasonable conditions are met.  Those conditions must and will include protections for children and spouses.</P>
    <P>Although the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 was part of the Programme for Government, and was part of a series of law reform measures which the Government intended to introduce, and although it had the backing of all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas, it was not part of the legislative programme regarded by the Government as essential in advance of the referendum on divorce. Nor could any further measure to achieve similar ends be regarded as essential prior to the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> The reason is simple, but it seems to have eluded some people on the Opposition benches.  In marital breakdown, the courts have power to make an order known as a property adjustment order, which can transfer an interest of one spouse in any property, including the family home, to the other spouse.  Therefore, regardless of whether the family home is jointly owned or in the sole name of one spouse, the courts have jurisdiction to protect the dependent spouse by giving that spouse a part or full interest in the family home.</P>
    <P>This is the law of the land in separation cases under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  It will be extended to cases of nullity and foreign divorce by the Family Law Bill, 1994. If and when the divorce referendum is passed, legislation will be introduced to extend the power to make property adjustment orders to divorce cases.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a few facts about the Government's approach to the divorce referendum, in view of the cloud of misinformation under which the Opposition is labouring on this issue.  The Opposition would do well to recall that if it chooses to play politics with the divorce issue, it will have to take responsibility for the consequences.</P>
    <P>The Government is entirely united behind the divorce referendum, which is a fundamental commitment of the Programme for a Partnership Government, to which both Government Parties fully subscribe and is putting in place a detailed plan of administrative and legislative measures preparatory to that referendum. Much of that work has been done; the remaining measures will be put in place shortly.  Preparations are on course for the referendum, and the Government will not be deflected from its task.  The Government's programme of family law reform culminating in the divorce referendum is already in the course of being implemented.  The matters being advanced are the Family Law Bill, 1994, expansion and development of the legal aid system and of mediation services and increases in funding of counselling services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The Family Law Bill, 1994 now before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is one of the most extensive family law legislation measures to be initiated in recent times.  It has measures aimed at protecting and safeguarding the institution of marriage and it provides substantial powers to the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown in certain cases.  Those powers will in substance be the same as the powers in any divorce legislation and they include wide powers in relation to maintenance, lump sums and property generally, including the family home and pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has already secured £5 million as grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board in 1994 which will allow the board to open ten new full-time and four new part-time law centres this year.  This unprecedented expansion will result in every county having either a full-time or part-time law centre in 1994.  The legislation to put the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has also secured £300,000 for the development of the Family Mediation Service and he will be announcing his proposals in that regard shortly.</P>
    <P>A provision of £750,000 has also been provided for the assistance of bodies involved in marriage counselling to enable them to expand their counselling services.  The Minister shall allocate that money very shortly to the relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government has made important decisions on the tax and social welfare aspects of marital breakdown.  It has agreed: (a) that property transfers between spouses whose marriages are dissolved following divorce or are annulled should be dealt with on the same basis as transfers between spouses; and (b) that the necessary changes in social welfare should be made to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as <Col N="1748" /> a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced or annulled.</P>
    <P>The remaining measures required in connection with the divorce referendum are being worked on actively and will be put in place shortly.  Two working sub-committees of the Government have been established to ensure that the technical and political aspects of the measure will be worked out in sufficient detail to enable the people to take a decision on the right of remarriage, in full possession of all the facts, well before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The details of the tax and social welfare decisions referred to will be spelled out in statutory form, and there will be further legislation on enforcement of maintenance orders and to put the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis.  The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment of the Constitution on divorce will, as they must, be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill in the House.  The date of publication of that Bill will, to a large extent, be determined by the date on which the Government proposes to hold the referendum and it is the Government's intention to proceed with the necessary legislative framework as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has already indicated to the House that she is examining the court services.  In the course of that examination she will have the benefit of the Consultation Paper of the Law Reform Commission which has just been published.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Government has a detailed plan of action leading to the divorce referendum.  It has already invested enormous work in putting that plan into place and will continue to do so.  That plan is on course for the referendum. The Government is united behind that plan, and it is very much hoped that the Opposition can have the grace to recognise that, and to support our common objective, to lift the absolute constitutional bar on the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> There is no similarity between this Bill and the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993. The object of the Matrimonial Home Bill was to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home and contents unless they already had those rights.  It proposed that the home and contents be held by both spouses jointly so that if one spouse died the other would become the sole owner of the joint interest.  The Bill was supported by all political parties, family law groups and the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the policy of the Bill had been supported by successive Governments. The Bill applied equally to both spouses.  Spouses who had no ownership interest in the matrimonial home would have gained joint ownership and spouses who were sole owners of such homes would have lost sole ownership and become joint owners with the other spouse.  The Bill was regarded as having particular implications for women who worked by looking after the home or caring for the family.  The decision of the Supreme Court was that the Bill was unconstitutional.  It is a decision which has been met with great disappointment by many people who supported the Bill, not least those mainly affected who, for the most part, would have been non-owning spouses who worked in the Home.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House can possibly doubt the commitment of this Government to the cause of family law reform or to the principle of partnership in marriage and in marital property.</P>
    <P>The idea of automatic co-ownership of the family home first emerged in the report of the First Commission on the Status of Women as far back as 1972. After 21 years of waiting, after reports from the Law Reform Commission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, and the Second Commission on the Status of Women, it was this Government which finally introduced the Matrimonial Home Bill and saw it through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In light of the adverse Supreme Court decision, and in view of the complex issues of law involved, I would have thought that all sides of this House would accept the <Col N="1750" /> need to proceed in a considered and careful way in this matter.</P>
    <P>Instead, what do we get?  As recently as Wednesday of last week.  Deputy Michael McDowell intimated to the House that he intended to make suggestions regarding matrimonial property by way of proposed amendments to the Family Law Bill, 1994.  Some time between then and now the issue has become, in his and his party's mind, a measure that is so urgent that only one day's notice of it can be given to the Government.</P>
    <P>On the principle of the Bill, I would remind the House that at Question Time on 22 February 1994, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform intimated to the House that he was sympathetic to the idea of legislation providing for the valuing of work in the home by a spouse, but that the matter required the most careful consideration.  I can assure the House that the matter has received and will continue to receive careful and sympathetic consideration by the Minister, but there is nothing to be gained and everything to be lost by neglecting the careful analysis of the legal and practical issues which would have to precede any proposals for change in this area.</P>
    <P>If the Government believed that a ready alternative to the Matrimonial Home Bill was possible the Government would be only too happy to promote or support such an alternative.  The fact is, uncomfortable though it may be, that no such ready alternative exists.  The Bill now before the House fails to add anything meaningful to the law as it already operates in this area and could lead to considerable uncertainty and confusion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is misconceived and is based on a misunderstanding of the law as it already operates in the area of family property.  It is being put forward as a modest proposal and as one to protect the non-working spouse.  I have to be cruel to be kind and say that the measure is neither modest nor protective.  It is a complete non-event and is bereft of any meaningful protection.</P>
    <P>It is, I fear, a measure born of political expediency.  I understand that some spokespersons of the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1751" /> Party have, since the decision of the Supreme Court, expressed the view loudly that notwithstanding that decision, there is still much more that can be done by legislative means to give recognition to the work of spouses in the home.  They have been critical of the Government for not acting quickly enough to do something about the matter.  At least we now know what the Progressive Democrats had in mind when they gave the impression, not for the first time, that they had all the answers.  This Bill completely flatters to deceive and is in no way acceptable as a measure protective of spouses' work in the home.</P>
    <P>I now propose to set out the background to and the reasons for rejecting this Bill.  In Ireland, ownership of property has always been a complex matter and has often given rise to strong feelings. For many people, the most significant piece of property they will ever own is the family home.  Not surprisingly in matrimonial disputes the home is often the focus of the most intense emotions. There is general support for the view that joint ownership of the matrimonial home is socially desirable and is to be encouraged. When the Matrimonial Home Bill came before the House, that support translated itself into widespread approval for both its intended purpose and the way in which it attempted to achieve that purpose.</P>
    <P>In its decision on the Bill, the Supreme Court accepted that the provisions of the Bill were directed towards encouraging the joint ownership of matrimonial homes and that such an objective was clearly an important element of the common good conducive to the stability of marriage and the general protection of the institution of the family.  The court went on to hold that the right of a married couple to make a joint decision as to the ownership of a matrimonial home is one of the rights protected by the Constitution and that its exercise is an important part of the authority of the family which the State guarantees to protect. According to the court's decision, the <Col N="1752" /> provisions of the Bill did not comply with the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>The implications of the Supreme Court's decision have been carefully examined by the Government.  It was clear that the judgment went to the root of what the Bill was trying to accomplish and that it would be no mere matter of adjusting the Bill in some point of detail in order to make it conform to constitutinal requirements.  Accordingly, the Government decided not to proceed with an amended version of the Matrimonial Home Bill or with any measure based on it.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to think that the various protections now in place, most notably under the Succession Act, 1965, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, have been adversely affected by the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Government is actively examining the ways in which these protections might be strengthened and affirmed.  This does not mean that the Government no longer believes in promoting the concept of equality of ownership rights in the matrimonial home.  If meaningful reform in this area is to be attained, any legislation must secure a real and tangible interest for a non-owning spouse in the matrimonial home.  If this were not to be the case, any legislation would lack credibility.</P>
    <P>This lack of credibility is very evident in the legislation now before this House. Essentially, all that it is saying is that in the case of applications brought under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, which allows the courts to determine property disputes between spouses, the courts will, in declaring that a spouse has a benefical interest in the family home, be empowered to take into account the non-financial contributions to the family household of that spouse. Such a measure is clearly of very limited use, if any, in the normal marriage situation. The explanatory memorandum openly admits that the Bill is designed for the situation where there is litigation concerning the ownership of the family home and, in consequence, it acknowledges <Col N="1753" /> that the Bill is a very modest proposal.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, section 12 of the 1957 Act was frequently used in a situation of marital breakdown where one or both spouses wished to establish their ownership rights to any property. The Act provided a mechanism for this by way of a court declaration in relation to such interests.  In other words, the Act offered a way in which disputes about property which arose between spouses could be resolved by way of court intervention but, with the advent of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the procedure under the 1957 Act is no longer being availed of in many cases.  This is hardly surprising since the 1989 Act contains substantial property adjustment provisions which ensure that the needs of a dependent spouse and children can be given full recognition by the courts.</P>
    <P>The contribution of a spouse in looking after the home and caring for the family is an important criterion to be borne in mind by the court.  This is spelled out clearly and unmistakably in the 1989 Act. As Deputies will be aware, the Family Law Bill, 1994, which is before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, having recently passed Second Stage in the House, retains this important reference to work in the home.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics on the property adjustment provisions show that over the last two years a total of 1,822 decrees of judicial separation were granted and a total of 1,316 orders relating to property were made in respect of those decrees. The orders included 515 property transfer orders, 518 orders for residence in the family home, 150 property settlement orders and 122 orders for sale of the family home.</P>
    <P>The court, in making property orders relating to the sale of the family home, is most likely to order that the net proceeds of sale be split evenly between the parties. Where an order is made transferring legal title from one spouse to another or giving residency of the family home to one spouse, usually a mother with dependent <Col N="1754" /> children, to the exclusion of the other spouse, it is usually the case that a declaration is made by the court at the time of making such an order that each spouse will have equal beneficial ownership in the home.</P>
    <P>The statistics which I have given indicate the importance of the property transfer provisions in the context of separation.  Those provisions are being extended to cases of nullity and foreign decrees of divorce, separation and nullity under the Family Law Bill and will, in time, become even more important.</P>
    <P>I am putting some emphasis on this point in order to make it clear that it is my belief that this Bill does little to address the ordinary needs of a couple whose marriage is stable and who, in the normal course of events, would not contemplate litigation in order to resolve a matter so personal to them as the ownership of the family home.  Were matters to reach a stage where litigation was contemplated, the reality is that it is likely that the marital discord would give rise to a judicial separation action and, in that context, it is already well within the power of the courts to provide for an equitable property settlement.</P>
    <P>A fundamental problem with this Bill is that it proposes court intervention as the only way in which a spouse who works within the home can obtain a beneficial interest in that home.  The Matrimonial Home Bill sought to remove the need to demonstrate a contribution to the marriage in order to acquire an ownership stake in that home.  Joint ownership flowed as a right from the fact of the marriage relationship.  The Private Members' Bill not only restores that notion of contribution but openly invites spouses to litigate on the matter.  That approach is, arguably, inappropriate where a marriage is not in difficulties. The Bill could be viewed as likely to give rise to marital disharmony.  If a couple cannot reach an agreement between themselves on joint ownership of the family home, the invocation by one spouse of court jurisdiction in this area could give rise to considerable family tensions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> This Bill will not give rise to any changes whatsoever in those provisions in the law which already recognise the work of spouses in the home.  The guidelines given to the court under the Bill lack precision and are vague in what they purport to achieve.</P>
    <P>A striking absence from the Bill is any express mention of the main circumstance which presumably gave rise to the Bill, namely, the recognition which should be given to spouses who work by looking after the home or caring for the family.  The Bill also fails to mention what should happen in the event that spouses have already agreed or that spouses agree on a division of ownership of the family home.  It could be argued that the Bill as it stands would conflict with the test laid down by the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill regarding disproportionate interference with the rights of families to make decisions having regard to Article 41 of the Constitution. Before any interest can be established, an expensive court action would be necessary under the provisions of the Bill.  The interest would take time to establish and, in a situation where one is talking mainly about contributions which are not monetary in nature, the precise share in the home to which a spouse is likely to be entitled may well be uncertain.</P>
    <P>One may argue that these same features are also present in the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and in the Family Law Bill provisions which replace them.  In those instances, one is talking about marital breakdown where it is appropriate to make final and definitive provisions in relation to property matters.</P>
    <P>Here, one may well be talking of a valid and subsisting marriage where the same features may not be appropriate at all.  If the parties were amenable to jointly owning the family home, it could be done under present arrangements and, while conveyancing fees might apply, stamp duty and the normal registration fees would not.  Clearly this Bill would be of relevance only where the spouses could <Col N="1756" /> not agree on such ownership.  In such circumstances, any court action might well be contested and any future relationship between the spouses would almost inevitably be impaired.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very short on detail.  Section 4 is the key provision.  However, that section is only of assistance where a spouse has enabled or assisted the other spouse to acquire or enlarge a legal or equitable interest in the family home.  The common situation here would be in relation to a mortgaged property where the work by one spouse of parenting and household management facilitates the other spouse in making repayments on the family home.  The section would have no application where the property was acquired by way of gift to a spouse, a frequent situation in the context where the family farm is transferred to a member of the younger generation or where it was inherited under a will on intestacy.</P>
    <P>This is a section that bristles with anomalies. A couple could have lived in a family home for ten or 20 years and because one spouse had received it by way of gift and was the sole legal owner, the other spouse, if that spouse worked solely within the home, would have no stake in its ownership under this Bill. However, should a mortgage be raised on that property, for whatever reason, those household contributions would suddenly assume a degree of relevance under this Bill, although no other circumstances would have changed.</P>
    <P>There are few in this House who could regard this as being a totally satisfactory response to the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 the court is asked to determine &ldquo;the extent of a spouse's non-financial contribution to the family household&rdquo;.  In this and in other matters the section is extremely vague.  On making an order under section 4 it would, it appears, be open to the court to make any number of subsequent orders.  There is nothing finite about the court orders. They could, on application to the court, be changed to vary the value put on work in the home.  It seems to be the intention that a spouse who gets an equitable <Col N="1757" /> interest of 10 per cent in one year may return in a few years time to get a fresh declaration and so, progressively over time, build up to an equity stake of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises is whether the Bill places a premium on marriages of a particular duration so that a few years of marriage must exist before a court action can even be thought of.  Is a special premium to be put on cases depending on the number of children in the family?  Are the courts going to have to keep records on that basis to ensure that spouses with one child do not get a greater stake than those with two or three?</P>
    <P>The Bill caps non-financial contributions at 50 per cent.  Under the current law, as it has evolved on financial contributions there is no such cap.  I am not clear what the situation would be where an individual claims simultaneously under this Bill and section 12 of the 1957 Act and some clarification of that in the Bill is surely necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill may also have serious implications for conveyancers and the normal sale of family homes.  Given the very limited time for examination of the Bill I cannot comment on this matter in any great detail other than to say that conveyancing could become complex and difficult and this could result in delays and expense for couples.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act of 1957, on which this Bill rests, is being repealed and re-enacted in extended form by the Family Law Bill, 1994.  It is rather odd that no reference to this is made in the Explanatory Memorandum. There is one consequence of that change to which I would, however, draw the House's attention.  A child of a deceased spouse is being given a right to recover money or other property or its equivalent to which that deceased spouse was entitled and which has, or may have, gone out of the ownership of the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, would it be open to such a child to raise the question of a trust in relation to non-financial contributions over a period of years and would the <Col N="1758" /> court then be in the invidious position of hearing conflicting evidence from a parent and child as to the extent of such contributions by the deceased parent?</P>
    <P>There is a final net point in this Bill relating to the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in the context of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  The view taken was that there was no need to proceed with the amendment which had been contained in the Matrimonial Home Bill since it was intimately linked with the definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; itself. However, the matter can be looked at again and if the need for change suggests itself, it can be done in the context of the Family Law Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, for the reasons I have given, the Government is unable to accept this Bill.  The Bill presents itself as a contribution to the process of law reform.  It is nothing of the sort.  It will have no appreciable effect on the rights of spouses who work in the home.  It is, quite frankly a half-baked measure which shows every sign of having received little thought and every sign of having seen the light of day on the back of an envelope. The issue of family law reform is too serious to be dealt with by way of amateurish efforts such as this.</P>
    <P>Many in this House will be surprised, if nothing else, about the solemn defence being made for a Bill which first made its appearance on the Order Paper of this House only this morning.  I am unsure as to whether this signals an end to the Progressive Democrat's wish to see Bills on the Order Paper for two weeks before debate, or they merely wish to have an exception for publicity stunts of their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few items of proposed legislation which are all bad. Usually it is possible to find something good to say about them, and so I waited in anticipation to see what the Tánaiste had to say that was good about this Bill. Eventually we got it when he said in the context of the definition of a dwelling: &ldquo;However, the matter can be looked at again and if the need for change suggests itself it can be done in the context of the <Col N="1759" /> Family Law Bill&rdquo;.  That was all he could find to say in favour of the Bill.  I am surprised by that and I do not agree with his blanket dismissal, irrespective of the origins of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Keogh on her initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  I welcome what she has done.  My one point of agreement with the Tánaiste relates to the amount of time we have had to consider it.  Possibly if the Tánaiste had had more time he would have had more to say in favour of the Bill.  I too would have liked more time and possibly I would be able to say even more in favour of the Bill.  Be that as it may, I welcome this effort to ensure that non-financial contributions, unwaged work such as home making and child rearing, will be taken into consideration when assessing ownership of the family home. I see this as a basic principle of civil rights and I wonder how this injustice has been tolerated for so long by society and by us in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one casts one's mind back, as one does more frequently as one gets older, one wonders how it was possible for any of us to tolerate the circumstances in which women found themselves not so very long ago and, indeed, the circumstances in which so many women find themselves today.  I remember a time, not that long ago, when some women, particularly in rural areas, were considered less of an advantage than the animals on the farm.  They cost more to feed sometimes than the animals.  That is an attitude that was all too prevalent. Women were involved in hard and boring work involving great drudgery and inequality, and anything they did in terms of rearing the family, looking after the home and, in many instances, a farm as well, was not taken into consideration. They could spend a lifetime doing that sort of work and not be recognised as having any ownership in the family home. It is strange to recognise that we had a society which was tolerant of that.  In many instances, that has not changed very much.  Fortunately, there are fewer such cases than there were in previous <Col N="1760" /> years but there are still cases of that attitude to women and to women's work. Anything that can be done to change that and bring us into the 21st century ought to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an effort to do in another way what the Supreme Court prevented us doing in the Matrimonial Home Bill and it specifically attempts to avoid the element of legislative compulsion, the main rock on which the Matrimonial Home Bill sank.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister for Equality and Law Reform stated that &ldquo;the Supreme Court judgment struck down what was, in effect, the central principle of the Bill, namely, the establishment of the matrimonial home as the norm within marriage&rdquo;.  I hope we will be able to enshrine that norm in legislation.  I am concerned not only about the civil right of equality of ownership, although that is a serious concern.  There is another matter involved.  The bricks and mortar of the Matrimonial Home Bill, and equality of ownership of those bricks and mortar, was a symbol of equality in marriage and in society.  That symbol is important because if there is equality in that respect it is possible to have equality elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform indicated his problem with this Bill by stating that &ldquo;in light of the Supreme Court judgment the Government has already announced that there is no alternative legislative route which can safely be taken to achieve a broadly similar result&rdquo;.  The proposers of this Bill obviously believe there is an alternative legislative route and that the Minister is mistaken.  What advice did the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs take in relation to his remarks this evening and, more specifically, what alternative advice did the Minister seek in relation to the constitutional implications of the Matrimonial Home Bill?  Presumably he did not seek constitutional advice on this Bill because he is elsewhere and could not do so.  The Chair need have no fear that I will stray into turbulent waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been very turbulent waters in recent times on this issue.  Clearly, the advice given on the Matrimonial Home Bill was incorrect as the Supreme Court struck it down.  Was alternative advice sought?  I have never been a great believer in the concept of infallibility.  Even the Pope's infallibility is being questioned.  I have not read Fr. Joe Dunn's book but I have read some extracts from it and heard interviews about it on radio and there seems to be a serious question in regard to infallibility. Members responsible to this House should not be above criticism.  If recent advice has turned out to be incorrect the individual or individuals involved should not be above criticism.  I leave that thought with Members as I skirt these turbulent waters.</P>
      <P>Why was the Matrimonial Home Bill considered so important when first introduced? I did not have direct responsibility as spokesperson on equality and law reform at that time, but I noted the Minister did not say it would not matter if we did not pass this Bill or if it were found to be unconstitutional.  He talked about a necessary stepping stone on the way to other things, otherwise we would be caught, not in turbulent waters, but in the middle of a river with nowhere to go. The Minister told us this was a necessary stepping stone, very important legislation on the road to a divorce referendum and legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his criticism of the Bill, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs at least illustrated how complicated this issue is and the importance of having these matters clarified before dealing with legislation or a referendum.  That was very useful.  He made a number of interesting points, but his comments did not appear to be of interest to the Government parties, one in particular.  The second in command in this Government, namely, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Labour Party, came into this House with three Labour Party supporters.  One would have <Col N="1762" /> expected more members of the Labour Party to support their Leader, particularly as he is standing in for an absent Minister.  I am delighted to note that with ten minutes remaining in this debate a member of the Fianna Fáil Party has entered the House.</P>

Does the absence of Members opposite not indicate a lack of commitment among the Government parties, particularly among Fianna Fáil members in regard to this legislation and other legislation about which the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs used the phrase &ldquo;the liberal agenda&rdquo;?  I noted the number of times the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs thought it necessary to state that the Government was united on this issue.  He stated that the entire Government is united behind the detailed plan of action leading to the divorce referendum.  If the Government is united behind that plan such unity was not demonstrated in the House or on any occasion when matters relating to &ldquo;the liberal agenda&rdquo; were discussed.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste stated he would like to put on record a few facts about the Government's approach to the divorce referendum in view of the cloud of misinformation under which the Opposition is labouring.  He said if the Opposition chooses to play politics with the divorce issue it must take responsibility for the consequences.  Is that the Tánaiste getting his retaliation in first or are those words not so much directed at the Opposition but at Deputies on the Government's backbenches?  No Deputy on this side has shown any indication of wanting to play politics with that issue, it is one to which every Deputy on these benches is committed.  We do not wish to play politics because we know the harm that will be done if this legislation and the referendum fail.  It will take a number of years, probably ten, before we reach this stage again, if ever.  We can all play politics but not with such a fundamental issue when the effect will create such tragedy.  We do not wish to do that and I hope the Government parties will not do that either.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste is correct in referring to the cloud of misinformation.  I was not active in politics in this jurisdiction when the last referendum was held when this was a matter of controversy but I am aware that misinformation played a large part in its loss.</P>

      <P>Such information must be cleared up this time, otherwise it will have a similar effect.  It is up to the Government to ensure the public will have proper information well in advance of the referendum to enable them to make up their minds and counter information should be circulated to deal with misinformation.  I hope that will be the case but to date it has not happened.  The Tánaiste stated that preparations are on <Col N="1764" /> course for the referendum and the Government will not be deflected from its task.  I sincerely hope that is the case. I will take it on trust and not question it further, but I will refer to it later if that does not turn out to be the case.  I hope Fianna Fáil backbenchers note that.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform had already secured £5 million as grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board in 1994 which will allow the board to open ten new full-time and four new part-time law centres this year, that such unprecedented expansion will result in every county having a full-time or part-time law centres in 1994.  It is pathetic that this is hailed as a major announcement.  The Tánaiste stated further that the legislation to put civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing is at an advanced state of drafting and will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sound a cautionary note by referring to a case I dealt with.  I have had experience of divorce and civil legal aid in another jurisdiction.  One of the first constituency cases I dealt with as a young MP in the mid-1960s related to legal aid for divorce.  A couple visited my advice centre in Cookstown and told me of their problems.  They were not married to each other.  The man had been married in 1942.  As was the case in the war years there was not a big reception after the wedding and the man and his new wife ended up in a pub in Cookstown.  Too much alcohol was imbibed and in the course of the conversation his wife told him she was expecting a baby but that it was not his.  The man told me when he heard this news that he went to his home and his wife to hers.  He said the reason he had come to me was that &mdash; to use the phrase &mdash; the wife took up with another man, the husband took up with another woman, the wife had nine children and the husband had eight.  The husband had applied for legal aid three weeks previously but was turned down on the basis that the couple could not show just cause for applying for legal aid for a divorce at that time.  The authorities wished to save money and were afraid the floodgates <Col N="1765" /> would open.  In 1965 or 1966 one had to prove the necessity for legal aid to apply for a divorce, which was not the case in 1942.  Those constituents never voted for me because of the tradition in Northern Ireland.  However, I managed to obtain legal aid for them for a divorce and I was thanked but I doubt if I got a vote.  I hope a similar situation will not arise in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the Bill in that it does not go far enough and make up for the 50:50 ideal contained in the Matrimonial Home Bill, but it is a step in the right direction and Fine Gael will support it in the lobbies.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter for discussion and I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to my case.  Most right-thinking people and myself welcomed the additional amount of money made available in the last budget for community employment schemes.  We were pleased that additional places were to be created to enable a larger number of people to find work in these schemes. That proposal held out great hope for many people, particularly those in the long term unemployed category.  The case I make this evening is on behalf of people who are precluded from working on such schemes, specifically married women who, by virtue of the fact that they are not signing on, are debarred from participation in the schemes.  I ask that the live register requirements be changed to enable women currently not signing on to be eligible for inclusion in the recently announced CEDP schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of married women stopped signing on when equality legislation was introduced in 1985.  At that time they saw no good reason for continuing to sign on because they did not <Col N="1766" /> anticipate that any benefit would follow. In the meantime, a number of developments in the training-work area have opened up fresh opportunities.  The part-time nature of this work is particularly suited to women working in the home who want to combine work outside the home with the carrying on of their family duties.  The extension of the work carried out from what was previously mainly heavy, outside work to work of a clerical, administrative, caring or organisational nature makes the new schemes much more suitable to women.</P>
    <P>Ironically, much of the work previously done by women in the community on a non-payment, voluntary basis is, under the CEDP scheme, being offered to men for a wage.  This is a clear case of inequality and it should be remedied. I welcome the recent changes brought about by the Minister and his Department for lone parents.  They represent a marked improvement on the previous system.  However, it makes no sense that many married women who have completed back to work courses are precluded from taking on the work on offer under these schemes.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Press</i> today the Minister said that an additional 1,000 people will benefit from the back to work schemes announced by his Department last October. The next logical step is to ensure that married women not signing on and hitherto working in the home will be enabled to find work under the CEDP schemes.  I know hundreds of women with small family budgets who are trying to make ends meet and these women would greatly benefit if they were allowed work under those schemes.  The extra money would certainly remove many families from the poverty trap.  I appeal to the Minister to change the position in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Quill is one with which I have considerable sympathy.  The Community Employment Development Programme was one of a number of special measures introduced in the pilot partnership areas <Col N="1767" /> chosen for the area based response to long term unemployment introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and now formalised in the local development programme.  Basically the CEDP involved incorporating a training element into a series of carefully screened social employment type schemes in each of the 12 areas.  The CEDP was widely welcomed as a marked improvement and advancement on the SES both because of the training element and also the inclusion of lone parents among those eligible to participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The CEDP was implemented by FÁS. A new FÁS programme, community employment, was announced in this year's budget.  This will replace the Community Employment Development Programme, the social employment scheme and Teamwork and essentially builds on the experience and strengths of these programmes, most notably that of the CEDP.  The following are eligible to participate: persons 21 years or over in receipt of unemployment assistance; all persons in receipt of unemployment benefit for over one year; all persons in receipt of the lone parent's allowance for over one year; and other special categories for example, referrals by the NRB and persons combining a period on the live register with a period on a recognised programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision for people under 21 years and for Youthreach progression participants will be examined later this year following review of the FÁS-Department of Social Welfare options initiative for school leavers.  Priority in recruitment will be given to the older and longer term unemployed and other groups targeted in area action plans in the designated areas under the local development programme. As a target, 25 per cent of all places will be set aside for the very long term unemployed, that is those over 45 who have been unemployed for three years or more.  In the case of older participants who have been unemployed for more than three years, efforts will be made to provide places for up to three <Col N="1768" /> years.  Community employment will be a key resource in the 33 designated areas targeted for inclusion in the local development programme.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one of the very positive developments is the inclusion of lone parents, who are mostly women, as an eligible category for community employment.  The point raised by the Deputy will be kept under review bearing in mind the objectives of the programme. Given the particular relevance of the Community Employment Programme to the local development programme, and the fact that experience in the partnership areas was so influential, the inter-departmental policy committee on local development also has a particular interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women included recommendations relating to women re-entering the labour market including live register eligibility.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has established a special committee to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the second commission.  The issues therefore, will be given full consideration.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the point made by the Deputy.  Priority has been given to people on the lowest incomes who are long term unemployed.  The scheme was recently extended to include lone parents and there are cases where women in the home who do not have a qualification may become involved.  That is an issue which remains to be addressed and it will be kept in mind in the reviews of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expecting good news from the Minister because since I tabled it this matter has progressed towards a successful conclusion.  The tenants of the capital assistance scheme in Westlands have now been deemed eligible for rent allowance by the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saga of the application of the tenants <Col N="1769" /> through Respond to the health board, which acts as an agent for the Minister for Social Welfare, for rent supplement is a lesson in how not to operate the public sector.  For months the tenants of this lovely housing scheme, for which the people of Wexford are indebted to Respond, have been put through the most protracted negotiations to establish their right to a rent supplement.  Notwithstanding the Department of Social Welfare circular, the regulations issued last year by the Department of the Environment, the fact that a similar scheme in Waterford, which is in the same health board region, had no trouble whatsoever in establishing the right of tenants to a rent supplement, the efforts of the tenants, Respond, inspectors of the Department of the Environment who were sent to Wexford, Threshold, the Irish Council for Social Housing and many other voluntary housing agencies and the South Eastern Health Board up to the level of the chief executive officer, Mr. Cooney, a 34-page file and deputations to the Minister, this saga went on for months, thus stringing out the tenants in terms of their entitlement to rent allowance,.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced on a monthly basis and as the deadline was reached it would be extended for another month. The final deadline was to be Thursday, 31 March.  Last Friday a hand delivered letter from the South Eastern Health Board to the tenants indicated that their rent supplement was safe pending a national review, or words to that effect.</P>
    <P>This saga is a lesson in how not to operate and if nothing else it must concentrate the minds of the public sector in general on the handling of such matters. Why does it take three Departments of State &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, with regulations interacting between them &mdash; to decide whether tenants in a capital assistance scheme in Wexford, built by Respond and completed only last July, should be entitled to a rent supplement? Why were these tenants treated differently from the tenants of similar capital assistance housing schemes, including <Col N="1770" /> those in the South Eastern Health Board area?</P>
    <P>This matter gives rise to many questions and I hope the Minister will be able to explain why it took so long to reach a reasonably successful conclusion to this appalling saga which gave rise to a waste of time, energy and money.  Ministers, health board chief executive officers and county managers were all involved in trying to reach a decision which should have been decided by a simple formula which could be applied nationally.  There is no reason the tenants in this capital assistance scheme should be treated differently from tenants in similar schemes.</P>
    <P>I look forward to confirmation by the Minister that this saga was brought to a conclusion last Friday by the hand delivered letter to the tenants.  Will he indicate how he intends to streamline the supplementary rent allowance scheme and say whether he thinks it is satisfactory for the health boards to continue to operate as agents for the Department of Social Welfare and whether health boards are the best body to determine a fair and accurate rent, which is part of their remit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In some ways Deputy Doyle has explained the complexity of the issue as between the health boards, local authorities and voluntary bodies. This matter needs to be clearly resolved on a national basis.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme empowers health boards to provide a weekly payment to assist eligible persons with their accommodation costs. Under the legislation governing this scheme the determination of entitlement to an allowance and the amount of such allowance is entirely the function of the chief executive officer of each health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for the general direction and control of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and in this regard my Department informed health boards, by circular issued in 1990, that residents of voluntary housing schemes may receive <Col N="1771" /> such assistance subject to the usual criteria for assessment of applications for rent supplement.  The circular pointed out that there is a standing instruction from the Department of the Environment that the principles of the differential rent scheme should be borne in mind in determining acceptable rent levels under the voluntary housing scheme.  It was stressed also that in setting reasonable rent levels voluntary bodies in the social housing area are obliged to have regard to their philanthropic and non-profit nature, to the extent of the State subsidy and to contributions from other sources, such as the general public.</P>
    <P>By way of illustration, the circular indicated the method of assessing reasonable rent which had been agreed by the Eastern Health Board with voluntary housing organisations.  This was included as an example of how one board had approached the question of determining rent levels.  It was not suggested as standard practice nationally because of the differences in rent levels in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The issue of establishing reasonable rent for voluntary housing was raised recently by the South Eastern Health Board with my Department and a review of the guidelines on rent supplementation for voluntary housing is currently being addressed in my Department.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this review, the South Eastern Health Board has decided to continue to pay rent supplements to tenants in the Westlands project using the Eastern Health Board criteria.  I expect that this review will be completed in a matter of weeks and the South Eastern Health Board will be advised of the outcome.</P>
    <P>My Department is increasingly picking up the tab, so to speak, for certain housing matters.  Yet the Department of the Environment has responsibility for this area and the health boards have a say in whatever decisions are taken.  I only cover the general scheme.  I have pointed out the position to them.  Voluntary organisations are looking for moneys which will help them with both their <Col N="1772" /> current and future projects and which will cover maintenance costs, etc.  Different elements have entered into the equation and I have pointed out that in order to sort out the matter we will have to put our heads together, look at what is happening in different health board areas and consult with Department of the Environment advisers.  I hope we will shortly have a scheme which can be applied nationally.  In the meantime the people about whom the Deputy is concerned will be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for State for being present to reply to this matter, namely, the need for the State to purchase the Waller Estate, including castle and fisheries, at Dromore, Kenmare, County Kerry, in order to develop the property for tourism and other job creation purposes in the national interest. This property which appears to be for sale again has not been sold.  When I raised this matter in the House last June I made it clear that the purchase of this property by the State would create employment in the Kenmare-Sneem area of County Kerry.</P>
      <P>This estate consists of approximately 50 acres.  Dromore Castle, which is approximately 150 years old, has been occupied recently and is structurally sound.  More importantly, the Waller estate contains one of the finest exclusive fishing rights in Ireland.  The river system which is ten miles long includes two tributaries also attached to the lands &mdash; one in Dirreendraugh and the other at Kealduff. There are also boating rights of 100 acres in nearby Lough Brin.  These are excellent fisheries with great potential.  The estate also has a half mile of netting rights on the Kenmare Bay estuary and a hatchery is available on the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 17 dilapidated dwelling-houses on the lands which could be made habitable again.  The estate is one of the greatest indigenous resources with the greatest job potential to come on the market for many years.  It has a boathouse <Col N="1773" /> next to the beach in a beautiful environment overlooking Kenmare Bay, with stables attached.  The property could be purchased at a reasonable price and would be a solid investment for the State. Dromore Castle is open for development as a tourism project in a specialist area with good employment potential.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to do everything possible to encourage the State agencies, Bord Fáilte through Cork/Kerry Tourism, the Department of the Marine or the Central Fisheries Board to purchase this property.  There was an agreement at one time that this property should be sold to the Central Fisheries Board and also to an Irish national living abroad but it appears the sale fell through.  At that time Cork/Kerry Tourism made an offer in the region of £800,000 for the property. Cork/Kerry Tourism has great plans for Dromore Castle and it is reasonable to assume that the castle could be separated from the fisheries.  Cork/Kerry Tourism's only interest in the estate was the acquisition of the castle to be used as the world headquarters of Celtic heritage and also to use it as an international heritage centre.</P>
    <P>When they offered £800,000, Cork/ Kerry Tourism had the backing of a private individual who was interested in acquiring the remainder of the estate at the time.  It envisaged disposing of the Blackwater river to the Central Fisheries Board.  I am aware that Cork/Kerry Tourism and the private individual are still interested in acquiring the castle and the lands and intend to proceed with the purchase should they be given an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board is aware that Cork/Kerry Tourism is interested in the purchase of Dromore Castle. Cork/Kerry Tourism, however, has not been contacted by the board.  I trust the Minister of State will do everything in his power to make funding available for this package because the purchase of Dromore Castle for use as the world headquarters of Celtic heritage would be of great economic benefit not only for the Kenmare-Sneem area of south Kerry but <Col N="1774" /> for the country as a whole.  It will create at least 25 full-time jobs with the added benefit to tourism of having the world headquarters of Celtic heritage in the area.</P>
    <P>This property should be purchased now by the State in the national interest. Cork/Kerry Tourism should be allowed to develop the castle for use as an international pan-Celtic centre and the Central Fisheries Board should be allowed to develop the fisheries aspect of this property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West) Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Following inquiries made by my Department, it is my information that the Waller estate is not for sale.  I note the Deputy's statement, however, that it appears to be for sale again and he can be assured that I will make further inquiries.  The most recent inquiry which I have made, however, confirms that it is not for sale.</P>
      <P>The whole question of State purchase of heritage properties is a difficult one. With scarce financial resources the Deputy will appreciate that we must be discriminating in selecting the cases which the Exchequer will support.  It is to this end that the advice of the National Heritage Council has been requested on the criteria which might be applied in assessing buildings for inclusion on a priority list of buildings which the State should acquire.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Waller estate on the basis of the information available to me, this property would not, from the heritage policy perspective, figure on a priority list of buildings to be purchased by the State.  This would not, of course, preclude other interests in the tourism and fisheries fields from purchasing this property.  Dromore is a most impressive two storey, over basement Gothic castle surrounded on three sides by woodland. It stands in a setting of great beauty, has facilities for fishing and sailing and is within a short distance of Killarney, Waterville and Ballybunion golf courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has made a strong case for the Waller estate to be considered for <Col N="1775" /> tourism and fishery purposes and it would appear this is where the future development of the property lies.  I agree that employment could be created, that it is an indigenous resource and that the castle could be separated from the fisheries. The Deputy referred to the importance of this estate as a heritage centre and he referred also to Cork/Kerry Tourism and the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy O'Leary that I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister of State with responsibility for the Central Fisheries Board and to the Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="1776" /> Tourism and Trade with responsibility for tourism.  Despite the fact that I am told that the property is not for sale, I will certainly make further inquiries.  We will seek the advice of the National Heritage Council but it may not be the type of development which would be high on its list.  I can assure the Deputy that at the earliest possible date I will bring the case made by him to the attention of my colleagues in the Department of the Marine and the Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 30 March 1994.</P>

      <P>The car rental sector is an important part of the Irish tourism product.  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to counter the problems of price and availability in the car hire sector.  These included the special grant scheme in 1992, the vehicle registration tax scheme in 1993 and the retention of this scheme this year.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in the 1993 budget in relation to the application of vehicle registration tax in the car hire sector were aimed primarily at addressing shortages in the car hire fleet, particularly in the peak season.  These measures proved very successful in this respect and there were adequate hire cars available throughout 1993.  There is also evidence that they impacted positively on price, in that the increased fleet size led to a more competitive environment among the operators.</P>
      <P>The retention of this feature in this year's budget, combined with the reduction in vehicle registration tax rates, is a very welcome development which will help to maintain the momentum already generated towards making this sector more competitive.  In addition, the general budgetary provisions, such as reduced PRSI rates, aimed at improving the business environment generally, will also benefit the car rental sector.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 39 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should explain that the co-ordination of tourism promotion at regional and county level is the responsibility of the regional tourism organisations.</P>
      <P>The House will already be aware, from my reply to parliamentary questions dated 8 December, 1993, of the agreement which I reached with the regional tourism organisations for reforming the corporate structures of the organisations. As outlined, the regional councils and management committees have been reconstituted and replaced by slimmed down regional boards and new county tourism committees.  The former regional directors will continue to have a major role to play through their membership of the new boards of management and county tourism committees.</P>
      <P>In formulating the new proposals my main concern was to establish a mechanism which would set in place a systematic, co-ordinated and planned approach to maximise efficiency in the administration and development of the tourism product at regional and county level.  Under the new arrangements county tourism committees will comprise representatives from the various membership categories within each regional tourism organisation and include members of those independent voluntary groups and organisations who operate at local level.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for all organisations to work together as effective partners for the benefit of tourism at regional and county level and this can best be achieved through the measures I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>The total financial allocation in the National Development Plan for services within my Department's area of responsibility was about £680 million at 1993 prices.  Deputies will be aware of the decision of the Government to effect a <i>pro rata</i> cut in the amount of EU Structural Funds available to Departments. However, as the Government is still in negotiation with the European Commission on the basis of these revised figures, I am unable at this stage to give definitive figures on what the final allocation will be for my Department.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will appreciate the selection of individual projects to be assisted under the National Development Plan will only take place after the Community support framework and the associated operational programmes have been agreed.  Consequently, it is not possible at this stage to indicate how reduced amounts of EU aid will affect individual projects in the tourism and trade areas.</P>

      <P>There are currently a wide range of support services on offer to assist indigenous industry to promote and develop export markets.  Services provided by An Bord Tráchtála include individual company consultancy work, market research and in-market developmental work, trade fairs, trade missions and financial assistance towards export promotion costs.</P>
      <P>ABT will spend almost IR£40 million, including an Exchequer subvention of IR£34.8 million, on trade promotion activities in 1994, most of which will be focused on assisting indigenous industry. These activities form part of a new six-year market development programme, currently under discussion with the EU Commission in the context of the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999,</i> aimed at increasing exports from Irish indigenous industry by 9 per cent per annum over the period of the Plan.</P>
      <P>Indigenous industry exports rose last year by 8 per cent to an estimated IR3.9 billion, bringing growth in exports to 30 per cent from the sector over the past five years.</P>

      <P>I outlined extensively to the House on 22 March the details of my visit to the United States and subsequently to the Bahamas.  The only St. Patrick's Day celebration I attended was in Washington.  Costs arising from this visit were further set before the House on 23 March.  The Government jet was used throughout the visit.  My itinerary involved engagements in New York, Chicago, Washington, and Hartford in the United States and Freeport and Nassau in the Bahamas.  On the occasion of the visit I was accompanied by the Secretary of my Department, the Government press secretary, the special adviser at my Department, Dr. Martin Mansergh, the head of the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs (US only) and my private secretary, all of whom had a role to play in the various engagements I had undertaken.  For security reasons an officer of the Garda Síochána also travelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For most of the visit I was accompanied <Col N="1560" /> by my wife, Kathleen, with my daughter, Andrea, taking her place for the first part of it.  Normal international standard of hotel accommodation was used throughout, with the exception of Hartford where I was the guest of the Governor of Connecticut at his residence.  In relation to Freeport and Nassau, my wife and I and the delegation were guests of the Bahamian Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that following on two separate studies, one of the benefits to the country of a national conference centre and the second of the most desirable location for such a centre, the site at the Royal Dublin Society was chosen for the proposed development of the centre.</P>
      <P>The gross economic benefits &mdash; discounted to take account of opportunity cost of capital &mdash; to the country of a national conference centre were estimated to be of the order of £60-£70 million over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>The position on the proposed development at the RDS is that the society has not been able to generate the funds necessary to match the European Structural Funds that are available for a national conference centre.</P>
      <P>The RDS proposal is one of a number of proposals that has been received for a national conference centre.  The essential difficulty of matching funding has arisen in every proposal.  The reason for this is that the conference centre is not commercial in itself but there are significant benefits for hotels, restaurants and other tourism-related facilities from the spending of those who come to the centre.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the issues which could provide justification for matching funds are currently being examined.  The Government will then consider the various arguments arising and come to a decision on the matter.  The Government remain committed to having a National Conference Centre.</P>

      <P>There is reason for serious concern at the continuing unstable situation in the Eastern and Southern parts of Sierra Leone which has been the cause of many deaths and the displacement of thousands of people from the region.  As I indicated in the adjourment debate last week the recent killing of Fr. Felim McAllister, an Irish Holy Ghost missionary, by rebel elements is tragic and it highlights the difficult circumstances in the area.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Eastern and Southern regions of the country have been the scene of increased rebel activity caused largely by dissident elements in the Sierra Leone army who have combined with rebels crossing over the border from neighbouring Liberia.</P>
      <P>Last year Ireland donated £30,000 to Christian Aid for emergency assistance for Liberian refugees in Sierra Leone and £25,000 to Trócaire for medical assistance. We have also raised the political and humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone with our partners in the European Union.  Our aim will be, in consultation with our partners, to encourage the Government of Sierra Leone to implement its recently published programme for a smooth transition to democracy within the timetable it has set.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, in <Col N="1568" /> the context of an increased demand from students this year, the Union of Students in Ireland Travel (USIT), sought an increased allocation of J1 visas.  At my request the Embassy in Washington contacted the U.S. Information Agency there and the Council for International Education Exchange in New York to support the request.  I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that the U.S. authorities have responded positively and that an increased allocation of visas is being made available to Irish students; we are awaiting confirmation of the size of the increase.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1994 I have made eight official trips <Col N="1570" /> abroad; the details requested by the Deputy are set out in the table below.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, accounting practices do not provide for a full breakdown in relation to the cost of individual visits.  Moreover, in so far as the most recent visits are concerned, actual costs arising for my Department have not yet been brought fully to account.  It is estimated however that the total travel and related costs of persons accompanying me on all eight visits will amount to approximately £45,000.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to keep the costs of visits to the minimum consistent with the appropriate discharge of my responsibilities as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  On my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I accepted a reduction in the allocation for ministerial travel of approximately 12 per cent for 1993.  This reduced allocation will continue to apply in 1994.</P>
      <P>Officials accompanying me, whether permanent or non-permanent civil servants, do so in order to provide the necessary advice and assistance in the course of the trip.</P>

      <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out drainage works are derived solely from the Arterial Drainage Act, <Col N="1572" /> 1945 and relate to the execution of works by way of comprehensive schemes for the entire river catchment area.</P>
      <P>The Erne river catchment is No. 10 on the priority list of major catchments (catchments over 100,000 acres) in the national arterial drainage programme&mdash; a scheme for that part of the catchment lying in the State and outfalling at Belturbet was prepared in 1970.  The project was not proceeded with on economic grounds as the cost of the works required would have far exceeded any benefits that would accrue from the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s, after extensive investigation, a drainage scheme for the Finn/Lacky catchment and a cross-border sub-catchment of the Erne, was considered as a joint venture with the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland.  However, this too was not proceeded with on economic grounds.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy has in mind the concerns expressed by trade unions representing construction workers that contractors were placing employees on the C45 system in situations where the employer-employee rules should apply. As part of their procedure in auditing taxpayer's returns the Revenue Commissioners would have regard to the necessity for contractors in the building trade to apply the C45 system only where a sub-contracting situation exists.  While statistics are not kept of specific issues arising on audits, the view of the inspector of taxes is that the use of the C45 system where PAYE-PRSI status should be granted has not been an issue in a significant number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current debate appears to suggest that there has been a sudden swing from direct employment to the C45 system. <Col N="1573" /> The Revenue Commissioners have a project under way to check the extent and reality of any movement from employment to sub-contracting.  The issue will also be considered by the Black Economy Monitoring Group who have been given the task of carrying out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the system generally.</P>
    <P>Any necessary action will be taken where incorrect use of the C45 system is identified.  Ultimately this would mean the entry of estimates on employers attempting to apply the C45 system to employment situations where the employers cannot be persuaded to operate PAYE-PRSI voluntarily. However, the Revenue Commissioners cannot unilaterally insist on the imposition of the employment status if the legal reality is that a sub-contracting situation exists.  This matter will be considered in the context of the reviews taking place on the issue.</P>

      <P>A major review of the Ordnance Survey mapping programme was undertaken in 1989, as a result of which the then Minister for Finance instructed that the following programmes be undertaken: an urban mapping programme (1:1000) which covers towns with a population of 1,000 and over.  These maps are now for the most part up-to-date and available in <Col N="1576" /> printed and digital form; a rural mapping programme (1:2500) involving a full resurvey of rural Ireland.  Using the best available technology will enable this project to be completed within a shorter timescale than was originally envisaged; a small scale mapping programme (1:50000) aimed at the tourism industry and comprising 79 sheets.  The programme is on going and is expected to be completed within the next five years.</P>
      <P>As regards satellite imagery, the position is that this technology has not yet been developed to such an extent that it can be used for the establishment of a large scale mapping data base.

      <P>Planning applications were made for a housing development at this site at Rathdown Upper, County Wicklow.  The area proposed for development formed part of a church, medieval settlement and castle site which has been entered in the Register of Historic Monuments, as provided for under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987.  In view of the archaeological potential of the site, the office of Public Works recommended to both Wicklow County Council and An Bord Pleanála that the site be archaeologically resolved, prior to the consideration of any development commencing.  This recommendation was reflected in An Bord Pleanála's decision, on appeal, to refuse planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, the developer has <Col N="1581" /> decided to conduct archaeological testing of the site and his archaeologist was issued excavation licences for this purpose by the Office of Public Works.  The current licence expires on 13 April 1994. Licensed archaeologists are required to submit detailed reports of archaeological excavations to the Office of Public Works within 12 months of the completion of an excavations to the Office of Public Works within 12 months of the completion of an excavation.  In this case it is likely that the developer would submit an archaeological report to Wicklow County Council in conjunction with any future planning application.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that country money is paid to employees in the building trade when they are working away from base due to the requirement of their job.  The allowance is designed to compensate for the travel and subsistence costs associated with working away from home and is covered by an agreement between the Construction Industry Federation and the Builders Trade Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such payments are taxable in the hands of the employee but the employee is entitled to a deduction for actual expenditure incurred.  Frequently agreements are made in advance with the Inspector of Taxes for the payment of such amounts without deduction of tax where the amounts involved no more than reimburse the employee for the actual expenditure incurred.  Such an agreement exists between the Inspector of Taxes and the <Col N="1583" /> building trade.  The allowance is paid tax-free only where the employee is working more than 20 miles from Dublin or in the case of country employees where the distance between site and the employer's base exceeds 30 to 35 miles depending on local agreements.  Persons hired on site or hired for that site alone are not entitled to tax-free payments regardless of where the persons concerned live.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not consider that the system is unduly abused. While statistics are not kept of the reasons for additional charges arising from Revenue audits, action has been taken in a small number of cases where the allowance was paid to persons hired on site or where the allowance was paid when the mileage from base was below the set limits.</P>

      <P>I represented the Government at the many St. Patrick's Day events in Savannah, Georgia, where some 18 per cent of the population is of Irish descent.  The St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah, which is the oldest parade in the US, is one of the largest, next to the New York parade and attracts over 300,000 people. I was accompanied on the visit by my wife and two permanent civil servants, my partnership programme manager and my private secretary.</P>
      <P>The events planned around St. Patrick's Day by Irish Americans afford Government Ministers the unique opportunity to promote the benefits of investing in Ireland to top American businessmen and women.  These visits are fundamentally important in showing solidarity with the 44 million strong Irish American community.  They also represent an opportunity to show Ireland's appreciation of the continuing interest and support of the US in Irish affairs and this year, particularly, its support for the Joint Declaration.</P>
      <P>My programme included several addresses to top Irish American business people and prominent Irish societies and associations.  Specifically, in relation to social welfare, the visit afforded me the opportunity to promote to Irish emigrants the benefits of the bilateral agreement on social security pensions which Dáil Éireann approved and I brought into effect in September last.  This agreement, which among other things allows for the payment of US pensions to returned emigrants here in Ireland, is expected to be worth some $35 million to the Irish economy annually.</P>
      <P>The flight details for the trip are as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1992 Social Welfare Act provided for the assessment of insurable earnings as means for unemployment assistance purposes for all applicants. The preferential treatment previously accorded to claimants with income from insurable employment had its origins in the establishment of the unemployment assistance scheme.  The legislation establishing the scheme provided that persons could have their means assessed while still employed so as to avoid any delay in authorising claims when they suffered a loss of work.  By excluding income from current employment, the assessment reflected the situation that would exist when they became unemployed.  At the time, that was a very necessary provision in circumstances where entitlement to unemployment benefit was very restricted.</P>
      <P>The change in legislation was necessary; firstly, to ensure equity of treatment as between employees and self-employed persons claiming unemployment assistance who have always had their earnings assessed as means; and secondly, in recognition of the extension of insurance cover to part-time employees earning over £25 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-employed persons claiming unemployment assistance have always been assessed with all of their self-employed earnings.  This contrasted sharply with persons working in insurable employment who heretofore were not assessed with any means from part-time or casual employment.  They could work for a few days in a week and qualify for unemployment assistance for the remaining <Col N="1588" /> days, regardless of their earnings for the days worked.  Accordingly, an unjustifiable inequity had developed <i>vis-à-vis</i> self-employed claimants.</P>
    <P>Evidence available indicates that in 1992 part-time firemen were in receipt of, on average, earnings of up to £90 per week without any reduction in their entitlement to unemployment assistance. Firemen attached to one particular station had earnings of over £300 per week, on average, in addition to their assistance payments of £100 per week. Self-employed persons with this level of earnings would have no entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for an amount of earnings to be disregarded.  This amount was initially set at the daily rate of unemployment assistance for each day worked plus £10 per week.  I reviewed this amount last year and increased it to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus £15 per day worked.  Thus at current rates a single person working three days per week can earn up to £74.60 without any means assessment; a married person with adult and three child dependants can earn up to £111.55 without any means being assessed.</P>
    <P>In addition, part-time firemen are not required to sign-off the live register on any day during which they are called out on fire duty.  Thus they receive unemployment assistance on a full six day per week basis less any means assessed.  In the circumstances there is a considerable incentive for persons to accept positions with the part-time fire service and that no changes are warranted.</P>

      <P>The experience of the two offices that remain open during lunchtime, is that lunchtime is not a busy time.

      <P>A person under age 66 may qualify for free telephone rental allowance provided she satisfies a number of conditions. One of these conditions requires that the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These payments include an invalidity pension or a blind person's pension from my Department or a disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for a free telephone rental allowance in October 1993.  As he was under age 66 at the time and was in receipt of a retirement pension, he did not satisfy the conditions of the free telephone rental scheme.  A retirement pension is a qualifying payment but only for people aged 66 or over. However, as the pensioner was due to reach age 66 shortly, my Department decided to retain the claim for the person concerned and to arrange with Telecom Éireann to apply the allowance to his telephone account from mid-April 1994. A recent application by the person concerned for a living alone allowance has been awarded from 21 April 1994 &mdash; the Thursday following his 66th birthday.  A letter notifying the person concerned of the award of the two allowances is in the course of issue to him.</P>

Any extension of this age limit to the end of an ongoing school year would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>I introduced the optional contribution scheme for people engaged in share fishing to enable them to top up existing self-employed PRSI contributions and provide themselves and their families with vital cover for disability, unemployment and treatment benefits.  Benefits are payable from January 1995 for those who have paid their contributions in respect of the 1993-94 tax year.  The rate of contribution is 5 per cent of earnings up to £20,000, 1993-94, subject to a minimum of £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strictly speaking, contributions for the 1993-94 tax year would have been payable before 6 April 1994.  However, I am conscious of the difficulties facing fishermen and it is for this reason that I have already allowed an extension for payment of the first year's contribution up until the end of June 1994.  Arrangements have been made, where people are <Col N="1593" /> experiencing difficulties, for the payment of these contributions to be made by instalments.  If a person engaged in share fishing is experiencing such difficulties, he should contact the optional contribution section of my Department.</P>

      <P>Consultations have been underway between senior staff in my Department and the agencies involved in delivering this treatment in the community with a view to identifying how it might be continued in prison.  We are also looking at practices followed in other European countries in this particular area which have proved quite successful both in improving health care for addicts and in reducing crime.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 50 from Deputy Yates on 23 March 1994, I travelled to Texas, Florida and Louisiana for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. I took the opportunity during my visit to meet with business and official representatives mostly in relation to justice-related matters, primarily in the prisons and custodial areas, and to visit a number of penal institutions.</P>
      <P>I flew on the Government jet on the outward journey from Baldonnel to Houston on 10 March 1994.  Thereafter, I did not avail of the Government jet and I made use of scheduled flights to travel between the cities of Houston, Orlando and New Orleans and for the return journey to Ireland on 19 March 1994.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied on the trip by my husband, the secretary of my Department, my Department's partnership programme manager, my private secretary and a member of the Garda team responsible for my personal security arrangements. A principal officer from my Department's prisons division joined the group on 16 March 1994.  The group was accommodated in hotels in each of the cities mentioned.  The cost of the visit, excluding the cost of the Government jet, is estimated by my Department to be approximately £19,000.</P>

      <P>I am aware of an increase in the level of crime recently in the Borrisoleigh area.  The Garda authorities have taken steps to address the situation by assigning an additional garda to Borrisoleigh on 18 March 1994, bringing the current strength there to two gardaí.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are also taking special measures to combat crime in this area. These measures include the operation of checkpoints throughout the district on a regular basis.  A community alert scheme was set up in Borrisoleigh in late 1993 and the local gardaí have been instructed to pay special attention to the elderly in the sub-district in order to assuage their anxiety.  The gardaí report that they have identified the persons suspected of being responsible for a number of burglaries in Borrisoleigh in January of this year.  One person has been arrested and charged with six of these burglaries and has been remanded in custody.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that the crime prevention officer from Nenagh has visited each business premises in Borrisoleigh and given advice on security precautions.  I understand that the district officer has met with representatives of the Borrisoleigh community alert group and the divisional officer also intends to do so shortly in order to allay their fears in relation to crime.  The gardaí are satisfied that the current manpower and policing arrangements are adequate to meet the needs of the area but they are keeping the situation under continuing review.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the local authorities concerned to carry out any works required to Hartley Bridge and to meet the cost from their own resources, supplemented by the road grants provided annually by my Department for non-national roads.  I have notified discretionary grant allocations totalling £1,990,000 and £2,459,000 to Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils, respectively, for this year.  Both councils also had the opportunity to submit applications by 26 February 1994, for specific grants in respect of improvement projects on non-national roads which have a significant and quantifiable economic impact and which meet the criteria of the grants scheme.  Leitrim County Council submitted 14 applications entailing total estimated expenditure of £2.030 million in 1994 and Roscommon County Council submitted 22 applications costing an estimated <Col N="1609" /> £3.917 million this year, but neither council included an application relating to Hartley Bridge.</P>

      <P>I have recently approved the 1994 Programme of Works to be undertaken by the Department of the Marine at Fishery Harbours.  No provision could be made for the development of Clogherhead this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan a sum of £12 million has been made available <Col N="1615" /> for the development of harbour facilities.  This sum includes an allocation of £3 million for the development/ renewal of the ice plant network.  The total cost of the development proposals submitted by the various local authorities for consideration and possible inclusion in the Fishery Harbour Development Plan 1994-99 (FHDP) far exceeds the funding available.  The proposals submitted by Louth County Council alone amounted to £8 million.  In view of this and the need for continued investment at the State owned Fishery Harbour Centres, only the most strategically or economically beneficial projects will be included in the 1994-99 Plan.  No project will be undertaken unless the costs can be justified by reference to the economic benefits arising.</P>
    <P>The projects to be included in the subsequent years of the FHDP have yet to be decided on. Further consultation with coastal local authorities will be necessary before a final decision is reached.  The projects to be included must also be agreed with the Commission of European Communities, who are subventing the Plan's implementation.  Until these exercises are complete it is not possible for me to outline what plans, if any, I have for Clogherhead.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in the Mullaghmore area of County Sligo there is concern about coastal erosion, particularly in the section between Gobaun and Mullaghmore lobster pond where whole sections are collapsing into the sea and being washed away, that there is a threat from this erosion to the Circular Road and that it seems only a matter of time before this road is washed away; if he will make special finances available in view of the major cost factor involved for the local authority, Sligo County Council, in carrying out coastal protection work and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concern about coastal erosion in the Mullaghmore area of Sligo.  The report of the County and City Engineers Association's National Coastal Erosion Committee entitled &lsquo;Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action&rsquo;, which was published in 1992, outlines the extent of the erosion problem affecting the Irish coastline, including the County Sligo coastline.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently drawing up a coastal protection plan to be implemented over the next six years.  However, as I am sure the Deputy can imagine, the total cost of undertaking the protection projects identified, far exceeds the £5.5 million that will be available for this purpose under the National Development Plan.  In fact, the costs of the protection works identified in County Sligo exceed £6 million.  Therefore, the Department will only be able to grant aid local authorities in respect of the most urgent coastal erosion problems having regard to economic, environmental and ecological impacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further consultation will be required with the relevant local authorities before a list of urgent coastal erosion projects for inclusion in the Plan can be identified. In addition, an Operational Programme to enable EU funding be drawn down to subvent the plan's implementation <Col N="1618" /> remains to be agreed with the Commission of the European Communities. Pending completion of these exercises it is not possible to identify what works in County Sligo, if any, may be included in the finalised plan.</P>

      <P>Between 1990 <Col N="1632" /> and 1993 my Department allocated about £225,000 by way of grant-aid to the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers' Association (IOFGA) to enable them to develop their facilities, structures and inspection service.  My Department's commitment to the IOFGA ended in 1993.  I have no plans to grant-aid them this year.  However, I hope to have some EU Structural Funding available to me later this year for the development of the organic farming sector.  Details of this funding will not be available until the National Plan and the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry for the period 1994-99, are approved by the European Commission. IOFGA will be able to make application for some of this funding then.</P>

      <P>Because of the preponderance of small-scale producers in Connacht-Ulster, this region benefits particularly from arrangements which give priority status to small producers. I was of course conscious of this when deciding the conditions for the allocation, free of charge, of the major part of the 6.6 million gallons special reserve which I secured at the 1993 EU farm price review.  The Connacht-Ulster region, which accounts for about 20 per cent of the national quota, received over 30 per cent of that allocation of 4.9 million gallons.</P>
      <P>On a broader level, I am pursuing, at EU level, the possibility of restricting, for socio-economic reasons the movement of quota from certain areas.</P>

    <P>Details in relation to public offices of State Bodies under the aegis of my Department are as follows:</P>

      <P>As you are aware, my colleague the Minister for Justice has responsibility for addressing the problem of crime, including crime against tourists. However, as Minister for Tourism I am naturally concerned about this issue.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Justice indicated recently in this House there is close liaison and co-operation between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests on this issue.  &ldquo;Take Care&rdquo; leaflets in four languages are circulated widely, through tourist offices, hotels, car rental companies etc. and verbal &ldquo;take care&rdquo; messages are also given to customers by accommodation providers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the topic is covered extensively in Garda in-service training courses.  Gardaí are encouraged to avail themselves of language training courses and the Garda Office in O'Connell Street serves as a centre for advising tourists to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new tourist assistance service in the Dublin area will be launched in April. <Col N="1641" /> The service, known as Dublin Tourist Victim Support will be operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support (IAVS).  It will be modelled on the existing Amsterdam Service which I understand has been very successful.  It will provide a practical support service in order to assist the victims of crime to overcome the initial trauma of their experience.  The Department of Justice, my own Department, the Garda Síochána, Bord Fáilte and the industry have been involved in setting up this service and the Garda Síochána will be providing premises for its operation.  The service will undoubtedly provide valuable support to tourist victims of crime.</P>

      <P>It is my Department's policy to ensure the safety of air navigation at and on the approach to the Airports.  Experience has shown that the most likely area where a crash would occur would be on the take off or landing i.e. on the approach to the airport within the red safety areas.  For this reason it is established policy, in conjunction with the local authorities, to keep the lands under the approach areas free of developments or obstructions.</P>
      <P>In the case of Cork Airport the location for the proposed development of a business park does not lie within the red approach zones and the local authority has recently granted planning permission for this project which will comply with the normal safety and technical requirements for such developments.  This worthwhile project will enhance the Cork area in general and generate considerable extra employment in the region.  As regards a new Terminal Building at Cork Airport it should be noted that this project involved an extension to the existing building.  Neither the original building nor the recent extension lie within the red safety zones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 33 of the Health Act, 1970, <Col N="1657" /> in respect of health boards, and under the establishment order for health agencies established under the Health Corporate Bodies Act 1961, the approval of the Minister for Health is required to undertake bank borrowings.  It is the current practice of my Department to approve bank overdraft limits for these health agencies, such overdraft limits being directly related to the levels of non-capital allocations approved for the period in question.</P>
      <P>The matter of overdraft interest incurred by such health agencies depends on the level of facility used within the overall approved limit, and the interest rate applicable within the period.  While it is a matter for each health agency to agree the borrowing terms with their respective bankers, it has been possible for my Department to negotiate very favourable rates for such borrowings for health agencies generally.  The current rates applicable to health boards and voluntary hospitals is generally the prime rate.</P>
      <P>The following table shows the total interest paid in 1993 by each of the major health agencies whose overdraft limit requires the Minister for Health's formal approval.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that, as a result of the special cash injection of £100 million by the Minister for Finance in the budget, the maximum overdraft levels of health agencies are being reduced to an appropriate level.  Health boards overdrafts will be reduced by about one third, and those of other agencies by about a half.  This will lead to significant interest savings for all the relevant agencies.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the number of women who have been screened for Hepatitis C antibodies is almost 44,000 and the number who have tested positive is 827 up to and including 25 March 1994. A further confirmatory test will be carried out on the blood samples given by these women and some may yet prove to be negative.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board estimate that 60,000 women received the Anti D product and it is imperative for the success of the screening programme that all women who received Anti D since 1970 to 18 February 1994 come forward for screening.  The number of children of these women is not known.  The spouses and children of women who test positive for Hepatitis C antibodies will be offered the screening test.</P>
      <P>Treatment for those who test positive for Hepatitis C antibodies will be provided at the following hospitals:</P>
      <P>St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin;</P>
      <P>Mater Hospital, Dublin;</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital, Dublin;</P>
      <P>St. James's Hospital, Dublin;</P>
      <P>Cork Regional Hospital;</P>
      <P>University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The treatment will initially involve outpatient visits which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, treatment will be provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,187 candidates took music as a subject in the leaving certificate examinations in June 1993.  This represents an increase of approximately 13 per cent on the pevious year.  A total of 8,941 candidates, which represents an increase of approximately 2 per cent, took music as a subject in the junior certificate examination in 1993.  These figures do not indicate a decline in the popularity of music as a subject.</P>
      <P>While some schools may have ceased to offer music others are taking it up enthusiastically.  The excellent reception given to the new syllabus in music at junior certificate is beinng maintained. This augurs well for an increase in the take-up of the subject.</P>
      <P>However, as I have stated before, the numbers taking music are not yet as high as I would wish them to be.  I have also put on record that I am concerned at the low take-up of the subject by boys.</P>
      <P>Finally, in connection with the funding supplied to second-level schools, I wish to inform the Deputy that the position is as follows: Apart from the equipment and resource grant allocation, the Department does not provide recurrent grants for the teaching of individual subjects. There are annual grants available for the setting up and maintenance of school orchestras and military bands. Also, there is a bonus scheme for choirs in secondary schools which enter for the Department's special examinations.</P>

Payment of the special grant ceased when the programme was introduced in all subjects in the junior cycle in 1992.</P>

      <P>My interest in promoting music as a subject in second-level schools and colleges is on record.  It would be unrealistic to seek a close correlation in the distribution of grades between different leaving certificate subjects because different levels of student motivation, <Col N="1668" /> different objectives, different course content, different emphasis and different participation rates inevitably produce different patterns of grade distributions between subjects.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently drafting proposals for a revised syllabus in music at senior cycle, consequent on the changes already introduced for the junior cycle. This revised syllabus will not be examined in the leaving certificate for some few years yet.  I am setting up a small committee representative of my own Department, the NCCA and music teachers to make interim proposals for the leaving certificate examination in 1995 and subsequent years until the new syllabus is examined.  This committee will report to me in time for schools to be informed at the beginning of the 1994-95 school year.</P>

    <P>In reply to the second part of the question, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 279.  It is not clear what the Deputy means by &ldquo;specialist subject&rdquo; in the context of his question.  All leaving certificate subjects involve a measure of specialisation especially at higher level. The fact that achievement in instrumental performance requires a great deal <Col N="1669" /> of practice outside the classroom and indeed the school may suggest that it is a &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; subject.  However, high achievement in any skill-based subject &mdash; modern languages for instance &mdash; requires a great deal of practice and reinforcement outside the classroom.</P>

    <P>Special supports for schools in disadvantaged <Col N="1670" /> areas take the form of additional teaching posts and additional financial assistance.

      <P>I am aware of the unfortunate circumstances of this case and I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that the needs of the boy in question are fully addressed. The boy was recently assessed at St. Mitchael's Remand and Assessment Centre and was diagnosed as requiring specialist psychiatric and therapeutic intervention. It was recommended that this intervention take place in advance of any decision regarding his long term placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the most recent hearing of this case <Col N="1672" /> on 22 March 1993, the court made a &ldquo;Fit Person Order&rdquo; charging the Eastern Health Board with responsibility for ensuring that the boy receives the necessary specialist treatment recommended in the assessment.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board is currently making the necessary arrangements and my Department is liaising with the health board with a view to ensuring that appropriate arrangements are made to meet the boy's educational needs.</P>
    <P>The question of more long term arrangements for the boy will be addressed when the treatment referred to above has been completed.</P>

      <P>It is not open to my Department to make any change to the existing service. The families in question reside in Kinsale post-primary centre catchment area, and are fully eligible, under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, for transport to that centre. They all live between 0.1 and 1.5 miles from the route of service and are, therefore, considered to have a reasonable and adequate level of service in the context of the overall operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The fourth assistant cannot be allowed to continue at the school for a further year, and the post in question will be suppressed from the end of the current school year.

      <P>I have no proposals to base eligibility for third level grants on net income. Net income is the result of personal financial decisions.  Two taxpayers with the same gross income can have markedly different net income if, for instance, one decides to rent a house and the other decides to take on a mortgage to buy a house.  To avoid discrimination on the basis of what are personal financial decisions gross income will continue to be the basis on which the assessment of eligibility for third level grants will be made.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to accede to the Deputy's request.  Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the school transport scheme, has confirmed that the family's home is 0.4 miles from the present pick-up point.  This is a very good standard of service in the context <Col N="1678" /> of the overall operation of the scheme in the country generally.  The pick-up point being sought is 0.2 miles from their home, off the main route.  In the circumstances, an extension of service would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>A circular issued to all schools on 3 February 1994 in relation to the May Bank Holiday.  School authorities may allow an additional day's holiday on that day from the 1993-94 school year onwards, and the required minimum number of days of school operation in the school year has now been reduced by one.  This change arises from the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to establish a new public holiday in May.</P>
