      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the Standing Order.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9, 1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and, subject to the agreement of Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, Nos. 11 and 12 shall be taken and then Nos. 17 and 13.  No 13 shall be taken at 12 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. 9, 1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 and 12 shall be decided without debate by one question in each case; (2) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 17, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; (3) The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; (4) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate on No. 13, Votes 1-25, inclusive, Votes 30-45, inclusive, and Supplementary Estimate to Vote 30:</P>
      <P>(i)  the Estimates shall be moved and debated together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair not later than 4 p.m. tomorrow and if a division is demanded it shall be taken forthwith;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter dealt with under No. 9 was approved by Cabinet only yesterday.  A significant number of parents and families are interested in adoption, with particular reference to Romania.  We have no objection to having this matter approved without debate but, in the event of any difficulties or queries arising, will the Taoiseach allow an opportunity to discuss the matter either in committee or in a general debate in the House when it resumes after the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request from the Deputy and the Government will have no hesitation in allowing time for a debate at a future date if difficulties arise or questions need to be answered in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter dealt with under No. 10 allows the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to discuss the Central Banks annual report.  Does the Taoiseach agree that all witnesses appearing before committees of the House should be covered by comprehensive legislation dealing with the privilege and compellability of witnesses?  Legislation in this area has been promised for approximately ten years but not introduced by any Government. When will it be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as drafting is completed.  Work on that legislation started some time ago, but if it started ten years ago it would have been introduced before now.</P>

      <P>To avoid the time consuming procedure of a division on this matter, will the Government give an assurance that either the Dáil will be recalled to discuss the position in Irish Steel if it deteriorates or that a specific debate on the matter will be allowed either today or tomorrow?  We owe it to those whose livelihoods depend on Irish Steel to show sufficient interest to discuss the matter here.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No such request was made to the Whips.  Deputy Bruton is well aware of how this House functions. If he had such a request to make yesterday <Col N="1550" /> evening why did he not make it to the Whips when the business for today was being agreed?  The Order of Business is being turned into Question Time on a regular basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ideas which come to the minds of those in Opposition late in the day are put forward on the Order of Business.  Two days have been allowed for an Adjournment Debate during which time questions can be raised in respect of any matter including Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, by regulation, establish an Office of Solicitors Ombudsman, who shall be independent of the professions and administrators of law in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> (2)  The Solicitors Ombudsman shall be entitled to investigate complaints from members of the public with regard to the conduct of any solicitor in the delivery of a legal service in any particular matter or in general.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Solicitors Ombudsman shall be entitled to have access to all or any documents concerning the investigation of any matter under subsection (2) from any solicitor or from any third party concerned and shall return those documents to the person entitled to custody on the completion of the investigation.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Solicitors Ombudsman shall be entitled to direct solicitors to act in a particular manner to resolve a complaint of a member of the public whether the complaint be in a particular or general manner, save that no such direction shall act, in any way, to usurp the functions of the Courts to judicially determine any issue relating to a matter pending before any court.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister shall, in making regulations herein, consult with the Law Society.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister shall require the Law Society to defray the costs of maintaining, the Office of Solicitors Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>(7)  A person appointed as a Solicitors Ombudsman shall not be or have been a practising solicitor or barrister and shall be independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Solicitors Ombudsman shall present a yearly report on the working of his office to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the critical amendment concerning this legislation.  The Bill is intended to establish new procedures largely for the regulation of solicitors by the Law Society.  There is much in the Bill to be welcomed as it will improve protection for solicitors' clients.  The Law Society expressed general satisfaction with the contents of the Bill &mdash; it may perhaps regret the degree of enthusiasm it showed <Col N="1566" /> for the Bill at an earlier stage in its passage through this House.</P>
    <P>The main flaw in the Bill is that it does not provide for an independent mechanism outside of the Law Society which would enable clients to process complaints against solicitors or against the Law Society.  There is a misbelief among the public, repeated in sections of the media that this Bill provides for the establishment of an independent ombudsman, but it does not.  Section 15 provides for the establishment of an independent adjudicator appointed by and paid for by the Law Society, who will function within the Law Society and report to that society, but whose functions and ability to investigate complaints from solicitors' clients will be severely restricted.  The first restriction is that the adjudicator may deal only with:</P>
    <P>any written complaint made to the adjudicator by or on behalf of a member of the public against the Society, concerning the handling by the Society of a complaint about a solicitor made to the Society by any person.</P>
    <P>The adjudicator is also prohibited from dealing with complaints, for example, which have been dealt with two years previously by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>The degree to which the so-called independent adjudicator may deal with complaints made by the public is quite restricted.  It is certainly not what is being sought by several Members of this House, including members of the committee which dealt with the Bill on Committee Stage, and by wide sections of the public, which is the establishment of an ombudsman's office for the solicitors profession to deal independently, outside of the Law Society, with complaints made by the public against solicitors.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to establish the office of solicitors ombudsman.  I am very disappointed the Minister has not responded more positively on Report Stage as he indicated he would on Committee Stage.  When we discussed this issue in Committee the Minister seemed to accept that there was validity in the <Col N="1567" /> case that the State would have to establish this type of independent office.  He undertook to have further consultations with his Department and the Department of Finance with a view to producing an appropriate amendment, and I am very disappointed he has not made that response.</P>
    <P>The degree of complaints made by the public about solicitors has recently been reported in the press.  For example, it is reported that according to the Law Society, more than 5,000 complaints were made about solicitors to the Law Society in the past five years.  According to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 11 June 1994, the majority of those complaints were dealt with privately by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>Of the 5,000 complaints received by the society between 1988 and 1993, up to one-third were referred to an internal society committee which sent about 10 per cent of those to the disciplinary committee. The disciplinary committee's 1991 report states that 44 applications were dealt with resulting in the establishment of 28 <i>prima facie</i> cases of misconduct leading to ten findings of actual misconduct.  The amount paid from the compensation fund gives an indication of the number of complaints and the Law Society report states that payments totalled £2,657,000 last year.  The number of complaints is substantial, over 5,000 in a five year period and the Law Society felt that at least one-third warranted referral to its internal committee.  There is probably some apprehension that this understates the degree to which the public makes complaints to the Law Society.</P>
    <P>The legal services Ombudsman in Britain stated in his 1992 report that the number of complaints he received amounted to 8 per cent of the total number dealt with by the internal investigative committee of the legal professions. It shows quite clearly that even where there is an internal mechanism for dealing with complaints from clients of members of the legal profession a significant number &mdash; which amounted to 8 <Col N="1568" /> per cent in Britain &mdash; were referred to the legal services Ombudsman.  It is also interesting that the legal services Ombudsman in Britain made the point in his report that the internal committees of the British legal professions which examine complaints from the public about the legal professions actively try to discourage clients from pursuing their complaints. He states in his report:</P>
    <P>I have come across a number of cases where people who have complained to the Solicitors' Complaints Bureau have been distinctly unhappy to find themselves redirected by the Bureau back to the solicitors they are trying to complain about.</P>
    <P>He states that this will have to be dealt with.  Many aggrieved clients of solicitors in this country are familiar with that practice. I met many people, as I am sure other Members have, who after submitting complaints to the Law Society were not happy with the way they were pursued and believe that a complaint is ignored.</P>
    <P>The Law Society is responsible for the education and registration of solicitors and, effectively, is the trade union for solicitors.  It is not the appropriate body to investigate its own members.  The so-called independent adjudicator the Minister proposes is not the equivalent of an independent Ombudsman as the office will be funded and controlled by the Law Society and will report to it.  It is also restricted by time limits in the Bill.  If the legislation is to be of any real use we need to establish an independent office of Ombudsman for the legal profession. We are familiar with that concept, we have the Ombudsman for the public service and the insurance industry Ombudsman. Such an office should be established and then the public would have a great deal more confidence in their dealings with the legal profession and in the outcome of complaints against it.</P>

      <P>As we are discussing amendments Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, I will comment on amendment No. 22 in <Col N="1569" /> my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>I think there is paranoia among solicitors that somehow there is, to quote Shakespeare &ldquo;a kill lawyer syndrome&rdquo; in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is not the case.  However, the level of public concern is reflected in the comments of Members.  In the past the attitude of the Incorporated Law Society to those who made complaints &mdash; I note it has made an effort to change in recent times &mdash; contributed to the odium in which it was held.  I recall accompanying a constituent who had made a complaint to a committee of the Law Society.  To be fair, I was permitted to accompany him to try to persuade the committee to uphold my constituent's request for a breakdown of his legal costs which, despite his best efforts, he could not get.  The Law Society did not assist him and &mdash; only under pressure &mdash; allowed him to make his case before a committee.  Some members of that committee tried to justify why something as simple and straightforward as a breakdown of costs was not furnished but, thankfully the wisdom of more streetwise solicitors prevailed and the information was eventually given.  By trying to justify such practices in the past the Law Society has brought odium on solicitors, in particular, and lawyers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because you are paranoid it does not mean that people are not out to get you. Therefore, we must be fair in everything we say and in how we legislate.  This House is reflecting the widespread concern of clients of the legal profession.  I do not have confidence in the Law Society to police this Bill when enacted and I understand it does not want to do so.  The Law Society and solicitors' clients are in agreement that it is not acceptable that the role of adjudicator is funded by the Law Society.  The Law Society feels it is an imposition on it and clients feel it does not assist the independence of the adjudicator.  We need, therefore, to provide a totally independent system for considering conflicts where they arise between clients and solicitors.  The best way to do that is to extend the remit of <Col N="1570" /> the existing Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills.  He published his final report yesterday and has given great credibility to that office by the way he conducted himself as its first incumbent.  He has brought great credibility to that office, as its first occupant, by the way he has conducted himself and he has set a tremendous standard for his successors to follow.  He has established an office which enjoys great public support and in which the public have much confidence.  Why should his office examine complaints in this area?  I believe it should because the courts are a wing of Government the same as local authorities, central Government and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the courts are independent of the Government and of the other institutions of the State in the way they conduct their business.  It would be wrong for the Legislature to interfere with any of the rulings of the courts, but the administration of the courts is another matter.  The practice of the law, however, is another matter also.  Because we have this separation of power we have been inclined to leave the business of the courts, including the practice of the law as it affects the ordinary citizens of this country, to the courts because we feel it is not any of our business.  It is our business. It is not our business to interfere with the judges and how they do their job, but it is our business to ensure that the administration of the courts is efficient, effective and that the people are treated fairly by those they choose to represent them in the courts.</P>
    <P>This particular wing of Government should come under the responsibility of the Ombudsman.  That is perfectly fair and reasonable.  It would be a slight departure from what we are used to, but the courts are a wing of the Government, no more than that.  However, because of the separation of powers we have not been swift to intervene and help people when they feel they have been treated badly by their solicitor.  It would be wrong of us, however, to give the impression that all solicitors are errant solicitors. That is not the case.  The majority of solicitors are decent people like the rest <Col N="1571" /> of us; but where a solicitor is representing a client who does not know the law, all the cards are in the hands of the solicitor and if he or she is an errant solicitor, the clients rights will be completely abrogated by the person who is in a position of trust and who should be looking after their interests.  That is a totally unacceptable abuse of power about which we in this House are entitled to be concerned.</P>
    <P>What would we do if doctors regularly told their patients that they were not going to tell them what was wrong with them, they were not going to make the files available to them and that they should simply continue to take the prescribed medicine?  We would say that that was unreasonable behaviour on the part of the doctors, that there must be doctor-client confidentiality and that doctors must be responsible and reasonable. We would also say that they cannot charge their patients whatever fee they choose and that they must treat people in a decent way.  The Department of Health would take an immediate interest in such a situation even before this House demanded that it do so.  The Department of Justice does not take an interest in the way solicitors or lawyers generally treat their clients.  There is a role for Government in overseeing this activity and I believe the person to do that is the Ombudsman appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is the person who should be given this role.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being unjust to the Law Society but I do not believe it would have any difficulty with the Ombudsman taking on this role.  I understand it is exactly what the clients and solicitors are demanding.  The problem facing the Minister is that this would probably require additional funding because the Office of the Ombudsman would have to be expanded.  In my amendment I provide for consultation with the Law Society to set an annual contribution to be made by the society towards the cost of running the Ombudsman's Office.  That would not mean that the Ombudsman would be on the payroll of the society <Col N="1572" /> because the Ombudsman, in law, has established his credentials and his independence and he has been completely fair in the way in which he conducts his business.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to accept this Fine Gael amendment.  I believe it would be the most fair and equitable way to deal with this problem and that it would enjoy broad support.  I know the Law Society would not like to be asked to make an annual contribution towards the running of the Office of the Ombudsman but the way the amendment is framed in regard to annual consultation with the society would at least give the society a better opportunity, in the knowledge of the finances from year to year, to discuss with the Department of Justice on an annual basis its input to the additional costs incurred in the running of the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Law Society or lawyers generally should not balk at this proposal.  We have reached the stage in our society &mdash; and this applies not just to lawyers but to journalists, politicians, members of the Church and so on &mdash; where if one criticises somebody, one is immediately accused of being down on them or being anti-solicitor, anti-lawyer or anti-journalist. Journalists, in particular, are very thin skinned about this, although they criticise all the time.  Lawyers, however, regard any criticism as being anti-lawyer. That is an indication of paranoia on their part.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House knows that all is not well with the legal profession. The sort of fees that have been charged by lawyers through the years are wholly unacceptable.  Consider what happened at the beef tribunal?  People often ask what is bringing the legal profession into disrepute.  It is not as a result of any criticisms made in this House; it is the lawyers themselves who are bringing the profession into disrepute.  The legal profession should not be allowed to bring itself into disrepute because within it there are many honourable people.  In fact, the vast majority of people in the legal profession are honourable, but if they are allowed to write blank cheques <Col N="1573" />&mdash; as has been the case at the beef tribunal, particularly in regard to barristers &mdash; and if they grab everything they can in a gluttonous fashion, that is not acceptable. When I saw the lawyers going in and out of the beef tribunal with their large briefcases I wondered whether they contained their daily fees.  If they act in such a blatant way, how can they expect people to respect the profession?</P>
    <P>There must be some ethical standards within which these people are required to behave.  If they do not adhere to those standards the profession should realise that such behaviour will not reflect well on it.  There has been no criticism from the Bar Council or the Law Society of that sort of behaviour and anyone who criticises such behaviour is put down as anti-lawyer.  That is not the case.  We need lawyers.  With the amount of legislation we pass in this House year in year out, the public would not know where it stands in regard to that legislation without the services of lawyers.  Lawyers play an important and central role in society, but if they expect to be respected &mdash; and they do and should &mdash; they have a duty to behave in a decent manner.  In the past there have been indications of an erosion of standards in that area.  In relation to complaints by clients against solicitors who have abused their positions of trust, there must be some acceptable and totally independent way of examining such complaints and our proposal is the best way of doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has an amendment similar to the Minister's amendment, No. 23.  I have no difficulty with that.  Our amendment is to delete lines 17 to 20 which state that an adjudicator appointed under this section may not examine or investigate a complaint made to him under this section after the expiration of two years following the determination by the society of a complaint made to the society.  In the event that the Minister is not prepared to accept our amendment substituting the Ombudsman for the adjudicator, I hope section 15 (4) (g) will be deleted.  I do not think the two year retrospective period is long enough. Many people will not be aware that their <Col N="1574" /> rights have been taken away in this fashion.  I hope the House will accept the Fine Gael amendment No. 24 to delete that paragraph.</P>

      <P>I supported the amendment put down by Deputy Mitchell when we debated this on Committee Stage because the principle inherent in his amendment is the solid one in jurisprudence that one should not be a judge in one's own cause.  The dilemma for the Minister is that, in his effort not to have any demands on the Exchequer, he is compromising the perceived independence of the system we are putting in place.  The amendment gets around that because it would oblige the Law Society to contribute towards the expense of the Ombudsman's role in judging complaints against solicitors.</P>
      <P>The Bill imposes penalties and substantially increases the powers of the disciplinary tribunal to deal with complaints of shoddy work and excessive charges. These matters form the basis of complaints by clients against solicitors.  I trained as a lawyer although I did not practise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a solicitor. In the past there was an unequal and ascendant relationship between solicitors and their clients.  It was not a normal customer relationship.  It is an unusual relationship because usually there is a lack of knowledge on the part of one party.  The solicitor has a duty to be caring and to respond to the client.  In the past there was a certain brusqueness and ascendant relationship between solicitor and client.  I witnessed behaviour which was rude and shoddy and for which no apology was made.  That was the way business was done.  It was sufficiently widespread through the generations for a feeling of disquiet to build up that the client, as a consumer, was not getting a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill tries to tip the balance in <Col N="1575" /> favour of a client as a consumer.  In law, the client comes to the solicitor with no knowledge, in the main, and places his trust in him.  He must take the solicitor's advice as being the best advice.  The Bill makes it obligatory for solicitors to talk about costs at the beginning and lay them on the line for clients.  In the past it was traditional for solicitors not to talk about fees and present the unfortunate client with a bill, which was usually a surprise, at the end of the case.  This was particularly hard for the client if they lost the case.  Most people who go to law are optimists but only one person will win the case and it can be quite difficult for people to pay huge sums of money in costs.</P>
    <P>A range of issues affects the cost of legal proceedings.  It is not all about fees that solicitors charge.  There are infra-structural problems in the court system which has been under-funded for years. I accept the Minister is addressing this area.  Court delays increase the cost of proceedings as travelling and other expenses of witnesses, doctors and so on must be paid even if the case is adjourned in order to take a criminal case because such cases takes precedence in the list. The court system is in a state of near collapse due to delays and backlogs.  This has a bearing on the high cost of litigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has compromised the perceived independence of the adjudicator. If he wants to achieve a perception of independence the State must pay for the adjudicator but it is not willing to do so.  The State is not prepared to pay for or extend the role of the Ombudsman to deal with complaints brought against solicitors.  I do not expect the Minister will accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment which would deal with his dilemma. We had this debate on Committee Stage. I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Stage debate was very limited and some who contributed were confined in their remarks. My remarks on the reform and improvement of the relationship between client <Col N="1576" /> and solicitor are set out in detail on the Second Stage speech I made in May 1992. My views have not altered because things really have not changed.  Although we have seen some public signs of accountability from the Law Society, in reality nothing has changed.  I monitored some of the cases which went to the Law Society and the procedures do not lend themselves to justice being done.</P>
      <P>This section is the litmus test of whether the consumer will receive justice and of the Minister's commitment to reform.  Unfortunately both are failing. As a result of the deficiencies in this section, which impacts on many other sections, the Bill is bogus.  It pretends to represent and protect the rights of the consumer but it perpetuates the self-regulatory role of the society and the interests of what is basically a trade union.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers I hoped the Minister would be a Minister of real reform regarding court reform, judicial reform and costs.  Even the conservative Government in Britain have set up an inquiry into court costs and procedures under Lord Wolfe.  The main purpose of the inquiry is to find ways of reducing costs to clients and to ensure more efficiency in the courts.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the need for reform of court procedures, but the most important and urgent need is to reduce costs to the public.  High costs are not only a major disincentive to people taking cases against vested interests and wealthy opponents, they also have an impact on our lives.  For example, the high costs of insurance are curbing job creation while high legal costs give rise to dearer employers' liability and car insurance.  I had hoped the Minister would give us some idea of his reform programme but, unfortunately, he did not.</P>

    <P>In Great Britain Lord Wolfe is leading the call for cheaper insurance.  Public seminars will be held on the costs of insurance at which the public will be entitled to express their views.  Nothing of that nature is being done in this country because the dead hand of the vested <Col N="1577" /> interests is leaning heavily on legislators. The legal profession has an involvement in all political parties and anyone who questions its privileged position is depicted as being anti-solicitor or a solicitor hater.  This is not the case; we are pro-consumer and not anti-anybody.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is unnecessary as all the issues with which it deals could have been dealt with under the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  The extension of the powers of the Ombudsman to include the investigation of complaints against the Law Society and the solicitors' profession would only have required an amendment to the Act by way of a Statutory Instrument.  Having studied the Act, I find it strange that there is no reference to the Law Society in either the First Schedule, which lists the bodies and persons subject to investigation by the Ombudsman, or the Second Schedule which lists those bodies and persons subject to investigation. Statutory Instruments have already been used twice to amend the Ombudsman Act, 1980 &mdash; Statutory Instrument 332 of 1984 and Statutory Instrument 66 of 1985.  The 1984 instrument included a number of bodies previously excluded from investigation &mdash; An Post, Bord Telecom Éireann, health boards and local authorities.  A further Statutory Instrument should now be introduced to extend the powers of the Ombudsman to include the investigation of complaints against the Law Society and solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister to appoint as many officers and staff as the Ombudsman requires thus ending, <i>inter alia</i> any backlog of complaints to be dealt with efficiently.  The only objection the Minister could have to the office of the Ombudsman must relate to funding.  He should be well aware that in the past taxpayers' money was spent on causes less noble than seeking justice for the aggrieved clients of solicitors.  Expense is not a valid argument in this case.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to seriously reconsider this section, the litmus test of the legislation.  If it is enacted in its present form the Law Society will have full control over the investigation of complaints against it and its members, solicitors. <Col N="1578" /> I have a major problems with such a proposal as it is handing over <i>de facto</i> to the Law Society responsibility for the investigation of complaints against its members.  Objections to what I am saying could be overcome by the introduction of regulations to include other professions under the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this proposal.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister thinks I am flying a personal kite, I want to quote from the statement of the Irish Family Farm Therapy Group which represents the clients and &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of solicitors and the Law Society.  It has asked the Minister for provision to set up an office of ombudsman and to allow him to oversee the investigation of complaints against solicitors.  This is in accordance with the recommendation of the Fair Trades Commission.  It goes on to say that in its present form the Bill oppresses clients of the legal profession, if enacted, will be bad law and that, ironically, it was drawn up in consultation with the Law Society, which Minister O'Dea has accused of failing in its responsibilities to discipline the profession, and without any input by consumers. The group had a number of meetings with Minister O'Dea, they made detailed submissions to him to amend the legislation in the interests of consumers but they fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>It says that, in contrast, the legal lobby has had so much influence on the Bill it could be said to have hijacked it.  The group believes that if the Minister does not accept our amendments the Bill, which purports to protect the consumers of legal services, will be unconstitutional. If the Bill is signed into law the group will ask the President to test its constitutionality in the courts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support the proposal that the Ombudsman's office should deal with complaints against the legal profession.  The present Ombudsman is unique.  Normally, the phrase &ldquo;ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís&rdquo; is used when referring to someone who has died but it could equally be used in the case of the Ombudsman.  It is a pleasure to deal with the staff in his office who are always more than helpful.  I am not in favour of appointing an ombudsman for every group.  Even though extra staff will be required to deal with those complaints, this will not be as costly as setting up another ombudsman's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with solicitors who argue that they should not pay the costs of the Ombudsman's office.  If it had been proposed at the time I was a teacher to set up an ombudsman's office to investigate complaints against teachers I would have objected very strenuously to teachers paying for this office as innocent people would have to pay for those who are guilty.  Why should the 98 per cent of solicitors already paying fees pay extra money for an office which will investigate complaints against the other 2 per cent of solicitors?  All that is needed is one black sheep in a thousand who may get away with £500,000 and there will be numerous complaints that all solicitors are gangsters.  It is said that all politicians tell lies, all politicians are in politics to get <Col N="1580" /> what they can out of it, that all politicians make false promises.  We rightly object to that type of labelling.  Very often solicitors get a raw deal, in that they are all labelled as being similar, all confiscating clients' money.  Some do, but it is a very small minority.  Some solicitors may be inefficient but there are teachers, politicians and others who are also inefficient. In general solicitors are no worse than any other group of professional people, all of whom will have a certain number of black sheep.  Our amendment requiring them to pay a certain amount of the costs of the Ombudsman is fair, but they should not have to pay all of the costs.  Why should they?</P>
    <P>While I agree entirely with the argument advanced by Deputy Gay Mitchell about the legal fees paid to barristers engaged in the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry I differ slightly from him in that I would not blame the barristers, solicitors or anybody who has earned that money.  Rather I would blame the person or persons who drew up the relevant arrangement.  They should be taken to some country that still engages in flogging, left there for a fortnight, and return thereafter if they are still able to walk.  If any of us here was offered a two year around the world trip to ascertain how Ombudsmen operate in other countries, we should not be blamed for so doing because of our sense of duty to the State, but the person or persons who made the offer should be deemed to be guilty of having made that offer.  I do not blame anybody for accepting large fees; if they can earn £5,000 a day that is their luck, but whoever drew up the arrangement should be hauled in and questioned because such action is indefensible.</P>
    <P>Whenever an injustice has been committed, allowing somebody a period of two years, or three as the Minister proposes in his amendment, within which to lodge a complaint does not mete out justice to anybody.  Why should somebody wronged by a solicitor discover that the only factor that prevented them from obtaining justice was that a limit of three years was stipulated within which to <Col N="1581" /> lodge their complaint?  What advantage is that?  Certainly it does not benefit somebody who has been wronged because very often people do not fully realise what is happening until it is too late.  In some cases, a limit of two or three years will prevent such people from getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sympathetic to the principle being espoused by Deputy Gay Mitchell.  Public perception of the independence of an adjudicator or Ombudsman is very important because, once a client has contacted a solicitor and confined in him or her, they are totally dependent on that professional. Almost without exception the client will know little or nothing about the law, rendering him or her almost totally dependent on the solicitor or barrister consulted.  It is important that we can have confidence and trust in the operation of the system in terms of the relationship between client and solicitor and barrister.  I would not write off what Deputy Gay Mitchell said.  It has much merit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne referred to a number of cases with which I would be familiar. Perhaps I might cite one or two others.  I have known of cases of solicitors dealing with the transfer of estates with substantial amounts of money involved which have been frozen, where I do not know, for a considerable period without any satisfactory explanations being furnished. That kind of practice is not good enough.  In other cases clients approached me contending that solicitors had not furnished them with a reasonable breakdown of the costs for their services. I am sure the people opposite would have many more examples, but I have quite a number on my files.</P>
      <P>I agree there is a definite need for an independent adjudicator or Ombudsman. It boils down to a choice between consulting the Ombudsman, as Deputy Gay Mitchell proposes in his amendment, or an adjudicator, as the Minister proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though Deputy Browne and I come from the same professional background, <Col N="1582" /> I disagree with him in the analogy he drew between complaints lodged against teachers and those against other professionals. He said he would not like to have to consult the Ombudsman in order to have a relationship between a teacher and student investigated.  In the case of this Bill, one is dealing mainly with a relationship between a solicitor and his client and the more contact there is, person to person, the more money the solicitor or barrister makes.  There is no doubt that in the past the Incorporated Law Society failed to regulate properly a satisfactory relationship between solicitor and client, leading to the urgent need for an adjudicator.  I would be extremely reluctant to ask the taxpayer to pick up that tab, since the general public perception &mdash; and I have little reason to believe it to be wrong &mdash; is that, in the main, the legal profession is reasonably well financially endowed. Since it appears to be a well remunerated profession, if there are miscreants within their ranks, it is only reasonable that the regulatory body, through its membership, should be asked to pick up the tab.  I have no qualms about contending that solicitors and the Incorporated Law Society should pay for an adjudicator to be appointed.</P>
    <P>There appears to be worry on the part of Members opposite, with which I can sympathise to a certain extent, about a perception that, because the Incorporated Law Society will be the investigating body, such investigation will not be independent and will not merit public trust and confidence.  That is reasonably well covered in the Bill where the Minister will have to give consent to the appointment of that adjudicator.  The Bill also provides an insistence on an annual report being furnished.  On the basis of those two provisions, the safeguards are sufficiently strong.  While I am sympathetic to the concept of total investigatory independence, the Bill goes far enough.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Gilmore is disappointed but life is full of disappointments.  He is disappointed <Col N="1583" /> that, despite the fact that I saw some validity in his amendment, I did not take it on board.  I said to Deputy Gilmore on Committee Stage that he had made his case well, that there was some merit in his argument and that I would examine it and discuss it with the various people involved, such as with the Department of Finance.  I have done all of that and reflected on the case he made.  After careful consideration and discussion, I have concluded that I am not prepared to accept his amendment.  To some extent Deputy Gilmore made my case in the latter part of his contribution when he extolled the adjudicator or Ombudsman system in the case of the insurance industry or the credit union business.  What we propose in this Bill is precisely the same as that which operates for the self-regulation of both those sectors of the financial services industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to a difficulty he experienced in relation to a particular case, when a client had sought a breakdown of his legal bill.  Section 68 will change all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It will place very definitive obligations on solicitors in furnishing breakdowns, explaining how costs are assessed and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell also made the point that the courts are a wing of Government.  We are not talking here about an Ombudsman, or an adjudicator for the courts; we are talking about an adjudicator for a private profession.  As Deputy Mitchell will be aware, the self-regulation system of investigation applies in the case of all private professions and we are not changing that here.  He also referred to doctors.  The medical profession, of which I have some knowledge, is a self-regulation profession.  If there is a difficulty with a doctor it is investigated internally and ultimately goes before the Medical Council.  It is precisely a self-regulation system and in the case of solicitors it will be strengthened considerably <Col N="1584" /> by the provisions of this legislation.  Deputy Mitchell referred to what the Law Society wants in relation to an independent adjudicator or a complaints system.  The Law Society wants everything so long as they do not have to pay for it.  That is the reality.  I know that because I have been dealing with them for the past 18 months and I have received many submissions.  They will accept the public service ombudsman, a private ombudsman, anything or anybody, so long as they do not have to foot the bill.  That is the bottom line with the Law Society.  Unfortunately for them I take a different view.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Gilmore's amendment about the payment of the adjudicator, if I understand it correctly, he feels that if the solicitors pay the adjudicator the public perception will be that the adjudicator is not totally independent of the profession.  On the other hand, if the Law Society pays a third party, namely the Department of Finance, who in turn pays the adjudicator, the public perception will be different. Whatever about the public perception, the reality will be no different.  If Deputy Gilmore is suggesting that I should do some type of three card trick operation such as this to fool the public, I will not engage in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liz O'Donnell referred to infrastructural problems in relation to costs and acknowledged that we are dealing with them.  I accept there is a problem in this area and much can and should be done to reduce costs generally in the legal profession.  On Second Stage, Deputy Gilmore referred to a radio interview I gave in which I said that because of competition in the legal profession charges were as low as possible.  He said that £500 for this or £300 for that did not appear very low.  Costs are as low as possible in relation to what the service costs the solicitor.  We are trying to reduce court costs and the costs of legal administration.  In that regard the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has comprehensive proposals which will come before the House in the next session.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> I am under-awed by Deputy Allen's contribution.  I would remind him that the use of vulgar terms such as &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;, &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;, and so on will not advance his case one iota.  I will be persuaded by solid argument, not by epithets of that nature.  Deputy Allen said we are perpertuating the self regulation system of the Law Society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Every private profession here is self regulated.  The same applies in the legal profession.  What was needed in the legal profession was not to change the entire system of self regulation but to strengthen it in view of the fact that there were perceived weaknesses in it.  In regard to legal costs Deputy Allen was engaged in another mission recently and may not have been in the House to hear the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice announce that we would have legislation in the autumn in relation to legal costs and cutting down the costs of court procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen made a valid point in relation to insurance costs but I do not agree with him.  Deputy O'Donnell's former leader, Deputy O'Malley, has some experience in this regard.  Deputy O'Malley was of the view that insurance costs could be cut by reducing legal costs. Unfortunately his efforts in that regard did not bear fruit.  The only way to reduce insurance costs is to reduce the level of awards.  The single biggest element in insurance costs is the level of awards.  In <Col N="1586" /> other countries where the level of awards is restricted the premia payable compares very favourably with those paid here in comparable cases.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Seamus Brennan, has proposals in that regard which I expect to see in the next session.  He will bring forward those proposals against the most vicious and sustained opposition from vested interests. The level of awards will be controlled, which is the only way to reduce insurance costs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald has rightly said, we are making the solicitors pay to strengthen the system.  Heretofore the profession was self regulated.  They did not do it properly.  It has to be strengthened and they should pay for it.</P>
    <P>I make one point before concluding.  I have noticed a number of drafting amendments from Deputy O'Donnell, amendments Nos. 40, 41, 45, 49, 63, 87, 91, 92, 93, 95 and 96 which I propose to accept.</P>

      <P>Ireland is forging ahead rapidly, economically, socially and culturally.  A real opportunity exists for peace and political progress in Northern Ireland.  A substantial portion of the commitments in the Programme for Government have been implemented.  While the two parties in Government have separate identities, the combined strengths of both parties have produced extremely fruitful and beneficial results for the Irish people. This Government is providing the right mixture of continuity and change, building on the progress of the past seven years.</P>
      <P>Our economy is performing powerfully. The crisis levels of unemployment are falling, with the live register down 20,000 already this year.  The ESRI has predicted total employment will rise by 23,000 this year alone.</P>
      <P>While the rest of the European Union is shaking off recession, GNP is set to rise in Ireland by 5 per cent in 1994.  The European average will be about 1.75 per cent.  We remain one of the low inflation economies.  This will help maintain our competitive position.  Strong export growth is translating into increased real income per head every year, resulting in rising standards of living.  Exchequer receipts are buoyant, helping to reduce the debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community Support Framework for Ireland was approved in principle by the European Commission on 15 June 1994, subject to the opinions of four EU consultative committees.  We expect it will then be formally adopted by the <Col N="1601" /> Commission during July, making nonsense of Opposition suggestions that we had been delaying its formulation for a week or two to get by the European elections.</P>
    <P>The Government set out its development strategy in the National Development Plan.  Its central objective is to ensure the best long term return for jobs through increasing output and economic potential.  It is further designed to reintegrate the long term unemployed into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy in the plan has been fully endorsed in the Community Support Framework, which identifies the same priorities and key elements.  The shortfall in EU aid, which we have all known about since last October, will have an effect only on the pace of implementation.</P>
    <P>Some of the operational programmes will be approved by the Commission in July, with the balance in the autumn. The Commission is likely to adopt the guidelines for a series of new Community initiatives shortly.  Implementation has been going ahead, in many cases since the start of the year.</P>
    <P>These elements combined &mdash; the Community Support Framework, Community initiatives, and the Cohesion Fund &mdash; represent the largest development effort ever undertaken here, and the best allocation of any of the member states.  The total European Union aid of, at a minimum, over £7 billion in the period 1993 to 1999 is the largest single aid package ever obtained by this country.  We are ensuring that these resources are used wisely to achieve lasting improvements in the economy.</P>
    <P>The overall impact will be dramatic. We will see a continuing major upgrading of our essential infrastructures, strategic investments to enhance our productive capacity, and development of the talents and skills of our workforce.  For the first time also, we will see a comprehensive package of measures to encourage, support and deliver on the development potential in local communities.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Opposition parties spend so much of their time making <Col N="1602" /> vicious personal attacks and engaging in character assassinations of a kind not seen in this House for many years, and which seriously damage the profession of politics.  Thankfully, the Irish electorate were not very impressed, as shown by the Euro-election results.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the voters of Munster did not believe the Progressive Democrats or their former leader?  This is the same man, who stated at the Public Accounts Committee on 10 March 1994, concerning his legal costs with the Beef Tribunal, and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;I did not make any application for costs&rdquo;.  Yet on 15 July 1993, one of his counsel had indeed made an application for his full costs.  That is a matter of public record.  The deliberate deception of the people in relation to the truth about the filling of the Presidency of the EU will meet the same fate.  In relation to the Sutherland affair, I deal in fact not in fantasy.</P>

Are the Progressive Democrats and other Members suggesting that a Member who has a profession or business should be discriminated against and should not avail of any scheme legitimately available to him or her?  If that is what they are saying, let them come out and say it.  Others are saying that should not be the purpose of this House.  Come out from behind the smokescreen and make allegations if there are any to make. They have no foundation any more than other allegations during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to social partnership has been further underlined by the agreement on a third National Programme.  The <i>Programme <Col N="1604" /> for Competitiveness and Work</i> (PCW), like its predecessors the <i>Programme for National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, has enabled all the social partners to discuss and agree how our economic and social development needs can best be served. The establishment of the National Economic and Social Forum is a further important step, bringing to the table and the unemployed, womens' group, the disabled, and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>In an economy of our size, all our interests are best served by co-operation and consensus.  I took the opportunity at Corfu last week to inform my colleagues in the European Council of the Irish success in the area of social partnership. Considerable approval was expressed for an approach which shows that partnership is fully consistent with economic success and increased competitiveness, and for the fact that this was the third programme since 1987.  I will be putting a paper on the Irish case to the European Council in Essen in December, focusing on complementary Community action.</P>
    <P>As a result of social partnership, there has, on the whole, been a marked improvement in our industrial relations record.  However, the necessity for adaptation and change in the face of commercial difficulties and strong competitive pressures must still be faced up to realistically.  There are, of course, long term options to be examined, as well as past mistakes to be analysed but the basic requirements for physical survival must take precedence.  It is a short term illusion, whether in Shannon, Dublin, Cork, or Waterford, to believe that, by exerting political pressure, commercial realities can be evaded.  It is the Government's duty and determination to do what the situation requires, in the long term interests of continuing employment.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the decision about whether a company survives is in the hands of its management and workforce.  The Government will be supportive in material terms, but, under European Union rules, help can only be provided on a viable basis of structural change that offers reasonable long term prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> The local development programme is widely regarded as the most innovative approach to social and economic development.  We are arranging structures and programmes to harness the great potential at local level, to build enterprise, create jobs, and tackle social exclusion.  The initiative will be local, but with formal back-up and support.  There are three strands in the local development programme: county enterprise boards, to enable enterprise creation and development; area partnership companies, targeting designated disadvantaged areas and the urban renewal programme, bringing about real improvements to the physical environment.</P>
    <P>Under Community Support Framework, funding of £208 million has been negotiated for the programme over the period to 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department has direct responsibility for the disadvantaged areas element of the local development programme, which is EU aided.  The aim in these areas is to improve the chances of the long term unemployed of getting jobs, where possible in their own areas; to ensure that those who might otherwise leave school early, get the maximum out of the educational system; to help local communities participate fully in local development; to develop effective community-based organisations; to bring about real physical improvement in the local environment.  The partnerships' task is to draw up and implement an action plan based on the needs and resources of the area.</P>
    <P>Community employment will be a key resource to the local development programme. Because of its importance, funding for community employment in the 33 designated areas is in my Department's Vote.  The target is to have 40,000 participants on community employment at the end of this year, with 22,000 of these in the designated areas.  We are well on the way to achieving this.</P>
    <P>Within the next three years, places for 100,000 unemployed people will be available across the full range of training and education services.  Under the <i>Programme <Col N="1606" /> for Competitiveness and Work,</i> active labour market policies should combat long term unemployment and consequent social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland continues to prosper. Farm incomes have increased by some 31 per cent between 1991 and 1993.  Premia payments negotiated in the CAP reform contributed significantly to this. We have provided additional resources to expedite the payment of headage and premia payments.  So far, in respect of 1993 support arrangements, payments total £440 million.</P>
    <P>We are studying the effects of decisions in different Departments taken in isolation from each other, on the question of rural renewal.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government promised to implement a development programme for the food industry.  The An Bord Bia Bill was passed this week in the House.</P>
    <P>Another rural initiative, the early retirement scheme is attracting considerable interest.  The rural environment protection scheme aims to establish farm practices which take fuller account of conservation, landscape protection and environmental sensitivity.  We are also preparing legislation on occupier liability.</P>
    <P>Fostering the right conditions for job creation continues to be our number one priority; 1994 has already been a major success story.  IDA Ireland has had an outstanding first half year.  Major new projects that will yield thousands of new jobs have been secured.  I and other Ministers have given maximum support both at home and abroad to the effort to win investment and encourage major expansions of existing firms.  There is also encouraging growth of telemarketing, in which several projects have been announced.  Some examples of our recent successes include Boston Scientific, Sensormatic and Xilinx, as well as expansions at Motorola, Analog Devices and NEC.</P>
    <P>When the Government established Forbairt, we gave it a mandate to foster a genuine enterprise culture and to build up the capability of Irish industry.  We are <Col N="1607" /> establishing a world-class manufacturing base, and developing the culture of self-confidence and self-reliance in Irish business. Over the past six months, Forbairt has assisted companies in expansion and investment programmes worth some £96 million.  This new investment by more than 190 Irish companies will create 3,000 new jobs over the coming years.  Forbairt has recently detected a substantial pickup in investment plans by companies. We are working to convert this growing confidence into new growth and jobs. Figures show that over the past six months, employment growth has outstripped numbers coming onto the job market.</P>
    <P>We are focusing too, on the development of links between Irish and foreign owned industry.  Last year alone, multinational companies sourced £1.4 billion worth of components from Irish companies. Through Forbairt, we continue to identify those sub-supply opportunities which can be met by Irish enterprise. Such partnerships help develop the competence and capability of local sub-supply companies, and act as a positive incentive for new overseas industry.</P>
    <P>We have continued to focus on tourism as an area with tremendous growth potential.  We have set a target of 245,000 additional overseas visitors this year.  The Government, in co-operation with the tourism industry, launched a major additional £3 million marketing campaign in the United States.  Ireland was featured on American television as an attractive holiday destination.  Our objective was to achieve a 24 per cent increase in the number of vacation tourists from the United States.  We are well on the way to achieving this target.  Our current ambassadors in the United States &mdash; I am not referring to our diplomats &mdash; are supporting such campaigns by their good-natured and generous support of the Irish soccer team.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been an important element of the small business expansion loan scheme.  The £25 million allocated to the tourism sector will be used to provide loans at a fixed rate of 6.75 per cent for <Col N="1608" /> the fixed and working capital requirements of small tourism business.  To date, 88 projects have been approved for loans totalling more than £16 million in 19 countries.</P>
    <P>The GATT will be of immense benefit to our export-oriented economy. Measures proposed under the EU-funded Market Development Sub-Programme 1994-1999, are designed to increase indigenous exports by an average of 9 per cent per annum, from £3.9 billion in 1993 to £6.8 billion in 1999. Early indications are that the sector is broadly on target to achieve this growth for 1994.</P>
    <P>Some 60 per cent of total employment nationally is now in the services area, compared with more than 70 per cent in other developed economies.  The Government is focusing on measures to realise the potential here for growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>Two key reports now form the basis of Government policy on services, the reports of the Task Force on Jobs in Services and the Task Force on Small Business.  The services report recommended re-orientation of Government policy to balance the treatment, in terms of incentives, between services and other sectors.</P>
    <P>The measures recommended in the valuable small business report will complement measures to foster services, since over 80 per cent of small businesses are in the service area.  That report concentrates on actions to encourage the formation and growth of small enterprises. We made substantial progress in this year's Finance Act in promoting small businesses.</P>
    <P>We are currently examining the extension of the International Services Programme, so that a greater range of internationally traded services can qualify for State assistance and, in some cases, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  It is intended to provide for these additional services in the 1995 Finance Bill.  We also intend to examine other more long term questions about a lower corporation tax rate for services.  We will of course continue our policy of the reduction of personal <Col N="1609" /> taxes with the concentration on widening the bands rather than reducing the rates.</P>
    <P>On the Government's part, establishing county enterprise boards, introducing the small business expansion loan scheme, and the recently announced EIB subsidised loan scheme have alleviated some of the difficulties small enterprises face in accessing suitable finance. Because of the unique role played by the banks in the economy, the Government intends discussing with them and other financial institutions, additional ways in which they can improve the range and reduce the cost of services on offer to small business.</P>
    <P>Financial services is an area in which Ireland is making its mark.  I have taken a personal interest in the development of the International Financial Services Centre since its inception in 1987.  It has been a successful Government initiative, making Dublin an internationally recognised financial services centre.  We are fully committed to enhancing its stature, through the further development of the Custom House Docks site and new legislation, extending the range of products and legal structures available at the centre.</P>
    <P>I have been keen for some time to explore the possibility of attracting new business activity to the centre.  The FINEX Division of the New York Cotton Exchange, with whom I had many discussions over the past year, has established a branch of its futures and options exchange here.  This signals a new and exciting dimension for the IFSC.  The IDA is actively pursuing negotiations with other international exchanges.</P>
    <P>Government policy, in this Year of the Family, has been to support and assist the family, the cornerstone of Irish society. This year, we are providing unprecedented funding to the Legal Aid Board, the Family Mediation Service, and the marriage counselling services. We dramatically increased the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board, providing almost £5 million to expand its network of law centres to all counties by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> People with disabilities in Irish society are finally receiving the attention they deserve.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities offers the opportunity to bring about a fundamental change in the way society treats disability.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill, 1994, is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.  The Bill seeks to develop and strengthen the law on financial support, and other consequences of marriage breakdown, and deals with the age of marriage.</P>
    <P>We hope to publish Equal Status Legislation later this year.  It will deal with discrimination in non-employment areas, including gender, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, and national or ethnic origin.</P>
    <P>We remain poised to make further fundamental legal changes over the next few years, to help ensure a fairer society for all, a society that excludes no-one, a society which supports the family and excludes marginalisation.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to improve and develop our health service.  In this year's budget, we took radical steps to improve the balance sheets of the health boards and to ensure financial discipline in the future.  This clears the decks for the implementation of our new National Health Strategy.  As part of it, we have instigated a dental health action plan. Following an initiative begun in 1992, we are introducing charters for the elderly and for people with a handicap, and reviewing the charter for hospital patients.  Mental handicap services have been provided with £12.5 million additional funding for the development of a broad range of services.  We have also provided an additional £15 million for the development of new child care services.  The Child Care Act will be brought fully into operation by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>This Government attaches great importance to education.  We have drawn upon the widest range of opinion on the Green Paper, published in 1992, so that we can ensure a system relevant to the needs of all.  We harnessed input from all interested parties in the National Education <Col N="1611" /> Convention, and all our consultations and planning will culminate with the publication of a White Paper on Education.  The pupil teacher ratio &mdash; primary school &mdash; will be further reduced; from 24.2 to 23.1, in September. We are providing more remedial and guidance teachers.  Investment in improved school accomodation has also been substantially increased.  We will continue to improve the access of students from disadvantaged backgrounds to third level education.</P>
    <P>In the National Development Plan, improving our roads has a high priority. We have committed more than £73 million to improve county and regional roads this year, up 16 per cent on last year. Investment in the maintenance of these roads has been increased by 170 per cent to £33.3 million.  More than £1 billion will be spent on these roads between now and the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan endorses the main recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  We introduced in May a much needed arrow service to Clondalkin.  Naas and Kildare. Planning for the introduction of light rail services for Dublin is continuing.  We are urgently seeking a private sector company to build and manage a National Convention Centre for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Water and sanitary services will benefit under the National Development Plan from investment of over £100 million per year.  The result will benefit industry and tourism, and bolster the economic value of Ireland's &ldquo;green image&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A new urban renewal scheme begins this August, taking in additional towns. It will concentrate on remedial and conservation works, residential development in our inner core areas, a better mix of social and private housing, and a greater use of vacant upper floors.  A new accelerated capital allowance will be provided for industrial units, encouraging small enterprise units and manufacturing jobs.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for local authority housing has been almost doubled to £129 million this year.  Up to 3,500 local authority houses will be completed in <Col N="1612" /> 1994.  The voluntary sector is expected to provide some 1,100 housing units.  These programmes, together with other schemes in <i> A Plan for Social Housing,</i> and vacancies in local authority stock, will meet the needs of over 9,000 households in 1994.</P>
    <P>Achieving a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland has been the most pressing political challenge facing this Government.  We have met this challenge with an unprecedented level of energy, commitment and determination.  Peace remains at the very top of the political agenda of both the Irish and British Governments.  The peace process is still very much alive.  Considerable obstacles have been overcome since last July.  The remaining problems can, and I hope will be, satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Joint Declaration is one of truly historical significance, and constitutes the best opportunity ever for lasting peace and a disengagement from violence in favour of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The protracted process of clarification for both Republican and Loyalist organisations is now over.  The substantial clarification provided by both Governments should serve to allay many of the suspicions or fears, which may have existed in the two communities regarding their political future, if we can create a peaceful environment free from coercion.  The two Governments are committed to achieving a just balance between the two sets of rights and aspirations, safeguarding each, threatening neither, and seeking to assuage the historical fears of both.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, John Major, and I have been firm in our resolve that political progress should not be held up by waiting for the decisions of paramilitary organisations, and that no party or organisation should veto our efforts towards an agreed and equitable settlement.  The two Governments continue to pursue urgently our work on the formulation of the joint framework document, which is intended to form the basis for resumed all-party talks.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion about the difference <Col N="1613" /> between joint executive institutions and joint authority.  The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, which editorially represents moderate Unionist opinion, wrote on Monday:</P>
    <P>There are many forms of joint authority, some of which &mdash; relating, for example, to tourism or fisheries &mdash; are uncontroversial and others which would encroach on sovereignty.  As the European Union takes hold, it will make sense to have North-South bodies to look after common interests.</P>
    <P>This should help to create a real single market in the island of Ireland.  Leaving aside their debatable use of the term joint authority in this context, the underlying sentiment reflects the spirit of the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an important distinction to be drawn between joint authority and North-South institutions.  Joint authority could be the joint exercise of power over Northern Ireland from above by the two Governments, without there necessarily being full democratic participation by the Northern parties.  For that reason, I can readily see why Unionists should be opposed to it.  Joint institutions, however, would represent freely entered into co-operation or pooled effort, in which people of both traditions would work together, on the basis of common interests between North and South.</P>
    <P>Frequent reference is made by Mr. Ken Maginnis and other spokesmen of the Ulster Unionist Party to their document lodged on 9 November 1992 at the very end of the last round of the talks process, with the suggestion that they showed great generosity.  They proposed an Inter-Irish Relations Committee, within what they called a British Isles structure, which would have had a purely consultative function, without any clear commitment to joint decision-making structures and institutions.  Their more recent <i>Blueprint for Stability</i> is even more tentative in this regard.  Clearly, these and other subjects are matters for negotiation, but it is wrong to suggest that a more forward position was advanced by <Col N="1614" /> Unionists at the eleventh hour on North-South institutions than in the openness to constitutional change which the Irish Government was also advancing at that time.  There has to be a balanced constitutional accommodation within an overall settlement, which creates neither winners nor losers, and which guarantees the position of both communities.</P>
    <P>Our two main objectives, peace and employment, are interconnected.  If we can create lasting peace, the whole country will benefit from the peace dividend. Peace will do more for national confidence and morale, as well as for the employment that will come from increased trade, investment, tourism and cross-Border co-operation, than any other single measure.  There is a potentially exciting period ahead, if we can maintain a steady purpose that will allow us to realise many of our hopes and our dreams.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate provides us with the timely opportunity to review the Government's term in office.  Looking at the performance so far is like trying to read a map, from which all the important place names have been removed.  We can see the roads and the well worn paths but have no idea where they are going. If this Government tried to use a compass to plot a course on this map, it would have no north, south, east or west.  Who needs direction when he does not know where he is going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's sole guiding principle is the desire to stay in power.  For all the Taoiseach's occasional bluster about strategic management in the public service, the first place he should start implementing it is in the running of his own Cabinet.  Then we might start seeing some real performance instead of the fuzzy agenda, the lack of realistic targets, the lack of time limits and the lack of performance indicators.  Pragmatism, short term expediency and anything for the quiet life are guiding strategic principles of this Government.  The Tánaiste can sit in his Bolinger Box at the World Cup match in New York.  The Taoiseach and his ever increasing encourage can <Col N="1615" /> cross and re-cross the Atlantic with such regularity that even the Government jet must be suffering from jet lag.  The increasingly regal trappings of the Government were at first a source of amusement but now are a source of frustration and anger among the public.  If Ireland qualify next week to play in Dallas, most of the members of the Government will undoubtedly avail of the opportunity to travel there to visit Southfork to get a few further tips on the lifestyles of the rich and famous.</P>

      <P>Labour was quite happy to sign up for the journey with Fianna Fáil when it looked like the heady promise of power, influence and jobs for the family <Col N="1620" /> could guarantee a safe future.  It has rapidly discovered, however, that Government is not only about Meres and perks; it is also about hard work, hard decisions and the national interest.  Needless to say the Labour Party is now beginning to discover this.  As it does so the cracks begin to appear and the so-called &ldquo;partners&rdquo; in Government are distancing themselves further and further from one another.  The typically opportunistic nature of this Government has been exposed.</P>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil and Labour face into the summer recess, they can contemplate each other with increasing degrees of mistrust as they face the prospect of more agonising and dissent in the autumn, if not sooner, over Irish Steel, the third banking force, the part sale of Telecom Éireann and, before that, the report of the beef tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government can, however, derail the process if it continues to increase as it is doing, namely, spending faster than the growth in resources. The Government is, as usual, hiding behind a smokescreen.  While our economy is undoubtedly performing well, according to many key indicators, the <Col N="1621" /> most critical, the number of long term unemployed in our society, remains almost unchanged.  The Government is interested in short term palliatives, not long term reform.</P>
      <P>The unprecedentedly favourable projections for our economy over the coming years provide any Government who might be in office at this time with an opportunity to take radical steps to cut taxes on work.  Increased revenue buoyancy should allow this Government to cut taxes now without having to raise new taxes or cut public spending.  Instead of doing that, the Government will take the usual populous choice and use the additional tax revenue generated by economic growth to increase spending even further.</P>
      <P>The best action the Government could take to help the long term unemployed is to create the conditions in which employers will want to offer them a job. That means cutting taxes on those who employ extra people.  Fine Gael believes we should be striving for a situation where the most profitable use any company or individual can make of money that is available to them is to create a job for an extra employee.  The most profitable thing anyone not working could do is take that job.  Neither condition is fulfilled.  The ESRI and others have pointed out that the long term unemployed will be unaffected by the rising economic tide projected over the next few years.  They expect the level of the long term unemployed to be no lower at the end of the century than it is now.</P>
      <P>The cost of unemployment in economic terms is enormous amounting to almost 7 per cent of GDP.  There are also indirect costs linked to ill health, crime and other symptoms of poverty.  This is plainly unacceptable but there are no signs that the Government cares about the problem of long term unemployment. The cruel reality is that, for all the Government's talk about boom and good times, the fruits of economic recovery reach a small percentage of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How the performance of the economy affects a person depends on where one stands on the track.  If one is running on <Col N="1622" /> the inside lane with senior members of Fianna Fáil and Labour and the golden circle of friends and hangers on, then the race is quite easy, particularly if one happens to own property in some town which has been designated for urban renewal status by the Minister on criteria which are hard to discern.  However, if you are running on the outside lane, no matter how fast you run those on the inside lane go increasingly further ahead. The vast majority of people are stuck on the outside lane of the economy.  They look on in amazement realising that unless they are on the inside lane with those who criss-cross the Atlantic they will never catch up.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's job is to speak up for those who cannot get onto the inside lane until the rules are changed, for those whose jobs are not so secure and for those who have no jobs.  We speak for those who must struggle to make a living, those who do not have the ear of the programme managers or of Fianna Fáil fundraisers who organise lunches at £1,000 a plate in different parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That response by the Minister in reply to a question is a direct contradiction of what the Minister for the Environment said a month or two earlier. Fine Gael believes that the health of the economy is measured by the mood of the people, by what they see and experience and not by dusty economic indicators. The reality is that while the Government tries to tell people they are well off and things are getting better, the vast majority of them have not experienced that.  If we cannot provide jobs for the people we cannot give them hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with the long term unemployed, young people face the biggest difficulty in getting a start in the labour market.  The big hurdle or getting a first job must be crossed.  It must be made attractive to employers to offer young people their first jobs at home.  That is why we have proposed a special income tax relief for people under the age of 23.  Unless we can employ young people businesses and services will become less dynamic, our competitive edge will become blunt and our talent will emigrate. If it makes sense to give a grant to a first time house buyer, surely it makes sense to give a tax break to help someone under the age of 23 to get his or her first job in Ireland?  Such an imaginative tax change is now possible because of our improving budgetary circumstances but I doubt if the Government will do that because real or imaginative tax reform represents harder work than simply agreeing to the incessant requests for new spending from all the interests pressing on various Ministers.  When there is a <Col N="1624" /> choice between radical decisions and easy options, the Government will always choose the easy option.</P>
    <P>The inexorable rise in public spending is a hallmark of this Government.  The complacent consensus of establishment forces that have drawn Fianna Fáil and Labour together in Government are the forces driving up public spending and increasing the burden of taxation without improving standards of public service. Taxation consistently rises faster than inflation as the Government funk the hard decisions on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>New ideas with public expenditure implications constantly appear on the Government's agenda.  The recently announced, though long expected, shortfall of £800 million in EU funding for the National Plan revealed a host of new projects that demand additional local funding from our own resources.  The shortfall in the Tallaght hospital project funding alone amounts to £40 million. That is almost equivalent to the increase in this year's budget on the old reliables &mdash; petrol, drink and cigarettes.  Overall, the shortfall in EU funds will amount to a minimum of £130 million a year.</P>
    <P>It requires a strong Government with a clear focus to control public spending and this Government has neither.  In the last three budgets public spending rose by 21.9 per cent which is faster than the 7 per cent increase in consumer prices in the same period.  In order to have meaningful tax reform, public spending must be controlled, not reduced.  There is no evidence that the Government is pursuing this policy.  Ultimately, the lack of tax reform will confine the unemployed to their misery for an indefinite period as the Government ignores their plight.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to live in a fantasy world where a good public relations spin is more important than the facts.  Expensive hotels, good restaurants and plenty of foreign travel may insulate the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers for a while from the hard reality of life for many people but the people will not be fooled for long.  They passed a harsh interim judgment on the Government in <Col N="1625" /> the European and local elections this month.  They will pass an even harsher judgment when given the opportunity at the next general election.</P>

      <P>The Dáil term concluding this week will soon be seen as the turning point in the life of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  It will be a watershed, the juncture at which, despite all the programme managers, advisers and spin doctors, it could not camouflage the inherent defects and monumental misjudgments of which it is guilty.  From the mishandling of the Structural Funds to the Masri passports affair and from its petty and begrudging handling of what the Taoiseach called the &ldquo;Sutherland affair&rdquo; to its continued failure to tackle the underlying economic problems of excessive taxation on work which is destroying jobs here, the Government is shown to be bereft of any coherent or positive strategy for running the country.</P>
      <P>Recently, I thought the Government was drifting, now I believe it is running scared.  Perhaps it was the few voices from the Labour backbenches last night, but whatever the reason, everyone knows the Government is running scared of the electorate and the Dáil.  It is not prepared to give a commitment that if an important tribunal of inquiry set up by this House reports during the summer it will recall the Dáil.  The Taoiseach is scared and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs does not want openness and transparency no matter how many times he tells us it is in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the life and death situation in Northern Ireland.  We all earnestly wish for peace and an end to the growing cycle of random sectarian murders.  From a domestic point of view, we have to realise and understand the ever growing threat of Loyalist violence spilling over on this side of the Border on a horrendous scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this delicate and complex situation where words can be another lethal weapon, sadly the Taoiseach continues to demonstrate an imprecision with language which can often inflame the situation. <Col N="1626" /> The most recent example was his botched use of language in Boston where he again raised the possibility of joint authority.  Every sensible party to the search for a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland realises that this is not on.  The fundamental question now facing all of us regarding Northern Ireland is whether a permanent cessation of violence can be achieved and what are the preconditions for judging that possibility. I want to make it perfectly clear that it is not tolerable in any circumstances to allow Sinn Féin to be involved in any talks process without a verifiable disarming of their colleagues in arms in the IRA.</P>

      <P>We cannot allow a party to any talks or peace forum to have a discussion document in one hand at the negotiating table and an armalite in the other hand either under the table, outside the door or down the road.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs must spell this out very clearly.  We have had enough play acting from Sinn Féin which has strung out its alleged response to the Downing Street Joint Declaration for more than six months in order to maximise the publicity and the propaganda advantage to itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can rightly claim credit, and justifiably deserves plaudits, for negotiating the Downing Street Joint Declaration, a fair and balanced recognition of the rights and aspirations of Nationalists and Unionists alike in Northern Ireland.  However, as I stated at the time, the subsequent decision to remove section 31 and the Government's role in facilitating a visa for Mr. Adams to visit the United States were wrong.  These decisions showed serious errors of judgment by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers involved.  These moves have accorded Sinn Féin and its members a legitimacy they do not deserve.  It must be repeatedly stated that a political party which condones the use of violence and refuses to condemn outright the murder, terror and intimidation campaign of the <Col N="1627" /> IRA and which has clear links with that organisation cannot be treated as simply another political party.</P>
    <P>There are two bottom line realities which Sinn Féin and the Republican movement must accept: first, participation in any talks or peace process must have as a precondition and verifiable renunciation of the violence of the IRA and, second, in terms of moving forward and being accommodated in any way in a democratic process, there can be no change in the current status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of the people living there.</P>
    <P>Nationalism and Unionism are not compatible.  The thrust of the way forward in Northern Ireland must, therefore, be the creation of a balanced society, with balanced structures, which enables these fundamental differences to co-exist without one triumphing over the other.  We must be able to demonstrate that peaceful constitutional politics can work.  This means we must seek to make Northern Ireland a consensus society and a viable democracy for all the people living there.  To that end Northern Ireland must have its own constitution and bill of rights.  The fabric of society in Northern Ireland must be radically transformed to enable the Nationalist community to be so fully at ease that it will want to give that state its full allegiance and enjoy its proportionate share of power at the very highest levels.</P>
    <P>It is only through the creation of such a genuine bipolar society in Northern Ireland, where Nationalists and Unionists can feel fully, freely and equally at home, that progress can be made.  That objective must be the priority of the two sovereign Governments in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Ensuring that such an agenda can be successfully pursued will require a wholehearted security policy to deal with the extremists in both communities who will unfortunately but inevitably reject this compromise way forward, pressing instead for a total victory for their tribal and exclusive preferences of a British Northern Ireland on the one side or some form of united <Col N="1628" /> Ireland on the other side.  Both these options are a recipe for continued murder and strife and cannot be allowed to prevail.</P>
    <P>In that context, the security forces in Northern Ireland and the Republic are now faced with as great a threat from Loyalist terrorists as they faced from Republican terrorists for so long.  Apologists for Loyalist violence can no longer explain it simply in terms of being reactive to Republican atrocities.  The perpetrators of atrocities such as that in Loughinisland need no excuse whatsoever &mdash; they are blood thirsty sectarian killers who must not be allowed to cloak their evil deeds with any spurious mantle of political motivation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to what he called the &ldquo;Sutherland affair&rdquo;.  The manner in which the Government, particularly the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, have handled that issue has been most unethical and has shown a staggering disregard for the national interest.  If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs do not quickly wake up to reality and do the decent and honourable thing in terms of promoting Ireland's only candidate with any prospect of succeeding as the next President of the European Commission, the opportunity will be lost and will never come our way again.  It is the turn of a smaller country to secure a nominee to that post and also the turn of a person who does not come from the Socialist ranks, as Mr. Delors did.  The European Union works on a shared give and take basis and the opportunity exists for Ireland as one of the small countries to capitalise on the deadlock which has arisen in filling the post.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to read in a Reuters report yesterday that Mr. Sutherland has not even been contacted by the Government. How can we take seriously the comments made by the Taoiseach a few days ago that the Government would be prepared to put forward a nominee when he has not even spoken to the one person who has any chance of succeeding to that position?  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister <Col N="1629" /> for Foreign Affairs to adopt a helpless, passive position of waiting on other EU governments to take the initiative in this matter.  It is clear that if the Government sees merit in an Irish nominee securing the most powerful post in the European Union then it should stop sitting on its hands and take a real initiative in the matter.  It is high time the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs engaged in positive and proactive canvassing of his European Union counterparts and made it plain that Ireland is willing to nominate Mr. Sutherland, the GATT Director General, for the Commission Presidency and for the Irish Government to demonstrate real support and enthusiasm for him.</P>
    <P>The only thing preventing Mr. Sutherland from succeeding in becoming President of the European Union is the veto placed on him by his Government and country.  This is the only reason his name was not on the table in Corfu.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; whom I presume will contribute to the debate &mdash; say if his Department was contacted by representatives of the Spanish and Italian Governments last week and told that if there was a stalemate they would be prepared to support Mr. Sutherland?  Did any Foreign Minister indicate to him that he would be prepared to support Mr. Sutherland and what response did he give to him?  What is the position of the Danes on this matter? The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should answer these legitimate questions which I also asked a few days ago.</P>
    <P>During a week when this House is debating a so-called Ethics in Public Office Bill, I plead with the Government to do the right thing, to do what it ought to do in this vital area before it is too late.  This is what ethics is all about.  When this Bill and the Sutherland affair are compared one can see just how bizarre the entire situation is.  On the one hand, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government is so concerned with ensuring that the right thing is done in public life that it has promoted special legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, when the first <Col N="1630" /> opportunity arises to do the right thing, or do what they ought to do, they wilfully refuse.  The so-called ethics legislation will not paper over the serious omissions of this Government in its handling of the Masri passports affair either.  The Taoiseach asked earlier if we believed that Members of this House should be discriminated against merely because of that fact.  Of course they should not, but neither should Members of this House, because they sit around the Cabinet table, benefit by virtue of that very fact. That is the issue at the core of what is called the Masri passports affair.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party stand indicated in a special way on this issue.  That party got a record mandate for putting trust back into politics in November 1992, yet they appear to see nothing wrong with the obvious abuses and conflicts of the passports for investment transaction which took place in December 1992.  The Tánaiste on 1 June made a statement in which he said that the business migration scheme excluded the possibility of a soft loan, had to include a permanent and interested residency qualification, and also that any investment in such circumstances would have to be approved by one of the State agencies.  He made that statement on 1 June despite the fact that none of the criteria which the Tánaiste himself said were essential was met.  He was able to tell us, when he looked at the file, there was nothing wrong, nothing improper.  What would the Tánaiste say were he now sitting where I sit?  What did he say when Mr. Bernie Cahill went out to Kinsealy for a meeting?  I would not want to embarrass the Tánaiste by reading it out now, but I ask him to read what he had to say on that occasion.</P>
    <P>This was a transaction that never should have occurred, given that the minority Fianna Fáil administration of December 1992, which completed the Masri passports transaction, was in power in a purely caretaker capacity and should not have taken any policy decision of that kind.  It is obvious that there was a total conflict of interest on the part of the Taoiseach, given that he was and <Col N="1631" /> remains the single largest shareholder in the firm which stood to gain massively from the passports for pet food transaction. It is quite clear that a range of conditions that should underline a bona fide investment by a non-national, including establishment of residency and the making of a permanent investment, was not complied with.</P>
    <P>The involvement of a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers in facilitating this passports for investment project politically stinks to high heaven.  How was it that the present Minister for the Environment was able to give a glowing character reference to a person he had met once only, whom he had been told was going to invest in a project in the midlands, yet he did not even ask the name of that company.  Is it not extraordinary that a Minister who sits around a Cabinet table would so easily give a glowing reference to a foreigner he had met only once?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In a speech on 1 June the Tánaiste <Col N="1632" /> spelled out the terms which should govern the business migration scheme. He said it did not cover soft loans, that it involved a residency requirement, yet he now knows there was a soft loan given and that the residency condition was not observed.  Still he sees nothing wrong with it.  He was able to declare he had seen the files and had found nothing out of order.</P>
    <P>There is a huge difference between something that is legal and something that is right, as I said when I spoke yesterday on the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994.  There is a huge distinction to be drawn between them.  The Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party has a lot to learn.  I was amused to hear him criticise the Progressive Democrats in this House yesterday when he stated that we had not included the word &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; in any of our Government provisions.  This betrays a fatal flaw in his approach.  He is simply incorrect.  The October 1991 programme for Government we negotiated with Fianna Fáil included detailed provisions for a register of Oireachtas Members' interests and a code of behaviour and disclosure for the directors and executives of State companies.  The real point the Tánaiste fails to understand is that ethics is not about words or rhetoric but about behaviour.  Ethics is about doing the right thing, and merely writing down particular things does not make them happen.  Surely the Tánaiste realises there is no salvation in prayer without good works?  When in Government my party never flinched.  We were never afraid to take tough decisions and we were not afraid to walk away when it was no longer tenable to remain.</P>
    <P>I want to reject also the criticisms the Tánaiste levelled at my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, and those levelled at my colleague Deputy Desmond O'Malley by the Taoiseach this morning and yesterday in the debate. These Deputies have been fearless in endeavouring to highlight grave errors of judgment and wrongdoing and will continue to do so.  No amount of abuse will intimidate them or me and my party. I do not care how often I hear people tell <Col N="1633" /> me it is holier than thou to raise issues of that kind.  If we want to preserve decent standards in public life and to preserve basic democratic values, our job is to ensure that the Government of the day is accountable, to ask the hard questions and not be deflected through fear of being attacked or abused in so doing.  The bottom line for this country is that we tolerate a code of practice, a culture and behaviour in public life which would be totally unacceptable in most modern democracies.  That is a terrible pity.</P>
    <P>As this House faces into its summer recess, it is obvious it will be a summer of increasing industrial discontent and of uncertainty for thousands of workers in a range of State enterprises, in TEAM and Irish Steel in particular.  It is quite clear that there is a variety of reasons for the crises which now assail these companies, but I suggest there is one fundamental feature common not only to those companies but to numerous other enterprises which is steadily eating away at their viability and survival.  That is the cancer of crippling levels of taxation on work and unemployment in our economy. At the end of the day we cannot repair or maintain aeroplanes, make steel, or produce any service or commodity if we cannot do so in an internationally competitive market.  We cannot do that since pay levels simply must be higher than they need be otherwise because of the necessity for workers to discharge a tax liability to the Exchequer of nearly 60 per cent and for employers to pay a range of additional charges on employment.  The problem has been so long lasting and pervasive and so much has been written about it that it is difficult to bring home the true extent of the employment-destroying cancer that payroll taxation now constitutes. What I am stating has become a political cliché and, therefore, tends to be regarded as no more than a ritual comment.  If we merely perceive the problem in those superficial terms, we will never wake up to the disaster befalling us.</P>
    <P>I want to cite a particular example to drive home the point.  It is a pertinent <Col N="1634" /> and timely example bearing in mind the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus.  It is quite clear for all to see that the real problem at TEAM Aer Lingus is that it is unable to compete with its international rivals for contracts to repair and overhaul aircraft. Its costs are simply way out of line and its payroll costs are the main reason. How out of line are they?  Let us look at the operations of the only other aircraft maintenance operation in this country, that of Shannon Aerospace at Shannon Airport, where the wages of the workers &mdash; the basic annual wage being just £11,500 &mdash; are only half those at TEAM Aer Lingus.  Clearly that wage level at Shannon Aerospace is not a high or excessive one but, even at that wage, Shannon Aerospace is not competitive with many of its international competitors for aircraft maintenance work, though clearly is a lot more competitive than TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The really frightening factor about the Shannon operation is that, even at that modest pay level, single workers there pay nearly 50 per cent tax on that less than average wage, that is 48 per cent income tax and 7.5 per cent PRSI.  How scandalous and demoralising it is for that company and its workers to pay such penal levels of tax on such modest wages. This is a microcosm of all that is wrong with our economy.  It is quite plain that the management of Shannon Aerospace have their finger on the pulse, that they accept the realities of the international market-place in which they must operate and are endeavouring to keep their overall costs competitive internationally.  It is equally obvious that they have a first-class workforce prepared to work for modest pay rates.  That operation has been undermined not by any outside force but by a factor imposed by our Government; it is being undermined by penal taxation levels that demoralise the workforce and, in turn, threaten the competitiveness of that company in the global market-place.  That is the cancer at the heart of the Irish economy and, unless we tackle that cancer at source by cutting the penal levels of tax on work and enterprise, <Col N="1635" /> we will never begin to overcome the unemployment crisis in our society.</P>
    <P>That is part of my reason for strongly criticising the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I am opposed to centralised wage bargaining generally and, faced with the crisis of unemployment, that must be the priority.  If we are to have such an approach, and I reject it, at the very least the unemployed should be represented at the table.  The market place realities should mean that any pay bargaining is conducted on a localised basis and in accordance with what different enterprises and activities can afford.  Ability to pay must remain the criteria.</P>
    <P>When we discussed the Ethics in Public Office Bill this week I raised serious questions surrounding awarding public contracts.  This is an area where there should be much greater transparency and openness. In particular I want to raise, as I did yesterday, the awarding of a tender worth £4 million for the subcontract element of the Tallaght Hospital.  What procedures were followed to ensure that the successful tenderers had their tax affairs and company registration office filing requirements in order?  What procedures were followed to ensure that the successful tenderers had a profitable trading record and how many years were investigated?  How many of the successful tenderers received, in the last five years, special mitigation of tax liabilities which they were unable to pay?  What successful procedures were followed to ensure that the successful tenderers have sufficient experience and competent staff to ensure that they can undertake and complete the relevant contract work?  Are the financial resources of all the successful tenderers sufficiently adequate and financially secure to ensure that they are capable of undertaking and completing the contracts? I would appreciate if a member of the Government would respond to the concerns I raised and expressed privately with the Minister for Health because it is causing enormous concern among certain companies here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Many in business believe we do not have a fair society or a fair chance to compete for public work.  There are companies carrying out public work who do not have tax clearance certificates or if they do they should not have them because of their tax liabilities to the Revenue Commissioners.  Why do these companies continue to get more State or local authority work when their tax affairs are not in order?</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the purpose of the new urban renewal scheme is to revitalise decaying urban areas and I support such a scheme.  Will the Taoiseach state why a portion of land on the west side of Portlaoise was designated for urban renewal under the scheme when it had not been built on?  There is now a considerable number of buildings on that land.  I want an assurance from the Government that in designating areas local traders and chambers of commerce will be consulted and that we will not have the designation of green field sites as in Portlaoise, Carlow and other areas. I asked the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, to give me an assurance on that a few weeks ago and he refused.  Also I want an assurance that the friends and associates of members of the Government will not have their land designated under the scheme.  We need more openness and transparency to which the Programme for a Partnership Government refers.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric from the Labour Party is one thing, the reality is another.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Government that if the Beef Tribunal reports in the summer that the Dáil will be recalled for a full and complete discussion of its report.  This morning the Taoiseach refused to give me that assurance.  As I said in my opening remarks, a few months ago the Government was drifting but it is now running scared.</P>
    <P>It is time that the man who sought to put trust into politics and justice into economics began to stand up for himself and his party.  Trust &mdash; some misplaced &mdash; was rested with the Labour Party when it went into Government in January 1993 <Col N="1637" /> but its members have been keeping their mouths closed and their heads down since they assumed office.  All they want is to remain in office.  I put it to the Labour Party in the week it is promoting its Ethics in Public Office Bill that ethics is about doing the right thing.  Ethics is about not being afraid to walk away from office if it is no longer tenable.  The Labour Party carries a special responsibility to ensure there is openness, transparency, equity and fair play and that their pals do not get all the favours which frequently makes many people in business and the public cynical about our political system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Dáil is going into recess this year a week earlier than last year is not without significance. Rarely have I seen a Government so anxious for the arrival of the summer recess so that they can be free from what it clearly regards as the irritant of having to account to the Dáil.  Rarely before has a Government been so dramatically transformed within such a short period.  The Government with the biggest majority in the history of the State, the Government whose members believed that they could do no wrong, the Government whose own arrogance has been a major contributing factor to its own problems, is now limping, bruised and bleeding, and desperate for the relief of the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The anxiety for the recess is no doubt intensified by the knowledge that there is a growing list of political time-bombs which are likely to land on the Cabinet table over the next few months and which are likely to add further strain to the creaking hulk of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the mock heroics last night of the northside two by two, the Government's intransigence threatens to turn the TEAM crisis into an unprecedented industrial disaster.  Cork faces a crisis of almost as great a proportion with Irish Steel.  The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry is reported to be imminent and given the conflicting positions they adopted, it cannot vindicate the Taoiseach and the <Col N="1638" /> Tánaiste.  A Government decision on the proposal by Cable and Wireless to acquire a large stake in Telecom Éireann is due this summer.  The High Court is due to give its judgment in the claim by married women for arrears of alleviation payments &mdash; a decision which the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, claims would cost the Government more than £340 million.  There are reports that a case bearing similarities to the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case is before the courts.  More details will be published of the cutbacks in the National Development Plan because of the botched handling of the European funds issue.  Who can say that there will not be more disclosures on the passports for sale scandal?</P>
    <P>Individually any of these items could threaten the stability of the Government: collectively they constitute a minefield which could blow the Coalition out of the water.  Coupled with the poor performance of both Fianna Fáil and Labour in the recent elections and the defections in last night's vote, it is clear that the common assumption that this Government would serve its full term of office can no longer be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>What has been most disappointing about this Government during its first 18 months in office has been the failure of the strong Labour presence at the Cabinet table to make this Government different in any significant way from the administrations which went before it.  It is true that the Labour presence, initially anyway, led to some welcome reforms such as the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the liberalisation of the laws on contraception, but even in this social area the Government appears to have run out of steam, with no sign of the promised legislation arising from the X case and the divorce referendum deferred again and again.</P>
    <P>Who can point to a single issue in the economic area where this Government has adopted a position or taken a decision that might not have also been taken by the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats administration or the minority Fianna Fáil Government which went before that?  Has the Labour presence <Col N="1639" /> led to a more sensitive handling of the TEAM dispute?  There is not much sign of that.  Indeed, it is a testament to the feebleness of the Labour presence at the Cabinet that Ministers Spring, Quinn, Howlin, Taylor and Higgins were unable to persuade their Fianna Fáil colleagues to accept a totally innocuous motion on the TEAM crisis calling merely for a round table discussion to try to find a solution.  Has the Labour presence led to any new radical approach to the unemployment problem or new measures to secure an equal distribution of wealth? There is no evidence of that.</P>
    <P>Immediately prior to the 1992 general election, a member of the Labour Party in Longford was outraged at the suggestion of socialist leanings by his party.  &ldquo;At no given time&rdquo;, he declared indignantly on Morning Ireland &ldquo;were Labour ever a left wing party&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the basis of Labour's performance in Government so far, who could deny the truth of those words?  Far from being in partnership with Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party has now been almost totally assimilated into the political culture which the Tánaiste spoke of in such withering terms in the dying days of the last Dáil.  I presume it was the Tánaiste the Taoiseach was referring to when he mentioned that some years ago there was much personal abuse.</P>
    <P>As we await the report of the beef tribunal, it is worth recalling some of the Tánaiste's words then.  He said:</P>
    <P>I believe one political party in this House has gone so far down the road of blindness to standards and of blindness to the people they are supposed to represent that it is impossible to see how anyone could support them in the future without seeing them first undergo the most radical transformation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring's remarks were fully in tune with the public mood and without a doubt contributed to the success of his party in the subsequent general election. Following the election, however, and without the slightest hint of transformation <Col N="1640" /> on the part of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Spring suddenly found it possible not only to support but to enter into coalition with the party he had so recently and so vociferously chastised &mdash; a case of the blind leading the blind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring should take note of the recent electoral response to that u-turn, most particularly the response in Dublin South Central and he should be prepared for a similar response at the next general election.  The outcome of the European elections and the two by-elections represented a clear warning shot across the bows of the Government and the clearest indication yet that the patience of the public is running out over the failure of the Government to deliver on its promises of real political change.</P>
    <P>No matter what positive gloss it may try to put on it, the real loser in the elections was the Labour Party.  Not only did its vote collapse in Dublin South Central, but by transferring far more heavily to Democratic Left than to its Government partners, Labour voters clearly indicated to the party leadership that they did not want Labour in government with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The enthusiasm with which Labour cooperated with Fianna Fáil in denying for 18 months the people of Dublin South Central and Mayo West the right to have full representation in the Dáil and its willingness not to ask awkward questions about the passports for sale affair suggests that far from Fianna Fáil being forced to undergo a radical transformation, it is Labour which has changed and changed for the worse.</P>
    <P>Those who hoped that this Government would deliver on real political change have been bitterly disappointed. Nowhere has the performance of the Government been more disappointing than in regard to unemployment.  While there has been some small reduction in the numbers on the live register this is probably due more to renewed emigration than to any policy initiatives by this Government.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we will have a series of Government speakers coming in here over the next two days painting a <Col N="1641" /> picture of an economy in boom.  There is no doubt that there has been a series of reports, such as the recent ESRI report, which point to a number of improved economic indicators, but unless steps are taken to begin a genuine process of wealth transfer and the implementation of an alternative industrial strategy, there is little guarantee that the poor and unemployed will benefit from the increase in economic growth forecast in the ESRI report and every danger that the unemployed and those on low pay and social welfare will be left even further behind.  The jobless regard talk of &ldquo;an economic boom&rdquo; as a sick joke when unemployment is still at almost 300,000 and when, even if the most optimistic targets are met, there would be still more than 200,000 on the dole by the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>While there has been evidence of an economic upturn for some time, it is clear that the benefits are being shared disproportionately. During the past year many firms reported record profits, the two main banking groups alone raking in almost £550 million in profits; the Stock Exchange has experienced a boom and farming incomes have bounced back.</P>
    <P>The other side of this picture is workers having to accept only token pay increases, the PAYE sector still bearing a grossly disproportionate share of the tax burden and £50 million being extracted from the sick and the unemployed through the taxation of benefits.</P>
    <P>The economic policies pursued by the Government have led to the emergence of three distinct economic tiers.  At the top are a small wealthy elite who are getting even richer; in the middle are the majority who continue to struggle to make ends meet; and at the bottom a substantial minority made up of the unemployed, the aged and the sick, who are in danger of falling even further behind.</P>
    <P>If the ESRI's most optimistic forecasts are accurate &mdash; as we all hope they will prove to be &mdash; it is essential that the growth in wealth is directed at those areas where it is most needed.  A key economic indicator in any society must be the numbers <Col N="1642" /> of people in productive, well paid jobs.  Irrespective of other indicators, Ireland cannot be regarded as being in good economic health as long as there are hundreds of thousands of people without work.</P>
    <P>Despite the supposed commitment of the Labour Party to the public sector, the pattern of privatisation started by the Fianna Fáil/PD Government has continued.  The fiasco of the Greencore/Davy affair has been followed by the apparent determination to privatise the Trustees Savings Banks, despite the fact that this will effectively sound the death knell for the development of &ldquo;a vigorous third banking force from within the state sector&rdquo; which was promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>It seems that Telecom Eireann is now to be the next target and it is now clear that what is involved is not a modest proposal to establish a new joint venture between Telecom and Cable and Wireless but a plan to allow the British multinational to acquire almost half of Telecom's business.  The strategy, it now seems, is to change Telecom into a mere holding company and to establish a totally new company in which Cable and Wireless would have a 40 per cent share to carry on the day to day business of providing telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>This would be privatisation by another name and would clearly conflict with the pledge given by the Tánaiste in May of last year that any attempt to privatise Telecom would lead to a break up of the Coaliation Government.  When the issue became a matter of public controversy in March last the Minister, Deputy Cowen, kicked to touch and asked the board of Telecom to examine the proposals and report to him within six months.  We suggested at the time that the purpose of this exercise was to allow the matter to be deferred until the elections were safely out of the way.  Now that the elections are over I expect that the Cable and Wireless attempt to grab a substantial share of Telecom's market will again make its way to the top of the Minister's agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> This Government has also continued to pile on the tax agony.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, put the political gun to the head of the new county councils in Dublin and forced them to bring in service charges.  Dublin Corporation will almost certainly receive the same treatment next year.  In addition to the new service charges, thousands of families living in modest dwellings will now find themselves in the residential property tax net for the first time, as a result of changes introduced in the budget.  The Government's deplorable decision to subject unemployment benefit to taxation means that the tax take from the sick and the unemployed will now be the equivalent of the income tax take from the entire farming sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government continues to deny tens of thousands of women arrears of the social welfare transitional payments to which the European Court has said they were clearly entitled.  Irrespective of any other issue, the scandalous manner in which the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has handled this affair would justify voting against the Estimates before us.  It is not just that the Minister tried to use every device and strategem to attempt to deny Irish women moneys to which the European Court decided they were entitled, it is also the manner in which he attempted to draw a veil of silence over the issue by refusing to give information to which Members of the Dáil were entitled and &mdash; when this failed &mdash; his attempts to mislead the Dáil and the public and to abuse me and journalists outside this House.</P>
    <P>The failure of the farming sector to make a reasonable contribution to the Exchequer continues to be a political scandal which, it seems, no Government has the courage to tackle.  Between 1989 and 1992 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £3,122 to £3,662. This represents an increase of £540, or 10 per cent &mdash; more than twice the rate at which wages and salaries increased in the same period.  In the same few years <Col N="1644" /> the average tax paid by farmers actually decreased by £72 or 9.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Farmers now pay less than one fifth of the average tax bill of a PAYE worker. Despite this, the Taoiseach apparently thinks that farmers are overtaxed as he told the recent Fianna Fáil agricultural conference in Kilkenny that the &ldquo;future should bring an easing of the tax burden, which could only be of benefit to the farming community&rdquo;.  The Fianna Fáil-Labour recipe for tax equity is load the burden on the sick and the unemployed, give more tax concessions to wealthy farmers.</P>
    <P>Despite our considerable economic difficulties, the single biggest problem facing our people remains the conflict in Northern Ireland; the biggest challenge facing democratic politicians is the search for a lasting solution.  The Government must be aware of the widespread disappointment that the initial promise of the Downing Street Declaration is being trampled into the ground by the continuing violence of both the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries.  Certainly the expectations were pitched too high.  The extravagant claims of &ldquo;peace in a week&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace by Christmas&rdquo; were not just foolish and misplaced, but irresponsible in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Together with these claims, other less public claims were being made within the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  The belief was encouraged &mdash; and not just by Sinn Féin/IRA &mdash; that the Hume-Adams agreement provided the basis for the United Ireland to be arrived at on the Hong Kong model.  The belief was further encouraged that Hume-Adams enjoyed the support of the Irish Government and that it was only a matter of time before the Nationalist objective would be realised.  The prospect of a United Ireland in our lifetime was held up as a real, if not immediate, prospect. Understandably Hume-Adams alarmed Unionists.  It raised fears and uncertainties which the Loyalist paramilitaries were quick to exploit and which some Unionist politicians were eager to confirm for reasons of self preservation.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Declaration, <Col N="1645" /> meanwhile, failed to satisfy many Nationalists.  The leader of the SDLP formally welcomed it, but he did not actively support it in the way that Sinn Féin/IRA actively opposed it.  Mr. Hume made many television appearances assuring us of Mr. Adams's good intentions.  Mr. Adams led the campaign on the ground to undermine the declaration.  Together they continued to put forward Hume-Adams as the real answer to the Irish question.</P>
    <P>This has led to the situation described by Arthur Aughey &mdash; a lecturer in politics in the University of Ulster &mdash; in the June issue of <i>Fortnight magazine</i> in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The trend towards clarification, or translation of the declaration into the language of Hume-Adams confirms an impression of two forms of political communication running together in a maddening babble.  It becomes increasingly difficult, not only for those outside the political elite but even within it to distinguish sense from nonsense. This is a profoundly destablising condition.</P>
    <P>Mr. Aughey continues:</P>
    <P>The declaration is a masterpiece of ambiguity &mdash; though considered ambiguity &mdash; in acknowledging complex realities and trying to build constructively and, as far as possible, consensually upon them.  The problem with Mr. Adams and Mr. Hume is that they see these ambiguities of the declaration in terms of the old unfinished business.</P>
    <P>For them the pure logic of the declaration's (green) language is still entangled in a contingent empirical detail &mdash; the principle of majority consent in Northern Ireland.  The calls for &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; for a new &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;, for &ldquo;realising the potential&rdquo;, &ldquo;moving the process forward&rdquo;, and so on, represent attempts to circumvent that detail, to foster the triumph of destiny over practicality.  They are calls to pretend that things are other than what they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> The failure of the two Governments to follow up on the unique momentum for political progress created by the Downing Street Declaration has brought further uncertainty and instability to Northern Ireland.  The sectarian murder gangs have been only too willing to exploit this atmosphere &mdash; as we saw in the past two weeks on the Shankill Road and in Loughinisland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister were entitled to the praise they received for their successful negotiation of the declaration.  The warmth of the reception the Taoiseach received from all parties in this House on his return from London last December was virtually unprecedented.  However, I do not believe either of them merit much praise for their handling of the situation since then.</P>
    <P>Given that the Taoiseach and Mr. Major put so much effort into the preparation of the Downing Street Declaration, it is all the more surprising that they should be prepared to put the whole project at risk by failing to follow through.  In the six months since the declaration was signed there has been little evidence of any urgency in the approach of either Government.  Months have been lost awaiting a response from Sinn Féin-IRA, yet there is little evidence &mdash; even at this stage &mdash; that a cessation of violence will be forthcoming.  All of the time the body count mounts and fear is entrenched.</P>
    <P>I was always apprehensive that the intensive efforts which the Government has put into attempting to entice Sinn Féin-IRA into the political process would result in further alienation of Unionist opinion.  I am afraid that my fears were well grounded.  Mr. Adams lavishes praise on virtually every speech the Taoiseach makes.  He talks cosily of the Dublin Government being well aware of the timeframe for consideration by Sinn Féin-IRA of the Downing Street Declaration. The Taoiseach condemns individual atrocities by the IRA but fails to utter a word of criticism of the political equivocation of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The net result of all this has been to <Col N="1647" /> create among even moderate Unionists the impression that the Government and Sinn Féin are political allies, working hand in glove in pursuit of a common political agenda.  This is exactly the impression Mr. Adams wishes to create.</P>
    <P>The problem has been compounded by a carelessness or looseness with words on the part of the Taoiseach when it comes to Northern Ireland.  It was a serious error of judgment for the Taoiseach, within 48 hours of the Loughinisland massacre to use his visit to the United States to launch a demand for a form of cross Border authority with executive powers.  It was inevitable that his interview would be seen as a demand for a form of joint authority over Northern Ireland &mdash; a demand which, I believe, is totally unworkable.</P>
    <P>Rather than pursuing unachievable objectives and workable solutions the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister should use the declaration as the framework for the development of political structures within Northern Ireland which would be capable of winning broad cross community support.  The matter is one of absolute urgency.  The latest disclosure that the framework document on which the two Governments were working may not be ready until after the summer is a further setback.  With people being murdered almost on a daily basis these sort of delays are simply unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The situation cannot be allowed to deteriorate any further.  The paramilitaries must not be allowed to set the agenda, or to exercise a veto of violence on political progress.  The primacy of democratic politics must be asserted, and democratic politicians must be obliged to face up to their responsibilities.  The first of these is to build on the achievements of the Declaration by giving practical expression to its democratic sentiments to which all parties, except the terrorists, subscribe.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to comment on the special Sinn Féin delegate conference at which, it is claimed, a formal decision will be made on the Downing Street Declaration. Once more Sinn Féin-IRA is <Col N="1648" /> taking the Irish people for fools.  The dogs in the street know that this conference is a farce, staged for the benefit of publicity, and will merely rubber stamp a decision taken by the IRA.  The decision is widely known, the IRA does not accept the Declaration, but will neither formally accept or reject it.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the IRA has no intention of renouncing violence.  It is holding out for a refashioned declaration that more closely resembles the Hume-Adams agreement.  The IRA will continue killing to get its way, and Sinn Féin's pretentions to democracy must be seen in this light.</P>
    <P>This Government must now make it clear to the IRA, and to those guarantors of Sinn Féin's good intentions, that IRA violence will not be tolerated and that there is no political dividend for murder and that neither Loyalist nor Nationalist gangs will be allowed to veto progress or set the agenda.</P>

      <P>This adjournment debate on the 1994 Estimates provides an excellent opportunity to take stock &mdash; to review the emerging economic and budget position in 1994 and to look at the prospects for next year and the medium-term.</P>
      <P>Ireland is currently among the best economic performers in the industrialised world with strong growth, rising employment, low inflation, a substantial balance of payments surplus and a level of interest rates which is the lowest since the late 1970's.  This performance, which has resulted from the consistent pursuit of sensible policies, reflects strong exports and improved competitiveness based on a wide degree of consensus on economic and social policy.  Yet, high unemployment continues to be the major economic and social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background of significant economic progress, coupled with the continuing challenge of unemployment, that I want to look at three issues.  I would like first to set out Ireland's key national economic objectives; second, to summarise the progress made in achieving these goals in recent <Col N="1649" /> years; and, third, to discuss the prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>Our main economic objective is to achieve the maximum possible sustainable increase in the number of people at work.  A secondary, but still important, goal is to realise the fastest possible sustainable rate of improvement <i>per capita</i> living standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1993, my Department has acted in conformity with the Equal Opportunities Policy and Guidelines for the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I intimated in reply to a similar Question on 23 March 1994, my Department was set up by the transfer to it of certain functions, together with the staff engaged on those functions, from other Departments.  On that basis, all but one of the Department's staff at senior level were assigned from other Departments and I had no role or function in that arrangement.  Only one senior civil servant, <Col N="1650" /> at Assistant Secretary level, was appointed since I took office and that appointment was made on the recommendation of the Top Level Appointments Committee.</P>
    <P>In the case of promotions within my Department, I have to date promoted eight women and two men.  Those selections for promotions were made on the basis of merit with due regard to seniority. Since assuming office as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I have made six new appointments, two of whom are women and four are men.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor the gender balance in my Department within the framework of the general policies relating to appointments and promotions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree he suffered some embarrassment at a recent committee meeting to discuss the Estimates for his Department when it was pointed out that the officials accompanying him were all male?  Will he agree that is the wrong signal to send out when this is a matter of concern in relation to appointments in other Departments? How can he lecture or advise other Departments when his Department is so deficient in this respect?  Will he agree that excuses can be found for almost everything and his job is not to find excuses for this but to find a remedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding whether I was embarrassed on the occasion of the committee meeting, like the Deputy I am a politician of long standing and as a breed we are not easily embarrassed.  My senior staff are provided by the Civil Service and that is a matter over which I do not have direct control.  When I saw all the officials at that meeting were men, I was tempted to sack some of them and replace them with women, but I had to refrain from taking that step.  In the Civil Service few women hold positions at top level and very few hold senior positions. That is regrettable.  Steps are being taken to remedy that.  I encourage the appointment of women at senior level and I look forward to improvements in this area throughout the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1651" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that politicians have to have a thick neck and if he was not embarrassed on that occasion his neck is even thicker than mine.  If the Minister was not embarrassed other people were embarrassed for him.  Will he agree that he ought to make changes to bring about gender balance as quickly as possible?  Any pressure he attempts to put on other Departments to bring this about will be looked upon as a cynical exercise because he has not sorted out the problem in his Department.  That makes a nonsense of the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in the Department's title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was embarrassed on that occasion my embarrassment was considerably reduced by the fact that the Fine Gael Front Bench Members present were also all male.  Appointments to all levels of the service, excluding a small number of exceptional cases, are made through the procedures of the Local Appointments Commission, which was set up some decades ago.  Various entrenched historical reasons account for the fact that very few women hold high level positions in the Civil Service.  It is regrettable that that is the position.  I assure the Deputy that I encourage the Local Appointments Commission &mdash; I have had meetings with members of it &mdash; to promote women of ability to senior ranking positions.  In the Programme for Government the Government made clear its position on the advancement of women. At an early stage it adopted a quota provision for the appointment of women over a four year period to State boards and it set an objective of 40 per cent, as recommended in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. The Government has signalled its position and I look forward to progress on this issue in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The doubling of funds allocated to the Family Mediation Service in my Department's Estimates for 1994 will allow for the employment of additional mediators and the opening of a second centre.  This centre will be in Limerick.  The proposal is to avail of mediators on as wide a geographical basis as possible using the existing Dublin centre and the new Limerick centre as facilitators in the process. These expansion and development plans will be in place very shortly.</P>
      <P>The information available to me is that our Family Mediation Service has an excellent relationship with the corresponding service in Northern Ireland and that both services have benefited from regular contacts between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a doubling of funds for the Family Mediation Service, but the total amount available for the service is £300,000.  Will he agree that having regard to the increasing rate of marital breakdown &mdash; it is estimated that five marriages break down every day &mdash; that the amount available for this essential service is ludicrous? I welcome the setting up of the new office in Limerick.  Will the Minister agree that people have to travel many miles from other large centres of population, such as Cork and Galway, and smaller centres of population to avail of this essential service and it is time something more was done in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The money provided for the Family Mediation Service this year &mdash; £300,000 &mdash; is more than double the <Col N="1653" /> £124,000 allocated in 1993.  Since it was instituted in 1986, the Family Mediation Service has been confined to one location in Dublin on an experimental basis.  That has now been made permanent and a signal expansion is taking place this year, not only by having an additional second permanent centre but also by a means which I hope to introduce, of using private mediators at other locations throughout the country.  There are plans in preparation in my Department to do that.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Currie that it not just a question of acquiring premises and pumping in money.  The build-up of a mediation service is more complex than that.  It requires the availability of a relatively small group of skilled and trained mediators.  Many are being trained by the Family Mediation Service and I hope that procedure will extend and continue.  It is not a system that can easily be duplicated or tripled and quadrupled.  It has to be expanded gradually.  I anticipate that, subject to budgetary requirements and the availability of the specialised professional skilled staff coming on-stream from time to time, I will be able to expand this service to the maximum possible extent.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the remarkable work and achievements of the Family Mediation Service in Dublin since its institution in 1986 &mdash; it provides a much more extensive service than the one in Northern Ireland referred to by Deputy Currie.  The service provided in Northern Ireland, which does excellent work, is limited; it provides a service in respect of children only.  It is a voluntary organisation, not State-run as the family mediation service here is.  I thank the Deputy for his support and assure the House that it is my hope and intention, subject to budgetary constraints and availability of personnel, to extend the service as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not praise the mediation service in Northern Ireland.  I suggested that co-operation would benefit North and South, particularly in Donegal and other areas adjacent to the <Col N="1654" /> Border.  There may be a case for an exchange of personnel in some areas and I ask the Minister to give that some consideration.</P>
      <P>On the more general question, many people think that any serious consideration of divorce is farcical without having a proper mediation service in place.  These two matters go hand in hand and the Minister ought to be making available as much money as possible to strengthen the mediation services.  The fact that the Minister is now suggesting employing private mediators, while welcome as a means of filling the vacuum, underlines how unsatisfactory our service is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the service is unsatisfactory.  It is extremely satisfactory and highly professional.  It works very well and is doubling its capacity this year in terms of centres which is a very valuable improvement.  In addition I am drawing up plans to use private mediators on contract throughout the country where it is difficult for people to get to one of the centres in Dublin or Limerick.  There has been a major expansion since 1986.</P>
      <P>Voluntary organisations, apart from the Family Mediation Service, do excellent work in this area.  Not all the mediation is confined to the State-run Family Mediation Service which has an important role to play in training professional staff.  Without that professional staff, expansion of this service on any basis would not be possible.</P>
      <P>I take on board what Deputy Currie said regarding the value of consultation and exchange of views and experience with the service in Northern Ireland and I will be very happy to pass that suggestion on.  I understand from the Family Mediation Service that it already has a very good relationship with the corresponding service in the North and that exchange of contracts already take place. I will suggest it should be expanded to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <P>As already indicated in reply to questions on 24 May 1994, the timing of the referendum will, if necessary, take into account the outcome of the decision of the court in the case pending concerning provisions in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and it will take into account progress made with implementation of the Government's wide-ranging programme of family law matters.  The referendum is now more likely to be held in 1995 than this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's programme of family law measures, which takes into account, among other matters, the White Paper on Marital Breakdown is well <Col N="1656" /> advanced.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, is awaiting Report Stage in the House, having been dealt with by the Committee on Legislation and Security.  That Bill deals with a very wide range of matters including age of marriage, notice of marriage, as well as financial powers of the court to provide for all marital breakdown short of domestic divorce.  The Maintenance Bill, 1994, having passed Second Stage, is before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and will facilitate the recovery of maintenance on an international scale.</P>
    <P>A Bill to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage of drafting.  As part also of the Government's programme, a Bill to amend and extend the provisions of the law regarding protection of persons from domestic violence is in the course of being drafted.</P>
    <P>My Department is, at present, examining proposals for legislation to provide simplified arrangements for voluntary conveyances of family homes to joint ownership.  The aim of such provision would be to enable couples to give full and effective recognition to the contributions made by the spouse who works in the home.</P>
    <P>The Government has recently made important decisions on the tax and social welfare aspects of marital breakdown. It has decided that property transfers between spouses in the context of marital breakdown should be dealt with on the same basis as transfers between spouses.  The necessary legislative proposals are being prepared.  The Government also decided that changes in social welfare should be made to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed following separation, annulment or divorce. The necessary legislative proposals in this area are also being prepared.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional funding has been provided in my Department's Estimates for 1994 for the development and expansion of legal aids, mediation and marriage counselling.  The details of those Estimates were discussed by the <Col N="1657" /> Select Committee on Legislation and Security on 15 June last.</P>
    <P>The House, I think, will agree that the Government's programme of family law measures is a comprehensive and wide-ranging response to the problem of marital breakdown.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given a lengthy list of the legislation he hopes to put through the House, but it has nothing to do with the question he was asked. Does he think that putting all that information before us will hide the fact that nothing has been done about the format of the constitutional amendment to be put to the people?  During the debate on marriage breakdown in March 1993 the Minister said he would welcome views from inside and outside this House.  Has he heard views and, if so, what does he think of them?  What will be the formula of the proposed constitutional amendment to be put to the people?  Will we have an opportunity to debate this matter in the House so that the Opposition parties, who are very supportive of what the Minister is doing, will have an input before the amendment is put to the people?</P>

      <P>I much appreciate the promised support of Deputy Keogh and her party on the divorce referendum.  The Government, in good time, will consider what the format of the divorce referendum will be.  I will ensure that when the legislation is introduced there will be an opportunity to discuss it.  This is a matter for decision by the Government. We have consulted widely on the issue and I will bring the matter to Government at the appropriate time.  It will be discussed and the Government will reach its decision which will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I understand there is a difficulty between the Government parties on the divorce referendum &mdash; that is acknowledged by all concerned.  Any offer of co-operation with the Government from my party is contingent on knowing what precisely the Government <Col N="1658" /> intends to propose by way of a change to the Constitution.  Does the Minister intend to consult further with the Opposition parties on the wording of the proposed referendum and constitutional change?  He has had a first round of consultations with the parties; does he intend to have a further round of consultations, having considered the presentations made to him and presumably the views expressed by his party and the Fianna Fáil Party?  Will the Minister be a little more precise about the timetable for a referendum?  Does he expect it will be held in the spring or the autumn of next year?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any difficulties between the Government parties on the holding of the divorce referendum. On the contrary, both parties agreed in the Programme for Government that a referendum on divorce will be held.  I cannot be more specific as to when exactly in 1995 the referendum will be held.  That depends on a number of issues, not least of which is the matter already referred to on more than one occasion, namely, the pending challenge to the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  The issue of divorce is inextricably bound up with the judicial separation position and we must await determination of the proceedings on the challenge to that Act.  I understand the hearing of that case is due to take place in the High Court next week and the likelihood is that a quick decision will be given.  We do not know whether that decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court, but we must await the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a round of consultations with the other parties in the House on the divorce referendum.  I met Deputy De Rossa and a colleague to discuss the matter.  He set out the position of his party on the issue and we had a broad-ranging discussion.  If Deputy De Rossa believes there would be a useful purpose in having further discussions on the matter or if the position of his party, as indicated to me on that occasion, has changed, I would be very happy to meet with him at any time to discuss the issue <Col N="1659" /> further.  If any of the other party representatives believes it would be useful to have further meetings my door is open and I would have no problem with that.</P>

      <P>It is remarkable the Minister is unaware of the comments made in the House by members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the divorce referendum.  Is it the case that the Opposition parties are more willing to have discussions on the proposed divorce referendum than are the Minister's colleagues in Government? Has the Minister had an opportunity to sit down with his colleagues from Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party to discuss the proposed wording of the referendum?</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the questions tabled about the position of the Labour Party or the Fianna Fáil Party. The position of the Government is set out in the Programme for Government, and that is the position of both parties. Deputies are at pains to suggest there is a difficulty about this issue between the two parties in Government.  I emphasise in the clearest possible terms that there is no such difficulty; both parties in Government are agreed that there will be a referendum on divorce.  There have been hold-ups in progressing the matter due to circumstances entirely outside the Government's control, and the Deputy well knows that.  All necessary discussions within the Labour Party have taken place, as have other wide-ranging discussions.  I hope there will be support from all parties and that this support will translate into action in advocating the need for divorce.  I look forward to the Deputies opposite and their parties taking a unified, non-partisan approach on this issue.</P>

      <P>I regret there is an underlying tone of admonishment from the Minister on this issue.  We must accept the Government is united on the principle of putting forward a referendum for a change in the divorce law. Is there agreement between the two parties in Government on the wording of the <Col N="1660" /> proposed change to the Constitution?  If not, perhaps it has not been discussed by them or presented to them.  Is the Minister prepared, having heard our views, considered the matter and discussed it with his colleagues in Government, to come back to the parties in Opposition to discuss the proposal so that we can undertake the most united campaign possible in pursuit of the desired objective?</P>

I already met the Opposition parties and listened carefully to their views, which varied from party to party, and have taken them into account.  I would be happy to meet them again if they have anything to add to what they said to me at our previous meetings.  I do not see a particular need to have a further meeting with them unless the views of the parties changed since then.  Having said that, my door is open and if they feel it would serve a useful purpose, I have no difficulty discussing this important issue with them or anybody else.</P>

      <P>The Minister is giving an indirect negative answer.  I put it to him that he will not come back to the Opposition parties with his proposal for change to seek the widest possible unity for his proposal.  Will he be more specific about what he means when he says the working will be published at an appropriate time?  What is an &ldquo;appropriate time&rdquo; bearing in mind that at least 27,000 couples are separated, many of whom are involved in second relationships and that we do not know the number of children involved?

      <P>I assure the House this Government is extremely sympathetic to their position and that is precisely why the Government wrote into its Programme for Government its determination to have a referendum on the issue of divorce to give those who wish to regularise their positions the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>The Government is held up in the advancement of this issue for the reasons I indicated already.  When the path is clear the Government will reach its decision and at the appropriate time, as soon as may be after that in preparation for the holding of the referendum, the details will be published and open for discussion, in this House in the first instance.  I heard the views of Deputy De Rossa and his party, and I sympathise with him to a great extent.  If he wishes to put anything further to me I will listen.</P>
      <P>The object of the consultations has been to listen to all parties who wish to make representations and put a point of view to the Government and me.  I have held wide-ranging consultations for that purpose.  The views of the political parties and outside groups will be carefully considered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The details are set out in the Programme for Government.  It is intended to introduce two measures, the first of which will be an Employment Equality Bill confined to employment and employment related areas.  Broadly speaking it will seek to make discrimination unlawful in an employment or employment related context against any person because of membership of one of the categories set out in the Programme for Government, that is, on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, handicap or disability, race, colour, nationality, age and membership of the travelling community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be the intention of the Bills to categorise anybody.  The relevance of the legislation will be to outlaw discrimination against members of the travelling community and because of that, the question of ethnic designations would not be appropriate for this legislation.  This is anti-discrimination legislation which seeks to outlaw discrimination against a person on the sole grounds that he or she is a member of the travelling community or on the grounds of his or her ethnic origins.</P>

      <P>I have just recently received from the Employment Equality Agency a Draft Code of Practice on the Protection of the Dignity of Women and Men at Work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft code has been compiled by the agency, based on broad consultation and agreement among employer bodies <Col N="1668" /> and trade unions, and is currently being examined in my Department.  I intend to have the draft code published shortly, in line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It will then be promoted, monitored and reviewed by the Employment Equality Agency which has considerable experience and expertise in advising workers and employers on the subject.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the code will be on a voluntary basis.  However, I propose to give it statutory recognition in the forthcoming employment equality legislation so that cases for decision by an equality officer, the Labour Court or civil courts could have due regard to the contents of the code.</P>

I hope the code will be published towards the end of next month.  If it is not quite ready then it will be in September.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the statement of the Employment Equality Agency arising from the case referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government and re-affirmed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> my Department is at present engaged in the preparation of proposals for broadranging employment equality legislation. The proposed legislation will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including sexual orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of a case where a lesbian women was dismissed from her job because management said that her sexual orientation could result in the company losing business. Can I take it that the legislation the Minister intends to introduce will cover such cases and that no man or woman will be dismissed because of sexual orientation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purport of the legislation is that a person may not be dismissed on account of sexual orientation alone.  As I understand it, the case referred to was not quite decided on that issue.  Inappropriate behaviour at work is a separate and distinct issue and the distinction must be drawn between the two &mdash; dismissal because of sexual orientation and dismissal because of behaviour at work.  The court concluded that a man would have been likely to suffer the same treatment for a similar display of his sexual orientation.  Legislation would provide for outlawing dismissal on account of sexual orientation but that is a separate matter from conduct at work. In other words, the fact that a person has a particular sexual orientation is not <Col N="1670" /> intended to confer on them immunity from dismissal in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the people concerned would not want the case rehashed in this forum.  As I understand from press reports, the court found that the action complained of was not sufficient to warrant dismissal.  However, as legislation did not deal with sexual orientation but gender the court could not give her a positive result although it felt she had been unfairly dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the case was not brought under the Unfair Dismissals Act for whatever reason.  It was brought under other legislation.  The employment equality legislation I hope to introduce will include, as one of the protected classes, people of a particular sexual orientation and will render it unlawful to discriminate against a person who is in that category on that ground alone.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether we have yet to put the support systems in place to accompany the growth in the number of women at work and seeking work shown in the labour force survey for 1992 published recently by the CSO; and the plans, if any, he has to ensure greater flexibility at work to help employees combine work and family responsibilities and to introduce regulated standards of child care.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of greater flexibility at work can be achieved primarily through arrangements negotiated between employers, employees and their representative organisations.  For that reason, I welcome their commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to support voluntary initiatives at enterprise level on equal pay, equal treatment and equal opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For its part, the Government is undertaking a number of legislative initiatives to provide support for women at work. The Adoptive Leave Bill which I recently <Col N="1671" /> introduced is to be followed shortly by improved maternity protection legislation giving protection for women workers who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breasfeeding.  In addition, employment equality legislation proposals currently being prepared will not only seek to provide protection against discrimination but will also support positive action to remove present inequalities.</P>
    <P>Over and above these legislative proposals increasing support for the reconciliation of family and work commitments also arises in the Government's backing for the draft EU Directive on Parental Leave and its agreement to the EU Working Time Directive which will be implemented by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>However, a purely legislative approach would not be sufficient.  Hence there have been a number of commitments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in relation to both public service action and voluntary initiative at enterprise level.  A more resolute application of equal opportunities policies and programmes by public service employers is one such commitment which is already being actively pursued. The preparation of a national code of practice on sexual harassment is also nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> envisages several actions in the childcare area.  These include a scheme of pilot projects which will focus on innovative childcare arrangements in disadvantaged areas and which my Department will be funding in the current year.  The regulation of minimum standards for childcare facilities is also a commitment under the programme and will be implemented by the health authorities under the Child Care Act by 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the obstacles to women returning to the workforce is lack of suitable child care facilities?  The Minister referred to a pilot project on child care programmes in disadvantaged areas.  Has <Col N="1672" /> he plans to expand this and what time scale is he talking about?  On minimum standards for child care, 1996 is a long way off.  Is there any way in which we would hasten progress in that regard? There is a great deal of discomfiture about the regulation of standards of child care.  It is imperative that standards are established and adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the concerns of Deputy Keogh about national standards for child care and I will convey her comments to the Minister for Health. She might raise a question on the issue with him.  As far as the pilot programme is concerned, arrangements are proceeding apace.  There is a further question on this subject on the Order Paper and perhaps we can deal with the matter there.</P>

      <P>I am at a disadvantage as I do not have the information set out in the tabular statement.  It would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to give the names of all the agencies which will receive funding, but can he give me an <Col N="1675" /> estimate of the number of agencies and the amount involved?  I appreciate that the Vote must first be passed by the House and while this delay may not seem long to us it can seem very long to those agencies awaiting funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 55 organisations have applied for funding.  The funding to be provided in 1994 amounts to £750,000, an increase of 150 per cent on the amount provided in 1993.  Clearance for the payment of a sum on account will be given when the Vote has been passed by the Dáil.  The Vote was dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on 15 June and it is included in the composite motion being debated by the House.  Those organisations which have been approved will receive some funding, if not the full amount, as soon as possible after the Vote is passed by the Dáil.  Under the normal procedure one moiety of the amount, approved is paid shortly after the approval of the Vote by the Dáil and quarterly payments are made thereafter. This procedure has been followed by other Departments in previous years and a similar procedure will be followed by my Department.  I am aware of the pressing needs of some of the organisations and will try to ensure that there is no delay in payment.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that any agency interested in receiving funding would have applied by now.  I cannot say if all the funds available will be exhausted by the 55 agencies which have submitted applications.  Obviously each agency will have to be examined to ascertain its position and the way it proposes to expend money.  Any organisation which has not applied should submit an application to my Department as quickly as <Col N="1676" /> possible and before all the funds are exhausted.  It should not be too late to submit an application at this stage.</P>

      <P>Given that all parties say they have as their aim the strengthening of the institution of marriage and that, according to Government figures, five marriages break up ever day, will the Minister agree that a sum of £750,000 for the marriage counselling service agencies is ludicrous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that a Deputy from a party whose finance spokesperson repeatedly calls the Government a &ldquo;tax and spend Government&rdquo; should be calling for more expenditure. The Government fully supports the need to protect and assist families in difficulties and this is why the funding for the marriage counselling service agencies in 1994 has been increased by 150 per cent to £750,000.  This increase has been welcomed by many of the major organisations involved in counselling; they have indicated to my Department that the substantial increase in funding will enable them to expand their services this year and in future.  This is a huge increase and I am sure the Deputy recognises this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>If one looks at the percentage rather than the amount, the increase appears to be huge.  We are trying to put forward constructive suggestions, yet the Minister continually tries to make party political points.  He said that my party regards the Government as a &ldquo;tax and spend Government&rdquo;, but he should bear in mind that when we use that phrase we are rightly referring to the amount of money spent in employing programme managers and others to help the Government put a spin on their policies.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that some of this money would be better spent on vital services than on employing programme managers etc?  Given our <Col N="1677" /> support for the institution of marriage, funding of £750,000 for the marriage counselling service agencies is pathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It enables Departments to carry out their functions in an efficient, practical way.  In the long run it produces savings, because it enables legislation to proceed at far greater speed than would otherwise be possible.  Deputy Currie knows that and while he may cast cold water on an increase of 150 per cent, amounting to £750,000 the agencies at the cutting edge in family counselling very much welcome and recognise this huge increase.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends to take in order to alleviate the inequalities in pay for men and women as documented in the recent ESRI report, Male-Female Wage Differentials; Analysis and Policy Issues, Paper No. 163; if he intends to raise this issue with the social partners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 21, 25 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report on male-female wage differentials shows that when all male and female employees are included in the analysis, women's hourly earnings are approximately 80 per cent of men's.  It is notable that when all sectors are examined, the female hourly wage is somewhat closer to the male rate than that commonly quoted for workers in manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent statistics for earnings and hours of work of industrial workers &mdash; adult rates &mdash; for March 1993 indicate that the average hourly rate for women in manufacturing industry was £4.84 &mdash;<Col N="1679" /> 71 per cent of the average hourly rate for men of £6.81.  Average weekly rates for women were £180.10 &mdash; 64 per cent of the weekly rate for men of £281.35.  These figures represent an albeit modest improvement in recent years, with average hourly rates having increased from almost 68 per cent and average weekly rates from 60 per cent since 1987.</P>
    <P>To close these earnings gaps further a number of strategies will require to be adopted including amending employment equality legislation, the promotion of equal opportunities and an ongoing effort by employers and trade unions to review their treatment of this matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment of employment equality legislation during 1994 will seek to improve existing equal pay and equal treatment provisions as well as to extend cover to non-gender categories.  The social partners have undertaken in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to implement equal pay for work of equal value and equality rights entitlements. They have also agreed, on my initiative, to consider EU developments on equal pay and support voluntary initiatives at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>The importance of equal opportunities measures in reducing wage differentials is also increasingly recognised.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> reflect the contribution which equal opportunities can make generally and specify actions to which the Government and social partners are committed, encompassing positive action measures and measures to reconcile family and work responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In this way it will be possible to secure a sustained rise in women's participation in the labour market over their life cycle, thereby reducing productivity related differences with men as regards factors, such as experience, which the ESRI study idenified as explaining almost half of the 20 per cent wage gap.</P>
    <P>I am currently consulting with my colleagues in Government on the response to recommendations for the provision of <Col N="1680" /> childcare facilities.  The views expressed in the ESRI report are consistent with the thrust of the <i>Report of the Working Group on Childcare Facilities for Working Parents.</i> The in-depth consideration of the measures proposed by the working group which is currently underway should help address the issue highlighted by the ESRI report.</P>
    <P>The availability of the ESRI report at this point is most welcome and will afford Government and social partners the opportunity to reflect on and respond to the report's findings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing the ESRI report, will the Minister acknowledge that part of the problem for women is that they more often than men have to leave the workforce to care for pre-school children, the elderly and people with a handicap?  Has he any strategy to overcome the effect of this interruption?  Is he aware that in the region of 70 per cent of women in the workforce are aged under 35 while something like 52 per cent of men are aged under 45 and because younger people's wages are usually lower, this also has an impact?  In the light of that will he recommend the introduction of a minimum wage which would go some way to alleviating that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a minimum wage is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to whom the Deputy might table a question.  I agree with the Deputy's comments on the findings of the ESRI report.  As he rightly indicated, when women who have interrupted their work cycle to care for their families return to the labour force their wages are not comparable with that of men.  Two issues are highlighted by the ESRI report as explaining the gap of 20 per cent. They attribute half of it to this experience differential and the remaining half to current or past discriminatory practices.  I intend to address current or past discriminatory practices in the employment equality legislation.  The best way to address the work experience of women is by providing child care policies.  This is <Col N="1681" /> being addressed in a number of ways; first by the pilot projects initiated by my Department and the new expenditure of £1 million on this programme to serve disadvantaged areas.  Child care arrangements are also written into the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and into European Union national plan programmes.  The other recommendations of the review group are also being considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Government Departments.  Nonetheless, the overall picture is disappointing.  The improvements we hope to effect in child care facilities coupled with the anti-discriminatory legislative provisions to deal with some of the shortfalls and defects in the legislation in operation since the 1970s, should narrow the wage gap very considerably.  I am sure Deputy De Rossa will have noted from his study of the report that it is a phenomenon not confined to Ireland.  Indeed, even in Scandinavian countries, where one would have thought there would be a much narrower gap, it is still surprisingly wide. We are grateful to the ERSI for having produced it as the basis for work in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that we should avoid complacency on the basis of there being only a 20 per cent gap within which there are serious discrepancies?  In the services industry there is a gap of £2 per hour between the wages of men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I assure him there is no room for complacency on this issue.  The Government is introducing the employment equality legislation to address the 10 per cent attributable to the discriminatory practices under legislation in operation since the 1970s.  That is one of the reasons the Government is providing funds this year for pilot projects on childcare and childcare provisions have been written into the EU plan.  There are a number of issues in the pipeline.  At my request this policy was included in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and I hope <Col N="1682" /> the employers and unions will deliver on that programme.  I will continue to monitor it and I can assure the Deputy there will be no complacency on this issue.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following Estimates which were moved by the Taoiseach on Thursday, 30 June 1994: Votes 1 to 25, inclusive; 30 to 45, inclusive; and Supplementary Estimate to Vote 30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I said that against a background of significant economic progress, coupled with the continuing challenge of unemployment, I wished to look at three issues: first to set our key national economic objectives; second, to summarise the progress made in achieving these <Col N="1763" /> goals in recent years, and, third, to discuss the prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>These aims are closely related because much of the gap between Irish and EU average living standards in attributable to our higher unemployment rate.  Other policy goals, such as low inflation, improved competitiveness, moderate Government borrowing, reducing the national debt/GNP ratio and so on should all be seen as means to achieving these key objectives rather than ends in themselves.</P>
      <P>How have our policies to date been delivering on our key objectives of creating jobs and improving living standards? For a small open economy like ours, there is only one test.  If a country as open as ours to international competition, as dependent as ours on international trade, fails to match the pace of progress in our main trading partners, then its policies have not been successful. On the other hand, if it out-performs its competitors, there is clear evidence of a correct policy stance.</P>
      <P>With this as our yardstick, what results have been achieved in recent years? Taking the years 1987 to 1993, a period of economic and social consensus and consistent budgetary and monetary policy as our reference period, the results are impressive.</P>
      <P>Irish economic growth in terms of GNP has been on average 2 per cent per year better than the EU average.  If I were to take output or GDP growth, the comparison would be even better still. Relative living standards here, as measured by GDP per head, have improved from 62 per cent of the EU average in 1986 to 77 per cent in 1993. Employment growth in Ireland has been on average 0.5 per cent faster than the EU average.  If I were to take growth in non-agricultural jobs, the comparison would be even better.  These results suggest that policy has been on the right lines and that we are moving in the right direction.  Given our employment needs, the challenge is to accelerate the pace of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to my third theme. <Col N="1764" /> What about the period ahead?  What do 1994 and 1995 hold in terms of jobs and living standards?  How are things likely to develop over the medium-term?  This year and next will see further substantial progress in growth, employment and living standards.  The international environment is improving.  Domestic and international economic analysts are revising upwards their economic forecasts.</P>
    <P>The OECD and the IMF now expect growth in the industrialised countries to be about twice as fast as last year and to accelerate further next year.  The European Union is returning to growth following a small decline in output last year.  The Commission's latest forecasts are for GDP growth of 1.5 per cent this year rising to 2.5 per cent next year.  The OECD is predicting a rate of expansion in the OECD area of 2.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 3 per cent in 1995. International inflationary pressures remain quite moderate.  This relatively favourable international background presents major opportunities for our exporters, although further gains in market share will not come automatically but must be earned through better competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Here at home, against a background of low inflation, the moderate pay increases under the new national agreement and the personal tax reductions in this year's budget have combined to provide the basis for an increase of 3 to 3.5 per cent in real disposable incomes.  Allowing for some fall in savings, I expect that growth in consumer spending will pick up to about 4 per cent.  Trends so far this year in retail sales and new car registrations support this view.  The low interest rate environment and the substantial increase in public capital spending should result in a considerable improvement in investment this year.  The climate for investment here has rarely been better.</P>
    <P>As is customary at this time of year, my Department will review the growth and budgetary outlook in the light of the Exchequer returns for the first half of the year which are due to be published on Monday next.  The results of this review <Col N="1765" /> will be published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> around the end of July.</P>
    <P>My budget day prediction of 4 per cent growth is now supported by almost all public and private sector analysts.  The EU Commission recently predicted growth of 4.2 per cent for Ireland.  Others speak of even stronger growth, all are agreed that this year will see a faster rate of employment growth here than among developed countries generally.  Provided that the recovery in the international economy is maintained, next year will see further strong output and employment gains at home.</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic prospects for the next three years are described in the <i>Convergence Programme for Ireland 1994-96,</i> which we have just published.  As with the previous programme, this new convergence programme is founded on the agreement between the Government and the social partners which maintains the consensus approach of recent years &mdash; the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The new convergence programme coincides with the first years of a major investment effort under the Community Support Framework, CSF, which I will be examining later.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines our growth and employment prospects for the period to 1996 and sets out our anticipated performance in relation to the nominal convergence criteria in the Treaty on European Union.  These criteria mainly concern the public finances in the form of the general Government deficit and the debt-GDP ratio.  A further requirement is that inflation must be close to the best performers in the European Union. Ireland has satisfied these criteria over the last several years and is expected to continue to do so.  The convergence programme has been transmitted to Brussels where, in keeping with the new Treaty arrangements for the mutual surveillance of the economies of the Union which apply to all member states, it will soon be discussed at a meeting of Finance Ministers.  I will come back later to look at budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the medium-term presented in the convergence programme <Col N="1766" /> is very good.  An annual economic growth rate of 4 per cent is in prospect, with non-agricultural employment expected to rise by about 60,000 in the three years to 1996.  Inflation is likely to remain low, averaging 2.5 per cent.  This promising economic performance is predicated on a general Government deficit below 3 per cent of GDP each year.  This will enable us to reduce the debt-GDP ratio at an annual average rate of 3 to 4 percentage points &mdash; in line with the objectives contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>This convergence programme is the third major medium-term economic policy document published this year.  It builds on the central elements of the two preceeding documents, namely the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Community Support Framework and it flows logically from them.  The three documents should be seen together as linked policy statements, with the second and third document each restricting on the successful implementation of its predecessor.</P>
    <P>First we had the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> under which we agreed to maintain the consensus approach to policy formulation which has served this country well.  Associated with this programme were pay arrangements which, if followed in a commonsense way, will provide the necessary backdrop of competitive strength and industrial peace.  Both of these elements are vital. Next, we had the CSF which spelled out the largest investment plan ever attempted in this country.  Now we have the convergence programme which sets out the results which we can expect over the next three years from the successful implementation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the CSF.</P>
    <P>The central goal of all three strategic statements &mdash; the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the CSF and the new convergence programme &mdash; is essentially the same: to improve conditions for the creation of sustainable employment. The policies which will deliver this objective are also similar &mdash; the continuation of the improvement in the public finances <Col N="1767" /> and a deepening of the competitiveness of the economy grounded on a moderate and reasonable pay settlement for both the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>Price stability will continue to be the objective of exchange rate and interest rate policy.  While the widening of the ERM bands in August last year changed the foreign exchange environment, the Irish pound has maintained a stable relationship with other low-inflation currencies. These macro-economic policies, reiterated in the convergence programme, are enhanced by micro-economic policies to make markets more efficient.  It is appropriate that the process of structural reform should be given prominence in the new programme as it is central to maintaining sustainable growth in output and employment over the medium-term.</P>
    <P>Ireland's employment record has been good in recent years, better than all of our partners in the European Union.  Despite the gains in non-agricultural employment and even with the fall over the last year in the number on the live register, unemployment is still unacceptably high.  In addition, the natural increase in the labour force will remain strong over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The programme acknowledges that unemployment is our greatest economic problem.  It explains that the structure of the economy determines how effective we can be in turning growth in output and incomes into sustainable jobs and that structural reform must be part of the response to the unemployment problem. The programme goes on to indicate the Government's intentions in that area.</P>
    <P>The improved international outlook and the prospective increase in domestic demand suggests that employment growth could accelerate over the next three years.  Total employment may expand by 17,000 per annum, or about 1.5 per cent, in the three years to 1996. Within this total, non-agricultural employment is projected to grow by 20,000 per annum, or 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is by no means a guaranteed outcome. Its achievement is conditional on <Col N="1768" /> the maintainance of our competitive strength.  Although such an outcome would be better than that expected for most industrial countries, it would still be inadequate to match the projected natural increase in the labour force of 25,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Emigration is not an acceptable solution to the problem of unemployment, nor is it consistent with the aims of the Maastricht Treaty in relation to convergence. The growth and employment figures set out in the convergence programme can and must be bettered through a renewed commitment from all sections of the community to give top priority to the maintainance of jobs, especially when these are under threat, and to the creation of new jobs.  This is my central policy goal; it is the key aim of this Government.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil is aware, agreement has now been reached on the other major policy document I referred to, namely, the Community Support Framework.  It was approved in principle by the Commission on 15 June and, once certain consultative procedures have been completed, will be formally approved during July.</P>
    <P>The Government's development strategy as set out in the National Development Plan is incorporated in the Community Support Framework.  All the key elements of the plan are maintained. The allocations between Departments of total combined Exchequer and EU expenditure arising from the Community Support Framework are consistent with the allocations as adjusted by the Government on a <i>pro rata</i> basis last February.</P>
    <P>The total amount of EU aid allocated at this stage under the Community Support Framework is, as has been known since last October, less than the amount on which the National Development Plan was based.  Account was taken of this shortfall in respect of 1994 in framing the 1994 Estimates.  The <i>pro rata</i> adjustments addressed this issue for the balance of the period.</P>
    <P>While reductions of £130 million were made to plan expenditures in the 1994 <Col N="1769" /> Estimates, this was not the full amount of the projected aid shortfall.  It proved possible for the Exchequer to meet some £40 million of the cost which would have been covered by EU funding on the basis of the plan.  Throughout the period to 1999, the Government will look each year at the budget possibilities to see whether additional Exchequer resources can be made available.  The Government would regard it as imprudent to commit itself at this stage to further increases in public expenditure.  The determining factor will be the budget and economic position each year.</P>
    <P>Work is very well advanced on the operational programmes which form the legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.  We expect some of these to be approved in July and the rest in the early autumn.  The EU aid will then start to flow.</P>
    <P>Implementation has not been held up while all of these arrangements are being put in place.  The greater part of the plan expenditures are funded by the Exchequer.  In those cases, the arrangement is that the gross expenditure totals are provided in departmental Estimates at the start of the year, with the EU aid element being recouped later in the year. Thus implementation has been going ahead since the start of the year.</P>
    <P>We should now look forward to continued efficient and effective implementation throughout the period to 1999 with all the necessary steps being taken to ensure that the country derives the maximum advantage from this unprecedented injection of funding into constructive investment.</P>
    <P>I now want to look at budgetary policy and the public finances in more detail. The general improvement in Ireland's economic performance has been reflected in the public finances.  Ireland's performance in relation to the agreed EU convergence criteria has to date been among the very best in the Union. Ireland's general Government deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP each year since 1989, thus meeting the minimum required under the Maastricht Treaty. The debt ratio, apart from the once-off <Col N="1770" /> effects of the 1993 devaluation on the Irish-pound value of the foreign currency denominated element of the national debt, has been declining steadily.  Our inflation performance has also been excellent.</P>
    <P>A central objective of the 1994 budget, of which the Estimates are an essential part, was to maintain the soundly-based public finances which is a necessary condition for the creation of sustainable employment.  The prudent budgetary policy we have pursued since 1987 has been the correct approach.</P>
    <P>The reduction of our dependence on borrowing, the control of public spending, the easing of the tax burden and its more equitable distribution, have restored confidence and strength to the economy and enabled us to weather the currency crisis, to introduce a new climate of low inflation, and to unwind the differentials which had emerged between the Irish and other European interest rates.  The basis for the medium-term developments I have been discussing has been laid by this policy.  It is no coincidence, either, that we maintained very reasonable levels of economic growth throughout the recent downturn in the international economy.</P>
    <P>The key budget statistic this year is the restriction of the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 2.7 per cent of GNP. While the half-year Exchequer returns are not yet to hand, the indications suggest that the outturn should be close to that target.</P>
    <P>Certainly, Ireland's level of borrowing is now down to a level which could not have been envisaged as being within our grasp during the period of large Exchequer deficits which emerged in the period up to the mid-1980s.  This reduction in the level of the annual budget deficits combined with a professional approach to treasury management, has meant that the burden of debt and debt-service costs has also declined as a proportion of GNP.  The debt-ratio will fall again this year, and we are determined to ensure that, in accordance with our obligations under European Monetary Union, the level of debt will continue to decline in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> The convergence criteria set out in the European Monetary Union Treaty put a firm obligation on member states to meet challenging budgetary guidelines.  We are now consistently satisfying these criteria. However, because of the large overhang of public debt still remaining, we must continue to keep our annual deficits low &mdash; even lower than those in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>The deficit and debt criteria set out in Maastricht may seem rather academic issues at present.  However, these criteria are in accordance with our own domestic needs and reflect the policies we were pursuing in any event.  The fact is that, irrespective of European Monetary Union, the overhang of debt must be reduced as rapidly as possible so that we can continue to release more of our national resources for other needs.  It is a sobering fact that almost one-twelfth of GNP must be allocated each year to meet deficit servicing costs before the Government can address the many other spending priorities which are of more direct benefit to the community and for which Members of this House continually call.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government has done far more than simply create the right environment for increased employment. In the last two budgets and Finance Bills, substantial measures have been introduced by the Government with the direct, specific aim of promoting enterprise and job creation.  As Minister for Finance, I want to ensure that all aspects of Government policy &mdash; taxation and expenditure &mdash; work towards this aim.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Government reduced the tax burden on employment income this year and made a number of changes in the tax code which are of particular benefit to small and medium-sized businesses. Those businesses were given a major boost in the budget, with a wide range of significant measures designed to increase the number of start-ups in this important sector.  Among other things, the 1994 budget and Finance Bill, increased VAT thresholds, taking many small firms out of the VAT net altogether; helped small business cash-flow <Col N="1772" /> by putting the VAT system on a cash receipts rather than an invoice basis; reduced capital gains tax on shareholding from 40 per cent to 27 per cent for small businesses; extended the capital gains tax roll-over relief for shareholding in small companies to the wider services sector; introduced a new business relief in capital acquisitions tax which is particular beneficial for the transfer of family businesses; increased the company value limit for the purposes of BES investment by the &ldquo;original entrepreneur&rdquo;; improved capital allowances for hotels, farm buildings and business cars; extended the PAYE allowance to the children of proprietary directors and of self-employed persons, where they are working in their parent's business; and, to improve access to funding &mdash; an issue of major significance for the small enterprise &mdash; the budget introduced a £100 million loan fund for small business.  The fund, which is administered by the ICC, advances business expansion loans to firms in manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>These, with all the other policy measures of recent years, are helping to improve the economy's capacity for job-creation.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the 1994 Estimates, there has been some criticism of the Government's policy on spending. The charges are usually summed up in the slogan that somehow this is a &ldquo;tax and spend&rdquo; administration.  While the Government may point to an Exchequer borrowing requirement held well within the Maastricht Treaty guidelines, the critics &mdash; even though very few of them are here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was a critic at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would argue that this has been achieved only by maintaining high tax levels and covering the fact that public spending has continued to absorb an increasing share of national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looked at narrowly, the critics seem to have a point.  It is certainly the case <Col N="1773" /> that public spending has increased.  In 1990, net current spending fell to 24.5 per cent of GNP; this year, it is likely that it will be around 28 per cent. However, these figures do not give a complete picture.  If we examine the position in our European partners, we see that there has been a similar rise in public spending throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>However, the rise in spending in Ireland has been much less than that in the rest of Europe.  Since 1990, total Irish public spending has increased from 40.2 per cent of GDP to 42.9 per cent in 1993.  By contrast, in the same period, for Europe as a whole, total Government spending increased on average from 47.9 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 51.7 per cent in 1993, a much higher rate of increase. It is worth pointing out that these figures show that the level of total spending in Ireland is very substantially below the European average, a point which the critics do not point out because they would not be capable of examining figures for other countries.</P>
    <P>The point, of course, is that one has to look behind these figures.  Expenditure has risen in all European countries during this period, primarily because of the slow-down in the international economy. The resulting increased social welfare spending, in particular, imposed significant additional burdens on the Exchequer.  Secondly, over the last few years the Government has had to honour commitments entered into in respect of deferred general and special pay increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to have more time to put the rest of the good news about the first half year on the record but, unfortunately, Opposition Whips limited my time so that I would not be able to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to go far for inspiration to find out where to start, and I am sure the Minister is well aware of that.  The tenor of my speech will be to give credit where it is due and, likewise, hand out the brickbats where necessary. Before coming to the debate proper I wish to refer to a matter which has been a bugbear for me in this House in the past couple of years in particular, namely, the standard of reply to parliamentary questions by some Ministers.  The two Ministers opposite are not the worst offenders in that regard, in fairness, both of them attempt to give reasonable and qualified replies to legitimate parliamentary questions without attempting to avoid the issue.  I do not wish to select individual Ministers who do the opposite, but the Minister for the Environment is probably the worst offender.  I raise this matter today because this is the time we normally review the performance of Ministers.  As an example of the arrogance of some people, I will refer to a parliamentary question which I tabled at the end of May to which I received a reply from the Ceann Comhairle stating that the question was a repeat of one tabled in February 1994.  The question in February was of a specific nature and the question refused was also of a specific nature.  There is no precedent for that type of behaviour, something which has been established recently and smacks of arrogance and indifference.  Arrogance in and indifference to the Houses of Parliament may at first appear to be a sign of a person's strength but, ultimately, it will turn out to be a weakness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I followed up the matter by tabling an amended question.  The first question <Col N="1775" /> related to funding from the national lottery and my second asked the Minister if there was any other source of funding available to the Department to meet a specific requirement.  He referred to the reply to Question No. 74 of 10 February, 1994 but that question was about a different matter.  I had hoped to raise that matter on the Adjournment but could not due to time constraints.  In the next Dáil session I hope we do not have that type of smart alec reply to legitimate parliamentary questions.  In the past four years, in particular, I thought Ministers would have learned to be courteous and attempted to reply to parliamentary questions asked in the House.  Even if they hold members of the Opposition in contempt they should not hold the Houses of the Oireachtas in contempt and, in turn, the general public.  I say that by way of warning and it is something about which all Members of the Oireachtas should be aware.  The right of a Member to ask a valid parliamentary question and receive a reply should not be impeded in any fashion because that can be construed only as an attempt to interfere with the legitimate democratic process.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Health, for which I am the Fine Gael spokesperson.  I give the Minister credit because he has attempted to address some of the problems in his Department.  Health affects everybody in the community.  Everyone at some time is affected by the standard of the health services whether community care, hospitals or special hospitals.  However, I must bring the House and the Minister back to reality by pointing to the massive problems and the inability of people to deal with them in the manner suggested by the Minister, despite his best efforts.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists exist for special surgery, such as for hip replacements and so on. Attempts have been made to deal with that problem but the waiting lists still exist.  Those on a waiting list must endure pain and suffering while awaiting surgery. They are anxious also about whether they will gain access to the service <Col N="1776" /> they require in time.  We have not achieved much.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed about the lack of progress in dealing with the old chestnut, orthodontic treatment.  Notwithstanding the Minister's extension of the scheme to cover children in a certain age group, and the allocation of an extra £4 million to reduce the waiting list, the length of time children have been on the waiting list is disgraceful.  The method of determining the category into which patients should be placed, which determines the length of time they must spend on the waiting list, is unsatisfactory.  Often those placed in the third category do not gain access to the service.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the ongoing debate about orthodontics, namely, whether the service is required for cosmetic purposes only.  We should know the difference at this stage because we have been told about it often enough.  When it is diagnosed that a child needs treatment every effort should be made to ensure he or she receives it as quickly as possible.  The child should not have to wait two to four years for treatment.  At that stage the child's parents would be forced to seek alternative treatment.  It is regrettable in many cases that children whose parents are medical card holders have been forced to opt for private care.</P>
    <P>I advised the parents of a child to seek an independent medical opinion which conflicted with the opinion that placed a child in a particular category, namely category 2, and under which the child would have to wait two or three years for treatment.  Following repeated representations the patient received treatment. It should not be necessary for people to go to those lengths to achieve the legitimate right to treatment for school children.</P>
    <P>Today, I heard of another child who has serious orthodontic problems and who was not deemed to be in need of attention, yet a private orthodontist readily qualified the serious nature of the problem.  The problem in regard to orthodontists has not been resolved and will not be in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Many of the programmes and initiatives <Col N="1777" /> announced by the Minister have a four year life span.  One could assume that the same Minister will be in control in four years time, but one should never assume anything in this House.  We may not be able to assume a life span of four months in terms of parliamentary life. I warn against any euphoria that might emanate from the Government's benches that such four year plans will resolve the problems in the health services.  I am sorry the Minister is not present, but I warn him that his successor may have to implement his proposals.</P>
    <P>The same position applies to optical treatment and speech therapy.  The problem in regard to speech therapy was raised by Deputy O'Donnell last night.  Thousands of children are in urgent need of speech therapy and can not gain access to therapy lessons because there are not enough therapists available.  There are not enough training places, the rate of remuneration is not attractive and many of those who qualify as speech therapists work overseas where they are properly paid for their services.  Children who need speech therapy cannot gain the maximum advantage from education facilities.  There are plans for great things to happen in this area but it will be some time before they are realised.  Like election promises I worry about them.  I do not stay awake all night thinking about them because the problem may be resolved before the fourth year of the four year plan.  The Minister should address the problems in regard to speech therapy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the lack of facilities for young people with behavioural problems. Traditionally, this has been dealt with by three Departments, the Departments of Health, Justice and Education. I hope the Minister opposite will convene some sort of discussion with her colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, with a view to providing the necessary places to give those children the treatment they require.  As we speak I am aware of a situation where one young person with behavioural problems was transported outside the State to Texas for specific treatment not available at home.  I know it is fashionable for <Col N="1778" /> people to go outside the State for various reasons and that everybody wants to go to Texas.  However, it will cost much more to provide facilities for that child outside the State, in terms of the cost of transport and of the service itself, than to provide facilities at home where they should be provided.  It would be more efficient and far better for the country to provide the service at home.  I am sorry that at this stage in the development of our society we have not copped on to the lack of services and facilities in that area. Despite promises from well meaning Ministers from time to time, we have not grappled with the situation.</P>
    <P>Virtually every Member of this House knows of some young person with serious behavioural problems who needs accommodation and specialised treatment in a semi-institutionalised setting and who has not been able to get it.  We are storing up problems for ourselves in the future because saving a penny today means having to spend £10 tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of hepatitis C which was caused by an agreed medical procedure whereby women, and in many cases their families have themselves also become ill.  Despite the Minister's repeated protestations about the availability of counselling and treatment and all the necessary backup facilities, they are not available, and the quality of counselling falls far short of what is required.  Every day women tell us in detail about how they can get more information and advice from other sources overseas than is made available to them here through a system which was allegedly set up specifically to cater for the problem.  The Minister might not agree, but the women are extremely disappointed. It is several months since the scare first started and the problem was identified.  If some attention were given to putting the necessary backup services in place there would be no ongoing worry and legitimate criticism.  In many cases spouses and children are also affected but the full extent of the problem has not yet been identified and the success or otherwise of the treatment has not been properly quantified.  Information which <Col N="1779" /> is available overseas is not being made available to women here, despite protestations to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I would not advise the Minister for Health or any other Minister to go away for the summer holidays happy in the knowledge that this issue will disappear. We on this side of the House intend to keep that issue to the fore to ensure that the large number of women who have been infected are not forgotten and that they will receive the kind of care and attention they deserve.  I have not spoken, except once before in the House, about the question of compensation but that must inevitably arise and will have to be tackled by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am sorry there are only two minutes left because there are other issues I want to speak about, for instance, breast cancer.  Last night we spoke about the Centre for Independent Living to which a small grant was allocated, not directly by the Minister.  Through him, I hope provision will be made for ongoing funding in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Now that the recess is upon us and Ministers are winging their merry way to exotic places where the sun will beam down while they sip their Cuba libres in the cool and balmy shade of the Eucalyptus trees, I hope they think of the poor unfortunate citizens who are left at home, and wonder with awe about how they managed to escape the wrath of the people for so long.  There was a slight indication of the people's wrath in the recent elections, but that is a minor thing. The rest is still to come or, as the Government might see it, the worst is still to come.  As they recline on the tropical beaches they will, no doubt, consider how good the people of Ireland have been to them in the last 18 months or so. The people's patience has not been fully tried yet but it is very close to it.  I hope, if they survive until the end of the year they realise that it does not pay to ignore either the Opposition or the legitimate concerns expressed by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate <Col N="1780" /> in this Adjournment Debate.  I wish to avail of the occasion to highlight some of the achievements in education and give this House an indication of my priorities and concerns for the advancement and improvement in education for all our people.</P>
      <P>Education is the means by which societies and individuals enhance their knowledge and human capital.  Knowledge and skills are increasingly the basis for economic growth and, it may be argued, represent the only durable basis for a country's economic and competitive advantage.  The NESC report, Education and Training Policies for Economic and Social Development, clearly shows the connection between education and employment opportunities in Ireland.  The Government and the social partners accept in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that the key elements in competitiveness that are of greatest importance are no longer confined exclusively to the direct costs of production, and they include in particular the quality of education and training. Much international expert comment and analysis emphasises that the priority given to education and the status within a society accorded to teachers and other education workers may be the most important determinants of economic growth.</P>
      <P>Although education is central to economic progress, it does not just have a mere functional role.  Education is a major State project, a project through which society socialises its young, enhances its repertoire of knowledge and skills and renews itself through developing its internal critical faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government, in addition to recognising the economic importance of education also underlines the central importance of education in promoting equality and equal opportunity for all our citizens.  It identified a number of key policy priorities, including tackling disadvantage both in school and outside school, the provision of second chance opportunities for adults and improving access to third level education, and the provision of the necessary supports for this task, including remedial, psychological <Col N="1781" /> and guidance counselling services, and maximising the benefits from the European Structural Funds.  It committed the Government to pursuing vigorously the open consultative process with the partners to create a new policy and legislative framework for our education system, a reformed framework to meet and cope with the needs and challenges facing us as we approach the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The time during which I have been Minister for Education has been a period of unprecedented consultation on education reform.  I have ensured that the process has been open and democratic. The National Education Convention, a watershed in the history of Irish education, held last October in Dublin Castle, proved an enormous success.  A broad range of groups was involved and I had the opportunity to listen to their views in an open and public way.  Tangible and encouraging results emerged from the convention and there was an obvious convergence of opinion on a wide range of issues.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to forge ahead with the preparation of the White Paper on the basis of the comprehensive consultative process which has, and is taking place. The process of reform cannot afford to lose its momentum.  The White Paper will map out the Government's vision of the future of education and will be followed by bringing legislation before this House. I look forward to the contributions of Deputies from all sides at that stage.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me, I wish to focus on three key themes which underpin my strategy since taking office: the significantly better overall funding for the education sector, the targeting of resources to the disadvantaged and those with special needs and the emphasis on more relevant classroom processes through curriculum reform and in-career development.</P>
    <P>The following are examples of the main funding increases in the primary education sector.  Capital or building expenditure at primary level has been increased from £17 million in 1992 to £19 million in 1993 and is £26 million in 1994.  This <Col N="1782" /> year's increase of 36 per cent will allow 73 additional major projects to commence in 1994.  The capitation grant for all schools has been increased by a further £5 per pupil at primary level in 1994, which means that it increased from £28 in 1992 to £33 in 1993 and is £38 in 1994.</P>
    <P>Recent demographic trends resulted in a reduction in the number of teachers required, but I have ensured that all these teaching posts will be retained.  In 1993 the pupil-teacher ratio was reduced from 25:1 to 24.2:1.  The retention of these posts in 1994 will effectively reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 23.4:1.  Teaching resources have also been increased at second level in 1993 and 1994.  In the area of second level capital expenditure in 1994 the allocation represents an 85 per cent increase on the 1992 expenditure for the development of the school building programme.  The 1993 and 1994 provision for the third level sector reflects the importance of this sector and the contribution it makes to the cultural, economic and social development of the country.</P>
    <P>As well as securing increased overall funding for the education sector, I have concentrated on targeting the disadvantaged and on making extra provision for pupils with special needs. There will be an extra 425 teaching posts available in the primary sector this year and I will allocate them as follows.  An additional 100 remedial teachers have been appointed and this has benefited more than 300 schools.  Additional teachers will be appointed to schools designated as disadvantaged and these appointments will have the beneficial effect of ensuring that infant classes in disadvantaged areas will be no larger than 29.  This is the first phase of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to reduce class size to a maximum of 29; 120 additional posts will be allocated to special education, an unprecedented commitment to pupils with special needs.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Williamstown (Galway) Sewerage Scheme.</Title>
    <Col N="1783" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter.  On 10 June 1993 I raised in an Adjournment debate the problems faced by the people of Williamstown, County Galway.  At that time they were frustrated and angry that 70 families had to contend with a bad domestic sewerage scheme, widespread pollution and nauseating smells.  There were definite health hazards in the village. Recently the local doctor had an in-depth analysis carried out which showed that there is widespread and dangerous pollution in the village.</P>
      <P>At that time Galway County Council, the Western Health Board and the Department of the Environment acknowledged the necessity to have a proper treatment plant installed and all the necessary land had been acquired by the county council.  The new design plans encompassed two areas of the village that had originally been left out and a better outfall was identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Ministers for the Environment over the years met deputations on this matter and it appeared that on every occasion a favourable reply was given.  I was told by the Minister on 10 June 1993 that in the case of Williamstown a preliminary report for a sewerage scheme to serve around 50 houses was approved in March 1987 at an estimated cost of £331,000.  I was told that Galway County Council gave an updated estimate of £592,000 in April 1992.  I was also informed that the contract documents for the scheme were submitted to the Department in September 1992.  The Minister stated in his reply: &ldquo;It is clear from the contract documents submitted that the county council has expanded the scope of the scheme to serve around an additional 15 premises and the route of the outfall sewer has been amended and extended&rdquo;.  I was informed that these additions and amendments, which were not approved by the Department of the <Col N="1784" /> Environment, were being considered at that time.</P>
    <P>The information emanating from the Department in June and July last year was that Galway County Council costings were out of order and that the new extensions and outfall points resulted in a cost that was unacceptable to the Minister. This could only have been a red herring because nobody in their mature minds could expect to install a sewerage scheme of this size for £500,000.  The Department should not have been surprised given the extent of the scheme.  All the communications by the people came to nought, and Williamstown is still without its sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>When the Department did not include this project in the 1994 Estimates a commitment was given to the people that it would be included &mdash; a new story emanated, that the real reason it was not to go ahead in 1994 was that Galway County Council did not give it priority.  This is another red herring by the Minister and the Department.  Galway County Council afforded this project the same high priority it has given over a number of years.  It wants to see the Williamstown sewerage scheme constructed.  If it did not, why would it keep updating the cost, as it did in April 1992?  Why would it submit to the Department contract documents for the scheme in September 1992? This suggestion is disingenuous and I nail it on the head.</P>
    <P>I want a straight answer &mdash; what priority is given to Williamstown sewerage scheme by the Department of the Environment?  The Minister knows what is required, he knows the cost and the contract documents are in order.  The time for talking is over.  On behalf of the people of Williamstown.  I ask the Minister to give me a straight answer to that question.  I convey, on behalf of these people, their absolute disgust about the way they are being treated.  They believe, as I do, that it is past time for the sewerage scheme to start.  It is time for the Minister to get off the fence and state clearly the priority that his Department gives to Williamstown sewerage scheme.  If the scheme is given the <Col N="1785" /> priority it should have &mdash; and which Galway County Council believes it should have &mdash; Williamstown will have its sewerage scheme shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Mr. Browne (Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>(Wexford)</i>: I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this issue.  The Deputy will know that the Minister is familiar with the background to the Williamstown sewerage scheme as he met representatives of the local action group on a number of occasions in recent times.  Representations have also been made to him on an ongoing basis by Deputy Michael Kitt and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton will also know that the cost of this scheme went from £330,000 in 1987 to over £1 million today. This amounts to a unit cost of around £15,400 for each of the 65 premises served. On the face of it, this is a very expensive scheme for a village of this size.  The Minister is aware, however, that there are certain technical difficulties to be overcome with regard to the outfall and that this factor has added greatly to the overall cost. The fact still remains that cost increases of the magnitude experienced with the Williamstown scheme have implications for the overall funding programme of schemes generally and militate against scope which the Minister might have to approve additional new works.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council has fared very well in recent years with regard to the level of funding provided by the Department of the Environment for water and sewerage schemes throughout the country.  Last year, the Minister allocated around £5.6 million to Galway County Council, the highest allocation ever for the county.  So far this year, he has allocated a further £5.2 million for water and sewerage scheme development in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of major environmental projects for Galway city and county was recently approved for assistance under the Cohesion Fund.  These include two <Col N="1786" /> very important projects in the county area: Tuam regional water supply scheme costing over £21 million and Oranmore sewerage scheme costing £6.8 million.  It is intended that construction work will commence on these schemes later this year.  The Minister also intends to submit further Cohesion Fund applications for additional water and sewerage schemes for County Galway in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council has a long list of schemes at various stages of planning. The council estimates the cost of these schemes at well over £100 million for the whole county.  In the short term, it simply will not be possible to afford all these schemes within the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to assure Deputy Connaughton, however, that he would like to progress the Williamstown scheme as soon as possible.  He is aware of the deep concern in the village that sewage collection and treatment should be provided at the earliest opportunity. However, having regard to the high cost involved, the scheme can best be progressed on the basis that EU co-financing can be secured.  The Minister cannot give a definite undertaking at present on the Williamstown scheme.  He intends, however, to review it in the context of the operational programme for environmental services, now at an advanced stage of negotiation.  He will then be in a better position to decide the most appropriate means of progressing the Williamstown scheme.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Connaughton and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, that they will be kept informed of progress.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Completion of Cork Housing Estates.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork Corporation is faced with the major problem of unfinished housing estates in all parts of the city. Some of the worst problems are on the north side where estates such as Hawthorn Mews, Millfield Lawns, Onslow Gardens and the Hollywood Estate on <Col N="1787" /> the Blarney Road have been left unfinished. Residents have had to put up with serious inconvenience during the past ten years.  The problems have arisen because developers who have gone out of business either left inadequate bonds with Cork Corporation, or having done so, the corporation failed to call in these bonds.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation has estimated that the cost of having these unfinished estates put in order will be in the region of £300,000. I consider that to be a very conservative figure.  Cork Corporation has considered a number of options and has decided to set in train a works programme funded in partnership with the Department of the Environment.  In response to a parliamentary question on Tuesday last the Minister for the Environment indicated that he will not fund the taking over of these estates.  The taxpayers, the commercial ratepayers and those who pay service charges in the city are being asked to fund this works programme, a matter which I very much regret.  The alternative is to do nothing and to leave these estates in the terrible condition they are in and let people suffer.</P>
      <P>A number of serious questions arise from this sorry episode: (1) why were some developers in a position to continue other projects in Cork city without first fulfilling their responsibilities to their customers or to the local authority?  (2) Why did Cork Corporation not cash in the bonds that developers had deposited with them?  (3) Was the updated bond for Hawthorn Mews a cash bond?  (4) Why has Cork Corporation failed to pursue to date the principals of the defaulting companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report submitted to the members of the finance and planning committee of Cork Corporation has thrown up more questions than answers and nothing short of a departmental investigation of the matter is required.  Alternatively, the Minister should request the local government auditor to examine the scandal where taxpayers are forced to fund the work left undone by these defaulting companies. Will the Minister insist that Cork Corporation identifies the principals of all the <Col N="1788" /> companies involved to ensure that they are legally forced to carry out their obligations? The evidence in relation to the principals of the company is readily available and I ask that they be pursued to carry out their obligations.</P>
    <P>My quest to get justice for hundreds of householders in Cork city is not a political witchhunt, as some wish to present it, but an honest and determined effort to get justice for people who have suffered for over a decade.</P>

It is a matter for Cork Corporation to ensure that the housing estates in its functional area are completed to a satisfactory standard. As the Minister said in a reply to a recent parliamentary question on the subject, there are no funds available to him to provide grants for the completion of unfinished estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for each planning authority to ensure the completion of housing estates by attaching appropriate conditions to planning permissions.  These might include conditions requiring completion of estates on a phased basis and requiring a bond to ensure that the legal powers are available to planning authorities under the planning Acts to ensure that developments are carried out in accordance with the terms of the relevant planning permission.  The planning Acts allow for prosecutions, the issue of enforcement notices or taking court action to ensure compliance with the Acts.  The Planning Act, 1990 updated the law on planning compensation and, in relation to unfinished estates, allows for the inclusion in planning permissions of non-compensatable conditions relating to the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures. The penalties for breaches of the Acts have been significantly increased under the 1992 Act.  As a last resort, and in the event of the developer being unwilling or unable to complete the job, the capitalised value of the bond should allow for the completion of the estate by the <Col N="1789" /> planning authority.  Where enforcement measures cannot be taken or where bonds are defective or have run out, local authorities are encouraged to consider other measures to alleviate the position. This might include the provision of technical and other advice to residents' associations undertaking the work themselves or, where feasible, engaging in joint schemes of work with the residents or residents' associations to achieve completion of the estate to an agreed and acceptable standard.  The Department of the Environment issued guidelines to planning authorities in October 1982 in relation to their approach to development control.  The guidelines dealt comprehensively with the problem of unfinished housing estates and stressed the importance of the types of conditions I have already mentioned.  The Minister is happy that the advice has in general been followed and the vast majority of local authorities appear to have no difficulty using the powers available to them effectively.</P>
    <P>He is aware that there are problems with a number of housing estates in Cork because of defective bonds and companies having gone into liquidation.  The Minister understands that the corporation is considering drawing up a schedule of work needed to complete these estates and will consider how to finance the works.  It would, however, be wrong to expect the Exchequer to take up the tab for the completion of such estates.  This is a local function and local authorities' powers are more than adequate to meet the situation, provided of course they use the powers properly. Experience has shown that a grant scheme only encourages rogue builders to leave estates unfinished knowing that someone else would be expected to pay for the work involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter with the Minister for Transport Energy <Col N="1790" /> and Communications, Deputy Cowen, on a number of occasions over the past seven or eight months.  There has been a certain improvement in the quality of reception of the two Irish television channels in West Waterford but, unfortunately, it is still not what it should be.</P>
      <P>The history of the problem goes back to the replacement of the cable television system in the towns of Cappoquin, Lismore and Tallow by the MMDS system. We were led to believe that the MMDS system would be the answer to all our problems where television reception on a multi-channel basis was concerned. While it has provided good quality pictures for British channels, it has resulted in a serious deterioration in the quality of reception of the two Irish channels.</P>
      <P>As a result of representations by members of Waterford County Council and by me in the Dáil, RTE has investigated the problem and brought about a certain improvement in the reception.  It is still inferior, however, to that which was available prior to the introduction of the MMDS system.  That particular system is operated by Cork Communications Limited who have been particularly negligent in not keeping the people informed and not responding to their complaints.  There is a need for Cork Communications Limited to be wrapped on the knuckles by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, because of their ineptitude and this attitude.  That is why I am required to raise this matter in the House repeatedly.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that those of us who have supported the legally provided system &mdash; the MMDS system &mdash; rather than the illegal deflector systems are supported by the Minister.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case to date.  Those of us who have to suffer the taunts and harassment of the supporters of illegal deflector systems are entitled to protection and support.  That has not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Minister. I know he has endeavoured to do his best but it is simply not sufficient. Once again I am asking him to ensure that the quality of reception of RTE 1 and <Col N="1791" /> Network 2 is brought up to the standard which was previously available and to ensure that people who have the franchise to provide the MMDS system do so in areas where it has not yet been installed.  I hope the Minister will live up to the commitments that he has given in this House but which, to date, have not been fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm an seans seo a bheith agam an freagra a thabhairt don cheist áitiúil seo faoi theilifís RTE i gContae Phort Láirge.</P>
      <P>I would point out once again in this House, as has been previously stated here, that investigation of problems with the reception of RTE 1 and Network 2 is a matter for RTE in the first instance. RTE has the technical expertise and the local resources to investigate such complaints effectively.  If, following those initial investigations, there is evidence of interference from another frequency spectrum user, RTE will inform our Department, which then takes responsibility for the matter and liaises directly with RTE.  Where interference is brought to the attention of our Department, it will initiate such liaison directly.  In general, where there is an issue relating to RTE reception which involves the local cable or MMDS operator, both parties work together to sort out such problems, and they keep the technical staff of our Department informed of progress.</P>
      <P>The towns of Cappoquin, Tallow and Lismore receive multi-channel television via a cable system which is owned by Cork Communications Limited, the local cable franchisee.  Last Christmas, Cork Communications Limited made some changes to the systems in the towns of Lismore and Tallow in order to increase the number of TV channels available to their subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that difficulties with the frequency settings for the new channels resulted in interference to the reception of RTE 1 and Network 2.  Following investigation of the matter, some adjustments <Col N="1792" /> to the frequencies involved were made and this solved the problem.</P>
    <P>Last week, Cork Communications Limited requested RTE engineers to examine the quality of RTE reception in the areas of Cappoquin, Lismore and Tallow.  The company wished to ensure that RTE reception was not affected in any way by the operation of the local cable systems.  As the issue involved more than one user of the frequency spectrum, our Department was informed.  RTE engineers have been working in the area during the past week.  They investigated the quality of the reception and found there was no question of interruption of service as such.  They felt, however, that reception quality was not satisfactory and that it would benefit from some adjustments to the local cable system.  I understand that they made these recommendations to the cable company, which is currently carrying them out.</P>
    <P>I understand that these adjustments are expected to bring the quality of the reception up to the standards which will satisfy RTE, and that liaison between RTE and Cork Communications Limited will be ongoing.  Our Department will be kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there may be other reception problems in the area relating purely to the quality of the RTE signal, involving RTE Radio 2, and these are being addressed directly by RTE.</P>
    <P>I take full cognisance of the sincerity of the representations made consistently by Deputy Deasy in this case.  I will refer them again to the communications division of our Department.</P>

      <P>The deepening crisis in Irish Steel has cast a shadow of despair over the Cork region and in particular over the town of Cobh.  What is at stake here is not just the 560 jobs directly involved in the industry, with an annual wage bill of £12 million, but also the additional 500 jobs in downstream industry. A total of 1,000 jobs are now at risk and it is estimated that the Irish Steel plant is worth approximately £7 million annually to the town of Cobh.  It is not necessary to stress that the loss of this industry would be a mortal blow to the economy of Cork.  It would turn Cobh into a ghost town and would have catastrophic consequences for the workforce and their families.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I appeal to the Minister at this late hour to be more flexible in his approach to the issue.  Specifically, I am asking him to extend the deadline. As we speak there is evidence that talks are under way and there is much hope that we may achieve a breakthrough.  I appeal to the Minister to extend the 30 June deadline and I warn him that there is a real feeling in the Cork region that the level of Government attention, urgency and flexibility accorded to the issue of TEAM Aer Lingus has not been given to the crisis in Irish Steel.  That should not be allowed to happen.  The Minister demonstrated a new found flexibility on TEAM Aer Lingus last night by asking the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission to invite both sides for talks. I appeal to the Minister to show the same degree of openness and flexibility in the case of Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that steel manufacturing here as in Europe, faces difficulties but the grim reality of what the closure of Irish Steel would mean to those concerned leaves us no alternative but to ensure that no stone is left unturned in trying to reach agreement.  There must be openness and commitment and mindful of the tragic consequences of closure <Col N="1794" /> I earnestly appeal to the Minister for renewed flexibility on time.  I appeal to him to agree to meet with and listen to the unions.  As he is willing to open up new dialogue for both sides in TEAM I ask him to do likewise in an effort to resolve the crisis in Irish Steel and defer today's closure deadline to ensure the retention of the industry in Haulbowline.</P>

Any hope offered over the past 24 hours must be matched by a degree of flexibility on the part of the Minister.  I concur with Deputy Quill's appeal to allow an extension of the deadline and use every opportunity to open new avenues to fresh talks and I hope a new beginning for Irish Steel.</P>

If Irish Steel closes, it will be a disaster for the region.  Every family, including my own, will be affected.  I ask the Minister to make efforts to stave off a regional disaster.</P>

They want the Minister to clarify what he stated yesterday that if there is a breakthrough in the talks between unions and management or light at the end of the tunnel, extra time will be given to them to reach a conclusion.  Will the Minister confirm that for the benefit of those in Irish Steel and their families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the House yesterday we discussed Irish Steel and I set out why it is <Col N="1795" /> vital that agreement be reached between management and unions on net cost savings of £8.4 million per annum.  This is a basic minimum and there is no room for compromise on it.  These are the management and unions figures.</P>
      <P>There are a few inescapable facts about Irish Steel.  It is losing money on every tonne of steel it produces and sells.  There are two ways to address that problem, it either increases its selling price or it reduces its input costs.  As Irish Steel is such a small producer it has no control over its selling price.  That leaves only one avenue open to it; it must reduce its input costs and that is what the cost savings plan is about.</P>
      <P>Cost reductions was the solution recommended by the consultants I engaged at the request of the unions to look at the company and it is the solution put forward by management in its viability plan.  I am not, for one moment, saying that is an easy solution, but it is the only solution.  We cannot get away from that no matter how long we spend discussing the problem.  Extra time will not change the facts.  Previous Ministers who dealt with Irish Steel faced difficulties just as I do now.  Unfortunately, they did not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I said from the beginning that the deadline of 30 June set by the Government last April for the conclusion of negotiations on the survival of the company is not an arbitrary one which can be indefinitely extended.  With the company losing over £1 million a month it would be downright foolhardy to extend it unless there is a good prospect that an extension of time would lead to a successful conclusion of negotiations.  I also made clear that, while it would be better if agreement could be reached by today, I would be reasonable and respond positively if a little more time would produce the required results.  That was my position yesterday and it remains my position today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Losses are running at over £12 million a year.  What does £12 million mean in job creation terms?  For that investment, given the present level of IDA activity, the industrial agencies both IDA Ireland <Col N="1796" /> and Forbairt could expect a project to create at least 600 high quality jobs.  This illustrates why we cannot bear losses continually.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, negotiations are still in progress between management and unions as we speak.  This is welcome to the extent that if people are at the table negotiating there is still the prospect of reaching agreement.  However, deadlines are not set just to concentrate minds, they must mean something.  Postponing the deadline will not change the figure of £8.4 million savings that must be achieved.  However, it will change the figures in the tab the taxpayer will have to pick up if Irish Steel closes because each day Irish Steel stays in business as a loss making operation the greater the losses it runs up.  Given this stark fact, the taxpayer will not thank me for extending the deadline unless there is a good prospect of keeping Irish Steel open and saving 400 jobs there.</P>
    <P>Right now I am not in a position to make that judgement because, even as I speak, discussions are still going on between management and unions and the board of the company is still discussing the problem.  I will review the position when I get a report from the board.  I am not prepared to make any specific promises until I have the report and have had an opportunity to examine its contents. I am sure Deputies agree that the seriousness of the situation demands no less.  However, I will give careful consideration to the points made by the Cork Deputies this evening.  I share their concern and understand the effect the closure would have on the vicinity of Cork and the lower harbour.  The solution is in the hands of the people and the workforce in Cork.  The viability plan was drawn up by a number of consultants and worked through with management. It is on the table and I salute the fact that the people concerned are talking in a constructive manner.  The solution does not lie in Dublin.  It lies in Cork with the people directly and indirectly affected by it.</P>

      <P>Under the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as amended by the Status of Children Act, 1987, the father of a child born outside marriage can apply to the court to be made guardian of the child and the court will decide on the application treating the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  As in other jurisdictions, our law does not confer automatic rights of guardianship on an unmarried father.  Prior to the 1987 legislation an unmarried father could become the child's guardian only by marrying the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Court of Human Rights in its recent decision identified the central problem in the case before it as being <Col N="1683" /> the placement of the child for adoption without the prior knowledge and consent of the father.  The court found the adoption procedures to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Against this background it was not necessary for the court to examine whether our law on guardianship was in accordance with the requirements of the convention. I am keeping our law in this area under review and any proposal I may bring forward will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>
    <P>The question of changes in our adoption procedures is the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 20, 22 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>On 23 March last I outlined the position regarding interdepartmental consultation to establish the Government's response to this report.  This consultation is ongoing.  All Departments were consulted and many public sector bodies, including tripartite bodies at national and local level, as mentioned in the working group recommendations, are in turn being consulted by their parent Departments. Effective progress on many of the recommendations will involve partnerships between interest groups and relevant public sector authorities.  I hope to see progress in respect of these in the coming months.  This consultation process does not preclude immediate action being taken and already steps are being taken to advance a number of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 24 May I indicated in a reply to a question the position regarding arrangements for allocating the £1 million included in my Department's Estimate to support the initiation of a number of pilot childcare measures in disadvantaged areas.  Since then, the board of Area Development Management Limited has agreed to administer the scheme.  ADM is already involved in local enterprise and <Col N="1685" /> related initiatives and is well placed to ensure the strong local employer, community and other interest participation envisaged by the working group in the development of childcare provision. ADM, through the area partnership companies, will invite proposals for grant assistance for new and innovative childcare projects sponsored by community groups under the pilot scheme.  Arrangements in that regard are well advanced.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to the provision of a suitable allocation to be set aside for childcare as a support measure relating to equal opportunities in connection with EU co-financed employment and training schemes as part of the human resources programme under the National Development Plan.  This development which corresponds to a specific recommendation of the working group on child care facilities for working parents, is being pursued in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  It is also welcome in view of the commitments on childcare in the Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>I have also ensured that childcare provision commitments have been clearly profiled in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> This is fully consistent with the recommendation that future collective agreements address this area.  I am satisfied that the issue will increasingly find its way onto the collective bargaining agenda of individual enterprises.  I consider that it must do so in order to ensure an optimum response to the variety of concerns of working parents and employers regarding such matters.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contains an undertaking to introduce by 1996 statutory regulation of minimum standards for childcare facilities in accordance with Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the speech referred to in the question.  The equal status legislation which I am bringing forward will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including disability.  Another objective of the legislation will be to make discrimination unlawful not only in the workplace but also in education, in the provision of goods, facilities and services including recreational facilities and services, entertainment, accommodation, transport and professional services and in the disposal of accommodation or other premises.</P>
      <P>The work of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which had its first meeting on 8 December 1993, is well advanced.  Its main task is to advise the Government on policy and other changes which are necessary to ensure greater equality for people with disabilities. The commission is to submit its report to me within two years.  Over the past few weeks, the commission has held &ldquo;listening&rdquo; meetings in Sligo, Tralee, Athlone and Kilkenny to find out the views of people with disabilities on the changes they would like to see implemented to bring about greater participation and equality.  Further &ldquo;listening&rdquo; meetings are planned for Dublin and other locations throughout the country in the coming months.  Working is also well under in my Department in facilitiating the establishment of a Council for the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to improving the employment prospects of people with disabilities.  The percentage of people with disability employed in Civil <Col N="1687" /> Service has now reached 3 per cent of total staff numbers.  I intend to continue with my efforts in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service and in the public sector generally to maximise the recruitment of people with disabilities.  In so far as the interests of women with disabilities may be adversely affected in the current climate, I am satisfied that the initiatives outlined above should enable corrective actions to be taken.</P>

      <P>The Government has approved my proposals for legislation on this issue and it is intended to bring forward a Bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the directive &mdash; to provide for a minimum of 14 weeks maternity leave &mdash; is already encompassed in the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981.  The proposed legislation will extend the right to maternity leave to all workers, including agency workers.</P>
      <P>A new right to health and safety leave will be introduced and may be exercised where a risk to a pregnant mother or her child exists in the workplace which cannot be remedied by a change in working conditions and where no suitable alternative work is available.  The payment of an appropriate allowance during such absence on health and safety grounds will be provided by the Department of Social Welfare following a short initial period where employers will be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pregnant or breastfeeding workers will <Col N="1688" /> not be obliged to perform nightwork, where this is certified as necessary for their safety or health.</P>
    <P>A right to time off for ante-natal and post-natal medical care without loss of pay will also be created.</P>
    <P>Redress procedure will be provided through a Rights Commissioner with an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>While exercising their entitlements to maternity leave or to health and safety protection, employees' employment rights will be preserved, including a prohibition on dismissal for any reason connected with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish the text of the Bill later this year in time for consideration by the Oireachtas before the date for implementation of the directive.  My colleagues, the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare, are also considering appropriate measures to give effect to the directive in so far as their areas of responsibility, health and safety protection and social security matters, respectively, arise.  In addition, my Department has written to employers' organisations and trades unions so that necessary consultations on the proposals can take place.</P>

      <P>The issue of why some work areas employ mostly men and others mostly women is only one dimension of the overall phenomenon of gender segregation in employment.  This question is widely recognised as one which is not fully explained by examining employment practices.  Education and training can be key determinants as can broader attitudes and traditions in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is undoubtedly value in providing greater insight into gender segregation through research whether in education, employment or any other sphere of activity in society.  The recent ESRI report on wage differentials between men and women was jointly commissioned by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency.  The agency is also involved in research on trends in gender segregation in employment since the introduction of equality <Col N="1690" /> legislation.  This study will avail of the most recent data available from the 1992 Labour Force survey.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of that study I would not propose to initiate a further study along the lines proposed by the Deputy.  However, I will request the agency to review the question of what further research in this area might contribute to addressing any policy and action gaps which might exist.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy that there is low intake of people with a disability into the Civil Service.  As the Deputy is aware, it is Government policy to recruit people with disabilities into the Civil Service and arrangements for doing so have been in place for many years.  I am happy to say that the target quota of 3 per cent for the employment of people with disabilities was reached in the Civil Service last year.  The Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service, which issued recently, calls on all Government Departments to continue to play their full part in employing people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by (a) from time to time holding special competitions confined to people with a disability, (b) <Col N="1693" /> facilitating people with a disability when competing in other open competitions and (c) where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment. Recruitment competitions for appointment as executive officer and clerical assistant, both of which include a competition reserved specifically for people with disabilities, are currently under way.</P>
    <P>While the Civil Service Commission from time to time holds competitions confined solely to people who are registered as having a disability, such as those mentioned above, it is open to anyone with or without a disability to apply for any open recruitment competition for which they are eligible.  There are no central records of the number of staff with disabilities recruited by means of standard open competitions.  The information on newly recruited staff supplied by Departments to the central database in my Department does not identify staff with disabilities, nor do I consider it appropriate that it should.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Disabled Drivers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, which govern the current disabled drivers scheme, a qualifying disabled driver or passenger with severe mobility problems is entitled to significant tax concessions on the acquisition and necessary adaptation of a vehicle for his/her use. To be eligible for the scheme, the driver or passenger must satisfy medical criteria laid down in the regulations and be in possession of a medical certificate issued by his/her Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health (DCC). In the case of a qualifying driver the disablement must be of such a nature that the person concerned could not drive the vehicle unless it is specially constructed or adapted to take account of that disablement. The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and qualifying claimants who obtain the appropriate <Col N="1695" /> medical certification must be registered with the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no record of receiving a formal application for inclusion in the scheme from the person concerned.  Consequently, I am not in a position to give a definitive reason as to why the person is ineligible.  If, however, the person concerned has been refused a medical certificate by the DCC, it is open to her to appeal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, which has been established under the aforementioned regulations.  Her case will be considered afresh and, if the appeal is successful, a medical certificate would be issued.  I, as Minister for Finance, have no function as regards the approval of applications under the scheme nor do the regulations give me any discretion to waive any of the conditions necessary for inclusion in the scheme.</P>

      <P>In this context it should be noted that under the income tax code elderly people already receive more favourable treatment than other taxpayers.

      <Quest>if working spouses on community employment schemes have a flat-rate disregard of £30 applied to their earnings; and his views on whether this is fair in comparison with other workers who have a £45 per week disregard.</Quest>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides that the earnings of a claimant's spouse are assessable as means for Unemployment Assistance purposes. <Col N="1698" /> However, in computing the means an amount of earnings is disregarded in recognition of the work related expenses incurred by the working spouse.  This amount is fixed at £45 per week where the spouse works for four days or more per week and at £30 where three days or less are worked.  These disregards apply to all working spouses including spouses working in Community Employment.</P>
      <P>Persons engaged in Community Employment work part-time, up to 20 hours or 2½ days per week.  Accordingly the allowance appropriate to persons engaged in Community Employment is £30.</P>
      <P>Community Employment participants are allowed to take other part-time work and in such cases the higher £45 allowance (four days or more per week) applies.</P>

      <Quest>if, arising from his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 67 of 23 June 1994, the statistics for the number of unemployed in Dublin's inner city have already been made available to the inner city partnerships by a section of his Department.</Quest>

      <P>Parliamentary Question No. 67 of 23 June 1994 requested the percentage increase in the number of unemployed in Dublin's inner city over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on levels of unemployment is maintained and published by the Central Statistics Office.  This information is largely, although not exclusively, based on data supplied by the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare and on the Live Register numbers at those offices.  The reply to the earlier question indicated correctly that statistics are not kept by the Department in a way which enabled the claimants living in particular areas to be identified and consequently to measure, as requested changes in the number of such claimants <Col N="1699" /> over a period of time.  This is the factual situation.</P>
    <P>From time to time special surveys are carried out by my Department to identify categories of claimants or claimants living in particular areas.  These are done for research or operational reasons or on special request.</P>
    <P>Further examination of this matter now confirms that at the request of the Dublin Inner City Partnership a special survey was done in 1993 and again recently to estimate the number of unemployed people in specified inner-city areas.  These surveys were done as an exceptional measure and they required considerable time and effort.  The data, while reasonably indicative for the purposes of the partnership, were not subject to the normal level of validation which is applied to formally published statistics such as the Live Register data.  The results of the first of the two exercises no longer appear to have been retained in the Department as they were not required for administrative purposes. Consequently the percentage movements in numbers over the last two years are not available.</P>
    <P>My Department makes every effort to respond positively to requests where possible within tight resource constraints and the time limit available for replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>The 1994 exercise showed some 14,530 registered unemployed on the Live Register in the areas covered by the special survey, i.e. postal districts 1 and 2 and parts of districts 4, 7 and 8.</P>

      <P>Legislation regulating betting and bookmakers' premises is set out in the Betting Act, 1931.  Various amendments to fiscal aspects of this Act and in relation to the collection by the Revenue Commissioners of betting duty have been introduced over the years by the Minister for Finance in annual Finance Acts.  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are empowered under the Finance Act, 1926 to request security in respect of the payment by bookmakers of betting duty and that, under this provision, payment of duty on bets is secured by bond, cover note or cash deposit.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the 1931 Act contains provisions whereby renewal of a bookmaker's licence may be refused. Under section 6 of the Act, a Garda Superintendent is empowered to refuse to issue the requisite annual certificate of personal fitness to an applicant for a bookmaker's licence, whenever specified grounds for such refusal apply.  The failure to pay winning bets without reasonable cause constitutes one of the specified grounds of refusal.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for the introduction of amending legislation to the Betting Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>My Department does not maintain records of the ownership of individual bookmaker's premises.  A register of all duly licenced bookmakers' premises is kept by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with section 8 of the Act and the Deputy may, therefore, wish to contact the Office of the Revenue Commissioners directly to obtain particulars of the registration details of premises referred to by him.</P>

      <P>On 23 June 1994, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 23 I informed the Deputy that statistics in relation to drug seizures for the years 1993 and 1994 are not yet available.  It is expected that the 1993 Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime will be published in the near future which will include particulars of drugs seized in 1993.  As in previous years, the report will not contain a breakdown of the amount or type of drugs seized on a county or Garda divisional basis, though it will contain particulars of the number <Col N="1704" /> of persons charged in each Garda Division for drug offences during 1993. Statistics for 1994 have not been compiled yet.  The further details sought by the Deputy are not readily available, and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>
      <P>I have previously informed this House that the Garda authorities are treating the problem of drug offending with the highest priority and I fully support their efforts in this respect.  The Garda authorities continually monitor the drug situation and constantly review and adapt their strategies as appropriate to deal with it.  While I cannot go into details on particular Garda strategies.  I can say that these strategies involve surveillance, intelligence gathering and targeting of suspects as well as close liaison, both nationally and internationally, with Custom authorities and police so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.  In this regard, the Garda authorities are satisfied that sufficient attention is paid to County Wexford, including Rosslare Harbour.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for detections of drug smuggling and importation is shared with the Customs and Excise service who, I understand, allocate resources to the problem at all ports of entry to the country, including Rosslare Harbour.</P>

      <P>Minimum statutory rates of pay and conditions of employment of a wide range of workers employed in hotels and catering establishments are prescribed in Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals from the Hotels Joint Labour Committee and the Catering Joint Labour Committee respectively.  These EROs apply to workers employed in hotels anywhere throughout the State except the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and to workers employed in catering establishments anywhere throughout the State except the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The prescribed rates of pay and other conditions apply to all workers covered by the orders, including young people employed for summer work.</P>
      <P>Routine inspections are undertaken by inspectors of my Department to ensure that employers are complying with the terms of the EROs.  In addition, the inspectors pursue reported breaches of the orders.  Appropriate action to ensure compliance with the provisions of the orders is taken where breaches are discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates of pay in areas not covered by the EROs are a matter for negotiation <Col N="1706" /> between employers and workers or a trade union acting on their behalf.  I should mention, however, that a Joint Labour Committee for catering establishments in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, which do not come within the scope of the existing ERO, has recently been established.  It is expected that the new committee will submit proposals for an ERO to the Labour Court in the near future.</P>
    <P>The question of negotiating improvements in pay and conditions in the hotel and catering industries is a matter for collective determination between employers and employees and, where appropriate, for the relevant Joint Labour Committees.</P>

      <P>As the proposed bridge would connect two regional roads responsibility for it would be a matter for Galway County Council.  In the normal way, the cost would fall to be met by the council from its own resources, supplemented by their discretionary grants which, in 1994, amount to £4.525 million.</P>
      <P>Under the new scheme of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement works on non-national roads, a grant of £1.610 million for selected projects was allocated to Galway County Council in 1994.  No application for a grant in respect of the bridge in question was submitted by Galway County Council under this scheme.  It will, however, be open to the council to consider whether to apply in 1995 for a grant in respect of the bridge, taking into account the conditions governing the specific improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <P>The development strategy which underpins the proposed Central Sea Corridor port development programme is focused on improving competitiveness and expanding the capacity of the internationally traded sectors of the Irish economy.  Port development proposals at a total estimated cost of £68 million have been submitted by Dublin Port and Docks Board for consideration for EC aid.</P>
      <P>The provision of a freight ro-ro facility at the North Quay extension, Dublin Port, at a total estimated cost of £5.5 million, has been approved by the EU for Cohesion Fund aid at the rate of 65 per cent of project cost.  A lo-lo terminal enhancement project at a total estimated cost of £9 million has been submitted to the EU for consideration for Cohesion Fund aid.  The EU's decision on this is expected during the second quarter of 1994.</P>
      <P>The other proposals submitted by the board are under consideration in the context of the utilisation of the next round of Structural Funds.  As the Deputy will be aware of comprehensive port development programme, involving a substantial expenditure programme over the years 1994 to 1999, as included in the National Development Plan.  Dublin Port projects which are shown to be justified will be strongly supported by the Department for Structural Fund aid.</P>
      <P>This investment is in addition to an EU-assisted investment of £22 million in the provision of bulk and unitised facilities at Dublin Port under the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-1993 which programme is now virtually complete.</P>

    <P>In relation to ferry services a comprehensive strategy for the development of ferry services on the central sea corridor was recently approved.  This strategy involves the parallel and complementary development of ferry terminals both at Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire and also the development of Holyhead to facilitate the earliest possible introduction of both B &amp; I's and Stena Sealink's new vessels.  The upgrading <Col N="1717" /> of ferry terminal facilities in Dublin Port to facilitate B &amp; I's new ferry is under consideration for EU aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1993 a limited number of consignments of oysters have been imported from France by some Irish shellfish farmers for ongrowing at Irish sites.  These importations have been legally permissable since 1 January 1993 when the Single Market meant that longstanding barriers to trade in live fish and shellfish were removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the consignments imported to date have been certified by the French authorities as free of the major shellfish diseases, in accordance with the relevant EU Directive on fish health.  The consignments have been subject to regular sampling by the Department's Fisheries Research Centre to verify their health <Col N="1718" /> status.  While none of the listed shellfish diseases has been detected, some of the consignments have been found to contain other shellfish species and the parasite mytiliscola orientalis.  These are not considered by EU veterinary experts to pose any significant threat to the growth rate and survival of oyster stocks.  They are, however of some concern to the Department's scientific experts who are currently assessing the stocks in question.</P>
    <P>In view of these concerns the Irish authorities have already negotiated the strengthening of the relevant directive to minimise the risk of inadvertent imports of other species in such consignments. We have also insisted that the French authorities apply more rigorous checks on stocks at source.  As a further precaution, the industry has been advised to confine imports to nursery seed which is less likely to pose a problem.</P>
    <P>It is primarily up to the Irish shellfish industry, in its own interest, to ensure that its members act responsibly when sourcing stock from abroad.  The Department, for its part, will continue to deploy all mechanisms available under EU law to ensure that possible disease risks are minimised.</P>

      <P>I propose to <Col N="1720" /> take Questions Nos. 75 to 80 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>All of these questions relate directly or indirectly to the legal case mentioned by the Deputy which is pending before the Supreme Court.  To the extent that the Deputy's questions relate to issues which impinge upon or are contingent on the outcome of legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Article 169 proceedings I am satisfied as to the accuracy of the statements contained in the letter dated 5 March 1991 addressed to the Commission of the EC.  These proceedings were opened by the Commission in their letter of 19 December 1990 and were suspended on 21 March 1991 pending the outcome of the action initiated by the plaintiff in the Irish courts.  In the interim, the Irish Government had written to the Commission on 5 March 1991 refuting the contents of the Commission letter of 19 December 1990.</P>
      <P>The matter has not yet been disposed of because, as I have indicated, the infringement proceedings have been suspended pending the outcome of the legal proceedings in the Irish courts on the matter.  With regard to the steps taken by my Department to correct the breaches of procedure claimed in the Commission letter of 19 December 1990, the position is that my Department has implemented the ruling of the High Court in so far as it relates to such breaches.  However, these matters are under appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Eleven companies replied to the letter of 12 February 1990.</P>
      <P>Damages, including interest, amounting to £450,596.17 were paid by my Department in accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling of 16 July, 1992. No costs have been paid to the plaintiff. Any payment of costs to the plaintiff in this case is subject to the outcome of the Supreme Court case to which I have referred.  State costs have not yet been quantified as the case has not been finalised.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium on six cows under the 1993 suckler cow scheme.  She also applied on four animals and on 13 animals under the June 1993 ten and 22 month special beef premium schemes. She did not lodge an area aid application in 1993.  Therefore payment under both schemes was held pending a decision from the EU which would allow payment on up to 15 livestock units without an area aid application.  This concession has been granted and any payments due to her will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The production of alternative fuels is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, my Department has a significant interest in this area arising from the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which allows for the growing of tillage crops for non-food purposes on set-aside land. Preliminary figures available from this year's arable area aid applications indicate that a total of 34,907 hectares has been set-aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The production of biofuels from crops grown on this set-aside land is permitted under the EU rules and accordingly I am <Col N="1727" /> anxious to see some developments in this area which would provide additional opportunites for our tillage farmers.</P>
    <P>My Department has been active in this area through the Biomass Committee established last year by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, with the support of my Department, to consider the potential energy use of biomass and biofuels.  Recently officials of my Department have had discussions with a number of companies who are examining the possibility of developing a biofuel industry here.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide additional coronary artery by-pass graft, CABG, procedures.  Since coming into office, I have been concerned to ensure the expansion of existing facilities for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector. <Col N="1738" /> In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital.  In addition, in 1993, I provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200-400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>The major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre is ongoing.  I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development which is nearing completion includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
      <P>This development, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of open heart surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to savings achieved by a number of practices under the indicative drug target scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation in the context of the GMS review it was agreed that, in common with other developed countries, medicines are not always prescribed in the most effective manner in this country and that, accordingly, there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing <Col N="1739" /> practice leading to better patient care and better use of the resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>Each doctor was, accordingly, encouraged to examine his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any available opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for patients.  To assist in this process doctors were provided with indicative drug targets.</P>
    <P>The operation of the indicative target scheme resulted in savings amounting to £5.4 million being achieved in 1993 by 645 doctors.  The amount of money involved means that on average savings of £8,000 were achieved by those doctors who were under budget.  I understand that the preliminary findings from analyses indicate savings were effected through a variety of measures, including an increased use of generic drugs and a revision in prescribing practices in relation to both the dosage and volume-duration of medicine prescribed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the scheme, half the savings made will be made available to the individual doctors concerned for practice development projects which receive the prior approval of the health board.  This resource will be allocated towards improving facilities within general practice for the purposes of providing a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.</P>

The request is presently under the examination by my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Health Board, and a decision will be reached shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 to 133, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As in all circumstances where resources are finite, there is scope for development and my Department will give every consideration to this as and when resources allow.  On foot of an interim report by the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disabilities, £1.5 million was provided in 1993 for service developments, including the provision of speech therapy services. This is being maintained in the annual funding, and a further £1.5 million has been made available in 1994.</P>
      <P>Regarding the requirement for the service and the numbers employed in the provision of such a service, I should explain to the Deputy that in accordance with my Department's current personnel policy, health boards and hospitals have discretion to prioritise service demands and the related staffing composition within their overall established staffing complement and financial allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> According to the most recent figures available, the number of speech therapists employed by health boards is 148.  The corresponding number for non-health board hospitals, mental handicap homes and specialist agencies is 57.</P>
    <P>The lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists graduating each year has been a difficulty in relation to the provision of service in recent years. My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin commencing in the 1992-93 academic year. The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96.  This increased level of graduate output should make a significant improvement in the provision of speech therapy services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rate of remuneration of speech therapists, this issue has already been addressed in the House by Minister O'Dea on the Adjournment Debate of the Dáil on 14 June.  The pay claim is being actively pursued through the normal industrial relations channels and within the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> On the question of the attractions available to the profession overseas, the decision to travel and gain experience abroad is entirely a personal decision and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on what is essentially a matter of personal choice.</P>

      <P>The basic working week for all non-consultant hospital doctors &mdash; NCHDs &mdash; is 39 hours.  However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week.  The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with health service management and the Irish Medical Organisation, has recently completed a study of NCHD hours in five hospitals.  The report of this study is in the course of being drafted.  It would be inappropriate for me to anticipate the findings of the study at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to compare the working conditions of Irish junior hospital doctors with those prevailing elsewhere as the medical career structure and postgraduate training system in Ireland and the United Kingdom are virtually unique. However, compared to the United Kingdom, Irish NCHDs work shorter hours.  NCHDs in the United Kingdom are still contracted to work up to 72 hours per week compared to 65 in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, the Council of the European Union adopted the Directive on Working Time.  The directive provides for a <Col N="1744" /> maximum working week of 48 hours. Among several groups excluded from the provision of the directive are &ldquo;doctors in training&rdquo;.  Therefore, NCHDs have been excluded from the directive.  However, the EU Commission is at present examining the implications of applying the original directive, or a similar more specific instrument to doctors in training. My Department is participating in the design of a European-wide study to assess the implications of restricting hospital doctors' working hours.</P>
    <P>While working long hours might be thought to have a detrimental effect on a doctor's capacity to deliver optimum care, I have to point out that under present arrangements, no distinction is made between actual time spent working and time spent &ldquo;on call&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board is the statutory agency which has responsibility for promoting, conducting or commissioning medical and epidemiological research. In making its decisions on whether or not to support a particular research proposal, the board uses an established system of evaluation involving peer review which assesses the merits of proposals submitted for funding.  Decisions by the board to fund individual projects are made on a strictly impartial basis having regard to the relative merits of the proposals submitted and the outcome of a competitive interview process involving applicants.  I have been given to understand by the board that the proposals by the Irish College of General Practitioners which concerned research on care of the elderly were assessed by the Epidemiology and <Col N="1745" /> General Practice Committee of the board and were not recommended for funding by the committee.  It is open to the applicants to resubmit the projects for support out of the board's 1995 research grants.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the role of the general practitioner is particularly important in the development of services for the elderly.  In that regard my Department has provided a grant out of the General Practice Development Fund to support an applied research project by the college in the care of the elderly.  The project concerns the functional assessment of the elderly by general practitioners, especially the effectiveness of interventions by general practitioners involving elderly patients.  In addition, the national health strategy, as part of the development of general practitioner services, provides a commitment to support the college in the development of quality assurance measures for general practice.  My Department will be meeting the college shortly to progress the implementation of this commitment.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which I was pleased to bring into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives: firstly, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and, secondly, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons in this country will be well cared for.</P>
      <P>So far a total of £9 million has been made available in 1994 for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act, 1990. Funding was allocated to health boards on the basis of the size of the nursing home sector and expected demand under the new subvention scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in contact with the health boards to establish the extent to which boards are up-to-date in payments due in respect of subventions approved under the Act.  All of the health boards, with the exception of the Western Health Board, have paid invoices for subventions from nursing home proprietors up to 31 May 1994 with the exception of some homes <Col N="1747" /> which have yet to provide tax clearance certificates or who are having difficulties with registration.  In the case of the Western Health Board, arrangements are being made to have outstanding invoices cleared as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility. These guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not think it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parent's means, particularly in view of the very many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to <Col N="1748" /> such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>I recently met with representatives of the Irish Countrywomen's Association to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and the question of the provision of a national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>As a result of our discussions, the ICA and my Department will be working together to develop a breast cancer awareness programme for women.  It has been agreed that a sub-committee of the ICA will work closely with my Department's health promotion unit with a view to conducting a series of seminars/workshops for women on breast cancer.  The first meeting between Department officials and the ICA sub-committee has been arranged for Tuesday, 5 July, 1994.</P>
      <P>With regard to a national breast screening programme, it was accepted at this meeting that an essential factor in the success of a mammography screening programme is a high and consistent participation rate among the population to be screened.  There was general agreement on the need to achieve standards of excellence in both the mammography equipment used and the staff carrying out the technique to ensure that the number of false negative and false positive results is kept to an absolute minimum.</P>

I have been informed that arrangements are being made at Wexford General Hospital to provide a staff car park at the rear of the hospital.  This should alleviate the problem of car parking congestion during visiting hours.</P>

      <Col N="1755" /> Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socioeconomic indicators.

Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

      <P>I recently announced the establishment of a pilot pre-school project in eight designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the selection of locations for inclusion in the pilot pre-school project were taken after detailed consideration of needs across the disadvantaged areas.  In this process, it was decided that the pilot phase would concentrate on large urban areas of greatest disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In the case of each area chosen, the intention is that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment area of the school to which the project is being attached.  I would be most anxious that the projects now being established should not in any way interfere with existing pre-schools which I would see as continuing to serve their existing catchment areas.

      <P>School attendance committees are responsible for the enforcement of the School Attendance Act in certain parts of Dublin and in Cork and Waterford. In all other areas the Garda Síochána have responsibility.  Consequently figures for school drop out rates are not in the normal course available to my Department.</P>
      <P>A review of the operation of the School Attendance Act, including an examination of the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved was carried out by officers of my Department recently and I published their report entitled <i>School Attendance/Truancy Report</i> on 8 April 1994.</P>
      <P>Some research findings examined for this report indicated that up to 8 per cent of primary school leavers may not transfer to second-level schools at all. The report pointed out that the limited data available may mask cases of severe drop-out rates in schools serving socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  The report also points out that the absence of more detailed information is a serious obstacle to a balanced analysis of the issue and it made a number of recommendations in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am proposing to make the report a basis for developing my proposals in relation to school attendance with particular regard to the functions that may be appropriate to regional education councils.

    <P>My Department has adopted a range of strategies to help prevent early school leaving and under achievement.

These include initiatives such as pre-schooling, remedial and home/school/community liaison services, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services, and ancillary services and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas.  A limited <Col N="1760" /> number of youth encounter projects are also provided for young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so, and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system.  There is a youth encounter project in Finglas. &mdash; curricular reform &mdash; junior cert schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the applied leaving cert programme &mdash; to encourage an improvement in retention rates to completion of senior cycle to 90 per cent of the total cohort &mdash; second chance education and training through the provision of youthreach for unqualified early school leavers over 15.
