    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>From 12 January this year I paid a six day official visit to Mexico, on the invitation of President Salinas.</P>
      <P>The main objective of my visit was to develop ties between our two countries and, in particular, to boost Irish trade and investment in this fast developing market of 88 million people. Relations between our two countries have always been friendly. Mexico is now an important and growing market for Irish goods and services &mdash; in 1992 we had exports to Mexico of £87 million, the most significant products being milk powder and pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>During my visit I held discussions with President Salinas, with Mr. Tello, the Mexican Foreign Minister, and with those ministers holding the major economic portfolios, including the Minister for Finance and Minister for Agriculture. I had a particular concern to try to resolve the problem of the Mexican ban on beef exports from Ireland. This ban is due to Mexican fears about BSE. In Ireland's case, of course, this fear is totally unfounded, but in order to resolve the issue we must allay Mexican fears. Towards this end, in my contacts in Mexico, I was facilitated by the concerted efforts my Government had already made at ministerial and diplomatic level.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to confirm that the two Governments have jointly agreed a number of measures which should allow for the resumption of beef exports from Ireland to Mexico at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to maximise the gains from my official visit I was accompanied by a 21-strong mission of senior Irish business <Col N="4" /> executives, co-ordinated by An Bord Tráchtála. I was very pleased to witness the announcement of a major Kerry Group investment in a Mexican food plant and the decision by the Smurfit organisation to increase its investment in Mexico substantially. I was also glad to be associated with the agreement of trade deals in banking software and water purification tablets. I also took the opportunity to support the interests of the other companies represented on the trade delegation, including those from the education sector. In the area of services An Bord Tráchtála have identified considerable potential for growth in the provision of English language and business courses in Ireland and our fast growing education sector should benefit accordingly.</P>
    <P>An Bórd Tráchtála estimates that there are now twice as many Irish companies doing business in Mexico as there were three years ago and that with the resolution of the beef problem, we can double our trade in a short number of years. All these initiatives should benefit growth and employment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>A formal agreement has now been signed between ABT and Mexico's federal trade bank, Bancomext, to open and facilitate credit lines for additional trade, investment and tourism projects. A visit to Ireland by a Mexican trade delegation later this year is also a strong possibility and this should contribute to the further development of trade between the two countries.</P>
    <P>From the position of being a very protected economy Mexico has moved rapidly to liberalise trade and investment flows, symbolised by its membership of GATT and most recently by its joining the North American Free Trade Area Agreement (NAFTA). In consequence of these changes Mexico is very interested in the historical parallels with Ireland's membership of the European Communities &mdash; in particular, how membership of a larger trading bloc has impacted on our economy. I addressed this theme in a lecture at the Colegio de Mexico, the most prestigious centre for <Col N="5" /> European Union studies in Latin America.</P>
    <P>The Irish community in Mexico is small but active in the life of their host country, and is particularly prominent in areas such as education. I met the Irish community to express my appreciation of their contribution both to their home country and their country of residence. Although contact between Ireland and Mexico has not been extensive, the Irish soldiers who died in 1847 fighting for their adopted homeland remain a cherished memory in Mexico. Their contribution and the present day efforts of our citizens in Mexico provide a positive fund of goodwill on which to further build cordial bilateral relations. I wish to pay tribute to the excellent work of the Irish Honorary Consul in Mexico, Mr. Romulo O'Farrill, whose dedication and commitment over three decades in that position has contributed enormously to closer Irish-Mexican relations.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity to brief President Salinas and other Government Ministers on developments relating to Northern Ireland. They expressed their full support for the Joint Declaration as a first step towards a lasting peace with justice in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions with President Salinas I expressed my concern over the conflict which had just taken place in Chiapas State. I expressed sympathy and regret on the loss of life caused through that conflict along with my concerns to learn of how the underlying problems might be dealt with. President Salinas advised me that a ceasefire on both sides had been established and that he had appointed Mr. Camacho, the former foreign minister, as peace commissioner to investigate and mediate the Chiapas conflict. I expressed my best wishes for a negotiated and peaceful resolution to these problems which would allow all the Mexican people to benefit from their growing economy.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that within the last few days the Mexican Government has recognised the southern Mexican guerilla group as a political force and <Col N="6" /> called for a rapid and serious political settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have any discussions while in Mexico with opposition parties? Mexico is unique in the western hemisphere in that the same party has been in office since the twenties and there are some doubts about the fairness of elections held there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. As the Deputy may be aware, a presidential election will take place later this year and I did not want to get involved in any internal politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not normal for heads of state visiting this country to meet with the Opposition as well as with the Government? Did the Taoiseach not consider it worthwhile even to ask that he should meet members of the opposition in Mexico?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already commented very extensively on the questions of concern to the Irish people in relation to the problems in Chiapas state and beyond that I did not go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Taoiseach is aware that 40 per cent of the population of Mexico live below the poverty line and that Chiapas, where the rising took place, is one of the most impoverished states. Apart from being assured by the Mexican authorities that a ceasefire had been negotiated, did he press on the Mexican authorities issues with regard to the human rights of the people of Mexico?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At my meeting with President Salinas he was very forthcoming in relation to the problems in Chiapas state. That state is suffering serious poverty and deprivation and the illiteracy rate is very high. The President said he had sent his foreign minister, with full plenipotentiary powers, to mediate and find a resolution to the problem and that they had called a unilateral ceasefire <Col N="7" /> the day before. There was much concern in Mexico that the fighting and shooting should stop. On that aspect of the meeting my view was that President Salinas was very genuine in his approach to trying to find a solution to the conflict. Now that the Mexican economy is on the up it may be possible for him to do more for the poorer areas. He had already included in the 1994 expenditures 10 per cent of GDP to improve the lot of people such as those in Chiapas state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What types of business were represented on the 21 man trade mission which accompanied the Taoiseach? Will he indicate priority areas for Irish exporters to Mexico and the areas of greatest potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide variety of sectors was represented on the 21 company trade mission that accompanied me. As the Deputy is aware the Kerry Group announced a major investment in a Mexican food plant. It is very bullish in its whole approach to the Mexican market. It believes it can establish a good manufacturing and distribution unit there and that there are also possibilities to export there some of its products from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major items to be resolved on the mission was, of course, to get the Mexican Government to lift its restrictions on the entry of beef into the Mexican market. This market had been building up before it was closed down a few years ago. Next week a veterinary mission from the Department of Agriculture will go to Mexico to give whatever assurances are required by the Mexican Government, who now understand that we do not have BSE problems. It is true there were no incidences of BSE in any cattle born in Ireland after 1989 and that it had occurred only in very old cows. We finally reached agreement and issued a joint statement and there is no reason to believe there is a problem now. The normal inspection of plants in Ireland by Mexican veterinary inspectors will be carried out after the visit of the veterinary <Col N="8" /> mission from the Department of Agriculture to its counterparts in Mexico.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities in the area of education, both in language teaching and in business courses. I understand from the private institutions on the trade mission that they expect to do considerable business there. It is true that we have a Mexican school in Leopardstown. There are some students in Trinity and other colleges. There is much potential in that area.</P>
    <P>We also do well in areas such as milk powder and pharmaceuticals. Some of our software firms succeeded in getting considerable business there. This is a good base from which to attack the South American markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate there is a glaring omission from his report to the House. The matter in which the Irish people are most interested, so far as Mexico is concerned, has not been touched on. Did he not do a reconnaisance of the Mexican soccer team and does he not have a report on the strengths and weaknesses of that team?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a more serious note, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Mexican authorities accept that our beef is as good as any in the world and that any question of a BSE scare is totally unjustified from the point of view of buying our beef? While I am glad to note the success of the Kerry Group's investment in a Mexican food plant and the decision by the Smurfit organisation to invest about $100 million there, I am more interested in the benefits which may flow as regards jobs here. Does the Taoiseach expect a reasonable number of jobs as a result of our contacts with Mexico?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in my reply, we reached agreement and issued a joint statement. The Irish veterinarian delegation is going to Mexico next week <Col N="9" /> from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to get its business organised. Then a Mexican veterinarian delegation has to come here to approve whatever plants will export to Mexico. That is normal business practice. There is no reason whatsoever that beef exports to Mexico cannot be resumed.</P>
      <P>In relation to soccer, I made preliminary inquiries and I was surprised to hear that the Mexicans have grave fears of meeting the Irish team&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they do not expect to beat Ireland. In fact the coach for the Mexican team stayed in the same hotel as I. It has grave fears in relation to playing Ireland. I said we did not have fears about beating Mexico. Deputy O'Keeffe will agree that trade missions abroad are never defined in terms of jobs. It is true that two leading Irish companies have made investments there&mdash;that is within their own corporate strategy&mdash;that there is a limit to some of the additional investments that these companies make in Ireland and that they have made international investments to try to underpin the structure of their expanding companies. That refers to the Smurfit Group and the Kerry Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate whether or not the question of the suitability of Irish beef processing plants was raised in the course of his visit? My understanding is that the Mexican authorities sent inspectors here to check out the suitability of Irish plants and found that 10 per cent of them were unsuitable and that this is part of the reason for the embargo on Irish beef. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether that problem has been overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When clearing plants to export to foreign countries, it is common practice for such countries to lay down their own conditions, hygiene standards and so on. It is true that all of the Irish plants did not pass the test on the last visit of the Mexican authorities. It is a <Col N="10" /> matter for the plants to get their houses in order and make sure that when the Mexican authorities return shortly they will be in a position to approve all of the plants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>On 10 January 1994, together with the Ministers for Finance, Social Welfare, Enterprise and Employment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society and Macra na Feirme, to open discussions on a new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined the Government's view that a new programme must, as an essential requirement for increased employment, continue the emphasis on moderate competitive income increases, on macro-economic stability to maintain low inflation, to continue the trend towards lower interest rates and to maintain progress in the reduction of the national debt. The social partners accepted the Government's view that the key objective <Col N="11" /> of a new programme should be employment and that the elements of the programme should be judged on their contribution to the growth and maintenance of viable jobs. Each side outlined the priorities they saw in that regard, including, in particular, structural changes in policies for job creation and maintenance, policy for macro-economic stability, human resource development, tax reform, competitiveness in all its dimensions from costs to innovation, development in agriculture, food and the rural economy and developing social equity.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed at that meeting that discussions would commence on 11 January on the negotiation of a new programme using the mechanism of the central review committee and that these discussions would proceed quickly so that progress could be taken into account in the budget.</P>
    <P>On 25 January, accompanied by the Tánaiste and Ministers for Finance, Enterprise and Employment and Agriculture, Forestry and Food, I met representatives of the social partners to review progress in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that considerable progress had been made on substantial elements of the programme in relation to work, agriculture, pay, socio-economic stability and social equity.</P>
    <P>The overall approach to pay in the emerging programme was aimed at improving competitiveness and the environment for employment growth, while enabling further progress to be made on social issues. All sides noted the important steps foreshadowed in the material discussed on work in particular in relation to small and start up businesses, the development of the services sector and increased community-based work for the long term unemployed and those in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It was noted that a number of key elements remained to be finally determined in the pay agreement in the public and private sectors. It was agreed that these and the other remaining issues <Col N="12" /> should be progressed quickly to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Government and the social partners indicated their satisfaction with the progress made in the new programme. The various social partner organisations indicated that they hoped that, following on the budget and the successful finalisation of the outstanding items, they would be in a position to recommend to their members and councils acceptance of the new programme. The Government confirmed that, in the light of this, the Minister for Finance would be in a position to introduce a budget which would complement and underpin the programme.</P>
    <P>I compliment the various parties for the commitment which they have shown in the time and effort devoted to the negotiations over the past three weeks.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that employment and the needs of the unemployed are central to these discussions. They are the primary concern of the Government in its participation in this process. Furthermore, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions represents some 30 centres for the unemployed throughout the country. The discussions have taken careful account of proposals for a new programme which were prepared by the National Economic and Social Forum on which groups representing the unemployed are directly represented. In addition, officials from my Department and other relevant Departments, on behalf of the Central Review Committee, met representatives of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors to discuss their views on a new programme, especially as they relate to the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that as far as unemployment is concerned the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was a complete failure in that unemployment went up by 40 per cent during the period of the outgoing <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="13" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was a total failure. The consensus on programmes since 1987 is that they have shown very direct results in the successful management of the economy. It is true that the problem of unemployment remains unsolved but we have made significant progress along that road, although it is not anything like what we would like to have achieved. Unemployment is the biggest single challenge to members of the European Union. I am glad that after a long time they have finally put it on top of the agenda and strategies being pursued by the member states, in conjunction with the signing of the GATT agreement and the NAFTA agreement, will help to raise world trade which will boost our economy. Jobs in the Irish economy depend very much on what happens in the world. When we get out of the recession we are undoubtedly very well placed and the projections in this year's budget are to have an extra 21,000 people at work at the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If unemployment has been put at the top of the Government's agenda, how is it that when the Government sits down to negotiate what it calls a programme for economic progress not a single unemployed person or a person exclusively representing unemployed people is there? Is this not an indication that the Government says one thing about unemployment and does the opposite?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not. I reject the suggestion that Members of the House or members of the Government do not represent the unemployed. The Congress of Trade Unions represents 30 centres for the unemployed. The Economic and Social Forum has received a wide range of views on unemployment and it too represents the unemployed. There is no shortage of input on behalf of the unemployed to the negotiations for a national programme.</P>

Is it still the intention which was expressed in the 1991 agreement that the Government will prepare a ten year-long term strategy for the economy? When, after three years, might we expect to see that strategy published?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the findings of independent research which shows that if we can improve wage costs by 1 per cent we can create 4,000 extra jobs; that we should have had a general pay freeze and that the Government should instead have concentrated on take-home pay and employment costs? Second, does the <Col N="15" /> Taoiseach agree, given that there are four organisations which focus on agriculture involved in this process, that it is not justifiable that the National Organisation of the Unemployed which focuses only on unemployment is not involved? While I accept that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is concerned with unemployment, its main concern is the interests of those at work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one will find that the farmer organisations and all the other organisations around the table have a deep interest in the unemployed. I accept what the Deputy said in relation to the findings of independent research; national plans are a matter for negotiation between the parties and have served this country well. In whatever agreement is reached which must be acceptable to all concerned we must take into consideration the contribution it can make to employment creation and maintenance. The objective of the budget was to complement and underpin such an agreement to improve take home pay without increasing wage costs. The tax reductions will complement this. The budget contains 21 separate measures to try to create jobs for the unemployed and expand the small business sector. There are 100,000 small business and in my view that sector has the capacity for job creation. Specific measures were taken to make it easier for people and to obtain a better return on their investment. There is a package of measures. There is no simple answer to the unemployment problem; it will require a combination of measures over a period of time to make an impact.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that he did not reply to two parts of my earlier question? First, what procedures will be put in place to provide for an ongoing review by this House of any agreement that is reached and, second, when may we expect the ten year strategy which was supposed to form the basis of the earlier <Col N="16" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and which has not yet been produced? May I also point out to the Taoiseach that it was indicated in the last agreement that in getting the so-called fundamentals of the economy right there would be a substantial increase in employment and a major assault on long term unemployment but neither of those objectives has been met despite the success, apparently, in getting the fundamentals right? Does the Taoiseach think that proceeding along the same lines in the next agreement will also fail?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is missing the point; the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> covers the first three years of a ten year strategy involving a national consensus to tackle various problems in the economy. While it is true that we would all like to see an improvement in employment creation we must not forget that there are more people at work now than for a long time. If the budget strategy is successful, and we all expect that it will be, even more people will be in employment.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Bruton about the representation of the unemployed in these discussions and, indeed, the 40 per cent increase in unemployment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, does the Taoiseach agree that while there were general expressions of concern, and many pious platitudes, about unemployment in the heel of the hunt when the unions are negotiating percentages <Col N="17" /> and push comes to shove their primary interest is their members and what they can achieve for them all of whom are working? From that point of view all of us should accept the point made by Deputy Bruton that the unemployed do not have a voice in the negotiations dealing directly and solely with their concerns?</P>

Neither would I accept that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Farmers Association, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme or ICOS have no interest in the unemployed. Members of these organisations have families and they are just as interested as the Deputies and I in this matter. Is a Member seriously suggesting that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has no interest in the unemployed? They are well and truly represented in the negotiations and everybody is trying to do the best job they can but Deputies should not forget, as they like to, that we have an increasing population and that it will not begin to level out before the end of this decade. We will then be in a position to create enough jobs in the economy to meet the increase in the labour force each year thereafter.</P>

      <P>The Abridged Estimates volume which was published on the 9 December 1993 reflects the 1994 pay costs of public services as on that date. The volume provides for</P>
      <P>&mdash;the carryover cost of restoring the 3.75 per cent general increase under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was paid with effect from 1 December 1993 and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the outstanding cost of restoring losses incurred by public servants due to the capping of the second and third general round increase under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Pay Agreement.</P>
      <P>Apart from the education and health elements of the arrears, the abridged volume did not take account of the adjustments required in respect of bringing forward <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay arrears from 1994 to 1993. This was due to administrative difficulties in getting all of the information in time for publication. The full adjustment will be shown in the Revised Estimates Volume for 1994. I am pleased that all Government commitments to pay increases to public servants which had to be deferred for budgetary reasons have now been honoured in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my budget speech last <Col N="22" /> week, the 1994 provision for Exchequer pay and pensions is now £4,278 million. This sum includes the effects on the pay bill of decisions affecting programme spending included in the budget. The necessary pay adjustments arising since publication of the abridged Estimates will be reflected in the Revised Estimates volume.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on a new national programme to follow the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are still in progress. It has not been possible, therefore, to make exact provision for any pay increases which may be negotiated thereunder for public servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister some very specific questions because as we speak negotiations are under way on the public sector pay deal. Last year the Minister said that the 3 per cent local pay bargaining clause would only be implemented in a payroll neutral situation, yet we hear this morning that baggage from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is being brought forward. What is the up-to-date position in regard to the local pay bargaining clause? Is the Minister paying it, and what is the cost? Second, I tabled a question last week about special pay claims and the Minister said that there were 27 special pay claims listed to go before the arbitrator. What is the cost, over and above any annual increase, of the local pay bargaining clause and these special pay claims, if they are to be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in regard to the local bargaining pay issue. That was 3 per cent of pay on an Exchequer neutral basis, on the basis of productivity negotiations within the public sector. A number of these claims were processed to some stage during the course of the third year, 1993. Some of these are Labour Court awards. Others have been partially paid, for instance, the dental technicians and the ambulance drivers. A number of others have claims outstanding and, within the talks, these are being discussed. The Government is <Col N="23" /> anxious that all these items should be paid.</P>
      <P>None of the special claims has been processed so what the arbitrator would give is an unknown quantity. The Government cannot see how it can pay the private sector pay deal to the public sector, take over disputed amounts or unresolved issues from 1993 and, on top of that, pay additional amounts. There is some case for some of the issues outstanding because they may involve Labour Court findings, but to carry over all items which are at various stages of negotiation would be extremely difficult. It is for that reason that the discussions are very difficult. I do not want to say too much about them because they are at a fairly critical stage and have been since the private sector deal was completed. The difficulties of resolving this matter should not be underestimated.</P>

      <P>The reports this morning are that the Minister is about to concede a four-year deal worth 12.5 per cent, leaving aside all the specials that now seem to be back at the starting gate. How can the Minister justify giving public sector workers a greater increase than private sector workers when over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> inflation has been 18 per cent and the public sector pay bill has gone up by 50 per cent?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the growth in second-hand car imports by 72 per cent in 1993 over 1992; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Government is not receiving VAT receipts on these purchases which are made abroad; and the steps, if any, he intends to take to rectify the situation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a substantial increase over the last year in the number of second-hand cars being imported into the State.</P>
      <P>The charging of VAT on trade between member states is governed throughout the European Union by harmonised rules introduced as part of the process of the completion of the Internal Market and the abolition of fiscal frontiers on 1 January 1993. The rules which apply in Ireland must be consistent with this framework.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Internal Market rules, VAT is not paid in the State on second-hand cars purchased in other member states by private individuals. In such cases, VAT is charged in the member state where the purchase takes place, but only if the purchase is from a motor trader. In the case of second-hand cars acquired by Irish dealers in other member states and resold here, the dealers are liable to Irish VAT at the standard rate on the full selling price. However, the traders are allowed a deduction, that is, a notional input credit, in respect of the relevant VAT of the other member state. In effect, the Irish dealer pays Irish VAT at the standard rate on his profit margin from the transaction and at the difference between the Irish standard rate and the standard rate of the other member state on the VATexclusive price paid for the car in the other member state. In addition, I should mention that VAT is payable in the State in respect of all cars imported from outside the European Union. Of course, all such cars are subject to vehicle registration tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out too in this context that, as a result of my recent budget initiative, the VRT rates on motor cars were reduced from 31.8 per cent to 29.25 on cars over 2012 cc and from 25.75 per cent to 23.2 per cent on all other cars, with effect from midnight on budget night. This should enable a reduction of <Col N="25" /> 3.3 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, in the retail price of a new car and will be of considerable assistance to the motor industry. The industry will also benefit from the substantial increase from £10,000 to £13,000 in the ceiling on capital allowances for new cars and the arrangements in that area planned for future years announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, reflecting both the favourable interest rate climate and the positive impact of my budget measures, new car sales will expand in 1994. Already there are signs that sales are performing strongly this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that over 30,000 second-hand cars were imported last year? What is happening is that in clubs and pubs right across this country people are being offered cheap cars by people going to Northern Ireland, buying them there, paying the VAT there, bringing them here and just having to pay the VRT to get the Irish number plates. If one buys a new car here the Exchequer gets the VRT and the VAT but in this context we are losing the VAT. Would the Minister not agree, therefore, that his proposals for adjustment of VRT were too modest and will not give the type of stimulus that is needed for the extra sale of new cars here as opposed to being a dumping ground for second-hand scrap cars, particularly from Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The January figure for car sales in excess of 13,000 compared with 9,000 in the same period last year. The Deputy's figures are correct in that approximately 33,000 cars were imported last year as &ldquo;used imports&rdquo;. It is estimated that new car sales in Europe decreased by at least two million in 1993 compared with 1992. Cars are being moved from one member state to another much more freely since the fiscal frontiers were removed. A large proportion of cars imported to Ireland are five and six years old, with quite a low value. Such imports are not displacing new car sales because we are talking about cars valued in the region of £3,000 to £4,000 rather than <Col N="26" /> bigger and more expensive ones. Nevertheless, I suspect that big cars, approximately two years old, are also being imported but that fact is not highlighted.</P>
      <P>The information I received from the Revenue Commissioners is that the position is not as described by the Deputy, that all cars brought in here for sale attract the vehicle registration tax normally paid by the unregistered dealers and private individuals within one working day of the arrival of the car here. If a person is bringing in a significant number of cars, his or her activities would be quickly noticed by Revenue. The VAT rate here is 21 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent in the UK; we have some yield from the VAT position. Car dealers who import second-hand cars from other EU states for resale here are liable for VAT. For example, if an Irish dealer acquires a second-hand car from a UK or a Northern Ireland dealer, for a private individual the Irish dealer or individual is entitled to recover 17.5 per cent of the cost by taking the notional import credit through the VAT return. He would be liable to Irish VAT on the full selling price of the car. In effect, that person pays Irish VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent on his profit margin from the transaction and at 3.5 per cent &mdash; the difference between the Irish and UK VAT rates &mdash; on the VAT exclusive price. We can do nothing about the question of full payment in a free market but a partial VAT rate applies. Many other matters arise in that regard, dut I do not believe it is necessary to go into those details now.</P>

      <P>Was it not the case that in the spirit of Maastricht we would move towards harmonisation of car prices? I understand we are the only country in Europe which imposes a vehicle registration tax, in other countries only VAT is paid. The total tax value here is more than 60 per cent compared with 17 per cent in the UK. Will the Minister progressively move towards abolishing the vehicle registration tax so that motorists here can avail of a price comparable to that enjoyed by other European consumers?</P>

We did not break the spirit of the European fiscal frontier regulations or get a special derogation in that regard. We are in order in introducing vehicle registration tax within European rules. The same is done in many other countries for various products. From the point of view of the State, the income from the vehicle and motoring taxation is in excess of £1 billion.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy in relation to the future ownership and development of the ACC, ICC and Trustee Savings Bank arising out of a recent Government working party report; and if it is still intended to honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-1997, to establish a third banking force.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in Government policy to create a third force in banking. The objective of this policy is to increase competition in the banking sector while protecting &mdash; and enhancing to the extent possible &mdash; the developmental role which the State <Col N="28" /> banks can play in fostering industry, especially small and medium sized industry. Proposals to give effect to this policy have not yet come before Government. The Government will consider the matter when I am in a position to present firm proposals. No Government working party, or official working party of any kind, has to date been established in connection with Government policy in relation to the State banks. No working party report has, accordingly, been prepared.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to a related question on 12 October last that I and my Department have been engaged in extensive consultations with relevant parties and in a comprehensive survey of the options available to give effect to the programme commitment to the creation of a third force in banking. Considerable progress has been made in clarifying and teasing out the steps that will have to be taken in order to achieve the desired objective. This preparatory work is continuing.</P>
      <P>The issues involved in this question are many and complex. Any decision has implications, not just for the institutions immediately involved but also for the wider financial system. I am, therefore, determined to take the necessary time to fully explore all the options and only when I have done that will I be in a position to put firm proposals to Government.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the cloud that hangs over the management of those three banks because they do not know where their future lies? A commitment was given in the Programme for Government that they would be merged, yet the Minister did not make us any wiser when that matter was referred to in the Dáil. Having met the management of all three banks, is the Minister aware that they have one common requirement, namely, an equity injection for expansion? If the taxpayer will not invest equity, how will a merger solve the problem of three banks that are under-capitalised? Perhaps the Minister will tell us what Government policy is in that <Col N="29" /> regard because the policy set out in the Programme for Government does not meet the major problem of the three banks in question?</P>

      <P>As I stated previously, there are only two or three short paragraphs in the Programme for Government which deal with this matter. Since then the issue has been teased out in formal departmental and informal contacts with the institutions concerned. Deputy Yates is right in that they hold different views. They would all have some difficulty with liquidity problems and ratios if they were merely to amalgamate. Deputy Yates will recall that an important aspect of the Programme for Government was the possibility of involvement with a major international bank which would be examined in accordance with the bank's needs. As the Deputy will be aware, there is no shortage of financial institutions who would be glad to be involved in this arrangement. That equation must be considered as it would be desirable to get involved with a new structure. Otherwise we will not resolve the difficulty the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>A sum of up to £70 million was provided in the budget White Paper for privatisation receipts. Will the Minister clarify whether the sale of the ACC or any of the banks is pencilled in as part of that provision or are we talking merely about Irish Life? Will he give a time-scale in which the Government might reach conclusions in regard to the third banking force or if it will drop the idea which, as the Minister is aware, was daft in the first place?</P>

These would relate firstly to increasing costs, and secondly, to our obligations, particularly in relation to EU-funded projects, to award contracts in accordance with the EU provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Gregory's concern in this regard. This problem does not only relate to Dublin. This issue arose in the famous Kilrush marine case some years ago and similar arguments have been put forward in a number of urban areas around the country. <Col N="31" /> I had deputations from people in Limerick and Cork about this issue before Christmas. I have considered the matter extensively, including some of the projects to which Deputy Gregory referred. The largest project was the Financial Services Centre in which Deputy Gregory was involved. That project generated high aspirations of employment which to some extent were fulfilled, but it did not provide employment for all those who were hopeful of gaining it. From discussions I had with various authorities there seems to be scope for aggressively promoting the use of local labour contracts by relying on voluntary elements. From legal and administrative advice I received, I understand that it is not contrary to the spirit of the European Union to include local labour clauses in contracts. At one time the position was that one could not include provisions in contracts because it would be counter to the EU's internal obligations, but now there seems to be room for manoeuvre in that regard provided such provision does not incur additional costs, but I understand the position cannot be altered on a statutory basis. It seems it would be possible to aggressively promote the use of local labour clauses by relying on the voluntary element and I will do what I can to promote that matter.</P>

      <P>I was consulted on the terms of the out of court settlement of the claim brought by Allied Irish Banks and ICAROM against the former auditors of ICI, Ernst and Whinney. Following consultation with the Attorney General I raised no objection to the terms of the settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the settlement, representatives of my Department, together with those of the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, had discussions with the ICAROM administrator on the extent to which the settlement payment, together with funds made available under the 1992 agreement, that is Allied Irish Banks' annual payments of £8.8 million for 20 years and the £32 million interest free loan advanced by the Exchequer, will cover all the outstanding liabilities of ICAROM. The liabilities include the repayment of the £100 million loan advanced under the <Col N="33" /> 1985 agreement which falls to be repaid in the year 2000. Following these discussions, I am satisfied that the payments under the settlement combined with those under the 1992 agreement, should have the effect of meeting all of the outstanding liabilities foreseen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Allied Irish Banks receiving money does not arise, it already had to write off a loss of £86 million. I note Deputy Gilmore's question relates to the 1992 agreement but to see the full picture one must consider the provisions of the 1985 agreement under which Allied Irish Banks contributes £5.5 million annually towards servicing the loan of £100 million. That loan is due to be paid in the year 2000. Under the 1992 agreement Allied Irish Banks will contribute £8.8 million per annum for the next 20 years, up to the year 2012, towards the cost of administration. To date Allied Irish Banks has written off £86 million and under the 1985 agreement it will pay £5.5 million per annum up to the year 2000. Under the 1992 agreement it will pay £8.8 million per annum up to the year 2012, in the year 2000 the State will recover the £100 million it received under the 1985 agreement from the reserves of the Central Bank and gave to the administrator at that time. Under the 1992 agreement the State contributed a further £32 million which it will also receive back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the State will get back its contribution of £100 million in any event in the year 2000 under the 1985 agreement and its contribution of £32 million on the due date under the <Col N="34" /> 1992 agreement. Do I understand from the Minister's reply that because £77 million was obtained in an out of court settlement from the accountancy firm that figure will have no net effect on what the State will get back? ICAROM has ended up with an extra £77 million as a result of that settlement and it will not improve the return to the State. Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My notes do not indicate that £77 million is the exact figure. I recall the figure was $110 million but I will verify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that figure arrived at during the Minister's devaluation audits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was calculated after that time. The latest examination of the liabilities of ICAROM confirms that even with the payment of the settlement moneys, estimated at £38 million, the repayment of the interest free loan of £32 million under the 1992 agreement would still be necessary to make adequate provision for the repayment of the £100 million interest free loan. If that money from the settlement did not come forward there would have been a shortfall in repayments to the State. As the Deputy knows, since the commencement of this saga in 1985 it would be a brave person who would assess the administrator's final figure, but as of now the administrator's costs are in the order of £260 million-£270 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, AIB will not pick up all the money. A £32 million loan was given to ICAROM and if no settlement had been reached a difficulty with the <Col N="35" /> figures would arise in the year 2000. However, the difficulty has been averted and the £100 million loan will be paid back to the State. The only loss to the State as a result of the deal is interest foregone on the original 1985 loan and the 1992 loan. The State will get back its money, but it if had had that money to reinvest it would have made some return on it. AIB is losing substantially on the figures I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful at the outset to clarify the respective roles of the Minister for Finance and of the other Ministers in regard to the disbursement of national lottery funds. Under section 5 of the 1986 Act, the Government decides the amount and purposes for which national lottery allocations shall be made. Such allocations are mainly decided by the Government in the context of settling the Estimates for the supply services.</P>
      <P>Since lottery-funded spending is appropriated by the Dáil directly to the Votes of the spending Departments, it is reasonable that the Minister responsible for the particular Department should be answerable to the Dáil for any queries arising from such expenditure. When the relevant appropriation account is being examined by the Committte of Public Accounts, the accounting officer for that spending Department is accountable in regard to the regularity and correctness of any such expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All expenditure must, of course, have the sanction of my Department. In the case of lottery-funded schemes &mdash; and, <Col N="36" /> indeed, for most of the day-to-day Exchequer expenditure &mdash; Departments operate under delegated Finance sanctions which allow the line Department to spend within clearly defined parameters without further recourse to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, when a delegated sanction has been issued by my Department to cover lottery-funded expenditure, it is the responsibility of the Department concerned to ensure that any expenditure falling within the category is properly covered by the sanction. The accounting officer for each Vote is responsible for the correctness for all payments under his control. I am satisfied as to the adequacy of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) with the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General recently investigated allegations that some groups had received lottery grants from the Department of Health without having made formal applications. This investigation indicated that while the correct procedures had not been followed in the particular cases, there was no impropriety involved. Revised arrangements have been made with a view to preventing a recurrence. When the Public Accounts Committee reports on the matter, I will review the procedures in relation to lottery-funded expenditures in the light of any recommendations made by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the reported allegations investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General represent an abuse of national lottery funds? It is a matter of great public concern that national lottery funds are being used by some Government Ministers as a kind of State-sponsored election fund. Will the Minister agree that the time has come to introduce a degree of transparency and clearly understood regulations, governing the administration of national lottery funds, so that the public can clearly see where their money is going, how it is spent and who benefits from it, financially, electorally and politically?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of how the money is spent appears in the Book of Estimates every year and I have outlined how the procedure operates. Ministers are answerable for money spent by their Departments and there is no difficulty whatsoever with that. The Committee of Public Accounts is examining the matter with a view to tightening up the procedures as it was found in the investigations that they were not followed. It is the function of my Department to prescribe general rules by way of broad guidelines or specific instructions as to how the allocations, decided by the Government, are to be made. It is then the job of the individual spending Departments to develop adequate procedures of accounting for grant purposes and to ensure that there is no misuse of money. If the Committee of Public Accounts reports further on this matter, I will review the position. My Department has received outline views from Deputy Jim Mitchell, chairman of that committee, who is working with the accounting officer of my Department to see how the procedures can be tightened up. It is a matter of tightening up procedures rather than transparency in the system, which already exists.</P>

      <P>We have been endeavouring, in the health and social welfare areas, to ensure that, wherever possible, the money goes to the head office of voluntary and local bodies. If it goes to the central administration, conflicts as to what section receives the money are avoided. Therefore, the best way to proceed is to ensure that wherever possible the money is given to central administration of these bodies.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the original intention of the national lottery was to assist sport and recreation, arts and culture and to replace the moneys lost by voluntary organistions as a result of the national lottery? In reply to the question, he ignored the fact that his Department is the sponsoring Department in terms of policy and of the legislation concerned. Would he agree that this money is being used as if it were revenue from taxation as opposed to voluntary contributions made by the public? Would he further agree that the purpose for which the national lottery was originally set up &mdash; that is, to help small clubs and sporting organisations, particularly those in underprivileged areas &mdash; has <Col N="39" /> been totally ignored and that moneys are being expended on projects for which lottery funding was never intended? Will the Minister kindly arrange, through his Department, to change the present policy so that small clubs and organisations are assisted in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of changes have been made to the policy decided by the Government in 1988. For example, in 1990 the Government decided to direct the money more towards the areas of health and education. I think the present breakdown of the funding &mdash; I do not have the figures with me &mdash; is approximately one-third for education, one-third for health and one-third for sport and the arts. This decision was not made solely by the Government, the people who play the national lottery games were consulted and they wished to see the money being directed towards the health area. This decision was made some years ago and I do not believe it would be possible to direct all the money towards the areas of sport and the arts.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that national lottery funding should not be used to replace Exchequer money. That is why it was separated from the system in 1990. Every departmental subhead clearly shows what the money has been used for, and people can easily check this and make comparisons with earlier years. As the Deputy knows well, that is precisely what the various charitable, sporting and cultural organisations do. These organisations have managed to increase their take over the past few years as a result of this. On the other side of the coin, it should be remembered that for every pound taken in by the national lottery, £10 is sought in funding. The demands are excessive in terms of the funding available.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that since the first disbursement of national lottery funding in 1987 there has been a continuous barrage of allegations of improper procedures and, indeed, at times chicanery? The changes made in <Col N="40" /> 1990, which were supposed to lead to greater involvement by local authorities, were completely unworkable and meant nothing. In view of the recent allegations &mdash; the most serious of which has been made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is under investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; does the Minister agree that it is high time to put in place proper procedures which will ensure transparency and, above all, that the disbursement of national lottery funds is not left solely at the discretion of the Minister who has control over it? Is it not the case that at the end of the day the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Health and, perhaps, the Minister for Finance decide which projects will receive funding from the national lottery? That is the level of transparency which surrounds this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply, that is not what happens. From 1987, when the national lottery was launched, until 1989 the funds were issued from a subhead in the Department of Finance Vote &mdash; the subhead dealing with the distribution of national lottery grant-in-aid to suspense accounts operated by the relevant spending Departments. From 1990 onwards the lottery funds were issued through the appropriate subheads in the Votes of the relevant spending Departments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the Committee of Public Accounts is working on recommendations on how to improve the system, the means of assessment and the means of financial control, and I will take its views on board and make the necessary changes.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister is not implying that because of the total success of the national lottery other charitable organisations which run lotteries have done well since 1987. The fact is that these organisations have been almost wiped off the board. It is the responsibility of the Minister and his colleagues in Government to ensure that such charities, which have a tradition of <Col N="41" /> providing a great service to the handicapped across a wide spectrum, are not wiped out by the national lottery. They do not seem to be able to get the level of funding they had hoped to get from the national lottery. Given the many aspects of the matter raised today, it is little wonder that these organisations cannot get this funding, which appears to be directed towards projects for which it was never intended. I should like the Minister to comment on this point. He knows that the Rehabilitation Institute and many other organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am glad to hear that the Minister has an open mind on any procedures which might be recommended and implemented. Will he outline specifically what he did, through his Department, in respect of his responsibility for these matters, without prejudice to what may be recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts, which does not absolve him from inquiring into the matter?

      <P>With regard to the question of transparency, would the Minister agree that if someone wants to find out where lottery money is being allocated, ultimately they are required to go through the annual reports of the National Lottery Company, departmental Estimates, replies to Dáil questions, reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and reports of the Committee of Public Accounts and that that is hardly transparent; nothing could be more opaque? Has the Minister the information on which he could publish a report which would correlate all of that information and indicate in a comprehensive way where national lottery money has been allocated since the national lottery was founded, how much of it has gone into the Exchequer, how much of it has been allocated to community groups and charities and who have been the beneficiaries of this money so that in one report the public can have all the information regarding national lottery disbursals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly raise that issue with the National Lottery Company; it is not an unreasonable request. I would make the point that one is not required to go through all of the departmental Estimates or reports of departmental agencies to obtain such information. The national lottery funding for each year is printed in one section at the back of the Book of Estimates, a measure which was implemented by me two or three years ago in order to combine all the information. I realise it does not give the details of, for example, what is under subhead 1.A but it indicates what money is allocated through the Exchequer to the various Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 19, 43 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Under the special statutory confidentiality arrangements which apply in relation to the 15 per cent amnesty the Chief Special Collector may only supply certain information to me and this only in the form of aggregates of the total amount of the declared amounts, the total amount of the settlement amounts, the total amount of value-added tax remitted to the Chief Special Collector and the total numbers of individuals who remitted amounts to the Chief Special Collector. This information will relate to the position as at the deferred declaration &mdash; filing date of 21 December 1993.</P>
      <P>The large volume of payments received under both amnesties is still being processed and will take some time to record and analyse. I will be happy to provide the information allowed by the legislation as soon as it is available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, however, inform the House that the total amount of tax paid under the two amnesties is currently estimated at £240 million, of which £9 million was paid in 1993. The amount remitted under the 15 per cent incentive amnesty is estimated <Col N="46" /> to be of the order of £190 million in respect of declared amounts of income and gains. Declared amounts are income or chargeable gains for the period up to 5 April 1991, in respect of which any tax due had not been paid. The actual tax due in respect of these amounts would depend on each individual's particular circumstances and the rates of tax in force at the time. An exercise to establish the amount of the pre-amnesty tax liability in each case would not be possible because of the confidentiality arrangements which are the cornerstone of the incentive amnesty.</P>
    <P>The balance of the amnesty payments &mdash; some £50 million &mdash; related to the general amnesty. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not feasible to provide information on the amount of interest and penalties which will be waived under the provisions of this amnesty. These figures represent the best estimates at this juncture.</P>
    <P>No target figures had been set for the amnesty. It will be clear from the significant figures which I have given for the estimated receipts that the outcome of the amnesty scheme has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Until all of the certificates have been completed and analysed I will not have the full information in that regard. Quite frankly, I believe it will take several weeks yet before this work is completed because I received a joint request from the accountancy bodies for additional time to send in their returns and there has been a time extension in respect of some of the 1991-92 returns. The Revenue Commissioners received most of the declarations and the payments on the last day of the scheme so there will be a delay in collating the information the Deputy seeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In the lengthy debates we had here concerning the tax amnesty, one of the arguments put forward by the Minister was that it would widen the tax base and bring in income that was not know about previously. What is the Revenue Commissioners estimate now of what the widening of the tax base will yield? Also, will the Minister arrange to let the House have a breakdown of the payments that were made in regard to disclosed and undisclosed taxes because that is the relevant point? That information would give us an indication of where the tax base has widened and also of what tax has been discounted? In other words, people who are paying 40 per cent capital gains tax or 50 per cent income tax could now rewrite their tax bill for unpaid arrears at 15 per cent. We need to be able to calculate how much has been lost to the Exchequer as a result of this amnesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in Deputy Yates talking about what we have lost. Most people were surprised by the extent of the yields from the incentive amnesty scheme. In regard to the point about the 1992 returns, the accountants are now working on bringing the figures up to date and that should prove a very useful excercise in terms of extending the tax base. Deputy Yates will also be interested to know that the number of payers under the incentive amnesty scheme is estimated at this stage &mdash; this is not a final count &mdash; to be approximately 35,000 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that the total amount paid under the 15 per cent special amnesty was £190 million. If my mathematics are correct that means that the crock of gold of income on which tax was not paid amounts to £1.3 billion which could represent, assuming that these people would be due to pay tax at higher rates, an annual loss to the Exchequer of somewhere in the region of £600 million. Could I ask the Minister how many tax payers or, more accurately, non tax payers, did that £190 million <Col N="48" /> come from? The Minister gave a figure of 35,000.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know most of that money would not have been collected in the ordinary course of events. The fact is that the people who used the incentive amnesty scheme did not avail of the amnesty scheme in 1988. They were outside the system, had not been detected but by and large have now brought their affairs up to date. They have adhered to the conditions of the incentive amnesty scheme and can be expected from now on to keep their accounts up to date as happened in the case of the previous amnesty scheme four or five years ago. It is worth noting that one of the successful aspects of the tax system here over the past five years is that when people came into the system, they stayed in. That is why the tax base has widened, is why the figures for corporation tax and other tax have increased and why we have a far better system now. While we might have wished that more overseas money had come back into the system, quite an amount of it did, particularly during the extension period. Probably the best thing we did was to agree on that extension.</P>

      <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, I have heard that answer given at least 20 times over the past ten years. Will we ever overcome this concept of surveying? Does the world not know that public buildings are totally ill equipped for all visually impaired and disabled people? Is it not true to say that no premises were as poorly fitted out as the very one we here occupy, that it took the election of a disabled Member to the Seanad before anything was done? Can the Minister of State not imagine the frustration and anger, particularly of the visually impaired, that there is really nobody thinking about them, that if there <Col N="51" /> is a price cut-off on a new building the first thing that happens is that that portion of the project is dropped?

This is the first time Deputy Connaughton has tabled this question to me. While it may have been answered 20 times over the past ten years in a similar fashion, it is the first time I have replied. Without any prompting by any Member of the House, I requested the Office of Public Works to undertake that survey. I know that the Deputy speaks from genuine concern in this matter. I can assure him that it is not a matter of lip service and that the surveys will be completed. In every place possible, within the remit of the Office of Public Works and within Government buildings, I will endeavour to ensure that the disabled and visually impaired are adequately catered for.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has satisfied himself with the equity of the present stamp duty tax in view of the fact that it creates discrimination between the purchase of new and second-hand houses and that rates do not apply to successive tranches of the value of the house resulting in abrupt jumps in the tax burden within very narrow ranges of house prices.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The yield from stamp duty makes a very significant contribution to overall tax revenue. Concessions in this area can be entertained only where there are likely to be considerable social and economic benefits involved. The stamp duty relief for new houses provides a valuable boost to building activity, thereby helping to maintain and increase employment in the construction industry. The relief also has the effect of reducing the real price of housing generally. I should add that, because second-hand houses are normally sold by individuals in their private capacity, they are generally not subject to VAT, whereas new houses sold by builders in the course of their trade are subject to VAT.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the stamp duty relief for new houses helps to further important social and economic objectives and that, in the overall context, the tax code does not unduly discriminate against second-hand houses. Applying the rates of stamp duty on a successive tranche basis would not be appropriate in the present circumstances. Such a measure would cost in the region of £20 million a year, with little or no impact on job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that the structure of this tax is totally iniquitous in that there is no grading of the tax according to ability to pay? Can he explain how he reaches the conclusion that any tax, such as stamp duty, reduces the price of houses? That certainly bewilders me. Would he not agree that, on a standard house above the residential property tax threshold, the stamp duty bill, on its purchase, would amount to approximately £5,000? This means that people endeavouring to buy a second-hand house in settled areas where facilities exist &mdash; where the State <Col N="53" /> does not have to provide them &mdash; are being asked to pay an additional £5,000 as well as being ineligible for the £3,000 new house grant. Would he not agree that this constitutes a foolish approach to taxation policy? Furthermore would he not agree that it places an extra burden on people burdened already by his residential property tax and the curtailment of mortgage interest relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance it is a matter of raising revenue. The stamp duty on transfer of houses yields approximately £55 million annually. The House will recall that I implemented a number of amendments in this area last year in that new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres were exempt from stamp duty. I made a number of changes to help the construction industry. The stamp duty charge is now based on the site value. Only 25 per cent of the site value is taken into account. This has been of substantial benefit in the case of that type of house. The reason I took that initiative was that, in the case of a number of new estates, houses were less than 125 square metres and when the purchasers had avoided paying stamp duty they then converted the garage. The present bands of stamp duty range from zero to 6 per cent for properties in excess of £50,000. The House will realise that to reduce any of those bands substantially would be extremely costly. I made one substantial amendment in the case of the new house market last year. It would be extremely costly to being to make amendments in respect of the second-hand house market. I might mention value-added tax. Last year we had to increase the new house grant by £1,000 to accommodate the 2.5 per cent VAT increase which just about covered that cost. There is no VAT on the sale of second-hand houses and this is a concession <i>vis-à-vis</i> new houses. A substantial cost is involved in making concessions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to resume my contribution to the debate. It is some time now since the opening speech by the Minister for Finance and people have had time to reflect on the measures and to develop objective views on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer to employment measures which will continue to be taken in the <Col N="158" /> Department in order to benefit employment. Because unemployment is so serious it demands intense Government attention and innovation linked to freedom of market forces. This budget provides such a mix. The Minister for Finance responded positively with a range of measures which had been sought particularly by small businesses who saw the need to relax some areas so that they could pursue their businesses in an unfettered way and consolidate and expand employment.</P>
    <P>A programme for jobs is the clear strategy in the current talks between the Government and the social partners. The policies and programmes outlined in the budget have given a boost to those talks. The budget contains measures which free up business and clear many irksome taxation and bureaucratic burdens from small businesses. When I travelled the country last year I was constantly reminded of the need to have simplified forms in clear language, particularly to address revenue regulations. This is a simple measure which will greatly benefit business.</P>
    <P>I have had many inquiries with regard to soft loans. I hope the arrangements to provide such loans can be quickly implemented. These measures help to free up business and I hope employers and employees will build on the new realism emerging in the workplace.</P>
    <P>There should be greater openness, honest dialogue and sharing of information between the social partners at individual plant level. There is no place in the modern work environment for a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; mentality. This type of local social partnership means that each group associated with it carries rights and responsibilities which will have to be openly addressed and we must work together at business level. I am convinced that this kind of genuine work partnership can lead to greater motivation, productivity and responsibility. There are already excellent experiences in this country to show that this type of realism can have results in job retention and creation. At the moment there is much dialogue between the social partners as <Col N="159" /> to how they will eventually work out new arrangements for another <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There is need for openness and honesty of dialogue between employers and employees in that context. Such dialogue can only be regarded as progressive for both sides.</P>
    <P>If workers are interested in their jobs, are motivated and committed to the essential mission statement of the firm, that commitment is enhanced by the more information they have. Throughout the country where such measures have been used they have proved to be of enormous benefit. This leads to workers having a psychological stake in the business in which they are involved and they are no longer seen as cogs in a wheel but rather important components in an important process. I cannot stress strongly enough that this type of involvement carries rights and responsibilities for both sides. I urge the social partners involved in dialogue at plant and national level to address openly the duties and responsibilities involved in that process.</P>
    <P>The ICTU in their programme for dialogue clearly outlined how they wished to see it develop and how they want to be involved in changes and technology, in work practices and in developing openness in firms. Without dialogue hurried decisions about which workers have no knowledge will continue to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The House might feel that I am talking about the pending EC directive, but I am interpreting it in a local way. Genuine work partnership can lead to greater motivation, productivity and responsibility. I have seen the beneficial effect of such interaction.</P>
    <P>I am considering a measure to update the 1977 Worker Protection Act. An EU directive of 1992 to be implemented this year lays down general guidelines in this direction. I want to use the review in conjunction with the social partners to bring about a climate of job retention rather than job reduction. In the context of that review there are changes under the directive to the Worker Participation Act. Lest some Members of the House <Col N="160" /> should say that we are imposing bureaucratic burdens on business, as was said two weeks ago on the Committee Stage of a simple information Bill about workers' wages and conditions of employment, this is not an irksome burden. It is a measure which has already been implemented in the UK.</P>
    <P>I am always amazed that despite their trumpeting about opting out of the social charter legislation, and the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major's, constant reiteration that people should come to the UK because jobs are so much cheaper and better and so on, I find when I am in Europe on social affairs business, that the UK have already implemented a directive towards which we are working. In many cases they had made it more embracing than envisaged by the terms of the directive. Somehow or other they seem to be able to bring about a <i>volte face</i> when required and to say they do not have any such legislation relating to the social chapter. People seem to be swallowing this, but I avail of every opportunity to point out that they have implemented social legislation ahead of many other countries which have a fine record in this area. It is odd then that they stand up in the House of Commons and declare that they are anti-regulations and are going to make bonfires of directives while on the other hand they are busy implementing them.</P>
    <P>I am considering a measure to update the 1977 Worker Protection Act. An EU directive of 1992 lays down general guidelines. In consultations with the social partners one must have regard, for reasons outlined in the directive, to measures other than redundancies such as retraining, redeployment and retention, albeit in other capacities. When this measure is brought before the House Members will have an opportunity to amend it.</P>
    <P>It should be said that the route to redundancy is often too easily taken. It seems firms have recourse to this first when they find themselves in trouble. This has bred a culture where we are no longer shocked when major redundancies are announced. Perhaps we are <Col N="161" /> shocked for a while but not for long. I intend to link the review of the worker protection legislation into the operation of the competitiveness and employment protection unit which has been established in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy John Bruton bemoaned the fact that this EU directive and measures contained in the Programme for Government concerning the competitiveness and employment protection unit had not been fully implemented. I hope when I introduce these measures in the House that he, along with his party spokesperson in this area, will show interest and enthusiasm and accept them.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness and employment protection unit was established some months ago in the Department. It has had reasonable, albeit modest success. Various firms have put forward ideas and have sought expert advice. I am particularly pleased that this unit is in operation because this was one of the ideas I put forward from my office in the dialogue between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party which led to the establishment of a partnership Government. I had thought about this matter during the year I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing.</P>
    <P>This unit is not presented by the Department of Enterprise and Employment as a saviour of lame ducks. People want to put us into a corner and say that this is the case. The unit will, however, anticipate business difficulties, helping viable firms to change and modernise in order to convert these difficulties into challenges and opportunities. The personnel in this unit working with the State agencies will then be able to pursue a robust pro-active policy, not passively waiting for the news of redundancies to be announced but identifying in advance firm by firm, sector by sector, where there are likely to be potential business hazards. I always had difficulty in accepting the IDA's early warning system which patently did not work. One received a notice each week when redundancies <Col N="162" /> were notified. In effect, late warnings were given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the unit will identify in advance firm by firm, sector by sector, where there are likely to be potential business hazards. These discerned difficulties can then be addressed in a professional, structured way in order to retain jobs and obviate redundancies.</P>
      <P>Quite rightly, we trumpet loudly when a tranche of new jobs is announced, yet we often seem to accept in a blithe way daily announcements of redundancies. I am strongly convinced that retention, consolidation and maintenance of existing jobs can lead to growth and that this strategy is an important component of our employment policy.</P>
      <P>I now want to address other areas of policy with which the Department and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, are dealing. I would first like to address the service sector. From time to time all parties in this House have mentioned that there is a need to look at this sector and, so far as possible, to allow it to avail of the benefits already available to manufacturing industry. To this end some time ago the Taoiseach set up a group comprised of people with an interest in this area which has published a fine report which is being considered in the Department. Some of the issues arising from this report have been addressed in the budget.</P>
      <P>In the past we relied on manufacturing industry whereas more and more there is growth in the service sector. As people's lifestyles and work practices change there will be a greater dependence on service industries. This report compiled by various experts will be an important factor in the jobs arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the question of linkages. Now that the legislation has been passed we know what the various divisions of the IDA will be doing. Criticism was expressed in the House and in the Seanad where Members argued that this would be another layer of <Col N="163" /> bureaucracy. Clearly, the need to create employment will be addressed. Already Forbairt, which deals with home business, and IDA-Ireland have recognised that there is a need for a linkages policy. IDA-Ireland will continue to attract multinationals. We often do not realise how many people depend on multinationals for employment. Once multinationals are established there is a need to ensure that sub-supply services are provided locally or by domestic firms. This is being addressed by Forbairt with IDA-Ireland and will bear much fruit.</P>
    <P>One might ask if such intervention is a good thing. However, where there are up to 300,000 unemployed it would be quite wrong to adopt a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude because, clearly, that will not work. The linkage to which I refer has been needed for a long time. The EU rules preclude us from baying too loudly about buying Irish but when I meet other Ministers at meetings in Europe I realise we are far too decorous and demure in our policy. They pin various names on their strategies. I cannot remember the UK one but it is quite an attractive coinage of words; yet when one breaks it down it means that the Department of Trade and Industry loudly proclaims its belief in British industry, the need for firms in Britain to rely on other firms within Britain and that its consumers should, so to speak, look to their own &mdash; I will leave that to my colleague beside me who may speak about it later.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the cluster policy. A very fine report has come out from the IMI which I have not yet had an opportunity to read. I came upon it inadvertently in last month's issue of <i>Management</i> which, according to its precis, should be required reading for senior management in every overseasowned manufacturing company in Ireland. It is, in the main, permeated by the thinking Michael Porter who was the main mover behind the Culliton report and who always has very innovative and highly-individualist commercial ideas. In the article the IMI say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> There are also things a region or a country can do to create and maintain competitive advantage. This is why the report also recommends a collective approach, sector by sector, region by region that ultimately influences national policy from the ground up.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that ultimately only companies themselves can achieve and sustain competitive advantage. He advocates building trust and sharing ideas so that firms can work together and, with local research and development resources, meet the demands for innovation by their most sophisticated customers, working through the cluster idea where the core component of excellence in research and technology can be shared with other companies. I know there is an appreciation here of industrial espionage where firms are afraid to share knowledge or to share their competence for fear that somehow their ideas will be lifted. However, sharing technology among companies of different kinds, making different products, supplying different services that have a core competency of technology which could be shared in a cluster environment would allow it to be more cheaply disseminated, more modern and up-to-date. I am sure that report will make very good reading.</P>
    <P>The last measure I wish to speak about briefly, because I hope to address it on another occasion in the House and Minister Quinn dealt with it at length last week, is the community employment programme. This is an honest effort to give employment to people who would otherwise not have a chance. I very much commend the Progressive Democrats who came forward with a programme themselves. I am sure it will vary in some respects from what we have put forward but, broadly speaking, it is along the same liens. We tapped into the imagination and the initiative of the CMRS, Fr. Seán Healy and Sister Bridget Randalls in their long commitment to this cause. There will be proper training and development &mdash; I insisted on that &mdash; and a dignified developmental chance for workers through it to come back into <Col N="165" /> the open labour market. I commend the budget to the House and am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on it.</P>

      <P>I note, not with surprise, that the Minister has concentrated on the positive aspects of the budget from the point of view of her Department. There were positive and radical developments, such as the community employment programme, and my party welcomes that progressive way of dealing with the huge human set-aside problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me if, in the limited time I have available, I concentrate on dealing with some matters which irk me about the budget. I want to concentrate on one aspect, the property tax and the changed regulations relating to it proposed in the budget. If ever there was a budgetary measure which contained the whiff of the hard Labour left ideology it is this one of the wider application of the property tax to include houses over the value of £75,000 and increase the rate of tax to 2 per cent for houses valued over £100,000. It is very surprising to see members of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party pointing the finger at each other and each disclaiming responsibility for this measure. It is also surprising to see ACRA threatening electoral sanctions against Fianna Fáil Euro-candidates. I do not see why they are pinning themselves only to Fianna Fáil responsibility in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surprising to see the Taoiseach justifying the property tax on the basis that only 3 per cent of houses in the State will be affected by it. This is clearly wrong. Our figures, in consultation with leading auctioneers and property valuers, show that up to 40 per cent of households, <Col N="166" /> 100,000 households, will be liable for this tax, that is particularly the case in Dublin where there are approximately 250,000 households.</P>
    <P>Although this is a national tax, its application will be arbitrary and will hit ordinary people in a penal way. This measure will hugely impact on my constituents in Dublin South and, for that reason, I am using my time today to set out by way of example how this will affect them.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty in relation to the new application of the tax is that it fails to look behind the veil of the value of a house and supposed wealth. It does not look in an objective way at the outgoings of the occupiers. It may well be that they are a hard-working couple already severely stretched in terms of their outgoings, very high mortgage and VHI payments and all the other expenses which go with a middle income. These people are paying through the nose for everything at the moment. The implications of this tax, particularly the increased 2 per cent on properties valued over £100,000 is that middle income families and people trying to make the best of their lives and who are enterprising and hard-working are a sure target for the Government. Many of my constituents reject the ideology behind this; the Government seems to be saying: &ldquo;let us hit the contented&rdquo;. The people of Dublin South are not happy either politically or economically. They are hard pressed to pay the bills that are part and parcel of their lives.</P>
    <P>There was not a squeak about the proposed changes to the property tax in the Labour Party manifesto which was presented to the voters in Dublin South with great effect. It was a very soft focus policy document and did not mention the property tax. That must be set against the huge support which the Labour Party received in Dublin South by way of approximately 18,000 first preference votes for the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald. The Labour Party carried out a dishonest election campaign and this is proof of its dishonesty.</P>
    <P>The presumption that people on middle incomes are content must be confronted. <Col N="167" /> I can point to one area where people are not content, namely, Knocklyon and Rathfarnham, the fastest growing area in south Dublin. The population of that area is steadily increasing and there is no post-primary school there. People there are living in a limbo with unfinished road developments because of the delay in the construction of the Southern Cross route. People can spend up to 30 minutes trying to get out on the main road because the necessary infrastructure to deal with the development there has not been put in place. There are plans for 2,000 more houses in the parish of Knocklyon without any promise of a post-primary school. The primary schools there are bulging, there is no proper infrastructure in place and we now have the threat of water charges. When the people there are on the ropes, they are told that their houses valued at £75,000 or more will be included in the property tax net.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that the Government is losing sight and an understanding of the psyche of middle income families here and it should not be complacent about the discontent of such people. The people whom I represent in Dublin South are up in arms because this is the final straw. It is normal for a person's pay packet to be hit by taxation. People are used to that as they have grown up with heavy taxation. However, having paid one's tax, there is something different and painful about having to write a cheque for several hundred pounds purely because one's house is deemed to be of a value which puts one in the contented class. For many of my constituents the requirement to write a cheque for several hundred or, in some cases several thousand pounds to pay the property tax will mean they will not have a family holiday. That may mean nothing to members of the Labour Party who probably think such people are lucky to be able to consider going on holiday when they have a nice house in which to live. It does not work like that. Those whom the Government is harassing and piling more taxes on are the people who pay for <Col N="168" /> everything. They pay for the dependency system, Government spending and so on.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which the Government can get money, namely, from Europe and from taxes. There is a wide belief that the public debt is being mismanaged. People wonder why they should have to pay a property tax when the Minister, Deputy Ahern, can allocate £5 million by way of gift with no conditions attached to Croke Park. It is anticipated that £5 million will be the take from the lowering of the property threshold. It is political madness to have those two matters set against each other,. Is it worth the candle for this Government for the small take it is predicted it will represent?</P>
    <P>As I said, the Knocklyon area does not have a post-primary school, decent roads or adequate public transport facilities and it is the victim of bad rezoning in south County Dublin. As a result of that rezoning the quality of life for people in that area has diminished. The last available pocket of land in the ownership of the county council has been earmarked for 55 local authority houses. That pocket of land which could provide much needed recreational space for the growing population of my constituency is being eroded and the people are powerless to stop it. At a time when the Government proposes to hit middle income people in south Dublin, Cork or Galway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it should wise up to the notion that the middle income classes have had enough. The property tax is slight on the upwardly mobile. Many Irish people, quite rightly, aspire to own their homes and to date there has been tacit Government support for that by way of tax breaks. This property tax is a type of ideological statement advocating that people should not put money into property but rather into manufacturing industry and so on. I do not agree with that nor would the people in my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, I listened with <Col N="169" /> interest to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, and as my colleague stated, she said little with which one could disagree. I know the Minister for a long time and I accept that she is committed to the changes she proposes, particularly in the area of labour relations. It was interesting to note the buzz words she used and in case we might miss them she underlined them in her script. She talked about bringing about a climate of job retention rather than job reduction and that the route to redundancy was often taken too easily. We are all aware of the management by redundancy which has taken place here for some time. However, I disagree with her on one major issue, namely, the whole premise on which she based her comments. She stated that &ldquo;this is a budget for business, a budget for jobs&rdquo;. That is where the Minister and the Progressive Democrats part company. By no stretch of reasonable analysis &mdash; which I am happy to say is beginning to emerge in the serious media here &mdash; could this budget be described as a budget for jobs or one which encourages investment or the sustaining of jobs. In my view, it encourages the complete opposite.</P>
      <P>I want to nail down a few facts about the great public relations package. There is no doubt the Labour Party learned one thing from its participation in Government in the mid-eighties and the debacle which that caused for the Irish people and for it as a party. It will not make the mistake this time of being lacking in public relations or in how to persuade the mind of the public to believe the opposite to what is actually occurring. They did so in conjunction with Fianna Fáil in the run up to this budget, a budget which was so well leaked, discussed and anticipated that nothing the Minister for Finance could have done would have come as a surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget speech was couched in language and phraseology that clouded the entire issue. One underlying fact in the budget, which is contained in the figures the Minister outlined, is that tax this year will increase by almost 11 per cent on the 1993 figure. There is no tax giveaway or <Col N="170" /> even a maintenance of the burden of taxation that existed in 1993. The tax burden will be substantially increased this year. That is the first and indeed only message that underpins the direction, if any, in which this budget and Government are heading. This will represent an increase to the Exchequer of approximately £667 million in the coming year. Not satisfied with an increased burden of £667 million on the taxpayers of this country we now have an Exchequer borrowing requirement of some £798 million so that we can go on a good spending spree that all of us accept we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>In the past four years Government borrowing increased by 73 per cent, an astonishing figure. We have not learned the lessons of the adverse effects of the policies of the mid-1980s which were largely responsible for our intolerable level of unemployment today. We are now embarking on a similar course of action and nobody is saying stop. I read the initial reports on the budget in the papers with astonishment. I wondered if the media were present for the budget debate, and if any analysis had been done. Was the hogwash from the PR machines washed away and did the media address the underlying messages in the budget. For the first time since I came to this House in 1987 Members were supplied with a copy of the Minister's script. As the Minister announced his intentions the more astonished and fearful I became regarding the direction this country is taking. Our inflation rate is 1.8 per cent and taxes are six times that rate, extraordinary figures for a country whose top priority is job creation.</P>
    <P>Regarding discussions in recent weeks and today under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement, an 8 per cent pay increase has been agreed for the private sector and the figure of 12 per cent has been mentioned for the public sector. It would be welcome if, two or three years down the road, we could see an 8 per cent reduction in the cost of employment, to be shared between employee's take home pay and what the employers must fork <Col N="171" /> out. I predict that the impact on employment by taking that course of action would be far greater than simply sitting in smoke filled rooms trying to create an easy life for the powers that be at the top levels of Government, trade unions, farming organisations and all those involved as social partners. It is easy for those people to go through the annual ritual of talking about job protection. From the point of view of the trade unions and, regrettably, from that of the employers, it is astonishing that those groups knowingly engage in this ritual in the knowledge that the outcome of their discussions will lead to a further inability to sustain existing jobs, not to mention creating jobs. The impact of those discussions is not helping those matters. There is no point in Deputies sitting on committees that have grown up like mushrooms talking about employment, crossing their hearts and beating their breasts as if the Holy Grail is there to be found. It will not be found in some committee room by a spiel or philosophy, but by facing hard reality. One of the hard realities is that the cost of employing people here is out of kilter with countries in the European Union &mdash; our immediate competitors &mdash; and countries worldwide.</P>
    <P>Companies near the Border who have relocated their business 20 to 50 miles north have saved a fortune on employer costs by being liable to an employer PRSI rate of 5.65 per cent compared with the 12 per cent rate here. Surely the penny must be dropping as to how we should go about trying to sustain jobs here, not to mention creating new ones. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is nothing more than a wage deal to keep everybody happy, it has achieved nothing in the area of employment or to our economic welfare in spite of the highminded spiels we hear every so often.</P>
    <P>The Government did an incredible job in December 1993 when 10,000 people were added to the live register with hardly a murmur in the media because the old machine was working towards the budget. The good news was on the way; massive tax reductions were promised. <Col N="172" /> The Minister had some £300 million to give away and we would all be better off. Sadly, that did not happen. If the 12 per cent pay deal sought by the public sector is granted we can close up shop and turn out the light on Ireland Incorporated. The country is more badly managed than companies that have gone to the wall in recent times. It has failed to deal with reality and soft options are being taken.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of the phrase &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; because it is primarily concerned with a small, disadvantaged group. I agree there is a need for social justice in that area, but is there justice for parents raising and educating their children, encouraging them to achieve more than they did to get better jobs and be better prepared for the world? Do those people represent the 3 per cent to whom the Taoiseach referred? He showed he was not in touch with reality by bandying that figure around. Surely the two Ministers sitting on the Government benches realise that the vast majority of people are trying to do their best to keep Ireland Incorporated afloat, to create jobs. They are the soft touch at budget time. There is no justice.</P>
    <P>We have quantity middle management here but we have not sustained quality people in that area or at senior management level. We are unable to sustain them because the message in the budget last week was that the Government does not want them here. They are being told to go out into the market, to go to the UK and Europe where their talents will be properly recognised and where they will get a reasonable reward for their efforts and labour. That is the message in this budget.</P>
    <P>The State is supposed to provide for everybody, but the few who are working are trying to pay for everything. We have reached a point where we cannot pay any more and cannot offer our children any hope of work here if the direction set out in this budget is to be maintained. From where does the Minister for Finance think that education, hospital and VHI fees come? Many people do not have the ability to look after their families and are not encouraged to do so. The problem <Col N="173" /> does not necessarily lie with the bald facts of income tax. The fixtures set out the position clearly. There is a philosophy underlying those figures.</P>
    <P>I am sickened when I hear Deputies on the Government side talk about an enterprising philosophy here. They would check the definition of &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; in the dictionary because the message to people from the budget is the opposite. It tells them to keep working for the Government which will continue to cripple them. Last year people had a saddle put on their backs by the imposition of the 1 per cent levy. This year the levy was lifted but instead the Minister got spurs, shined them up and gave them to everybody on the saddle so that he could climb further up our backs and ride us over Beecher's Brook or at Cheltenham. That is the position and the Minister might well smile.</P>

      <P>That is what has happened. The preamble to the budget was the greatest con job ever perpetrated. I give credit to the Labour Party for the lessons learned from the mistakes it made in the mid-1980s but the spin doctors will not make any mistakes now. The Fianna Fáil Party view is that it is the Government party come what may, and it will be sustained. The Government can sit back and smile but a tragedy is unfolding. There is no justice for middle income people here at any level. Most families have relatives working abroad. Does anyone believe that those people wish to come back to the penal servitude that applies to people who are trying to work here? They certainly do not. Employers in foreign countries have been the beneficiaries of the resources that were spent on educating those people. The number of artificial barriers that are constantly created by Governments is increasing. We should not depend on Europe to give us another £1 billion to solve our problems. The real problems with this country relate to what the Government of the day is doing, and this budget is the final straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> My colleague referred to the property tax. I will not repeat what she said, if ever there was a slimy, cynical and disgraceful attempt to totally undermine people, for the Government to laugh up their sleeves at them, this is it. I can think of no measure in recent times that was so biased and grossly unfair as this. I feel so strongly about it that words fail me. I and my party have a view on the issue of property tax and I am prepared to sit down and debate it with anybody, but I never advocated a property tax that would destroy the people who are left in this country, trying to earn a decent living and look after their children. This tax has been introduced in an arbitrary fashion.</P>
    <P>Let us look in hindsight at the whole question of property tax, local charges and local government funding. Let us put a committee together, sit down and look at all the issues involved. The property tax has been introduced in a grossly unfair way. For two months, as Mayor of Waterford I desperately tried to promote the value of local charges in terms of the developmnent of the local economy. I tried to explain to people that everybody should share the burden so that we would not fall behind other areas. The local authority in my area won the battle and persuaded people that what we proposed would be to their advantage. However, the Government, in a cynical exercise, then introduced property tax. The money that will accrue from this source will not even go to local authorities, which are grossly under-funded. The property tax which I will pay will go towards Croke Park, and I resent that. The one organisation that is better funded and organised than any other received £5 million from the Government. That is absolutely outrageous. At the same time the Minister decided that the rest of Ireland would receive the princely sum of £3 million, not a very generous gesture to the other 25 counties.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail on the Custom House Docks area, Sheriff Street and all the organisations that are looked after by the Government &mdash; it is laughable to even talk about it. One of the finest regional sporting facilities is located in my area. <Col N="175" /> The national soccer team is involved and all our efforts are concentrated on minimising costs. We cannot get funds for a dressing room, we have no stands and no facilities. That position is mirrored in other areas of the country, but the Government sits and laughs at us as Croke Park goes merrily on its way &mdash; in saying that I am not being anti-GAA. My colleague commented on the fact that the £5 million due this year on property tax equates with the £5 million granted to Croke Park. I suppose the Government can say it is putting property tax into property, that one will balance the other. That is the sort of attitude it takes.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister spoke about recognising the need for road development, but he provided money only for road maintenance. The fact that we cannot build roads in irrelevant. Apart from the main national routes which are 100 per cent funded, no funding is provided for county and urban roads. In my area we cannot get funding to build ring roads, yet we see Ministers dispensing large amounts of money in other areas. Where is the cohesive policy on local government, local funding and road development? Is the tax that we in the south-east pay somehow a lesser tax than that paid in Dublin and other favoured spots? Are we in some way lesser people? What this Government is doing in this budget will drive a further wedge in terms of discouraging people from work, in terms of the reward-for-work principle. People will say: &ldquo;Why should I bother when the Government's attitude is that every time my head appears slightly above the water it is stamped on and driven back down&rdquo;. Where is the justice in this Government?</P>

      <P>I will confine most of my remarks to tourism and trade. The contributions of Deputies O'Donnell and Cullen sum up the verbiage of opinion that is aired when one makes a move in the area of taxation. While I would be willing to debate on any occasion the question of property tax, high taxes and borrowing, the speeches of both Deputies sum up the dilemma which we as a society will have to face regarding the whole question of taxation.</P>
      <P>We must realise that if the State is to provide a reasonable supply of public services there will be a cost involved. If the social partners, all the political parties and experts are convinced that tax on earned income, whether it be PAYE or tax on the self-employed, is too high, there must be a shift in another direction in terms of taxation. Whether we like it or not, we must move in the area of capital taxation. The question as to how such a tax should be introduced is one which will be debated for a long time. If the furore that has been caused by the small shift in residential property tax is an indication of how that debate will go, we might as well stop the charade now.</P>
      <P>I have tremendous respect for Deputies O'Donnell and Cullen and I value their integrity and their contributions. I understand the real world as well as anyone else and I will take a lot of convincing that a person earning £30,000 per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very pleased, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, to have this opportunity to speak in the House on the Government's 1994 budget. As the Minister for Finance indicated in his opening remarks, this budget is part of the strategy designed to give impetus to sustainable employment in Ireland. I intend to frame my remarks generally in the context of the areas of tourism and trade development and how the activities of my Department and agencies fit into and are supported by the provisions of this budget.</P>
      <P>One year ago the establishment of a new Ministry for Tourism and Trade provided us with the opportunity to devise and implement focused policies which would lead to increased foreign earnings and give tourism an enhanced international dimension which would be the focal point for the development of the sector. We have achieved a lot in this first year in the following areas.</P>
      <P>Last year was a particularly tough and challenging time for Irish exporters, given the difficult trading environment in which they operated, the depressed economies in some of our main markets and the conditions prevailing at home, particularly in relation to high interest and exchange rate uncertainty in the early part of the year. Despite these difficulties, it is encouraging that the overall value of Irish exports is estimated to have grown by 8.25 per cent to £18 billion in 1993. An Bord Tráchtála has estimated that indigenous exports reached a total of £3.9 billion in 1993, an increase of 8 per cent on the 1992 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> Last year I introduced the EURO-PLACE scheme which gives very substantial financial support to firms putting extra sales representatives on the ground in overseas markets. This scheme is estimated to yield additional business of £3 million per annum per sales person. An Bord Tráchtála's targeted marketing consultancy scheme offers assistance to Irish companies in preparing and implementing a marketing plan involving significant financial investment. To date, TMC grants have been approved for 124 companies to a total of £24.6 million. Over the four year cycle of the scheme for these companies, it is expected that additional export sales of £1.3 billion will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The GATT Uruguay Round Agreement, on which negotiations concluded on 15 December last, is the biggest trade agreement ever concluded in the history of world trade. It is a major victory for multi-lateralism over unilateral solutions to trade problems and incorporates the biggest single reduction every achieved in trade tariffs.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to be very precise about the benefits for Ireland of the GATT Agreement, the consultancy study which I commissioned, and published in December, estimated that the Irish economy stood to directly gain in excess of 20,000 jobs from a GATT agreement. This is in comparison with a failure scenario which would lead to trade hostilities and a proliferation of protectionist measures.</P>
    <P>The exploitation of the trade and growth opportunities the round will create is, of course, a matter for industry &mdash; manufacturing agriculture and services. The Government can only contribute to the creation of the economic environment which will stimulate growth and trade opportunities which, if exploited, will result in increased output and employment. Many of the provisions in the budget will help to improve the competitiveness of our exporters and boost their ability to take full advantage of the GATT.</P>
    <P>Last year was a very eventful year for <Col N="180" /> the tourism industry. Despite the recessionary climate in Britain and the United States and the fact that travel within Europe has been stagnant, total foreign exchange earnings are expected to exceed £1.3 billion for the first time ever. According to preliminary forecasts compiled by Bord Fáilte from available Central Statistics Office returns, the number of overseas visitors is estimated at 3.27 million, a 4.9 per cent increase. This puts performance for the 1993 season in line with Government growth targets. When revenue from domestic tourism is added, total earnings are expected to exceed £1.8 billion.</P>
    <P>Two important institutional developments took place in 1993. In September, I established the Tourism Council which includes representatives of the tourism industry, State agencies and Government Departments dealing with tourism. The council will act as a national forum for consultation and advice on tourism policy.</P>
    <P>The reaction to the council has been very positive and its members have shown great enthusiasm for its work. I look forward to hearing the views of members on the key issues of marketing, access and product development which have been set before them.</P>
    <P>Also in 1993, I reached agreement with the regional tourism organisations to reform the corporate structures of the organisations. Arising from that agreement new structures based upon county divisions are in the process of being established to replace the existing regional councils of the RTOs. Each county, therefore, will be represented by a county tourism committee comprising representatives of the various membership categories within each RTO, including members of voluntary groups and organisations. In addition, new slimmed-down boards of management will be established to replace the existing management committees.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other very positive developments in the tourism area in 1993 which merit brief mention. Following Government approval of the Aer Lingus survival plan, a new bi-lateral <Col N="181" /> air services agreement was arranged which will allow direct scheduled services between the United States and Dublin. There was an expansion of scheduled air services from Britain and mainland Europe, and the number of in-bound seats on charter flights from the Continent increased from 110,000 to 120,000. Capacity on Irish Sea and continental routes was increased significantly. During 1993 investment in tourism training, marketing, infrastructure and plant continued strongly with support from Government, EU and International Fund for Ireland incentive schemes. It is estimated that these schemes supported an investment of over £100 million in the year. In 1993 a number of new projects of scale were opened which are of international standard and which will help Ireland establish itself as an exciting quality holiday destination.</P>
    <P>Despite the uncertain start to the year, 1993 turned out to be one of good performance by both the exporting and tourism sectors, aided by focused and sensible measures on the part of my Department and agencies.</P>
    <P>Coming into 1994 we had grounds for optimism on a number of fronts. The period of weak growth in the international economy seems to have reached its lowest point in 1993. An increasingly solid expansion is underway in the United States and Canada. The recovery in the UK seems well established and the indications are that, in some EU countries at least, the low point of economic activity has been passed. This improving international climate is good in terms of demand for our goods and services and good in terms of the ability of the overseas consumer to consider a holiday in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provision in my Department's Estimate of an additional £3 million for tourism promotion activities has enabled me to provide a major impetus to our marketing drive this year. A sum of £2 million of this allocation will go to a new programme linking the tourism industry, my Department, Bord Fáilte and tourism specialists as we strive to increase the number of visitors from the United States <Col N="182" /> in 1994 by 57,000. An intensive advertising campaign is about to begin in the US using TV, magazines and newspapers which will highlight Ireland in a new and vibrant way. We expect this major campaign to bear fruit in a way that will mean increased numbers of visitors from the US throughout the year. Carrier capacity is also being expanded in order to meet the anticipated demand for seats.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind Deputies that there has been concern for some time that the full potential of tourism from the US was not being reached. This year there is evidence of an improvement in the United States economy. The dollar is strong on the exchange markets and of no little importance to us because of our presence in the US at the World Cup finals. The time is ripe to interest US holiday makers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors which impairs the profitability of Irish tourism is that operators do not get a year round return on their product. Improving the seasonality of Irish tourism through greater utilisation of facilities throughout the year would greatly help the industry. I am allocating £800,000 this year for a special seasonality campaign to be operated by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the industry to promote holidays in off peak seasons.</P>
    <P>An additional £100,000 is being made available for tourism promotion in Japan. Due to the distance separating our two countries and the lack of direct air services we do not receive as many Japanese tourists in Ireland as we would like. A new strategy being developed by my Department in co-operation with Bord Fáilte will emphasise Ireland as a green island with a Celtic culture and will focus on the opportunities for language training and leisure activities. The bulk of the additional money will be concentrated on travel agencies and the media with a view to getting Ireland better known as a viable travel destination. We would hope to have up to 20,000 Japanese visitors in 1994.</P>
    <P>A further £100,000 is set aside for marketing in Australia and New Zealand. A major task will be to increase <Col N="183" /> awareness of the Fly Free facility. This facility allows Australian visitors who travel to initial destinations such as London to fly to secondary destinations at no extra cost. We must make increased efforts to ensure that more Australians choose Ireland as their fly free destinations.</P>
    <P>With the support of the European Union, we are completing the Tourism Operational Programme, 1989-1993, the single biggest investment programme ever undertaken in the industry and are about to embark on an even more ambitious programme.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the last programme, overseas visitors increased by over 800,000 per annum, generating an extra £450 million annually and in the process creating an additional 20,000 jobs in the economy. The investment programme undertaken over the programme period has supported this success. It is estimated that total investment in tourist facilities, training and marketing over the period was well over £500 million.</P>
    <P>The new operational programme aims to build on the partnership process initiated under the previous programme, with the public and private sectors again working jointly towards the achieving of Government targets. The Government aims to achieve an increase of 50 per cent in real terms, equivalent to an extra £1 billion in foreign tourism revenue and in the process to create up to half the net employment growth in the economy over the next five years. The new operational programme will be the key plank in the strategy to achieve these targets. Investment under the programme will be targeted at further product development to meet specific market deficiencies; a large expansion in marketing activities; major improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism product and an expansion in the range and scale of training.</P>
    <P>The draft programme is at present being finalised and will be formally submitted to the Commission in the near future. I hope to be in a position to publish <Col N="184" /> its content before the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Against the background of solid achievements in 1993 and an improving international climate, this year's budget gives a powerful incentive to investment and job creation in the economy. It contains measures which will help growth of all small businesses as well as measures which are targeted specifically at the tourist sector.</P>
    <P>The reality of the international marketplace for multinational investment is such that the number of mobile projects is declining and the level of competition is intensifying. We must, and will, continue to attract suitable overseas projects to locate here, but we must look more and more to indigenous industry, especially small and medium sized industry. Indigenous industry tends to be more job intensive and this is why successive reports, including the Culliton report, place such considerable emphasis on developing native enterprises. This budget has set about tackling many of the barriers which have inhibited the growth of small business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a £100 million enterprise fund available to small businesses at low, fixed rates for a ten year period addresses a major obstacle which small business has faced for many years. I know from my contact with entrepreneurs throughout Ireland that they are not lacking in the energy and commitment to make their businesses succeed, but so often they simply cannot access the funds to get the business on a sound footing. Business people seeking loans from the enterprise fund will not be required to give personal guarantees and no repayments will be made in the first two years.</P>
    <P>This budget also contains an impressive package of taxation and administrative changes which have been developed in consultation with business to reduce the bureaucratic burden and let them get on with productive activity. I will mention just a few: A new tax relief for the transfer of business assets is being introduced into capital acquisitions tax. The relief will also cover the transfer of <Col N="185" /> shares in a business; the company value limit for enterpreneurs' investment in their own company under the BES is being raised from £150,000 to £250,000; the VAT registration thresholds for both goods and services are being increased significantly; businesses whose turnover is less than £250,000 a year will be entitled to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis; the Revenue Commissioners will shortly produce a single registration form which can be used by businesses to register for all taxes; and the tax clearance procedures for public sector contracts are also being simplified.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the last ten minutes to my colleagues and prospective MEP, Deputy Gerard Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister campaigns in a similar way in Munster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a good budget for business and for tourism. At the outset of my contribution I outlined some of the problems any Government has when it attempts to make some changes to the taxation code. As a result of this budget every taxpayer will be better off. In the area of taxation significant changes have been made which signal the intention of the Government to encourage people at all levels of enterprise in the economy to get on with the job of working for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the multinational companies that come to Ireland. They have provided much employment here in the past years but, as I said earlier, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract international mobile investment here. We can make changes ourselves. We can put more money into people's pockets to allow them get on with the business of creating economic activity. This budget gives many signals in that regard and it marks a turning point in economic activity. We have experienced considerable difficulties economically but we have overcome those difficulties by prudent financial management in the past seven years. This budget will lead to greater economic activity which in the <Col N="186" /> long term will lead to sustainable jobs in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my sincere gratitude to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, for giving me some of his time to contribute briefly to this important debate. I wish him well in the new responsibilities with which he must contend as a result of his acquiring additional finances from the Government to promote tourism. We all recognise the value of tourism and we recognise also that in the short term it can have the quickest pay-off for the economy by helping us create additional employment and job opportunities for young people. I wish him every success in that regard.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome this budget in that its essential thrust seems to make job creation the major priorty. That is very important. The Minister for Finance has delivered a package that combines incentives to industry with personal tax cuts, a strategy aimed at stimulating the economy. The budget also contains a range of special measures to create jobs in small and labour intensive industries while those in low paid jobs were given approximately £200 million in tax cuts. That is a worthwhile measure which I welcome.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of this budget on which I would like to comment if the time was available to me but as it is not I wish to refer briefly to one matter on which I have voiced opinions previously in this House and which has now been dealt with successfully by the Government, namely, the probate tax. I am very pleased to register my support of the efforts of the Minister for Finance in that spouses will now be fully exempt from probate tax. In addition, the Minister's efforts provide for a 30 per cent reduction in the market value of agricultural land buildings for probate tax purposes. I am glad to note that these have been made retrospective to 18 June 1993, the date on which that tax came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the tax measures to assist business and employment generally I <Col N="187" /> should say that over the past weekend I was contacted by three small business people already preparing applications to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in an effort to help them maintain what they have and improve their stability in an effort to keep the show on the road. One of those businesses employs 28 people full-time and another small industry in the same vicinity employs six people full-time and another six parttime, something that is very valuable in a rural area. What the Government is doing under this heading will be of great benefit to such people.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has been said with regard to the urban renewal scheme which is indeed worthwhile. It would be my hope that, when the Minister for the Environment is designating towns outside the Dublin area, for such urban renewal, he would engage in greater consultation, perhaps with public representatives, and would listen to cases that must be made in an effort to develop county towns that have been run down for one reason or another. In this respoct I might mention two towns in County Limerick, Newcastlewest and Rathkeale, Rathkeale in particular, a unique community, where there are between 600 and 800 travellers throughout the year, integrating in so far as possible with the settled community. There is need for much development in Rathkeale which should be examined in particular in that it does not have a local authority. It is a town that must be closely examined having regard to the overall problems we experience nationally endeavouring to settle travelling people. That is very important and it is my hope that the Minister will act in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the very worthwhile social benefits to come on stream: for example, the 3 per cent increase from July next for weekly welfare payments and the provision whereby people in receipt of disability and unemployment benefit will receive an increase in payments of almost 10 per cent. That is something to be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused, on coming into <Col N="188" /> the House this afternoon, to hear the Progressive Democrats express exceptional concern for people living in houses valued up to £100,000. I should have preferred that their social consciences would have reminded them that there are very many old people living alone in eligible houses for small grants for essential repairs such as doors, windows and leaking roofs. The fact that the Government recognise that such a class exists within our society and are allocating £4 million to this scheme is to be welcomed. However, I would contend it is not sufficient, that it is a start only. I know of many old people whose applications for this help were submitted in 1992 and processed in 1993 but who have been told that they cannot expect help before late 1994 or perhaps into 1995. By then, it is fair to assume, many of them will be dead and gone. Therefore, I hope the allocation of £4 million will make some mark in that area and do something worthwhile for such applicants. I am not sure how many applicants would be involved but certainly £4 million divided among 26 or 27 local authorities demonstrates exactly the amount available. When there is talk of £10 million being allocated to Collins Barracks and £10 million for Dublin Castle it is not easy to tell an old person that they are being given priority. However, I will stand corrected if the £4 million turns out to be adequate to deal with the backlog obtaining. Nonetheless, I have had people come to me letting me know that that is the score, that they have been told that their applications will not be implemented before late 1994 or early 1995.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Government's recognition of the disastrous state of county roads nationwide and that an additional £15 million is being provided to counteract that problem. However, I would emphasise that this amount is being provided as an emergency measure to deal with what is now recognised as a drastic position, a very serious problem which is causing many people grave concern, particularly those living in rural areas. Serious accidents occur almost <Col N="189" /> daily because of the shocking conditions of roads in the various counties with people being injured and considerable damage being caused to motor vehicles. I have spoken to two garage owners in small towns recently and that was the message being put across. Motorists and other road users are very angry and are demanding that urgent consideration be given to what they consider to be a major problem, with a view to its resolution, not overnight but within a reasonable period. The inclement weather of the past two months has contributed to the continued deterioration of those roads, with, in some cases, parts of the roads disappearing. It must be recognised that a large number of county roads were already in a deplorable condition. Not alone were they full of potholes but, in many cases, both sides of the road had sunk leaving the centre elevated and rendering it impossible for vehicles, in particular cars, to travel on them because of the potential damage to oil sumps. Some of these roads are almost impassable at present.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the budgetary allocation it is vital that it be clearly understood that it is a barely adequate response to the problem I have outlined. While it may alleviate the deterioration caused by the exceptionally bad weather of the past two months it will not rectify the alarming conditions of a significant number of county roads nationwide which has worsened over the past two months. It is imperative that a suitable programme be devised to resolve this problem within a reasonable period, that the appropriate financial provision be made, not only in the interests of rural development but of rural preservation. We must not discriminate against people living in rural areas. We must not allow those areas become &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas. The people there deserve justice and fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened in my office to the various contributions made in the House in relation to this budget. There were times when I smiled and times when I almost cried. I will not identify the particular occasions. Suffice it to say that <Col N="190" /> the euphoria that seemed to befall the community, including Members of this House, in the course of the Minister's Budget Statement, was genuine in the sense that it was general but was very short-lived. The Minister had scarcely left the House and the various Members reached their homes before they began to feel that perhaps the euphoria they had felt earlier was not as well based as they might have thought or would have liked. Therefore, it was with a sneaking suspicion they reached their constituencies to be greeted by inquiries about property taxes, unemployment, local charges and various other matters. It was all discussed at the time, by the people being questioned, as having been not all that important but, as the week progressed, that questioning became more persistent and consistent. Indeed the unfortunate members of the Government parties became more irate because it was then recognised that there was a large group of people nationwide, at all ends of the social and economic scale, who were genuinely concerned at how the budgetary provisions would affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of where they stood on the social or economic scale, they saw the budget as a threat. They saw the microscope being placed over them, information being extracted and identification of how much extra taxation they could tolerate, how much further the Government could go before breaking point was reached. It was a threat to the unemployed, of whom we have already 400,000. Indeed the way things are looking we shall have more of them. The only thing the Minister can say to the unemployed at present is that they will not be lonely, that they will have plenty of company for a very long time. There is nothing in the budget that will reduce permanently the number unemployed. There is a proposal, of course, to employ 35,000 on a massive FÁS scheme, but I wonder what will happen when the FÁS scheme comes to an end. How will the 400,000 unemployed be greeted? What is in the budget for those who have spent years seeking work? Absolutely nothing, <Col N="191" /> but things being the way they are, the Government will attempt to dress it up.</P>
    <P>The budget runs counter to a great many promises made by each party in Government. Although the promises were made by the individual parties they do not seem to apply to the partnership because each can now turn to the other and say the promises were made before they became partners. That appears to be the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>The budget is a threat to the farming community. Farmers were recently informed that their incomes were considerably higher than in previous years. Anybody to whom I spoke in the past week asked me how this could happen when most of the land has been under water for the past six months. I cannot understand how anybody assessed farmers' income unless they travelled by boat. In any event there is nothing in the budget for farmers.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the tremendous benefits to industry resulting from the minimal reductions in PRSI. The 1 per cent income levy is recognised as one of the most backward steps in the past 20 years. Surely it has been recognised by successive Governments that a direct tax on employment is a huge disincentive to employment. It has resulted in an increase in the number unemployed. The Minister had the option of removing the levy by way of a Supplementary Estimate but he did not choose to do so and I congratulate him for recognising belatedly the error of his ways. The partnership Government buckled under the pressure from the social partners and the community at large and were forced into recognising that the 1 per cent levy was a stupid tax and the quicker it was buried the better.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for repeating this year that we must take a benign approach to the clothing industry. However, if this is the benign approach I would hate to see a hostile one. Throughout the length and breadth of the country people in the clothing industry do not know from day to day how long they will last. Their overheads are too high. Production costs, <Col N="192" /> in addition to high VAT, place them in an uncompetitive position. Their lives are a misery. I would have thought even at this late stage the Minister would cast a benign eye on that industry. The budget is still a threat to employment in industry and to the well being of the country.</P>
    <P>Did anybody escape the wrath of this Government? No. Residential property tax, that grand old chestnut, has been trotted out as a possibility since the foundation of the State but the two parties, having convinced each other that the promise was made individually felt there was no commitment to keep it collectively and they have brought the income and the valuation thresholds down. I listened to Deputy Gerard Collins reassuring himself but he did not reassure me that this was not a problem. I will outline where the problem lies. Former local authority houses will shortly fall within the thresholds for residential property tax as all that is required is that the household income be over £25,000. I cannot understand how the Government arrived at the alleged target of 12,000 homes. In fact, the number of homes likely to be targeted this year will be greatly in excess of 12,000. The Minister must know that. In my area some of the local authority houses built by Kildare County Council in the past 25 years will be subject to residential property tax in the next four to five years. That gives Members an idea of what is likely to happen elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There must have been some considerable soul searching as Deputies viewed their respective constituencies. Some will be hit much harder than others. I will not go into the nitty gritty but I certainly would not like to be a Government backbencher representing a constituency in or around this city &mdash; I am not talking about the inner city. When reality dawns after the euphoria associated with the budget I have a sneaking suspicion the Minister will be made aware somehow that a great many people will be adversely affected by this arbitrary taxation. I have no objection to it in principle but we must ask why the parties in Government did not indicate before <Col N="193" /> the last general election what they proposed to do. If somebody goes into a shop and pays for something behind the counter he likes to know what he is buying. Obviously a great many people did not know what they were buying at the last election because they were not told. It is a sad reflection on the Government's behaviour that it welshed on the promises it made to the community.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the arrival of my colleague, Deputy Broughan, because I am sure he will be interested in the local charges proposal. This is not included directly in the budget but obviously it has had to be calculated in the context of overall expenditure. I can remember the last ditch battles fought in relation to local charges. In Dublin they said never to local charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be never never but now it is just never. Individually promises were made by the respective parties in Government but when the two parties merged under the umbrella of Government they felt they had no responsibilities to the people to whom they made the promises. People in Dublin who are not caught for the residential property tax will have a service charge imposed on them and that will come as a surprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been wrong before but not very often. I am afraid that the wrongs in the budget are greater than any wrongs perpetrated on the people so far and, unfortunately, the Deputy has not seen that yet. I am surprised that somebody from the Government parties did not apologise because surely at this stage an apology is warranted. One cannot tell people at election time that they will be looked after and at the same time attack people from both ends of the social and economic scale. By attacking from the top as well as the lower end of the social <Col N="194" /> scale the people in the middle will be caught and that is what the Government are proposing to do. I feel sorry for them. The only assurance we can give the people is that we in Opposition will attempt to highlight the misdemeanours of the Government and point out the error of their ways.</P>
      <P>A matter which has annoyed me of late is a reluctance on the part of some Ministers to answer, fairly and squarely, questions that come within the ambit of their Department. There are no personalities involved, but it is particularly relevant in the case of a Government with a large majority. Some Ministers respond well and I compliment them, but there is a tendency in other areas to treat the House with contempt. The Government should beware because once they bring their own house into disrepute they are in disrepute. I have a particular reason for saying that, which I will deal with again in this House. My view has always been that any issue which is within the ambit of the vote for a particular Department is the responsibility of the Minister. We receive from a Department a reply to the effect that the Minister has no responsibility to the House. I received such a reply last week which annoyed me so much that, for once in my life, I was very tempted to cause an unnecessary row. It would be unnecessary because that type of thing should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has turned its attention to mortgage interest relief and asked why it should not be reduced, saying that interest rates are at their lowest level in 12 months. We know what the rates were 12 months ago. The point is that there was now a growing lobby of people who had enjoyed their mortgage interest relief during the past 20 years. Instead of giving those people relief without strings attached the Government decided to give it to them at the expense of the people who were about to enjoy mortgage interest relief. It was a neat trick but they did it and I congratulate the Government. Anybody who had mortgage interest relief during the past 20 years and paid off their mortgage would face increased income tax and would ask for <Col N="195" /> a more favourable tax regime. In this case the Government wanted to help out because they want to be helpful to everybody &mdash; as we have seen from previous performances. What did they do? They found other willing victims. They found that the best thing to do was to phase it out by watering it down slightly. There are two threats in that area for homeowners. Both the mortgage interest relief and the residential property tax will, within the next four or five years, seriously threaten those people who have local authority loans, those who have bought local authority houses and people who will live in local authority houses. I ask whether the homeless got away scot free. I am always loath to criticise constituency colleagues.</P>

      <P>I was amazed to find that the total number of local authority houses built and tenanted throughout the whole country last year, despite all the brouhaha, was 947.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those houses will not be private for long because of the residential property tax and the removal of the mortgage interest relief. This Government intend to own everything. They will soon have all the houses in the country within their control. It is important to remember that their performance in the housing area is bad. There has been much hype in relation to solving the problem of homelessness. Any Member of this House will verify that. They can go through this city or the adjoining constituencies and they will find there is not a single location into which a person in <Col N="196" /> need of emergency housing can be put at present. This was brought home to me recently when the housing policy of the local authority was being discussed and I heard the phrase &mdash; which I presume emanated from the Department because I hope nobody in the local authority would have been so callous &mdash; that &ldquo;local authority houses would be built as a last resort&rdquo;. That statement says much but I will not go any further down that road as there are other roads I wish to travel.</P>
      <P>Any Member who lives in a rural constituency, such as I do, must be aware of the problems that have faced people during the years. I have heard various speakers applaud and congratulate the Minister for approving an extra £15 million for main and county roads or minor roads. I have the greatest of sympathy for the Minister and, in fact, I am worried about him. If he feels that £15 million will be sufficient to deal with the problem that exists in relation to main and county roads then his problems are much more serious than I thought. In my constituency of Kildare we could spend the £15 million in any one year and still have the job only half done. I do not know where the Minister got the inspiration that £15 million would solve the problem this year. I would like to know from whom he got his advice. Surely in the Department there must be lines of communication available to back benchers in both the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties whereby they can convey their worries to the Minister and let him know their problems.</P>

      <P>If they have done so, I am equally sorry for the back benchers as they did not do a very good job. He did not respond in the manner expected. This nonsense in relation to main and county roads has gone on long enough. It is a sick joke throughout the country. I am tired of going to meeting night after night explaining to people about the difficulties local authorities have in spending money which comes from the Department, because we only get about <Col N="197" /> 10 per cent of what we require in any given year. We would be far better off if we tried to do a reasonably good job in one year so that we could indicate to the people that we had attempted to resolve the problem and that we had at least finally controlled it. What we are doing is throwing good money after bad. Year after year we spend that 10 per cent of what is required. It would be better to put it in the bank and wait until it had collected enough interest so that we could do a reasonable job on some of our roads. What we are doing now is an insult to ourselves, a sad reflection on the Government and an insult to the people this Government purports to represent.</P>
      <P>Elderly people have not been reassured by this budget. They are concerned about primary health care, housing and security. Every household which contains people in their sixties or over that age is concerned about primary health care. Old people are particularly vulnerable and they feel they are being tossed on the economic sea by one Government after another with little regard for their well being. They are equally concerned about the knock on the door at night when they wonder if they will be alive in the morning. Protection for the elderly has not been enhanced in this budget. The problem has not been and will not be addressed because the resources are not being made available.</P>
      <P>The budget is a threat to youth. It holds out the promise of more of the same. It throws out a few little treats but does not do anything really positive. There is nothing in this budget for the young people still at school, in second level or third level education or for those on work experience programmes. For them there is a strong possibility that they might have to join the 400,000 people already unemployed. There is nothing in the budget to suggest that anything else will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that there was more scope this year than at any time in 20 years but if that is the case the Minister made bad use of his time, as did the two parties in <Col N="198" /> Government. The budget does not even give hope.</P>
    <P>Last year many poor unfortunate people were threatened in the budget with probate tax, a tax which was banished 20 years ago because it was seen as a tax on the dead. While some people may be euphoric in welcoming the fact that it no longer applies to benefits accruing to spouses, it still applies to widows or widowers whose property may be passed on to members of the family. Given that the amount of money involved is not great I hoped that the Minister would have had the gumption to wipe this tax out altogether. However, the opportunity was lost and only a few of those who were made subject to the probate tax last year will be taken out of the net. The tax is removed in the case of spouses but not in the case of other members of the family. I do not know how that can be seen as a benefit because one must conclude that at some stage the property will be passed on to somebody other than the husband and wife who originally owned it.</P>
    <P>This is a disappointing budget. It will generate a great deal more heat between now and the Finance Bill. Back benchers of both Government parties who are reneging on promises will feel a fair bit of heat between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill. Perhaps it will bring some reality back to this God forsaken Government.</P>

The budget carries on the programme of the partnership Government. I welcome the significant reduction in tax for lower paid workers and the first attempt to deal with the bad effects of the tax wedge.

      <P>This budget has attempted to provide a basic standard of living for the 1.5 million people caught in the poverty trap. The initiatives in the budget will take a large proportion of families out of the poverty trap over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The Minister in reviewing the economy at the start of his budget speech pointed to the many favourable achievements of the partnership Government last year. The general Government deficit stood at 2.5 per cent, inflation stood at 1.5 per cent and GDP, against all the odds, alone among the countries in the OECD, rose by 2.25 per cent while the Exchequer borrowing requirement was less than 3 per cent. The Minister was the first to recognise that unemployment is unacceptably high. Provision has been made for a figure of 289,000 this year.</P>
      <P>Like many other backbenchers in this House, I felt, because the economic indicators of performance were so favourable &mdash;for example, it has been forecast that there will be a 2 per cent growth rate in OECD countries this year&mdash;because of the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> under which approximately 80,000 extra non-agricultural jobs have been created and because of the fall in personal taxation to 13 per cent of GNP there was never a more favourable opportunity to launch a major attack on unemployment.</P>

    <P>I have great admiration for many of the ICTU leaders, such as Mr. Peter Cassells who in the negotiations on the <i>Programme</i><Col N="200" /><i>for Economic and Social Progress</i> put forward the idea of local economic development which has had a favourable effect in many parts of my constituency, Coolock in particular.

      <P>That is exactly what the conservative parties would have done. I applaud the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, for streamlining and rationalising the social employment scheme, the community enterprise development programme and Teamwork <Col N="201" /> under the local development programme. It has to be said that previous programmes had many unfavourable aspects. For example, applicants had to be more than 25 years of age and long term unemployed. I note that the Minister proposes to double the total number of jobs available to 40,000. Likewise, I welcome the initiatives in relation to the VTOS, Youthreach and FÁS all of which should have a favourable impact this year. Despite the fact that 40,000 jobs will be available under the local development programme we are still faced with a major problem. The Deputy sitting on the Opposition benches is correct in that regard.</P>
      <P>Apart from development of our education system and greater competitiveness in the economy one possible solution is a national work sharing programme which would be very attractive to many people who wish to enter the labour force. For the past year the Government has been considering the possibility of introducing such a programme. I hope it will be introduced this year. While job sharing on a 50/50/ basis may be attractive to a minority of workers who can afford to take a drop in net pay it would not be sufficient. In this regard, it would be more realistic to introduce a Government programme in which employers and employees would be offered major incentives to switch to a shorter working week. Various suggestions have been made &mdash; for example, five workers doing the work of four. Even if agreement could not be reached on this policy initiative until next year it would still be worthwhile.</P>

It has been suggested <Col N="202" /> that 15 per cent reduction in working time would lead to a 10 per cent increase in employment with a reduction in employers' and employees' PRSI being offered in compensation.</P>
      <P>Even if we could double the figure of 75,000 to 150,000 new jobs through extensive work sharing schemes unless employers change their policies on recruitment the unemployment figure will continue to remain at around 250,000. I understand that yesterday at the opening of a conference on the national plan the Taoiseach stated that a rising tide does not necessarily lift all boats. In this regard, he paraphrased the famous quote of the late great Taoiseach, Sean Lemass. He seemed to be saying that without intervention the 124,000 long term unemployed will be by-passed.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business in Dáil Éireann today, Deputy Eamon Gilmore accused me of touting for business in the course of my career as a solicitor and of abusing my position as a public representative in so doing. I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to reply to this most serious charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the legal profession touting for business is a serious ethical breach of discipline. It is all the more important, therefore, that I assure this House and the public that the allegation made by Deputy Gilmore is completely and totally false. Deputy Gilmore's accusation was based on an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which itself carried very serious implications, including the suggestion that I availed of a conflict of interests to generate very substantial fees in a case that can be referred to as the <Col N="205" /> Concerva heaters case. Those implications are also totally false.</P>
    <P>I intend to deal in some detail with the issues arising from the Concerva heaters case in order to facilitate the fullest understanding of the situation. My purpose is to ensure that there is no shadow of doubt surrounding the handling of the case arising from this morning's or any other publicity. I believe that I owe it to the clients involved and to many other professional people who worked on the case. I am also aware that a number of people with a vested interest in the matter have been trying for some time to spread false and malicious rumours about the case. I emphasise that in saying this I am not implying that <i>The Irish Times</i> or Ms Geraldine Kennedy were doing anything other than following up on a story they were given.</P>
    <P>However, I must begin by pointing out some serious errors of fact in <i>The Irish Times</i> story. First, the story refers to a number of letters written by me. None of those letters refers to the Concerva heaters case which is the main subject of the story itself; they all refer to a different case and a different part of my constituency in which I made vigorous representations on behalf of corporation tenants but in which I had no personal involvement in the conduct of the legal cases. Those cases were dealt with and, for all I know, continue to be dealt with by another partner in my former firm. Second, the article referred to an amount of money paid to my former firm in legal fees over a two-year period. It failed to point out, however, that I severed my connection with the firm in the middle of that two-year period.</P>
    <P>The Concerva heaters case involved a large number of families and individuals in a particular housing estate in my constituency who suffered serious health problems as a result of the installation by Dublin Corporation in their homes of a heater known as the Concerva heater. Initially I and many other public representatives took up the matter with Dublin Corporation on a political level. As <i>The Irish Times</i> correctly reports, I circulated a questionnaire to the families <Col N="206" /> affected and I understand that similar inquiries were made by other public representatives, including those of The Workers' Party, as it then was. Following many fruitless months of political representation on behalf of these families by me and by other public representatives, Dublin Corporation refused point-blank to make any concessions to these families or to recognise any liability for the damage and personal injuries they were suffering or, most important of all, to remove the dangerous heaters from the homes of the people involved and to replace them with normal fire places.</P>
    <P>After we had exhausted all political avenues of representation many of the families involved requested that I initiate legal proceedings in the matter. At the request of the families &mdash; and I emphasise that it was at their request &mdash; I agreed to act for them and arranged for the commencement of legal proceedings at a later date by my former firm. Test cases in the matter were contested by the corporation all the way to the Supreme Court and families were awarded substantial amounts of compensation. The High Court and the Supreme Court both found that the health damage was very severe and the fault lay with Dublin Corporation. In addition to awarding compensation, the High Court ordered the removal of the offending heaters from affected homes.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that, to this day, not one of the families involved has ever received an apology from Dublin Corporation for that hurt and damage. It is also worth nothing that Dublin Corporation has never admitted that it was Dublin Corporation's own actions that led to the financial damages involved. The corporation was given ample opportunity over the years in both the political process and the legal process to minimise financial costs very considerably by taking steps to put the damage they had caused to rights or by settling those actions at a much earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The case made new law and was fought entirely in the public interest, as the facts make clear. I am appalled that any one who was not involved in the case should <Col N="207" /> be seeking to make points about the way it was handled as if to imply there was anything remotely underhanded about it. This would be the first time in 40 years practice as a member of the legal profession that anyone has ever made such a suggestion and I refute it utterly. Despite the fact that a very large number of clients were involved in the case, running into several hundred individuals and families, since my involvement in the case was concluded I have never once received a complaint in any form from anyone of those clients about the question of cost or about the issue of alleged conflict of interests. The allegation of touting was also never made to me by any client, quite the contrary. Over the years I have received many expressions of thanks from people who were the victims of Dublin Corporation and whose entire legitimate grievances were vindicated by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Some salient facts must be emphasised for the record and are as follows. First, litigation on the Concerva heaters case was only contemplated after many months of political representation by me and by other public representatives failed to persuade Dublin Corporation to take any interest in the legitimate grievances of the people concerned. That political representation included surveys and questionnaires to reveal and ascertain the extent of the problem, and countless letters and discussion with Dublin Corporation. I repeat no legal action was every contemplated in the matter until Dublin Corporation had flatly refused to deal with the political representations made.</P>
    <P>Second, I never at any stage touted for the business involved in that litigation. On the contrary, I was inundated by people who wished to see the matter pursued. All clients gave me the appropriate authorisation to pursue the case on their behalf. There was never any question of confict of interest in the matter; I have never been a member of Dublin Corporation, the defendants in the case. The litigation, in its early stages, involved the preparation and issuing of about 100 plenary summonses and the commissioning <Col N="208" /> of a great many engineer's reports and medical examinations and reports. All costs involved, running to many thousands of pounds, were borne by my former firm without any guarantee that they would be recovered. The High Court action on the test case lasted for some nine days and the clients involved were represented in court by two senior counsel, Mr. John Rogers SC and Mrs. Mary Robinson SC &mdash; both would, I imagine, be horrified to be told of the allegation that they were involved in a case based on touting. A subsequent appeal by the corporation to the Supreme Court lasted three days. Had my clients lost either case the substantial expense involved would not have fallen on them but on my former firm, and the clients were aware of that. At all stages of the proceedings the corporation was given ample opportunity to settle the cases. Even after the test case was won in the courts there was extensive work and hundreds of hours of negotiation with the corporation. Each case was individually negotiated and many of the negotiations involved senior counsel. Each case was the subject of a very substantial file.</P>
    <P>These are some of the basic facts of the case. As an consequence of the many hundreds of hours put into the case by a team of lawyers of my former office and support staff over a five year period it represents a case in which people who had been hurt and damaged by official activities were fairly and honourably vindicated. As I said, a Cheann Comhairle, I am appalled that anyone would seek to represent the Concerva heaters case in any way other than as a genuine, committed and ultimately successful effort to vindicate the hurt caused to citizens of Dublin through the due processes of the law.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> That Dáil Éireann, in view of the continuing campaign of slaughter and destruction in Northern Ireland and in view of the failure of those engaged in or supporting the campaign of violence to accept the Downing Street Declaration as a just basis for developing a political settlement, calls on the Government to make orders under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, in the same terms as applied until 19 January 1994, on a two-monthly basis until such time as those engaged in the campaign of violence and those who are in or associated with the organisations mentioned in the orders publicly commit themselves to an immediate and permanent cessation.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion comes at a significant point in the development of the peace process. In recent weeks it has become abundantly clear that the IRA does not intend to give any definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration in the short or medium term which, in this context, means in the coming weeks or months. It is simply not in the IRA's interest to give such a response. There is no downside in delay or prevarication. On the contrary, recent events have put and kept the IRA in a centre stage position. It has never been less isolated or more fully understood. Its viewpoint has never been more carefully parsed and analysed; it has never had such an opportunity to expound its point of view or its agenda. If sympathy, generosity of spirit and a willingness to listen have been absent in the past, they are not in short supply today. However, the killing goes on and the peace process is stalled.</P>
    <P>I have spoken thus far about the IRA rather than Sinn Féin because many people here are confused by Provo propaganda into believing that the IRA and Sinn Féin are separate but allied bodies drawing their support from similar bases. Nothing could be further from the truth. The IRA is the controlling element in the Provisional movement. Sinn Féin is not an independent political force. It is controlled and supervised by the leaders of the IRA at every level. It has no <Col N="210" /> independent mind of its own and aspires to none. It could not survive in present circumstances without the IRA. It cannot split from the IRA nor can it persuade the IRA. Its leaders cannot do so either. Sinn Féin is the face of the IRA, the mask behind which the IRA plans and dissembles. The pretence that Sinn Féin is a peace seeking political party that can act as a sympathetic interlocutor or intermediary for the IRA is entirely bogus. Adams and McGuinness are at the centre of the Provisional movement and they cannot and will not stand aside or apart from it. Sinn Féin is not the political ally of the IRA; it is the IRA playing at politics.</P>
    <P>It is our thesis and fixed conviction in the Progressive Democrats that allowing Sinn Féin access to the airwaves is allowing the IRA to use the airwaves. Events in the short period since 19 January demonstrate amply that access to the airwaves is, as we predicted, one way traffic for the IRA to flout the authority of the State, to attempt to rehabilitate murder and subversion as a political tactic and to attempt to build status and credibility for the IRA's armalite and ballot boxes strategy. If the ending of the section 31 order had been part of a linked process in which the Provisionals gave up violence, it would not really matter which step preceded the other. If face had to be saved to save lives, it would be arch of any politician to stand on some principled order of precedence, but there is no such linkage and all the signs are that there will be no such linkage in the short or medium term.</P>
    <P>The Provos do not accept the basis of the Downing Street Declaration and have indicated that they will not accept it. They do not want clarification; they want it changed by negotiation. The changes they seek are simple to understand although, for all their simplicity, they will not be expounded in public by Gerry Adams who prefers to demand a secret method of dialogue with the British Government. The Provos want Britain to indicate in principle that it will withdraw from the North. If they do not want a time frame for withdrawal they want a <Col N="211" />&ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date or a &ldquo;best before&rdquo; label put on the Unionist political aspiration. They have made it abundantly clear that they will not settle for less. In short, they will not accept that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland cannot change without the consent of a majority of its people.</P>
    <P>In so saying, they reject what the Dublin Government described as the cornerstone of the peace process. Instead, they are demanding that Britain should undermine and lever out that cornerstone, and all of this is to be disguised as what they term clarification. No such concession will be made because any such concession would tear apart the Northern communities, end the involvement of the Alliance Party and moderate Unionists in the peace process and pave the way to a terrible resurgence of polarised politics and the spectre of unprecedented intercommunal violence.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that we must judge the ending of the section 31 order. If the Provisionals were to renounce violence permanently within the next eight or ten weeks, the authority of this State could endure what is happening but if, as is obvious now, the Provisionals are hell bent on kicking out the fragile foundations of consensus in the Downing Street Declaration, on trampling down its fine balance and blasting away its central principles, we are faced with a major political and constitutional challenge which this State must face down. &ldquo;Clarification,&rdquo; their term, seems to be a process whereby we will see daylight through the remains of the Downing Street accord.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made every possible gesture he could properly make and several lapses which he ought not have made, the most recent on Sunday evening when he used the Provo-speak of &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo;. He painted the use of arms in Northern Ireland as a three cornered process and used language that drew no moral distinction whatsoever between the status of the security forces in Northern Ireland and that of the terrorist murderers there. That type of political body language is neither proper nor <Col N="212" /> helpful. It is based on an entirely false premise there is something in common between the security forces and the terrorists they are there to confront. That language devalues the office of Taoiseach and, worse still, it undermines trust with the Unionist community. If we are talking about trust building the Taoiseach must choose his words more carefully in future.</P>
    <P>The ongoing process of devaluation, political language and democratic authority in pursuit of compromise is fraught with danger but when it is being done in the face of the facts it is proving to be folly of the highest order. Truth, as usual, is the first casualty in this process. To suggest that there is not a whisker of difference between what we know of the Humes-Adams process and the Downing Street Declaration is false. Senior politicians who compare what is set out in paragraph 5 of the Downing Street Declaration with the stated position of Hume and Adams are making a fundamental error because paragraph 5 sets out the Taoiseach's viewpoint, not the British viewpoint.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Taoiseach, that paragraph states:</P>
    <P>He accepts, on behalf of the Irish Government that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland....</P>
    <P>In contrast, the British position is set out in paragraph 4 in terms which are crystal clear. That paragraph states the British Government has agreed that &mdash; and these are the important words &mdash; if it is the wish of the people of Ireland by agreement between the two parts respectively to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent freely and concurrently given, North and South, it is for the people of Ireland alone to choose to do so. The British acknowledge that such an agreement could, as of right, include the outcome of a united Ireland but &mdash; and this is the important point and one about which the Provos are well <Col N="213" /> aware &mdash; it equally follows that, in the absence of such an agreement or if such an agreement takes a different course, the majority in Northern Ireland for the time being may, within the terms of the Downing Street Declaration, choose to retain the link with the British indefinitely. That is something the Provos have said they will not wear and that is not the same as the Hume-Adams Agreement as we know it.</P>
    <P>It is futile to pretend that the circle can be squared. The British formulation in paragraph 4 is as far as the principle of national self-determination can be reconciled with the majoritarian principle set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unless and until the Provos accept that the only way forward is to accept a process built on the reality that the status of Northern Ireland is open both to Nationalist and Unionist aspiration and preference and that a majority of the people of the North will decide its constitutional linkage with Britain or with the South, there is no common ground between the Provisionals and even the most moderate Unionist opinion. There is no prospect in those circumstances for an inclusive peace process without such acceptance.</P>
    <P>On this fundamental issue the Provos must be faced down. On this they must be told there is no concession forthcoming. There is a danger that political coinage, such as, using the term &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo; which means murder, will go into wider circulation if, as it has been, it is used by TV interviewers to make their point or to engage in dialogue. There is also a danger that &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo; will convey the meaning the Taoiseach seemed to put on it the other day, that is, that the Dublin Government is no longer drawing a moral distinction between the security forces in Northern Ireland and the murder gangs which they face.</P>
    <P>If the Provisionals persist in their unrealistic and unattainable demands, every political gesture takes on a new significance. The concession that their armalite and ballot box strategy can be dealt with as just another political point <Col N="214" /> of view in the broadcast media is not a concession that any liberal democracy can afford to make.</P>
    <P>The path to peace in Northern Ireland lies primarily along the road of trust. Faced with the malign posture of Paisleyism, those who believe in creating trust must of necessity deal with the Alliance Party and the moderates among the official Unionists. Those parties in turn and their supporters deserve to be treated in good faith. If their constitutional aspiration is accorded even some legitimacy it should not be sacrificed in an attempt to persuade the Provos to stop murdering their way to political victory. If Ken Maginnis says that he feels betrayed by the section 31 decision, I will listen very carefully because I will be listening to a man whom the Provos have attempted to murder on a number of occasions. I will listen to Martin Smyth because he has spoken with reason and calm. We are denied the voice of people like Robert Bradford and Edgar Graham because they were butchered by the Provos. Strangely and somewhat sinisterly, the Democratic Unionists have never been subject to the same assassination tactics and it is not hard to see why.</P>
    <P>For the time being the IRA has given up killing elected politicians. For the time being the IRA has stopped killing building workers and contractors. For the time being the IRA has stopped killing children. That is all for the time being. It is only killing security force members now. It is killing RUC men and women if it can. It is killing British Army men and women if it can. To what end? To show the British Government that the Downing Street Declaration is not enough, to break the will of the British and to preserve the principle of majority determination in Northern Ireland. Adams in a recent radio interview with Jim Dougall of the BBC sought to explain and justify this change in the murder list of the Provos. Who does he think he is fooling?</P>
    <P>The leadership of Sinn Féin is centrally involved in all of this. It is the propaganda wing of the murder, the maiming and destruction. It is using the violence of the <Col N="215" /> Provisional IRA to further its political agenda. It claims a revolutionary mandate, not a popular democratic mandate, for its acts. It expects its barbarous violence to be retrospectively anointed by history.</P>
    <P>We in this House, on the other hand, must uphold the authority of democracy, the value of human lives and human rights and the basic legitimacy of democratic politics. We are charged by our mandates to reject and face down the combination of murder with politics. If any party in this House was using murder to achieve its political end, would we countenance it? If Members of this House faced the same fate or threat as Robert Bradford, Edgar Graham or John Taylor, would we allow our Taoiseach to speak of the legitimacy of the mandate of their murderers? If we had to search under our cars in the morning before we come to this place, if we had to fortify our homes to exist in our communities, if we had to have policemen to open up and search our clinics because there could be landmines in them, would we allow the people who pose that threat to us in this House and, indeed, a threat to our Constitution, access to the State broadcast TV or radio media? Would we allow them to be feather-dusted there by impartial reporters on the merits of their threat to this House and its Members? Let us not cod ourselves; we would not.</P>
    <P>It is an irony that the real partitionists in this House are to be judged by the extent to which they tolerate north of the Border violence and a threat to democratic values which would be snuffed out ruthlessly if it reared its ugly head and became tangible south of the Border. It is an irony that it is only north of the Border that that can be tolerated. If those things happened in our democracy, if one Member of this House was shot dead, there would be a radically different response from this Government. It is strange that the Border seems to seal us from feelings for the democratic values north of the Border and the people who are the practitioners of democracy up there. It is strange that our feelings and <Col N="216" /> our sense of duty stop at the Border. I wonder why those Deputies who are loudest in their condemnation of partition seem to have thrown a border across their duties to fellow Irishmen and the vindication of democracy in all parts of this island.</P>
    <P>I note with some disbelief that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, has claimed that the decision on section 31 was not affected or determined by the peace process. He may be speaking for himself but one thing is very clear, he was not speaking the political truth or for the rest of the Cabinet when he said that there may be some ivory tower in which he consults a mirror on the morality of censorship or the limits of liberalism, but if he is so out of touch with reality as to view the issue of whether section 31 should be renewed as having nothing to do with the peace process, it calls into question his judgment on the issue of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats do not believe that section 31 is, as the Minister seems to have believed for many years past, an issue of political censorship or an issue in which freedom of speech arises. When the National Union of Journalists in Ireland brought its case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, it was rejected as unstateable by the Commission of the European Court of Human Rights, even without a court hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 31 orders were not put in place to protect us from hearing the Provo message nor because successive Governments thought the great majority, or even a significant minority, of people were politically immature or gullible. They were put in place to uphold the authority of the State and the democratic basis of politics. They were put in place precisely because we require our broadcast media to be politically impartial. Impartiality and balance, which are statutory requirements of all the media, whether State owned or privately owned independent broadcasters, are not privileges available for those who use the media to undermine the State and to propagate the killing <Col N="217" /> of fellow Irish people nor are they available to those who seek to set aside the rule of law for the barbarism that the Provos &mdash; I refer to all of them, whether in suits or in combat jackets &mdash; have brought to these islands in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>If we believe in a regime of licensing the broadcast media, in requiring them to be political and impartial, and in prescribing by statute a code of impartiality by which they must abide, it follows that they are in an entirely different category from the print media of whom we do not make such demands. There have been specious arguments launched repeatedly by people asking why should RTE and broadcasters, be prevented from broadcasting material which any newspaper may print. Nobody says of any newspaper in this country that it has a duty to be impartial. Nobody licences the newspaper media here. Nobody tells a newspaper it has been unfair. There is no newspaper complaints tribunal, as there is a Broadcasting Complaints Tribunal, to redress the wrongs or to force newspapers to treat issues fairly. We have in our democracy newspapers that are privately owned and free, as the Minister well knows perhaps to his cost, to be as unfair as they choose, to put forward whatever viewpoint they choose and to lay whatever emphasis they wish. Nobody has ever proposed, and I hope nobody is proposing, that a system of State licensing of newspapers would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>However, in distinction, we say in relation to the broadcast media that they are too important to be left to private individuals to establish and run in accordance with their own prejudices, that they are two important for programme editors &mdash; the equivalent of individual columnists &mdash; to run programmes in accordance with their political prejudices. We say that the broadcasting media are too important to hand over to people who are under no duty of impartiality, fairness or balance. If that is true then it follows that there is a radical distinction between the print and broadcast media. It follows that, as a matter of Irish law, it is specious to say <Col N="218" /> that what applies to one must necessarily apply to the other.</P>
    <P>The proof of the pudding has been seen in the last fortnight. Skilled broadcasters, whose training and background taught them to be impartial, deferential to a point and polite to a fault, have been confronted with skilled, devious and determined propagandists for murder and they have not knocked a feather off them with their feather duster. They have made no impression whatsoever. The net effect of access of Sinn Féin to the airwaves in the last fortnight has been that they are becoming a part of the legitimate establishment of this country while holding on to the right to blow out someone's brains or to blow up children when it suits them. That is what has happened in the last week or two. That is why Gerry Adams is feted in New York, that is why there are cameras in RTE to welcome him, even at the door of the studio, when he goes to speak to Brian Farrell or David Davin-Power.</P>
    <P>All the deference and civilities that are shown to democratically elected people are being shown to people who are engaged in a murder campaign on this island. We have achieved nothing in the last fortnight which in any sense fulfils the great boasts made by the deprived broadcast media during the section 31 regime that they would be able to expose the falsity and barbarities of the Sinn Féin campaign. There has been no evidence whatsoever that they have made any progress in denting the IRA's status or standing in the community. However, there is clear evidence that we have set in train a process for which the Government, by the foolish error it made in lifting the section 31 ban, must take considerable responsibility; we have put in train a process whereby the use of murder as part of politics is no longer seen as a stigma which deprives those people who use both murder and politics to achieve their end access to the democratically controlled media. People will become progressively numbed to seeing on their screens those who engage in murder, talking not merely about their campaign of murder but about every other subject <Col N="219" /> under the sun. We are normalising and institutionalising Sinn Féin's presence in our broadcast media and that will have the effect, as time goes by, of numbing people to the reality of the barbarities of the Sinn Féin-IRA campaign.</P>
    <P>Those who claimed that the section 31 orders prevented us from knowing the truth have been confounded utterly by the experience of the last fortnight. For the Provos the victory is simply being on television and radio. They have been kept to less than 2 per cent support in recent Irish elections, and rightly so. What is the difference between them and the Nazis in Germany or the extreme right in countries such as France? The difference is that this country has taken a stance based on the moral authority of democracy to deny these people equality of status with constitutional politicians, and it has been successful. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. They have, within our democracy, been kept to a small lunatic fringe status. However, this is capable of being thrown away by what I suggest is the unwarranted folly of this Government in making a gesture to the Provisional movement in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The IRA has a deep rooted contempt from human rights. That organisation has killed hundreds of people. Sometimes we forget those circumstances, but surely now and then we can recall the horror of the RUC men who have been blown up in their cars outside their homes. What about the wives and children who see the aftermath of those explosions? These events merit a tiny fraction of the newsprint that is accorded to the tortuous meanderings of Mr. Adams' political thought process in some of our newspapers. When an RUC man is blown up the story gets only a few column inches in the papers. Will RTE interview that man's widow? Will the full horror of what happened ever be conveyed to the people of the Republic? No. I defy people in this House to recall the widows and families of UDR men, RUC men and British Army men who have been interviewed in the same probing way about the extent <Col N="220" /> of their loss and grief as have many other victims of violence in Northern Ireland. It strikes me as grotesque and obscene that even our newspapers of record which devote half pages to long, meandering statements of justification for this murder campaign, consider that the families who are destroyed by barbarities, the people who are murdered and tortured by the IRA, merit far less coverage than the people who are directing the political face of the campaign that is doing so much evil.</P>
    <P>Do we need to be reminded of what happens to those whose conscience gets the better of them and inform the police about planned murders? We should remember that they are regularly stripped naked, hooded, tortured in unspeakable ways, shot through the head and dumped by their murdering former colleagues in ditches along country roads near the Border. That is the IRA at war and Sinn Féin is the IRA playing politics. The people who direct the Sinn Féin political thrust are the same people who take part in planning the campaign that deals with its dissidents in that way. Those are the rights about which this State and this Oireachtas should be concerned, not a specious and entirely fallacious view &mdash; the European Commission on Human Rights rightly found &mdash; that the human right of freedom of speech was in some sense curtailed by section 31.</P>
    <P>We cannot excuse the bombings at Enniskillen, La Mon, Guildford and Birmingham, nor can we excuse Adams or McGuinness of the moral blame for the killing of Robert Bradford and Edgar Graham and the attempted murder of Ken Magennis. Their view of democracy is that those who stand in their way can be blown out of their way.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is true, and I accept, that the evil IRA campaign was conceived in circumstances of injustice and hatred. Of course it is true that there have been enormous wrongs done in Northern Ireland. I am conscious as is my party, that we always remember the killing by the Army in Northern Ireland, all the torture at Palace Barracks, all the beatings carried out at Castlereagh, all the <Col N="221" /> miscarriages of justice in Britain and Ireland, all the harrassment and all the repression that has taken place, but they are grist to the mill of the IRA. Such is the nature of political terror: it feeds off injustice, it creates injustice, it draws forth injustice, and all to propagate further injustice. It is to the remedying of such injustices that every political sinew of ours must be strained.</P>
    <P>There is no injustice on this island that could possibly justify another person to be killed, another person to be maimed, blinded, paralysed, scarred or bereaved, or to be a young witness to such barbarities. There is no moral, legal or political right &mdash; I say this particularly to the Minister in the House &mdash; to claim that these acts are right, excusable or merely regrettable but necessary or inevitable. There is no constitutional right to organise politically in support of, or in conjunction with, such barbarities. There is no constitutional freedom to propagate the destruction of others under the protection of the law, directly or indirectly. On the contrary, this State is under a clear constitutional duty, legal and moral, to protect people from the IRA wherever they are on this island and to suppress and to prevent the strategy of the armalite and the ballot box. The phrase &ldquo;the strategy of the armalite and the ballot box&rdquo; needs some consideration because I believe that neither the armalite nor the ballot box &mdash; I use those words advisedly &mdash; should be available to anyone who will use both together.</P>
    <P>It is not the fate of liberals to have to falter, to implode or to fall on their own political swords when they are confronted with political violence. The section 31 orders were not repression. Under our Constitution the airwaves were, are and will be available equally to every person in Ireland provided they are not engaged in the systematic extinguishment of other people's right to life. That minimum standard of access to the airwaves is not censorship; it is vindication of people's human rights &mdash; the right to life and the right to freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>It is false, and has always been false, for Members of this House and for a <Col N="222" /> minority of people to portray the section 31 issue in terms of political censorship. It is not, and never has been, the case that the people of Ireland have been under any misconception as to what the Provos believe or what they are about. They are a group of men and women who have set about the destruction of the State in which they operate but they are also a group of people who have on their agenda, when they are finished that work, to set about the same work in this State. That is their stated political agenda and it cannot be obfuscated, dressed up or manicured into any different message. A liberal democracy owes nobody who is about the business and the business of murder the privilege of propagating their views in the media which it is required by law to control and keep impartial. A liberal democracy owes nobody such a duty; a liberal democracy owes everybody the duty to prevent that from happening.</P>
    <P>During the Adjournment Debate on the Downing Street Declaration before the Christmas recess the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the House that one of the factors which affected his judgment and that of the Government in relation to an extension of section 31 was that the orders under that Act could not be made for any period of less than one year. That is false. The Act, as amended by the 1976 Act, makes it very clear that orders under the Act could be made for any period up to a year, and that includes any lesser period. There is a basis in law for what the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs told this House, and I am surprised he has never taken the opportunity to correct the impression he created on the last day of the last Dáil term. I am surprised he has not informed the House that the advice he tendered to the House about the legal implications of section 31, as amended, were incorrect and that it was possible for him to make orders of a lesser duration than 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that if the Provisional IRA gives up and renounces permanently the use of violence on every part of this island, they <Col N="223" /> and anybody else who is so minded should have access to the airwaves on an equal basis with the rest of the community. The Progressive Democrats believes the converse; until the Provisionals give up murdering people they are not entitled to use the airwaves of this country to propagate their point of view. It is not simply a point of view, it is an opinion that kills. It is not simply one of a number of political points of view which it is equally legitimate under our Constitution to hold that you can use murder to further your political aims. On the contrary, it is a viewpoint which the Constitution enjoins upon the State to keep off the airwaves and to keep out of the media to the extent that it subverts the authority of the State. It is not a matter of the Constitution being neutral as regards protecting the authority of the State. There is in Article 40 a clear direction to the Government and the State to prevent the media from being used for the propagation of subversive propaganda.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Progressive Democrats have not come into the House to suggest the reinstatement of section 31 because we want to drive a hard bargain with the IRA. We have not come in here to suggest that section 31 should be reinstated because, on balance, we feel an error was made on 19 January. We have come into the House to seek the reinstatement of the orders under section 31 because events of recent weeks have demonstrated beyond contradiction that the IRA intends, so far as it can, to give no response to the Downing Street Declaration, to parade its objections to the Downing Street Declaration in public and to parade its process of consultation among members as though it were a legitimate process of consultation within a political party. It is no such thing, and nobody should be fooled by the nature of what is going on at present. Adams and McGuinness have a clear agenda &mdash; to prevaricate, to delay and to avoid making any clear commitment to the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>In the euphoria of the public reception <Col N="224" /> for the Downing Street Declaration the Government made a decision that it would make a gesture of goodwill to the Provos, an indication, perhaps, of what would happen if they were to give up violence in the expectation that that is what they were about to do. However, the reality is that that generous gesture has turned out to be a gesture which, in the last analysis, will be seen as being generous with other people's lives.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats reject the proposition that section 31 was ever an issue of political censorship; we believe it is a matter of the State upholding its authority; we believe it is a matter of democratic politicians vindicating the values of political democracy. Therefore, we call upon the Government and the Members of this House to reverse the error they made on 19 January and to put back in place the proper protections for the authority of this State and the vindication of human rights throughout this island which were in place, which were effective, which were appropriate, which were proportionate and which should never have been taken away.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising the maturity of the Irish people, welcomes the Government decision not to renew the order under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Acts, 1960 to 1993 and expresses confidence in the professionalism of Irish broadcast media journalists in carrying out their responsibilities in compliance with the terms of Article 40 of the Constitution, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 and current broadcasting legislation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Gallagher <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i> and McDaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude towards the making of statutory orders under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993 has been clear and consistent down the years since the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 which gave this statutory power to the Minister of the day. Deputies, if they wish, may refer to my contribution to the debate on that Act in the Seanad. I believed then as I do now that the potential abuse of freedom is no excuse for repression.</P>
      <P>I listened with great care to what Deputy Michael McDowell said and I respect the views he holds. I note he does not respect the views I hold with the same enthusiasm. I also note suggestions in his speech that were exercises in casuistry and in moral innuendo, that is when he referred to my motivation for bringing forward a recommendation that the order not be renewed. I also listen carefully to those who ask how we defend and define rights.</P>
      <P>The most recent order made under section 31 (1), which was allowed to lapse on 19 January 1994, was signed shortly before the present Government was formed and therefore before I took up office. Since my appointment as Minister with responsibility for the matter I have not concealed my lack of enthusiasm for the type of restrictions imposed on broadcasters by the existence of the order. I made it absolutely clear that I would not automatically recommend to Government that the order be renewed when the matter came up for consideration towards the end of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have used the time to review this matter in all its complexity. A fundamental difference between Deputy McDowell and me is that he sees the public as inevitable victims of television; I believe they are mature viewers capable of arriving at a decision. These are matters upon which people differ but I have never said it is a simple black and white decision and I have consulted widely with interested parties with differing views on <Col N="226" /> the matter. I have discussed it with my Cabinet colleagues, particularly those who would see an impact on their own statutory responsibilities. I have been available during Question Time to share with this House the shape of my thinking during the course of an extensive and careful review of the issue. Finally, I presented proposals to Government and on my recommendation the Government, taking all relevant factors into account, decided that the order which was made last year should be allowed to lapse when it expired on 19 January last.</P>
    <P>I must reject at once another view that I have seen written and heard expressed that I and the Government have acted in some undemocratic way in making this decision. As I have already said, I have answered extensive questions on this matter in the House. The Oireachtas, through the enactment of the provisions of section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 &mdash; which inserted the current provisions in section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 &mdash; has entrusted the Minister of the day with the power of making an order under this section. Both the Oireachtas and the Minister of the day are entrusted with the power to extend the period during which the current order remains in force. Despite the fact that I made my position clear on a number of occasions that the order under section 31 would not be automatically renewed, some Members chose that I should not exercise this power. It is clear that my actions in this matter, in exercising my democratically accorded statutory functions which have been traditionally exercised with the approval of the Government, have been totally in accord with the democratic process. Indeed I believe I saved them from some embarrassment by not replying directly saying that they had lost their opportunity. They wanted the recall of the Dáil which would have simply pointed out to them that when they had an opportunity they chose not to use it.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the Government decision not to renew the section 31 order has been portrayed by <Col N="227" /> some in the narrow context of the effect this will have in relation to one group or another. Criticisms have been levelled along the lines that by allowing the order to lapse, this will give a platform to those who wish to support or justify a campaign of violence and murder. The wording of the motion before us is a case in point.</P>
    <P>This criticism ignores two fundamental points. The core issue, as far as I was and am concerned, is not whether Sinn Féin <i>per se</i> or any other group covered by the order is allowed access to the Irish air waves. My recommendation to Government that the order be allowed to lapse is about expressing confidence in the maturity of Irish people and about their right to see and hear comprehensive news and current affairs coverage that is essential to support a fair and informed national debate on issues of national importance, to hear all views and shades of opinion and thereafter to make up their minds on the issues involved. It is a basic issue of freedom of information and expression versus censorship.</P>
    <P>I have heard the argument that censorship is invoked to serve a higher category of rights and the assumption is that the public cannot draw distinctions between arguments and nuances of arguments. I choose not to have a determinist view of the impact of television, to trust the public and also to regard the basic right of access to information as one that is essential in a democratic set of practices of communication.</P>
    <P>The second fundamental point ignored by the critics and the tone of the Opposition motion is to ignore the existence of sections 17 and 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Acts, section 9 of the Independent Radio and Television Act, 1988 and the provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 which have applied and which will continue to apply to all broadcasters as well as others.</P>
    <P>Can anyone seriously believe that the comprehensive coverage in the print media, which is unrestricted by any specific statutory provisions along the lines of that which has applied to broadcasters, of the tragic events in Northern Ireland <Col N="228" /> over the last 25 years has been a bad thing? Has it contributed to a prolongation of the agony? Would anyone seriously argue that this coverage has not improved our understanding of the situation there? How, therefore, can anyone seriously believe that access to such information and reportage through our broadcast media will result in the undermining of the authority of the State or lead to an upsurge in public support for the men of violence? Irish print media journalists have, in the main, an honourable and valuable tradition in their reporting of and expression of opinions on this issue. I see no reason to believe that the broadcast media, freed of the restrictions of the section 31 order, cannot perform the same vital function and enhance our understanding of events in Northern Ireland. In virtually every article, speech or commentary on broadcasting these days, we hear about the revolution that is taking place in telecommunications technology which is providing options for a diversity of programmes, views and services to every home in the world. To my mind, it is high time that we allowed this technology to assist us more completely in our attempts to understand and to find the way to peace on our own island. To some extent, at least, this is to put these breathtaking technologies at the service of the people rather than at the service of those who see television and radio as simply an effective means of selling us their goods and services. With the existing corpus of statutory constraints that continue in force for broadcasters it is not, as the motion before the House suggests, to put the broadcast media at the service of the men of violence, as if I were handing like an advertising manager, the national media to a group of people who did not believe in democracy but who condoned murder.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what has actually happened here. On the one hand, the Government has decided, on my recommendation, that the Order under section 31 should be allowed to lapse. On the other hand the RTE Authority has to abide by the provisions of sections 17 and 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, <Col N="229" /> 1960 as amended by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976. Section 17 provides that in performing its functions the RTE Authority shall in its programming, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (1A) of the Broadcasting Authority Act prohibits the RTE Authority from including in any of its broadcasts anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State. Section 9 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 places similar prohibitions on independent radio stations operated under the auspices of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The fundamental difference between section 18 (1A) and the terms of an order under section 31 (1) is that, in the first case, it is the responsibility of the RTE Authority and the independent radio operators to decide what contravenes the law whereas, in the second case, the Minister forms his opinion on what should not be broadcast and imposes a statutory ban. In addition, we have the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 which prohibits a broadcast which is intended to or likely to stir up hatred. It is my view that the public good is sufficiently protected by these provisions which remain in place and that it is unnecessary for a Minister to be dictating to a broadcasting authority what is unfit to be transmitted.</P>
    <P>One of the first Bills which I initiated when I became Minister was the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993 which was debated in the House not too long ago. I can remember that most of the Deputies who took part in the <Col N="230" /> debate on that Bill referred very positively to the contribution made by RTE to our way of life and how it had changed. Many Deputies from all sides of the House spoke in particularly glowing tones about the hugely positive impact which the fledgling independent radio sector had made in a few short years in giving local perspectives on national and international news stories and as important avenues of expression of local culture and values. I agreed &mdash; and still do &mdash; with most of these views. However, I must put the question: what has happened in the eight months or so since this Act was passed? Why are we now not prepared to trust these very same broadcasters to behave responsibly and to obey the law? The time has come to let them shoulder their full responsibility as broadcast journalists.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the fear of change expressed by the Deputies who have tabled this motion. After all, RTE has not operated without either a statutory order or a statutory direction being in force in this area for 20 years. Therefore, it is not surprising that there would be resistance to change but I believe that their fears are groundless.</P>
    <P>Let us, for the purposes of this debate, look at the section 31 order within the context of the tragic conflict in Northern Ireland. One of the difficulties with a debate of this nature is that it is impossible to quantify the effect of the existence of the Order for over 20 years on the Northern Ireland situation in any definite way. We cannot say categorically that it has contributed in any way to a lessening of violence in Northern Ireland. Indeed it is perhaps worth noting that at present a majority of the population of Northern Ireland cannot receive RTE television programmes.</P>
    <P>There are those who seem to believe that the removal of the Order will allow those who support violence and murder an uncritical platform from which to justify and to generate support for their abominable atrocities committed in the name of both communities on this island. Those of us who take the view I do condemn those atrocities unconditionally <Col N="231" /> and unequivocally. Those who want to use the orders under section 31 as some instrument have no monopoly of moral outrage. There are also those who have believed that the existence of the orders has led over the years to an unhealthy reluctance on the part of journalists to investigate and report on the issues fully for fear of breaching the provisions of the Order. They argue that this reluctance has frustrated sections of the community in Northern Ireland as they can see no avenue for expressing their legitimately held views. In short, some would argue that the orders have at least contained the violence while others would claim that the conflict has been exacerbated as a result.</P>
    <P>For my part, I find it difficult to be convinced that the existence of the orders and directions over the past 20 years has contributed in any meaningful way to the securing of peace in Northern Ireland. There is also the anomaly that an ever increasing number of households on this side of the Border have access to United Kingdom television services where, until quite recently, there was no ban on the appearance of representatives of organisations covered by the order under Section 31 and where since the ban has been imposed broadcasters have devised ingenious ways to circumvent the spirit, if not the letter of the ban. I am not convinced that access by an ever increasing number of viewers in this part of the island to United Kingdom services has led to any increase in support for organisations covered by the section 31 Order.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that our population has become more mature and sophisticated over the past 20 years as is evidenced by our questioning of previously strongly and even rigidly held views about social and moral issues. We have come to realise that not everything can be painted in terms of black and white. Tolerance and compassion have come into our understanding of how we have to live with one another on this island. This growth in understanding has allowed us to see the representatives of those organisations engaged in or supporting violence <Col N="232" /> for what they are. The vast majority of the population would probably welcome the opportunity to see and hear representatives of these organisations being subjected to rigorous scrutiny and being asked to justify their actions on our radio and television services. The vast majority of the population are clearly revolted by the atrocities perpetrated in the name of Ireland by many organisations covered under the Order and supported, or at least condoned, by their political wings. We have seen in recent years a desire for peace that cannot and will not be frustrated by the men of violence.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989. This Act makes it an offence to broadcast material intended to, or likely to, stir up hatred.</P>
    <P>In July 1993, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reported on Ireland's compliance with the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which Ireland ratified in 1989. The Order made under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act was brought to the attention of the committee by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties. In its final comments issued at the end of July the Human Rights Committee stated that</P>
    <P>the prohibition on interviews with certain groups outside the borders by the broadcast media infringes upon the freedom to receive and impart information under Article 19, Paragraph 2, of the Covenant.</P>
    <P>The option proposed in the motion before the House, that of the recurring renewal for short periods until those prohibited by the order renounce violence is one which I considered briefly and I have to say, rejected. To accept the proposal in the motion is to refuse to take a decision and to allow an organisation such as Sinn Féin to set the agenda of the Government &mdash; in broadcasting matters &mdash; as to its attitude to the fundamental question of principle on censorship of broadcast news and current affairs. It is far better to grasp this nettle firmly now and to make a decision rather than dither <Col N="233" /> on from month to month wondering if a particular organisation will allow us place our trust in the people and in our professional journalists. That is the nub of the matter this evening.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Minister with responsibility for broadcasting policy, that censorship of news and current affairs coverage is unacceptable. While I am cognisant of the views expressed in the Supreme Court judgment in 1982 which referred to the obligations imposed on the State by Article 40 (6) of the Constitution, I believe that the current situation is not such that warrants the State intervening directly to determine what may or may not be broadcast. The Oireachtas has imposed a responsibility on the RTE Authority and the operators of independent broadcasting stations to ensure that nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State. This statutory responsibility should now be exercised by the RTE Authority and the independent sector. Accordingly, I proposed to Government that the Order in force until 19 January 1994 should be allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite clear about my thinking here. I fully subscribe to the provisions of Article 40 (6) of the Constitution which guarantees the liberty of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions but also imposes an obligation on the State to endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. I accept wholeheartedly that television and radio services must not be used to justify murder or to incite others to violence. It is my contention that the State's constitutional obligations are fully met by current broadcasting legislation and the provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, which I mentioned earlier, and that there is no longer sufficient justification for Orders under section 31. In the unlikely event that our broadcast media journalists are somehow hoodwinked into allowing their programmes <Col N="234" /> to be used in an illegal fashion, the power to introduce an order remains. Unlike the proposers of the motion before the House, I am confident that no such need will arise.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that I do not see myself as some kind of watchdog vetting every news and current affairs programme to search out possible abuses of these new freedoms. The RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission have been established by Acts of the Oireachtas as the custodians of the airwaves on behalf of the nation. They have been given statutory responsibilities and duties and are autonomous in these areas. They, in their wisdom, have drawn up guidelines on the operation of the relevant legislative provisions. It is the responsibility of both organisations to monitor and ensure adherence to their guidelines. It will also be their responsibility to amend or revise them if they consider it necessary to do so in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission is charged with the investigation of complaints of alleged breaches of the legislation and it is important to stress this point &mdash; the commission will investigate alleged breaches of legislation rather than guidelines. As I said, it will be up to the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission to adjudicate on the adequacy of their guidelines in the light of experience. The kernel of the matter is that, in a democracy, the Government should not have to intervene in the detail of broadcast programmes, particularly news and current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there have been some interviews broadcast recently which would not have been permitted if the section 31 order had been renewed. I do not wish to place too much emphasis on the content of these interviews or on the individual or organisation involved. Without wishing to impinge in any way on the autonomy for our broadcasters, it is safe to say that these interviews have ranged from what could reasonably be described as a publicity stunt on the part of one broadcaster, regardless of the contents <Col N="235" /> of the interview itself, to the normal integration of such interviews in news and current affairs programming. It is inevitable that the first such interviews will excite a certain element of novelty interest and comment. I would expect that within a very short time, decisions by broadcasters as to whether interviews with spokespersons representing organisations covered by the order will be taken in accordance with standard editorial judgment regarding the relevance and importance of what these people have to say.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to acknowledge the possibility that in the future there may well be one or two occasions where a particular programme or contribution to a programme may give cause for concern. If such instances occur, I ask Deputies to bear in mind an extract from a report made by the Federal Communications Commission, which regulated broadcasting in the United States, as far back as 1949 which says:</P>
    <P>. . . the standard of public interest is not so rigid that an honest mistake or error of judgement on the part of a licensee (this means a broadcaster) will be condemned where his overall record demonstrates a reasonable effort to provide a balanced presentation of comment and opinion...</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to share the confidence expressed in this extract in our maturity, judgment and competence and I urge them to take the opportunity to express similar confidence in the people by supporting my amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I oppose the motion but support the amendment proposed by the Minister. The motion proposed by the Progressive Democrats is ill-conceived in its understanding of the purposes of broadcasting and access to the airwaves and the current negotiations on the future of this island on the basis of the Downing Street Declaration. Under the terms of the motion access to the airwaves is to be used as a carrot and stick with which to alternatively <Col N="236" /> coax and beat certain organisations into changing their views. They could do this by proposing an extension of the broadcasting ban on a two monthly basis until they make certain commitments, and by doing so they fail to recognise that this approach has failed for almost two decades. Neither is this the purpose for which our radio and television stations were established.</P>
      <P>Article 40 of the Constitution guarantees liberty subject to public order and morality for the exercise of the rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. Such a right is too important to be used as a tool in a game of cat and mouse as proposed in the motion. Furthermore, a simple reintroduction of the broadcasting ban as it existed until January would ignore the High Court and Supreme Court decisions in the O'Toole case. The nub of the problem is that this motion proposes to limit rights guaranteed under the Constitution, not because of what a person may say but because he is supposed to belong to a certain organisation. This is a ham-fisted and patronising approach and encourages laziness and a lack of discrimination in broadcasting and listeners alike. It harks back to the mentality espoused by many in this country in former times that your betters know best and it is still being promoted by certain guardians of democracy in this House who consider that they should be the judges of what the people are fit to hear and see. Limiting the constitutional right to freedom of expression should only be done in exceptional circumstances and for reasons of what people say rather than who they are or the organisation to which they belong. This is clearly provided for in section 18 of the Broadcasting Act and the guidelines laid down by the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission since the section 31 order lapsed give effect to this while still allowing, as far as possible, freedom of expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Granted, it imposes greater obligations on broadcasters and challenges listeners and viewers to be more critical and discriminating. What is wrong with that in <Col N="237" /> a democracy? Most people I met who heard Gerry Adams in recent days have been well able to form critical opinions of his views and would very much welcome a chance to put those views to him or to have them put on their behalf. The ban gave people such as Gerry Adams an aura of mystique which tended to elevate their importance and turn the journalists who reported on them or the actors who imitated them into oracles to be consulted for a sign of what the mysterious creature might mean. Thank God that day is gone and we may now find the deities are mere mortals like ourselves.</P>
    <P>The motion is ill-conceived in that it tries to link the abolition of the broadcasting ban with acceptance of the Downing Street Declaration which was welcomed by a wide range of opinion inside and outside this House. We know that strong efforts are being made to have the declaration accepted by Sinn Féin and for the commencement of genuine talks on the future of this island. In the process leading to the Downing Street Declaration I am sure many things were worried about but I am fairly confident that section 31 was the least of these, if it figured at all. Similarly, the current efforts in regard to Sinn Féin are proceeding on the basis of the inherent merits of the declaration and on whether Sinn Féin and its supporters can be convinced that their aspirations can be pursued via this framework. I do not believe that Sinn Féin's acceptance of the declaration will be enhanced either by the promise of reward by way of non-renewal of the ban or by the threat of its reimposition. The process is much larger and more complex than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very real danger that there will be a steady erosion of this State as a result of the removal of section 31 and the access to the airwaves by Sinn Féin. The Supreme Court said that the IRA and Sinn Féin are one. If this is the case, despite the protestations of Gerry Adams, then what we are seeing on the airwaves over the past weeks since the removal of section 31 is a new PR drive by an organisation with violence <Col N="238" /> and criminality as an integral part of its political agenda.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence from the interviews I heard so far of the radical new agenda of Sinn Féin. What I have heard is a disturbing, old style rhetoric. I get a feeling, from the interviews, of a predestined outcome, not of a man or a party approaching the situation with any real investment to self-determination of the people of this island, but a calm, cold certainty that their way is the way. The lines used are persuasive in their simplicity. According to Gerry Adams, the &ldquo;British occupation&rdquo; is itself sufficient justification for the &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo;; simple, appealing and wrong, ignoring completely the fact that Ulster Protestants have been rooted in this land for nearly four centuries with their families, traditions, expectations and civil rights.</P>
      <P>All of that can be so easily glossed away in the emotive phrases of a practised politician, because &mdash; let us make no bones about it &mdash; Gerry Adams is a practised politician; a practised speaker who knows how to persuade and how to survive debate and a man, above all else, who is possessed of a frighening undemocratic certainty. That certainty and practised eloquence are profound challenges to the democratic discourse. I believe those challenges have been met with a certain unpreparedness in our reaction to section 31.</P>
      <P>We should be addressing the real credibility conferred on Gerry Adams by inclusion in mainstream programming politicians who, despite their limitations and faults, have always been committed to democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been little examination of the problem of constitutional politicians who do not believe they should share a platform with Gerry Adams because they believe it would provide him &mdash; as a man who has not renounced violence &mdash; with a normality and acceptability we should not extend to those who promote violence. Instead, the removal of section 31 has, first, put Gerry Adams centre-stage, positioned him as the visiting celebrity whose interviews are to be fought for and <Col N="239" /> promoted, and turned him into a figure of glamour and interest.</P>
    <P>It seems that the holding of centre-stage by Gerry Adams in the past few weeks has blurred in a worrying way the most progressive stance outlined in the Joint Declaration which envisages and sets a framework for us living together on this island, where there will be &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; for Nationalists and Unionists alike and the other areas mentioned in the Joint Declaration and the further development of North-South institutions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the fact that Mr. Adams got a visa to visit the United States resulted in a United States audience being prevented from hearing the views of constitutional party leaders from the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Belfast last week it became clear to me once again that if we are to solve the problems on this island we have to take great care to be extremely balanced in our approach to both the Unionist and Nationalist perspective. I am concerned that this balance has been upset by the removal of section 31 and the unfolding saga of Sinn Féin's access to the airwaves. At this extremely delicate time I am worried that this will push the balance away from the possibility of peace and back into the neverending saga of violence.</P>
    <P>We must strive continuously to keep the balance and move towards peace. The decision to remove section 31 at this time may prove to have been easy and popular but ill-timed and ill-judged. I worry that Gerry Adams on prime time television in the United States will be putting forward a view of the Joint Declaration which is not an accurate view, and because of the publicity surrounding the granting of this visa his view will be the view that will get most prominence.</P>
    <P>There are some questions I should like to ask. Can Sinn Féin-IRA move towards peace given the level of criminality with which that organisation is involved? I also question whether the granting of this visa to Mr. Adams will erode the delicate consensus on the Joint Declaration currently <Col N="240" /> in place. Will the Ulster Unionist Party be further undermined and marginalised and will we see greater support emerging for the more extremist DUP in the North of Ireland?</P>
    <P>We should not be so desperate in our efforts for peace that we lose sight of the unfolding dangers of the central position which is being given to Gerry Adams. How many further concessions will there be before the balance is tilted too far?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his press release announcing the changes in relation to section 31 mentioned that he had got the RTE guidelines and that he was awaiting guidelines from the Independent Radio and Television Commission. Is the Minister happy with the variation in these guidelines? Can he spell out how he intends to monitor the situation, as he said he would when he made the announcement of the change in relation to section 31, although I notice in his speech tonight that he has made some variations on that? Let us also hear what Gerry Adams has to say to the Taoiseach's analysis about the State's international obligation on self-determination. Can Sinn Féin consistently ignore this? Is it really the British Government that Gerry Adams is still calling on to clarify, or is it that he does not wish to hear the clarifications coming from our democratically elected Government here on the future; the Government which has the support of the Opposition parties on this Joint Declaration? The Joint Declaration also has the support of the parties in Northern Ireland with which the vast majority, both the Nationalists and Unionists, consistently vote.</P>
    <P>It now seems that Sinn Féin must clarify their position and listen to what Irish people North and South are saying. They must be aware that the exercising of this right of self-determination on this island, for the vast majority of people on this island, does not include the use of violence. It is clear to me that Sinn Féin do not like the questions being asked and instead of answering are distracting. The lack of the democratic mandate of Sinn <Col N="241" /> Féin stands more and more starkly illus-trated in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration lays ground rules for affecting change up to and including a united Ireland but does not specify what change will take place. It has been said it is like the electoral law, it tells you how elections are conducted but not who will win. Sinn Féin-IRA know very well what is meant by the following statement in which the means of achieving a united Ireland are clearly spelt out.</P>
    <P>The British Government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right to self-determination on the basis of consent freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>They do not accept that consent in the North is necessary before British withdrawal and they reject the constitutional guarantee reiterated by Britain in the Joint Declaration. They want Britain to state an intention to withdraw and to persuade or &ldquo;force&rdquo; the Unionists to accept some form of all-Ireland government. In other words they want their strategic objective conceded as a precondition, irrespective of the reality of the lives of the two communities. Mr. Adams is constantly seeking clarification but withholding, as Deputy John Bruton has said repeatedly, specific questions about it.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, I believe the lack of specific questions illustrates the reality of the position of Sinn Féin-IRA. Let us not forget &mdash; Deputy Michael McDowell reminded us tonight &mdash; the violence, injury and destruction that has been caused by paramilitaries on both sides. Now is not the time to take decisions which support extremes on either side. For this reason Fine Gael fully supports the motion put forward by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Peace is the prime objective in a country committed to an inclusive culture on this island, inclusive of difference. We <Col N="242" /> have to be willing to change Articles 2 and 3, willing to move on social issues and willing to build an Ireland that is genuinely pluralist and inclusive. What we have seen in the past number of weeks, shorn of all the hype, is a depressing return to a much more narrow, excluding vision.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>The failure to renew the section 31 ban damages the peace process. I honestly believe that it reduces the prospect for peace on this island, that is why I so strongly support this motion and the reason I am so critical of the Government's decision.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear that one of the continuing objectives of Sinn Féin-IRA has been to obtain access to the airwaves. I am not saying they will decide to accept the Joint Declaration just for that purpose, but it is one of their objectives. They have achieved that objective without renunciation of violence. They are not in from the cold but at least they have one of the prizes which would be available to them on coming in from the cold. The follow on from that is access by the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, to the United States. Let us be quite clear about it. It was a natural follow-on to the failure to renew the section 31 order. I have no doubt that the Irish Government was consulted and raised no objection to a visa being issued to Mr. Adams. How could the Irish Government raise an objection at this stage? How could there be an objection when the Irish Government allowed the Sinn Féin President access to our national television and radio? It was just a further objective achieved, a further prize in hand, without a renunciation of violence. This process damages the prospects for peace because if one removes all the incentives, why should they bother renouncing violence? Will their attitude not be to continue on and on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two aspects to this question which it is important to bear in mind in the light of the Minister's speech. There is the issue of the ban, and I do not <Col N="243" /> accuse the Minister, Deputy Higgins, of inconsistency in this regard because he always objected to it but the same cannot be said about any of his Government colleagues. This may be an indication of the powers of persuasion of the Minister but it certainly does not indicate common sense among his colleagues in Government. That aspect must be looked at separately but a more crucial aspect is the effect on the peace process of the failure to renew the ban. For 20 years every major party in the State supported the ban. There is a fundamental principle of law going back to Cicero or Plato &mdash;<i>Salus populus suprema est lex</i>&mdash; that the safety of the State is the first law. In that context the original argument developed that those who seek to undermine the State should not be given access to the airwaves to carry out their mission. A group that does not even recognise the State was denied access to the airwaves. Why should sensible people or the Government of a democratic State give access to the airwaves to those who would undermine the State, who do not even accept its legitimacy? Through the years, but particularly in recent years, there has been much violence in Northern Ireland. There has also been violence in the South. Have we forgotten Senator Billy Fox, Garda Morley and all their colleagues who were killed on this side of the Border? That is not to say the decision should have been made just because of violence on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between the proposers of the motion and the Government as to what this ban is all about. The Minister, Deputy Higgins, talks about it being a question of the basic issue of freedom of information and expression versus censorship. That is where we part company. I do not see that as the issue. The issue, as far as I am concerned, is whether Sinn Féin, the IRA, or the groups covered by the order, were to be allowed access to the airwaves to spread their message of violence and to be given an opportunity to dispense propaganda. The maturity of the people is not an issue, nor is the professionalism <Col N="244" /> of the broadcasting media and journalists. Propaganda is very subtle. If these people come on the airwaves openly advocating violence they will be stopped but that is not how propaganda operates. It is an art which is central to the whole process as far as Sinn Féin and the IRA are concerned. If we try to relate this issue to the maturity of the Irish people or the professionalism of the media journalists, we are producing red herrings. It is enough for me if Sinn Féin or their spokespeople on the airwaves can convince even one person to become a killer pursuing a false ideology. The vast majority of the people will not be prevailed on to join the IRA or to become killers but impressionable young people will be affected.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is what young people and not so young people will think of a situation where, as a matter of course, spokespeople like Mr. Adams are allowed access to the airwaves? Does that not give them credibility, an acceptance as a normal part of our political furniture? However, they are not a normal part of our political furniture. Mr. Adams in one programme virtually equated himself with the Taoiseach or the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major and said he was quite willing to meet them and so on, but he is a different category of person, a leader of an organisation which does not condemn violence as a means of achieving political or other objectives. The difficulty with removing the ban is that he is now given that respectability and credibility.</P>
    <P>I was in Northern Ireland at the weekend, and I was led to believe that a decision has already been taken not to support the Downing Street Declaration, that in fact Sinn Féin and the IRA have already decided. It seems they are involved in a propaganda exercise at the moment and are being given further possibilities for spreading propaganda because of the failure of the Government to renew the ban. What sort of mandate have these people to continue their work? They are entirely unrepresentative. They have no mandate; they have 1.6 per cent of the vote in the <Col N="245" /> Republic and even in Northern Ireland where they are more significant they have 10 per cent of the vote in national elections and 12.5 per cent of the vote in local elections. What mandate is that?</P>
    <P>We are talking here about a major political question at a time when serious political decisions are to be faced on this island. The core difference between those in Opposition and the Government is that we are not talking about freedom of expression and censorship but about allowing people who continue to support violence access to the airwaves. We are talking about allowing them to continue spreading their propaganda on our radio and television. The carefully argued speech of the Minister does not clear that point because the Minister has argued from an entirely different perspective.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the Constitution. The devil can quote scripture so I will quote the Constitution as well. Article 40 of the Constitution imposes an obligation on the State to endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. How can the Government uphold that obligation by allowing access to State television and radio to those who do not accept the authority of the State? These people are not on the airwaves to talk about potholes, they are spreading propaganda based on the criterion that they are not prepared to condemn violence or to accept the authority of the State. In allowing them such access I am concerned that we are pushing back the peace process. Because they are able to do that why should they bother to accept the Downing Street Declaration? Why should they come in from the cold? They have already been given the warmth beside the fire. That is the real difficulty and that is why the Minister &mdash; I accept good faith on his part &mdash; has made a huge error of judgment. The Government who accepted his recommendation has done a major disservice to this country in failing to renew the ban.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter tonight. No Government Department is willing to accept financial or statutory responsibility for the flooding of houses in Duleek and certain public buildings in Julianstown, both of which are on the banks of the Nanny River. The Nanny catchment is due to be drained under the Arterial Drainage Act but this is not likely to occur until we are half way throught the next century, if ever.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works will not accept any immediate responsibility for this matter. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, said in the Dáil on 23 November that the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act does not allow the Minister to undertake works to relieve flooding of specific houses. It seems in effect that that Act can only be used to drain an entire catchment principally for the agricultural benefits that might accrue and the Office of Public Works does not concern itself with the flooding of houses.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the Minister of State drew attention to the fact that the Local Authority (Works) Act, 1949 does allow the local authorities to carry out such works but the fact is they have no money to do this. Since the abolition of domestic rates they have no source from which to raise funds to carry out this work themselves. I asked the Minister for the Environment about the matter and he said the grants from the Environment Vote to the local authorities address flood relief requirements only in the context of measures to relieve the surcharge on existing drainage works in built up areas. They do not deal with the more general problem of flooding because of a river overflowing. In this case there is overflow of both the Nanny and Paramadden Rivers, which converge at the estate about which I am concerned in particular in Duleek, the Mill Race housing estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mill Race housing estate in <Col N="247" /> Duleek has been flooded three or four times since it was built. Twenty-two of the 122 houses are flooded each time there is flooding. One of these is occupied by an elderly person and another by a lone parent with two children. Each time this estate is flooded the entrance is also flooded with the result that all 122 houses are cut-off, even though only 22 are flooded. The insurance companies have refused to continue to quote for flood insurance to the affected houses in Mill Race housing estate.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council, representatives of which visited the estate last week, has indicated that it is refusing to take over responsibility for this estate. It remains the responsibility of the developer who has left it. The county council which I have contacted about the matter says that it is not willing and does not believe that it would be worth while to conduct any further works in the area, such as the building of banks, because it feels they will not work. A hydrographic study of the entire Nanny and Paramadden catchments needs to be carried out to ensure those works would be effective and the county council does not have the money to finance a study of this magnitude and, indeed, does not have the expertise. The Office of Public Works does but it has refused to do anything about it for the reasons I have indicated. It does not accept responsibility. I have raised the matter in the House in the hope that some Minister will accept responsibility for the matter and that something will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter which is of great interest to both of us as the Nanny river happens to be in our constituency. I cannot agree with him when he says that the Office of Public Works will not accept any responsibility. The simple fact, as he knows as a former Minister for Finance, is that the Commissioners of Public Works and the Office of Public Works have no powers to undertake drainage works to relieve <Col N="248" /> flooding of homes in Duleek, Julianstown or in any other river catchment area. Responsibility for such works rests with the local authority, under the Local Authority (Works) Act, 1949 to which I adverted previously in an answer in the House.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage schemes arises under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. That Act provides only for the execution of comprehensive drainage schemes on entire river catchments. The commissioners have no power at present to undertake limited drainage schemes to relieve flooding. I would like to inform the Deputy that I am reviewing that matter at present.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy outlined and as I am fully aware, there has been a long history of flooding in Duleek and in Julianstown. The flooding which is particularly acute in Duleek and in the estate he mentioned &mdash; Mill Race &mdash; is due to the inability of the River Nanny or its tributaries to cope with the volume of water that arises at times of exceptional rainfall. There is a theory that it is due to a combination of factors, not just exceptional rainfall. It is felt that there must be an easterly wind and a high tide at the same time to cause an exceptional flood but, as I said, that is a theory and it has not been proved or disproved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Four possible solutions have been put forward to this problem: full arterial drainage, diversion of the River Nanny and its tributaries, erection of flood barriers &mdash; the county council has done some work in that regard &mdash; and interception of flood waters upstream. All the experts agree that until the necessary data is collected it will not be possible for the relevant authorities to make decisions on which is the optimum solution.</P>
      <P>The first thing that must be done therefore in order to provide a solution to the flooding problem in Duleek and Julianstown is to collect comprehensive hydrometric data over a period of years on the River Nanny and its tributaries around Duleek and Julianstown. When sufficient data has been collected on water levels and floods over a range of weather conditions the information that is essential for the design of an economic and successful scheme to overcome the flooding problem will be available.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to inform the Deputy that following discussions which I and my officials have had with Meath County Council during the past few months arrangements have been agreed for the collection of the necessary hydrometric data by the Office of Public Works with the assistance of the county council. The arrangements for the supply and installation of the necessary measuring gauges and other items are already in train. I am also happy to be able to assure the Deputy that the necessary resources to undertake the hydrometric survey are in place and that his concern in that respect is misplaced. I can also assure the Deputy that I will continue to take an active interest in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this urgent problem and to thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The area concerned is Tinnycross which is located not far from the town of Tullamore and where many new houses have been built in the past 15 to 20 years. When facilities such as septic tanks were being installed there the county council ensured that the work was executed to the desired standard. The area concerned is on the Eiscir Riada which, as the House will know, is the terminal moraine running right through the midlands. That is an area of gravel and glacial material which is very porous and in which it is difficult to locate and follow water courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, however, is that there is serious pollution in the area. This has been monitored by the County Council environmental section on numerous occasions but it has proved impossible, due to the nature of the terrain, to trace the source of the problem. The county council is willing to assist, and has assisted, the water scheme group in the formulation of their proposals. A very active residents group has got together and is willing to make every possible local contribution to the provision of a group scheme. The county council has assisted them from a technical point of view and Tullamore Urban District Council is willing to supply the water from their supply. There are already two smaller group schemes in the adjacent area one of which is in the process of being taken over by the urban council and county council <Col N="251" /> together, but there is certainly no problem with technical back-up or water supply and there is certainly no problem in regard to the willingness of the local residents to do their bit to ensure that the scheme is put in place.</P>
    <P>I have to say, however, that it appears to the residents, and sometimes to staff in the county council, that the Department is causing unnecessary delays in the advancement of this proposal. In regard to the initial scheme that was sent in for consideration, the word that came back was that the proposed piping was too small in the light of possible future development in the area. The scheme was redesigned to take account of the Department's views and the next thing they were told was that the new design was too big and too costly. The Minister will be happy to know that it has been redesigned and resubmitted, it is hoped to the satisfaction of the Department. I want to stress that the problem is an urgent everyday one for people who live in the area. The water which comes from their wells is dirty and smelly. It is not suitable as drinking water and neither is it suitable for washing. This has caused much hardship over a number of years and I would welcome any indication from the Minister that progress can be made on this urgent scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Gallagher for raising this matter here. The proposed scheme would serve up to 25 households and four farms in an area just outside Tullamore town. For the most part these householders are currently dependent on private individual ground water supplies, many of which are subject to localised pollution. As a result householders are anxious to obtain an alternative supply by connecting with an extension of the Tullamore public water supply scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tullamore Urban District Council has agreed to supply the group with sufficient water to meet their current demand as well as providing spare capacity to facilitate a future increase in demand of up to <Col N="252" /> 50 per cent. The original design capacity, as recommended by Offaly County Council, was far in excess of immediate or projected group needs. This was likely to add significantly to the overall cost of the scheme and a preliminary estimate of the cost indicated that the scheme could not be financed on the basis of members' contributions and group water scheme grants. My Department recommended that the group's design engineer, in consultation with Offaly County Council, reexamine the proposal with a view to achieving cost savings. This is being done but the exercise has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Gallagher will appreciate that until such time as these matters have been clarified I am not in a position to indicate what the overall cost of the scheme is likely to be or to assess in detail the cost implications for my Department or for individual group scheme members. I do understand, however, the concern of local householders to obtain a quality water supply. I am anxious that a workable solution should be found. I must stress that the delays to date were not caused by my Department. As soon as the result of the re-examination is available I will give priority consideration to this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I am glad to see you back and in good form again. I thank the Minister, too, for coming to the House to listen to my contribution. The eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis in this country has cost the Government and the taxpayer very large sums of money over a long number of years. Tonight I want to draw the Minister's attention to the serious financial losses and the trauma that many farming families continue to suffer as a result of anomalies in the compensation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation of individual <Col N="253" /> farmers on low-income dry stock and suckler cow production who find themselves, for the first time in their lives, with over 100 animals on their farm on the day of a TB test. For example, a farmer with 35 suckler cows, 50 young calves and 20 other cattle will not get income supplement if he loses over 10 per cent of his herd, yet he has no other income until he gets three clear tests and can sell cattle some six months later if he or she is fortunate enough to have no other reactors. Compare this with the situation of an intensive dairy farmer who could have up to 99 top class cows with no followers who, if he lost over 10 per cent of his herd, would get income supplement even though he would continue to have income from the yield of up to 88 cows on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>We should be able to use some imagination and use a system of livestock units rather than just animal numbers to rectify this anomaly. Livestock units are used in relation to headage claims and other claims. Why it cannot be used in this case I do not know. This situation must be rectified now. There is a danger that herd owners would be tempted to hold back a few cattle so as to remain under the magic 100 figure.</P>
    <P>The above example must not be taken as a suggestion that dairy farmers do not suffer major financial losses in many cases also. As one dairy farmer who has to provide for a young family said to me the other day, when talking about his five year trauma with bovine TB, it is an economic nightmare. He had lost over 30 animals in one year alone. Another young dairy farmer with a milk quota of just over 25,000 gallons found himself losing 22 of his 29 dairy cows. In an independent study of the financial implications of TB on that farm, it is clearly proven that the farmer lost £13,000 after Government compensation was paid. In that study it is stated that six of his cows would have been sold as cull cows to allow for his own replacements and he allowed for £1,700 credit and only bought in 16 replacements. I have the full study here which was published in the &ldquo;Irish Farmers' Journal&rdquo; a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> The Minister must realise that only a small number of farmers lose over 10 per cent of their herds and they must be looked after. It cannot continue that farmers would only receive £800 in total for good cows which would cost at least £1,300 to replace, and that does not take into account the loss of yield. Compensation for TB and brucellosis should be compared with that for other diseases. For example, a farmer gets the market value of an animal suffering from what is called mad cow disease. People whose animals have contacted TB and brucellosis find it difficult to understand why they cannot get similar compensation.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that negotiations which have been taking place for many years have failed to draw down the £10 million EC aid that was available. That aid has been given to other areas but we must continue to fight for it. If that aid was available it would save the taxpayers and farmers of this country a great deal of money over five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes there are a number of elements which are designed to assist herd owners whose herds are restricted due to disease breakdown. There is a comprehensive scheme of grants based on animal type and weight which supplements the slaughter value of reactors paid to the herd owner by the meat plant. A reactor collection service is provided free of charge to herd owners for the removal of reactor animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, these grants are designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent replacement animal. The prices being paid for reactor animals by meat factories are relatively good and this together with the reactor grant means that by and large herd owners get fair compensation. Herd owners whose herds are depopulated &mdash; totally or partially &mdash; in the interests of disease control may also qualify for depopulation grants which cover the rest period before restocking can take place. Also, an <Col N="255" /> income supplement grant is paid in cases where disease breakdown results in the removal of more than 10 per cent of animals in a herd but where depopulation is not appropriate. Payment is in respect of each animal removed as reactor from herds in which there are 100 animals or less on the date of restriction. Animals in transient herds or in feed lots do not qualify for income supplement. By its nature this is not an open ended scheme and the parameters set were devised to make the best use of scarce resources and to focus the assistance towards herd owners which need it most.</P>
    <P>The limit of 100 animals indicates that all small and reasonably substantial enterprises can benefit.</P>
    <P>It can be appreciated that there is a limit on the amount of funds available for grants under the TB eradication scheme to which owners themselves contribute substantially by way of payment of bovine diseases levies on each gallon of milk processed and each animal slaughtered or exported.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that these funds are used in a fair and economical way the criteria for eligibility for the grants are fully adhered to. To make exceptions in any grant scheme would create a precedent and would clearly lead to claims from other individuals in similar circumstances. It also has to be recognised that if a limit is established there will always be cases at the wrong side of the limit.</P>
    <P>In practice it would be administratively difficult to devise a system based on livestock units. Even if it were feasible, the same difficulties would arise in terms of the limit set.</P>
    <P>In the overall, the reactor compensation scheme as operated here is regarded as one of the most comprehensive animal compensation arrangements in the EC. The payment arrangement has in recent times been the subject of an independent economic analysis study. The outcome of the study showed that, in general, the compensation mechanism was reasonble and fair in its application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> In the normal course, reactor grant rates are reviewed on an on-going basis in line with market trends and taking account of a variety of factors including prices being paid by meat plants for reactor animals.</P>

      <P>This matter has been raised on many occasions in the past. In fact, the present Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, is the seventh Minister on whose desk this matter has been put. The matter refers to the long awaited post-primary school in Knocklyon, Dublin 16. The previous incumbent, the present Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, who is a TD in that area, following a series of meetings in March, July and November of 1992 officially sanctioned the building of the first phase of a 400 pupil postprimary school in Knocklyon. A committee dealing with the issue of the post primary school has been in existence since 1978. One can imagine the delight of the members of that committee when the provision of the school was eventually sanctioned by the previous Minister. One can also imagine their horror, disappointment and sense of betrayal, particularly by the Labour Party, when a Labour Minister took over the portfolio of Minister for Education and rescinded the decision on the grounds of a changed ideology in the book of the Minister for Education. In March last she maintained in this House that the emphasis for the Department in relation to the building of secondary schools would be to target disadvantaged areas. The obvious corollary of that is that she views Knocklyon as an advantaged area. One can imagine the horror of my constituents at being disadvantaged because they were seen to be contented or advantaged by way of income.</P>

    <P>This matter is a source of real concern in the constituency. I remind the Minister that the area surrounding Knocklyon has been the victim of blanket rezoning and <Col N="257" /> planning permission for approximately 1,000 houses was granted recently. Knocklyon national school is the biggest national school in the country. It is bursting at the seams and the only option for children leaving that school is to disperse to secondary schools outside their community. That is having a demoralising effect on that new and developing community. A secondary school is a fundamental unit of any community and the demographic information for the provision of such a school exists. The school was sanctioned by a previous Minister for Education; the only thing that has changed is the ideology of the present Labour Party Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee and I have been trying to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Education to discuss the possibility of including this project in the 1994 Estimates. I see a window of opportunity now because £5 million was allocated in the budget to the Minister for Education for capital spending on secondary schools. Perhaps she might reconsider the plight and concerns of the developing community in Knocklyon. The people there are hard-working, they own their own homes, are compliant taxpayers and are now being threatened with a property tax. They feel completely betrayed. They believe they pay through the nose for everything and get nothing in return. They are living in a limbo which has been created by bad planning and rezoning. The Southern Cross route is hanging over them like a pendulum causing traffic chaos in the area. The people believe they get nothing in return for the taxes they pay. They have a legitimate gripe and that is why I am raising this matter on the Adjournment. I hope the Minister for Education will show compassion and decency for the demands of the people of Knocklyon for their long awaited secondary school. Surveys show that there is a growing population and that greater numbers are attending the primary schools. Indeed, they are full. It is not only a matter of services, but of helping to build the community. I hope the Minister for Education will have good <Col N="258" /> news in the Estimates this year for the people of Knocklyon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this matter. The Department of Education purchased a site of more than 11 acres in the Knocklyon area in 1982 when it was considered that the demand for post-primary places in the area would require the provision of a new post-primary school.</P>
      <P>Throughout the 1980s the question of providing a school at Knocklyon was reviewed on a regular basis. In 1984 the then Minister, Gemma Hussey, decided to defer the opening of the school until 1988. In 1988, following a further review, the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, decided not to proceed with the proposed school for Knocklyon but to retain the site in Department ownership.</P>
      <P>The Department has, since 1988, been regularly reviewing the present and future post-primary needs of the Knocklyon area. In 1992 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, having received a number of submissions from the Knocklyon Post-Primary Committee, decided that the school for Knocklyon should be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>It was envisaged that construction of the school building would commence in 1993, with the school taking its first intake of pupils in September 1994. Regrettably, however, it was not possible to include the project in the 1993 capital programme within the allocation available and having regard to other commitments and priorities, including the needs for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the protracted history of this project, and of the major demographic implications of recent and proposed housing developments for Knocklyon and adjoining areas, it is considered that the short and long term requirements of the area at post-primary level need to be assessed in the light of the most up-todate statistical data available for primary and post-primary levels and for housing and other demographic indicators. The completion of this assessment will enable the Department to decide where the Knocklyon project stands in relation to <Col N="259" /> the post-primary capital programme and to the many other building projects at present proceeding through the various stages of architectural planning. It is <Col N="260" /> hoped to have this assessment completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 February 1994.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to bring forward legislation to give the National Treasury Management Agency statutory responsibility for the debt management of semi-State bodies, local authorities, health boards and other agencies of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national debt is in excess of <Col N="56" /> £28,000 million and is by far the biggest portfolio of debt in the State. In the circumstances it is important that the agency should concentrate all its attention and resources on the management of this portfolio so as to keep the cost of servicing it to a minimum. It is the responsibility of the boards of semi-State bodies and other agencies of the State to look after the operations of their enterprises and it would not be appropriate to take the vital function of debt management from them. In any event, a number of semi-State bodies have sophisticated debt management operations in place and in some cases are selling their debt management expertise to other organisations.</P>
    <P>There are also other important operational and policy considerations which strongly suggest that the National Treasury Management Agency should concentrate on the National debt. As agent for the Government the National Treasury Management Agency commands the best borrowing terms. As agent for other State bodies it would not get such fine terms. Lenders decide on credit risk on the basis of the underlying borrower and not by reference to the borrowing agency. If all the borrowing was done in the name of the Government then it would be part of the national debt and this would undermine the commercial nature and independence of bodies outside Central Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the national lottery legislation in 1986 the Government gave a commitment to make funding available to voluntary bodies, then holding periodical lotteries, who could demonstrate satisfactorily that the national lottery had adversely affected their proceeds. While the operators of some charitable lotteries have adverted to this commitment in representations, they have not put a specific case to me nor have they specifically requested compsenation.</P>
      <P>There would, in any event, be a practical difficulty with evaluating any such claims for compensation. Private lotteries are not subject to the same rigorous and transparent accounting procedures which apply to the national lottery. They are not obliged to publish audited accounts and have not done so. In the absence of reliable audited data for this sector, it is not possible to make any comprehensive analysis of revenue trends over time, which would be a prerequisite for any compensation claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if such data were available, it could be wrong to assume that any changes in the performance of individual lotteries were primarily due to the advent of the national lottery. It would not be practical to disentangle the effect on their sales of factors other than the national lottery such as the way in which those <Col N="58" /> lotteries were managed, changes in consumer preferences or the general economic situation. In this regard, I am mindful of the fact that one of the most successful of the private lotteries only came into existence subsequent to the introduction of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that a clear distinction needs to be made between charitable fundraising generally and the income to charities from charitable lotteries. Very little is known about how much of the turnover of private lotteries accrues to the charities which they support. However, even if income from their lottery activities were declining, market research has shown that public contributions to charitable fundraising in general have continued to grow since the introduction of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I should also remind the House that very many charitable and voluntary bodies have received grants of national lottery funds since the lottery was introduced.</P>
    <P>It would not be necessary to amend the National Lottery Act, 1986 to allow for unclaimed prize money to be given to charity as the provision in relation to unclaimed prizes is contained in the rules of the lottery which it is open to the Minister for Finance to amend. In the light of the position which I have outlined in relation to the charities, I do not propose to amend the rules on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there is already a high degree of co-operation between all the Government agencies in the battle against the drug smuggler. This has resulted in a number of significant drug seizures in recent times, particularly off the South coast. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the dedicated people involved who work diligently, sometimes at considerable physical risk, to protect the community from the drugs menace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Justice is having a report prepared by her Department with a view to establishing the scope for further improvements in co-operation, the sharing of information and intelligence and in general ensuring that there is the maximum level of co-operation by all the agencies involved in the fight against drugs smuggling. The report is being prepared in consultation with all concerned, <Col N="63" /> including the Revenue Commissioners, and will contain recommendations aimed at avoiding any difficulties or misunderstandings which may have arisen at operational level in the past.</P>
    <P>I shall consider with my colleagues in Government any proposals arising from the report for improved measures or strategies for tackling the drug smuggling threat.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are presented in a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's interest is in Ireland's position relative to income levels in other countries of the European Union. To make comparisons of that nature, it is necessary to adjust the income data for differences in price levels between the various countries. This is the standard approach for international comparisons of income levels. It is used whenever comparisons are needed for Structural Funds purposes.</P>
      <P>The most recent year for which comprehensive official data are available for the Twelve on this basis is 1992. These put Ireland's <i>per capita</i> GDP at almost 72 per cent of the Community average, a substantial improvement since 1986 when it was just 60 per cent of the average. Although official data for 1993 are not available, Ireland's relative GDP growth performance in 1993 indicates that further gains were made last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement in Ireland's position is a tribute to the successful implementation of our stabilisation and development policies which have seen the economy continuing to grow and maintain employment in the face of recession <Col N="64" /> elsewhere in Europe, and to the productive use which has been made of the EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The report by Oxfam has been brought to my attention. I consider that it is a very interesting one. In particular, the report contains a number of recommendations to alleviate the debt problems of developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. I consider that these recommendations merit further study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime I want to say that I think concessional or soft loans to these poorest countries are vital. The International Monetary Fund's adjustment programmes for the poorest countries involve loans which are heavily subsidised &mdash; at a concessionary rate of interest of 0.5 per cent. For its part, the World Bank is doing much to alleviate the situation of these countries. In the <Col N="65" /> first place, it introduced in 1990 a special scheme to provide resources on a grant basis to enable low-income countries to reduce their external commercial debt; operations under that facility increased sharply last year. In addition, the Bank has been helping low-income countries experiencing difficulties in paying interest on loans previously obtained from it. The Bank also organises and assists through the International Development Association, the Special Programme for Africa, a unique aid co-ordination mechanism for debtdistressed African countries committed to adjustment programmes. The International Development Association is the soft loan arm of the World Bank and provides concessionary finance to the poorest developing countries. Last year, having received the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Ireland agreed to contribute to the tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and also to make a supplementary voluntary contribution &mdash; totalling in all £13 million.</P>
    <P>I share Oxfam's particular concern with the plight of sub-Saharan Africa. I stated at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF last year that it is time to formulate a debt-relief package for this region and the other poorest regions at least in line with the Trinidad terms. Of course the formulation and implementation of debt relief schemes needs to be tackled at global level. The role which the Irish Government can and will continue to play is to support all efforts being undertaken in international fora to provide debt relief particularly for the poorest developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="66" /> As the Deputy will be aware a Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) was set up by the Revenue Commissioners to combat the smuggling of drugs in view of the greater responsibility placed on Customs for protecting not only Ireland but the European Union as a whole against drug smuggling from third countries, with the abolition of systematic checks at internal Community frontiers since 1 January, 1993. The CNDT, comprising over seventy staff, consists of Intelligence Units, Operational Units, Maritime Units and Sniffer-dog Units, which are strategically based at locations throughout the country. These specialist officials supplement the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that two full-time members of the CNDT are based in each of the two areas of West Cork and Kerry, and are assisted by two further officers of Customs and Excise on a part-time basis. Where the need arises, these CNDT members can call on the assistance of other Customs and Excise staff, in particular the seven officials attached to Customs and Excise Mobile Task Units which operate in their areas. Additionally, they can request the assistance, when necessary, of CNDT staff based in Cork, Limerick and Shannon which comprises twenty-five members, including two sniffer-dog units and one Maritime Unit. All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present Customs and Excise levels of staffing are adequate to combat drug smuggling in the West Cork and Kerry areas. On resources generally I would remind Deputies that I am pressing the case at European Union level for the provision of assistance to enable this country to equip itself better to protect the Irish sector of the external frontier of the European Union.</P>

The excise duty charge is reasonable considering that this travel is zero rated for VAT purposes and that the fuel used by aircraft and ferries in international travel does not bear excise duty. The Deputy might note that, in the recent United Kingdom Budget, higher taxes were introduced for air-travel both within and to outside the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by Uganda which emerged in the second half of the 1980s from a disastrous civil war that left its economy in ruins. Indeed, the economic and infrastructural difficulties being faced by Uganda were recognised in the Irish Aid Strategy Plan issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs in July 1993 and were taken into account in designating Uganda as a priority country for Ireland's Official Development Assistance. However, I do not consider that the severe difficulties of Uganda arise from its relationship with the IMF which has been to the forefront in Uganda's support since 1987, to significant effect.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the net flow of financial resources from 1987 to 1992 was an inflow to Uganda of some 105 million US dollars from the IMF. Looking forward, Uganda will repay IMF debts over the years ahead, and will doubtless receive loans also, since its economy is going to need them for some time. At present, the authorities in Uganda and the IMF staff are working together on a further programme which should involve new lending in the next year or so. The IMF is advising Uganda, in the light of its precarious debt, not to engage in borrowings other than on concessionary terms, such as grant supported or interest subsidised loans.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the IMF and the Uganda Government have been working closely together since 1987. The Fund has a resident representative in Uganda, and regularly sends missions to consider new programmes, and to monitor developments under old ones. I know that the IMF Board and staff are well aware of the debt problems facing the country, and have engaged in subsidised lending to it (½ per cent interest). The IMF is also acting as a catalyst for non IMF debt restructuring &mdash; with some success. The IMF would consider that its adjustment programmes have been of great benefit to Uganda in recent years despite a very difficult external environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the IMF itself is not in a position to engage in debt forgiveness its role is as <Col N="72" /> a facilitator in turning around economies with balance of payments problems by</P>
    <P>&mdash;helping design suitable adjustment programmes to let countries deal with their external difficulties, including past and future debt; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;lending to such countries, including lending under economic adjustment programmes &mdash; in the case of the poorest countries at the low rate of interest of ½ per cent which other IMF members voluntarily subsidise.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that Ireland's Alternate Executive Director in the IMF is monitoring the situation in Uganda and in other countries of particular concern to Ireland, and will make the Government's views known as required.</P>

This in fact became legally binding on the European Community as a whole under E C Regulation 3626/82. There are concerns that there may be technical discrepancies between the terms of the Convention and some aspects of Irish Law. The matter is currently being examined.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned applied for relief from payment of vehicle registration tax on his motor car which he imported on transferring his residence. Legislation provides that a person transferring his/her residence to the State may be granted this relief provided, <i>inter alia</i>, the vehicle is his/her personal property at the time of transfer of residence and s/he had possession and use of the vehicle for at least six months outside the State prior to taking up residence in the State.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> In this case the person concerned transferred his residence to the State on 2 July 1993. However, he failed to establish that he had possession and use of the car outside the State for the required six months prior to transferring his residence to the State. Also, as the car was registered in the name of a company in Germany the Commissioners were not satisfied that the car was the personal property of the applicant. Accordingly, the application was refused on 8 November 1993.</P>
    <P>The refusal has been appealed by the claimant and further documentation submitted. However, the Commissioners still await satisfactory evidence that the vehicle was the personal property of the person concerned at the time of the transfer of residence. This has been requested and the applicant has stated that it can be supplied. I am informed by the Commissioners that if the required evidence is submitted and is sufficient to meet their requirements they are prepared to grant the relief sought.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on foot of a 1988 EC Directive Ireland gradually removed exchange controls from 1988 onwards and on 31 December 1992 abolished the few controls then remaining. There is no question of our reintroducing exchange controls. Apart from any other consideration, the Treaty on European Union prohibits their use except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, Irish resident taxpayers are liable to Irish tax in respect of income and capital gains no matter where they arise. Specific measures have been enacted by the Oireachtas to counter attempts to evade or avoid Irish tax through the use of off-shore companies and trusts. In addition, the Oireachtas has enacted a general anti-avoidance provision &mdash; section 86 of the Finance Act, 1989. I should mention that the Revenue Commissioners have recently been operating a more intensive programme involving the issue of notices seeking information regarding the setting-up of off-shore companies and trusts.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the 1993 tax amnesty was the final opportunity for taxpayers to put their affairs in order before the introduction of the stringent new penalties, including prison sentences, which accompanied the amnesty.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners extended powers will greatly improve their ability to combat future attempts at avoidance and evasion.</P>

      <P>The issue of a graduated relief for people marginally in excess of the £60 threshold was examined by the expert working group on the intergration of the tax and social welfare systems, which was established under the aegis of the Minister of State at my Department, in context of the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government. After a preliminary examination of the issue the group concluded in its interim report that for administrative reasons it would not be feasible to address the question of graduated relief in the 1994 budget.

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is payable to eligible households from mid October to mid April. An additional <Col N="80" /> payment of £3 per week is made in the Dublin area because of the higher cost of smokeless fuel. Some 256,000 people benefit from the national fuel scheme. The cost of the scheme is estimated at £39.5 million in 1994. Increasing the rate of the fuel allowance would have significant cost implications and is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme is a free service operated on behalf of Social Welfare customers by An Post. People receiving unemployment payments can authorise An Post to deduct regular amounts towards various household bills from their weekly unemployment payments. An Post pays the amounts deducted to the appropriate organisations.</P>
      <P>Household budgeting has been designed as an aid to managing household finances for those who wish to avail of it. A person may choose to pay regular contributions to any of the following utilities &mdash; ESB, Bord Gais, local authority rents and mortgages and Telecom Éireann. Total deductions cannot exceed 25 per cent of a person's net weekly unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Deductions made in this regular way help such customers to cope with ongoing expenses and in clearing arrears. This scheme will also assist in reducing the recourse to moneylenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is currently in operation in the greater Dublin area and in Counties Waterford and Kilkenny. It will be extended to other counties on a phased basis. Extension of the scheme is dependent on securing agreement with the various local authorities and also on the transfer of clients to my Department's newer methods of payment. Progress has been very good to date and I expect a <Col N="81" /> number of additional counties to come on to the new scheme in the coming months. I wish to assure the Deputy I plan to have the household budgeting scheme operational in every county, including County Meath, as soon as is practical.</P>
    <P>My Department and An Post are also seeking ways of offering the facility to other types of Social Welfare customer. There is considerable potential for the further development of this scheme. I am considering various options at present. I hope to announce extensions in the scheme over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Irish social welfare system complies with the requirements of EC Directive 79/7 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security. This Directive applies to schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, accidents <Col N="82" /> at work and occupational diseases, and unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Directive was implemented in Ireland by way of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was enacted by the Oireachtas in July 1985. The provisions of that Act were brought into force by way of commencement orders in two phases with effect from May and November 1986. In June 1992, regulations were introduced to provide for retrospective legislation to cover the period of delay in implementing the EC Directive.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Directive does not extend to family benefits or survivors' schemes. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made in providing for equality of treatment in these areas.</P>
      <P>Last week I announced the introduction of a new widower's contributory pension, at an annual cost of £16 million, with effect from October next. The introduction of this new scheme is a major achievement in the provision of equal treatment in the social insurance system. It complements the developments already made in relation to achieving equality of treatment in the social assistance system. In this regard, I introduced new social assistance allowances for widowers and deserted fathers with dependent children in 1989. These schemes were subsequently incorporated into the lone parent's allowance which I introduced in 1990. This scheme caters for all lone parents, irrespective of whether they are male or female or of the circumstances which gave rise to the lone parenthood.</P>

When the system is up and running, the question of certifying and classifying videos already on the market will be addressed. I should say, of course, that the Censor and the Assistant Censors have power to examine any video &mdash; whether a new release or already on the market &mdash; and to prohibit its distribution if they regard it, by reference to the criteria set out in the Video Recordings Act, to be unfit for viewing.</P>

      <P>At present, when a fine is imposed, the courts normally allow a specified period (typically 14 days) for a payment and, in default of payment, may stipulate a term of imprisonment to be served by the defendant. Court staff send a notice to the defendant indicating the fine imposed and requesting payment within the stipulated period. A subsequent reminder notice may be issued in certain cases. In the event of failure to pay a warrant is made out in the court office and sent to the Garda.

      <P>As announced in the budget, a further £15 million is being provided this year for the maintenance of non-national roads. The increase will help protect the substantial investment over recent years in improving these roads and assist local authorities to undertake work necessitated by adverse weather and flooding experienced since last summer. The total State provision for the maintenance of these roads in 1994 (£28.3 million) is 130 per cent more than last year's. In addition, the provision for State grants for the improvement of non-national roads has been increased by £10.6 million to a total of £73.6 million in 1994. In both cases, I will notify local authorities of their individual allocations as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Overall, a total of £101.9 million is provided for this year for grants to local authorities to supplement expenditure for their own resources on the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads. This represents an increase of £26.6 million, or over 35 per cent, on last year's grants. I expect local authorities to at least maintain the level of expenditure financed from their own resources on these roads so that maximum benefit can be realised from the additional grants.</P>

      <P>Under the Iberian Act of Accession the fisheries aspects of the Act fell for review by the end of 1993. However, since no final decisions were reached the review is ongoing. The terms of the Act provide that the Irish Box is due to lapse by the end of 1995. The effect of this would be full access for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets to all EU waters outside twelve miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been discussed at <Col N="94" /> recent Councils of Fisheries Ministers where I have taken every opportunity of indicating that any significant change in the present arrangements, including any changes to the Irish Box, would have major direct implications for control, conservation and territorial fishing patterns in the Irish zone.</P>
    <P>I have explained to Council the importance and sensitivity of the issue to the Irish Government and Irish fishermen. I stressed that, from a control perspective, the track record of the Spanish fleet in the Irish economic zone was most unsatisfactory. In particular I pointed out that</P>
    <P>(a) one out of every two Spanish vessels boarded is detained for serious fishery offences,</P>
    <P>(b) nearly three quarters of these vessels were in breach of the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession,</P>
    <P>(c) apart from these breaches, the vessels concerned also had serious infringements relating to log books and undersized fish,</P>
    <P>(d) since Accession, 40 per cent of the vessels on the basic list have been arrested for serious offences, and</P>
    <P>(e) recently, a new problem &mdash; secret holds &mdash; had come to notice and eight vessels have been detained over the last year.</P>
    <P>I have also stressed that the capacity of the Spanish fleet far exceeds the resources available to that fleet.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to follow the review of the Iberian Act of Accession are not yet agreed at Council. In view of the risks posed by the heavy concentration of fishing effort by certain vessels to the South West of Ireland at the perimeter of the box, and the extreme pressure on fishing resources, I am pursuing at Community level proposals to adopt specific control arrangements so as to ensure the conservation of stocks in these areas.</P>

      <P>In 1993 I announced detailed proposals for a major restructuring of the organisation of <Col N="97" /> horseracing involving the establishment of a new horseracing authority. The new authority would assume overall responsibility for the administration and development of all aspects of the horseracing industry with the sole exception of the operation of the rules of racing and the provision of integrity services for horseraces. Both of these functions would continue to be the responsibility of the governing bodies. A draft of the legislation necessary to put the new frame-work in place will be published and circulated to Deputies in the current Dáil session.</P>
      <P>The National Stud is in the process of implementing a development plan involving a restructuring of its operations. The object of the plan is to bring the stud back to profitability. The plan calls for an increase in the State's equity in the stud. To this end a sum of £1.5 million is provided for in the 1994 book of estimates.</P>
      <P>In 1992 I appointed an interim board for the non-thoroughbred sector with a view to the establishment of a structure to provide for its development. Last year the interim board recommended the establishment of a horse board cooperative. The co-op has been launched and is now in the process of recruiting members. The Board has submitted a plan for the future development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry including in particular a strategy for the breeding, production and marketing of sport horses. I have already accepted this plan and have agreed a package of measures including financial assistance for the co-op to facilitate the implementation of the plan. The package covers the period up to 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full amount of the 5 per cent levy collected on all &ldquo;on-course&rdquo; betting at authorised racecourses goes to the Racing Board and is used for the benefit of horseracing. The 10 per cent tax on &ldquo;off-course&rdquo; betting which includes bets on all events whether connected to horseracing or not goes to the Exchequer. A grant-in-aid is paid to the Racing Board from the Agriculture Vote for the benefit of horseracing. The level of the grant-inaid <Col N="98" /> in 1994 is equivalent to more than 20 per cent of the Exchequer receipts from the betting tax.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a degree course in equine science was introduced at the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>The number of people employed directly and indirectly in the horse industry including both thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred sectors, is estimated at 40,000.</P>

As the person named made on application in 1988 his quota was based on the average of the numbers for which he was paid premium in the years 1989 and 1990 which in this case was 10.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available to me for the promotion of Cork Airport. However, in September last I made representations to Aer Rianta on the need for more transparency in their allocation of marketing funds for Cork Airport. I also apprised them of my wish to involve local commercial interests in their marketing proposals and plans for Cork Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that Aer Rianta has now decided that a special marketing fund totalling £500,000 be set up for the promotion of Cork Airport. A new marketing task force, chaired by Mr. B. Roche, Airport Manager, Cork, comprised <Col N="111" /> of representatives of airport management and business-commercial interests in the Cork area will also be set up.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the 1993 provision for the promotion of regional airports was an exceptional measure and is not being repeated in 1994.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the essential services programme is to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the six small regional airports viz., Donegal, Sligo, Connaught (Knock), Galway (Carnmore), Kerry (Farranfore) and Waterford. Unlike Cork Airport, which experienced traffic growth of 12 per cent between 1991 and 1993, traffic at the six regional airports fell by a total of 36 per cent over the same period. The cost of implementing the essential air services programme will be met by the Exchequer and not by the European Union.</P>

      <P>The incidence of cystic fibrosis is estimated at 1 per 2,000 live-births. It is estimated that there are 800 cystic fibrosis sufferers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 20 and 185 on 16 December 1993 the position in relation to genetic counselling is that this service is largely provided in paediatric hospitals and paediatric units and in obstetric hospitals and units throughout the country. In addition, genetic screening and testing facilities are available in the major university hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funds have been allocated over the past two years to Our Lady's Hospital, in Crumlin for the establishment of a new medical genetic counselling service, which is to be backed up by a medical genetic laboratory service also based at that hospital. A Consultant Medical Geneticist/Professor of Human Genetics has been appointed to head up the service and is expected to take up duty at the hospital on 1 July 1994. In the meantime <Col N="115" /> the appointee has been actively involved in the arrangements for the setting up of the Medical Genetics Laboratory at the hospital.</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
      <P>Persons are granted medical cards where the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board considers that they are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship. A uniform set of income guidelines are used by the health boards to assist in deciding on a person's eligibility. Each application is assessed on its own merits with the individual circumstances, including particular illnesses or disabilities, being taken into account. Medical cards are not, therefore, granted automatically to any particular group.</P>
      <P>In the interests of ensuring the effective management of the medical card system, health boards periodically review the eligibility of medical card holders. The review period will depend on individual circumstances but typically varies from one to three years. A disabled person with a medical card, whose circumstances would not be expected to alter significantly, would be subject to less frequent reviews.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the system of determining and reviewing eligibility for medical cards is operated by health boards in an equitable manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to higher level leaving certificate results in languages and, specifically, to the percentages of candidates obtaining Grade A in those subjects.</P>
      <P>The percentages of candidates obtaining the different grades are not determined arbitrarily: they depend on the performance of candidates in the examination in the different subjects.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate is offered at two levels, ordinary and higher, and the results are significantly affected by the proportion of candidates opting for a particular level.</P>
      <P>The proportion of the whole cohort of leaving certificate students opting for a particular subject at a particular level has a major impact on the percentages of candidates obtaining the different grades. Italian, for example, was taken by only 112 candidates out of a cohort of 61,562. Of the 112, 71 per cent opted for the higher level. This is clearly an unrepresentative sample of the whole cohort.</P>
      <P>It is important therefore that if comparisons are to be made, like should be compared with like. English as the mother tongue of the vast majority of candidates is in a category by itself and is not examined as a second language.</P>
      <P>Irish is in a rather unique category in that although it is mother tongue for some candidates, it is a school-learned language for most. Performance in Irish should therefore, be fairly comparable to that achieved in French, which like Irish is a high participation subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the comparison has to be qualified because of the different emphases placed on the four basic language skills in the two languages. French has a strong bias in favour of the receptive skills of reading comprehension and listening comprehension, whereas Irish emphasises the productive skills of writing and speaking. The receptive skills are far more accessible and more readily mastered than the productive skills. Hence, candidates' performance in the <Col N="121" /> receptive area will outshine preformance in the productive area.</P>
    <P>It will interest the Deputy to note that a test in listening comprehension was introduced in leaving certificate Irish for the first time in 1993 although it has been part of the leaving certificate in modern languages for many years.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this test has already enhanced the overall performance of candidates in leaving certificate Irish. As the receptive skill of listening comprehension in Irish is developed in the schools it can be expected that there will be an increase in the proportion of candidates achieving grade A in higher level Irish.</P>

      <Quest>if it is her Department's intention to provide temporary accommodation in a low cost building structure on the post-primary school site in Dunboyne, County Meath which is owned by the diocese; if a diocesan secondary school will proceed on this site in view of meetings between her Department, the Bishop of Meath and his representatives during 1993 as this information is urgently required to alleviate stress on parents who have no places for their children who will be attending first year in September 1994, and who are dependent on this green field school commencing at Dunboyne in a low cost building structure.</Quest>

      <P>The type of management structure for the proposed new post-primary school for Dunboyne, County Meath, is under active consideration in my Department at present. I expect to have a decision in the matter shortly.</P>
      <P>The question of opening the school in temporary accommodation next September will be considered when the management issue is resolved. You can be assured, however, that sufficient pupil places will be available for all Dunboyne children entering postprimary education in September 1994.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal from the European Commission which has still to be discussed by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo; programme is still under discussion by the relevant institutions, it would be premature to respond specifically to the Deputy's question as to the way in which the programme is <Col N="143" /> to be utilised within the Irish education system. However, the Deputy can be assured that when the Commission proposal is finally adopted, it will be implemented in this country in a manner which seeks to maximise its benefits to Irish students.</P>
    <P>The proposed action programme draws on experiences gained in the implementation of Erasmus and Lingua and on other pilot schemes developed and promoted by the commission. The programme is comprised of three principal elements, viz., higher education; school education; horizontal actions, e.g. the promotion of language skills, open and distance education and learning, information and exchange of experiences.</P>
    <P>The proposals provide for community support for actions which promote cooperation between the member states while, at the same time, respecting the primary responsibility of the member states for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity in accordance with Article 126 of the Treaty on European Union.</P>

      <P>The procedures for selecting schools for inclusion in the scheme are based on a range of socio-economic criteria agreed by a working party comprised of representatives of my Department, the INTO and schools management.</P>
      <P>The factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>At present under this scheme a total of 258 primary schools have the services of 275 additional ex-quota teaching posts. The schools in question also receive supplementary capitation grants at the rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
      <P>As I announced to the House last year, I allocated an additional 68 ex-quota teaching posts to the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September 1993. As part of this arrangement, an additional 50 schools were newly included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>All national schools were circularised at the time and invited to apply for inclusion in this allocation. On the basis of information submitted, schools were assessed and prioritised in order of need. Quite a number of the schools under consideration had up to 80 per cent to 90 per cent levels of unemployment among the parents of their pupils.</P>

      <Col N="147" /> The application submitted by the school referred to by the Deputy was among those considered in this context. However, the school did not rate high enough on the priority list for inclusion in the scheme on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to allocate additional resources to the disadvantaged scheme again this year to facilitate further expansion of this scheme. The case for the school mentioned by the Deputy will be fully considered in this context.</P>
