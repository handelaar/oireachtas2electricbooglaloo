    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>Since the Joint Declaration was signed the Irish and British Governments have provided very substantial clarification on those issues which were represented by the Republican movement as causing genuine perplexity.  This protracted process has essentially presented the Joint Declaration as a fair and balanced framework within which a lasting solution to the Northern Ireland conflict can be found.  The two Governments have stated in clear and detailed terms that its principles and realities reflect a solid commitment by us both to the inviolable rights and legitimate aspirations of both traditions in Ireland.  We have provided an enormous amount of detail on how on the basis of the declaration, we will strive to achieve a just balance between these rights and aspirations in a way which would safeguard each and threaten neither.  The principal effect of all this has been to clearly demonstrate that there remains no vestige of justification for paramilitary violence anywhere, whether loyalist or Republican.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the violence has continued. The two Governments, therefore, have repeatedly challenged the paramilitaries on both sides to give tangible expression to their stated interest in peace by calling a permanent end to their respective campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constructive British response to Sinn Féin's repeated requests for clarification has cleared the way for an early response from the Republican movement. Regarding the loyalist paramilitaries, I can confirm to the House that a request for clarification was received from an Ulster Democratic Party councillor, in his personal capacity. The letter in question seeks clarification <Col N="1391" /> on a number of matters pertaining to Irish Government policy on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome this request and am willing to extend to loyalists the same level of clarification as I have extended to others.  It is important to make clear, however, that I am not prepared to enter negotiations on the Downing Street Declaration, or on any issues which are properly a matter for the talks process.</P>
    <P>A response to this letter is in the process of issuing.  I would have no difficulties should the recipient decide to make public its contents.  It is my hope that the clarification provided will constitute a significant advance in the development of the peace process, leading to a permanent halt being called to loyalist paramilitary violence.  I look forward to a similar response from the Republican movement.</P>
    <P>I take the view that the clarification process has now been completed.  An important opportunity exists for both sides to finally disengage from violence in favour of the democratic process.  As I have already made clear on numerous occasions, the two Governments will continue to pursue political progress without waiting for the decisions of the paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>Our work on the formulation of a joint framework document as a basis for resumed all-party talks will continue.  I will review progress with the British Prime Minister at our informal meeting on the margins of the European Council meeting in Corfu.  Although no absolute timetable exists for the completion of the framework document, we have set ourselves the aim of finalising it by the time of our next formal meeting, which is scheduled to take place in mid-July.  It is our intention therefore to review at that meeting the actual situation in this regard, as well as the prospects for the earliest possible resumption of the three-stranded talks process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Councillor McMichael's letter seeking clarification, will the Taoiseach accept it would be in everybody's best interests <Col N="1392" /> that the letter and the response be published so that there would be openness and transparency to avoid suspicion? Does he accept we have not had any peace dividend from the Downing Street Declaration of last December, that instead we have had half a year of further killing and maiming, that as far as paramilitaries on both sides are concerned it is now &ldquo;make up your mind time&rdquo; and that from now on the approach of the Irish and the UK Governments will be totally focused on those in the constitutional parties and those who disavow violence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the writer of the letter, Councillor McMichael, chooses to make it public I will be happy to see that process carried through.  It is a matter for him to decide when he gets the reply which, it is hoped, will issue within the next 24 hours.</P>
      <P>The clarification process has been completed and there is no question of any more clarification.  We look forward to early responses now that the elections are out of the way.  The result of the European elections in Northern Ireland were positive.  Mr. John Hume's vote went up considerably, by 3.5 per cent or thereabouts, and an increase of 25,000 votes.  The Official Unionist vote also went up.  Clearly the vast majority of people in the North use the democratic process and the ballot box to express their continuing support for a permanent cessation of violence.  That is what the people want to see coming out of this process, sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate that the expected declaration of cease-fire by the Provisionals arising from the agreement between the British and Irish Governments on the declaration has not occurred and is now not likely to occur in the way that he expected?  Will he agree it is necessary for both Governments to be clearly seen to be moving forward with the political process in a way which would undercut the fear in various parts of the community in the North and that neither Government <Col N="1393" /> should be seen to be held back by paramilitary organisations of whatever hue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to put the same response on the record here time after time that the two Governments are not waiting for the paramilitaries to say yes or no.  I have laid out the timetable on which we are working.  The two Governments are engaged in trying to finalise the framework document in time for our next formal meeting in mid-July. Whether the paramilitaries say yes or no we will continue with our timetable.  On the Deputy's other question, it is a matter of fact that there has not been a cessation of violence.  However, the clarification process is now complete and it is hoped that we will hear one way or the other by early July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will pardon me if I take the opportunity of complimenting those in the North who clearly voted for the peace process.  In particular I compliment John Hume on the powerful endorsement of his stance. Arising out of that, will the Taoiseach confirm the position in regard to the framework document which has been under discussion for so long?  What steps are being taken to accelerate the process? I understand there are to be further meetings between the Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew later this week.  Finally, on the framework document, will the Taoiseach give us an idea of how it is to be launched? I take it the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will be waiting until after 12 July before launching the document. Will it be publicly launched or submitted to the constitutional parties for consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is continuing between the liaison committee operating on behalf of the two Governments.  The Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew are in regular contact about the contents of the document.  At my latest meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, we also advanced certain aspects of it. Our target is mid-July, which is a very tight schedule.  It is a question of getting <Col N="1394" /> agreement before any decision is taken on how the process will go from there.  It is our hope that that framework document, when completed, will be the basis for a resumption of all-party talks and it is hoped that by then we might see a cessation of violence to allow all parties to participate around the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach believe those all-party talks could take place?  Does he envisage the two Governments responding before the all-party talks begin in a way that can advance the peace process?  In other words, does he envisage the two Governments responding by way of the Irish Government suggesting stronger North-South institutions and the British Government advancing proposals for a power-sharing executive within Northern Ireland?  Does the Taoiseach envisage that happening after the July summit and prior to the talks process or will everything be as a result of the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters about which Deputy Harney inquired are matters for continuing discussion between the two Governments and between the liaison committees operating on behalf of the two Governments.  It is hoped that we can accelerate the process and have it finalised by mid-July to enable the talks process to proceed from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>All the signals from the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin are that they will not say yes or no to the declaration.  In view of the clear point made by both the British and Irish Governments that acceptance of the declaration is now of no importance as far as the IRA and Sinn Féin are concerned, will the Taoiseach agree that the emphasis should now be shifted on their acceptance or rejection of it to a total and outright demand that they cease their campaign of murder and destruction forthwith, regardless of their attitude to the declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The call for a permanent cessation of violence has been <Col N="1395" /> made on numerous occasions by both Governments.  We expect an early response now that the clarification process has ended.  We do not know what that response will be but there is no question in anybody's mind about where the two Governments stand, with or without the paramilitaries' decision we are proceeding. The strongest suport that could be given to the peace process was given yestereday via the ballot boxes in the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;both sides.  There was very strong support for the peace declaration and I do not accept Deputy De Rossa's assertion that it is no longer a matter of importance.  The declaration is the foundation on which the framework document is being constructed and it is there to stay.  It will not disappear from the agenda just because one or other or both sides of the paramilitaries may say so.  We have made it clear that entry to the talks process is after a permanent cessation of violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>M.G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything in the Joint Declaration, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to make it clear to Sinn Féin, the IRA and any other paramilitary organisation that the sort of military display we saw in this city in recent times is wholly unacceptable? Will he tell the House what steps he has taken to deal with that display?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue our efforts.  All people on this island, North and South, have one objective, that is to see the nuclear reprocessing plant closed down.  We are all of the one view in this House, so far as I know, on the approach to that matter.  We will continue to push forward that issue at European level, in the European Parliament and at the European Council of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may have misheard the last question I raised.  My point is not that the declaration is of no consequence &mdash; I am on record as saying that it is a very important and historic document.  It is a basis for peace in Northern Ireland.  Would the Taoiseach agree that, given the rejection of Sinn Féin by the people in Northern Ireland and in the Republic in the recent elections and given the public's knowledge of its support for the IRA, it is of no consequence whether Sinn Féin accepts, rejects or blusters on the question of the Declaration?  What is important is that it be told in no uncertain terms that it must end its campaign of violence, that the people want it to end and want the killing to stop.</P>

      <P>We are having an element of repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the vast majority of people, North and South, reject violence as a means of advancing political objectives.  The Downing Street Declaration states clearly the way forward in pursuing those objectives.  The SDLP received a very strong vote in the European elections &mdash; the Nationalist vote has never been as strong.  Clearly there is overwhelming support for a cessation of violence.  That is what all of us want to see.  Hopefully both sets of paramilitaries will see it that way and will participate in the talks process, but if they say &ldquo;no&rdquo; we will continue to push ahead as the people, North and South, would want us to do, for a just and lasting settlement to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an idea of his hopes for the next six months or year on Northern Ireland? Hopefully an agreed framework will be in place within the next month which will be submitted to the parties.  What does the Taoiseach expect will occur thereafter? What timeframe has he in mind? What expectation has he of progress in the next 12 months in establishing a settlement between the two communities in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree this is a centuries old problem and I do not think anybody would be foolish enough to set a timescale in terms of weeks or months to find a just and lasting solution to it.  The clarification process is over.  If Councillor McMichael gets the clarification he sought on behalf of his community and answers are given to his letter, hopefully it will advance the peace process.  It could advance the opportunity to seek a new accommodation between the communities and between the people North and South.  I think that is the hope of all of us in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopefully when the framework document is ready around mid-July there will be an acceptance by the paramilitaries <Col N="1398" /> on both sides that the continuation of violence is futile and will not advance the objectives of either side.  Both Governments have made clear on a number of occasions that the continuous use of violence to advance political objectives from either community will not bolster their negotiating position around the table. The sooner that message is taken on board by both sets of paramilitaries the better for everybody.  By the time the framework document is ready I hope the paramilitaries will have seen the futility of their actions and resort to the only way forward, which the vast majority of people support, that is the democratic process of the conference table.</P>

      <Quest>the changes, if any, he proposes to make to the guidelines issued to Ministers and Ministers of State on taking office regarding their involvement in firms or business concerns in which they or their families have a financial involvement in view of the controversy surrounding the business migration scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Ministers are informed on taking office of the general principle that they should not engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the duties of their offices.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, makes provision for the comprehensive statutory disclosure by Ministers of their own interests and those of spouses, children and other connected persons.  Among the interests to be disclosed will be any shareholdings, bonds or debentures, or other such investments in companies, enterprises or undertakings.  Any directorships or shadow directorships, as defined by the Companies Acts, would also have to be disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see these provisions as complementing existing arrangements governing conflicts of interest which are clearly set out for Ministers on assuming <Col N="1399" /> office.  The Government is satisfied that, between the Bill and the existing long-standing guidelines, the provisions in this area are more than adequate.</P>

      <P>Regarding the statement on the record of the House of 9 March last in which the Taoiseach told me that Ministers are required to draw the attention of Government to any matter in which they have a beneficial interest, may I ask the Taoiseach if this was done in the case of the investment under the business migration scheme in this company which you wish me not to refer to?</P>

This issue was not a subject for Government decision.  If Deputy Rabbitte is pushing out the boat on this matter perhaps he will tell us if a family business must be discriminated against because some member of the family is a Member of this House.

      <P>The Chair must express concern in respect of accusations by innuendo or otherwise made in the House, and indeed outside the House, against Members of the House.  I have always said if charges are to be made they should be made in a more formal manner by way of substantive motion.  I am always concerned about charges made by innuendo.  This is not a court of law and if there are charges to be made, let it be done in accordance with the procedures of the House.</P>

Since there are guidelines requiring Ministers to draw the attention of Government to any matter in which they have a beneficial interest or where the family has a beneficial interest, may I ask the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, if he drew the attention of the Ministers in question to the fact that he is a beneficiary of the company in question?</P>

      <P>All obligations on me and on Ministers in this or any other transaction have been fully complied with.  Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte or <Col N="1401" /> Members who try to deny that this is an excellent scheme and to damage it would say to the taxpayer that this amount of capital should be raised by, say, a business expansion scheme which would cost the taxpayer £500,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Deputy Rabbitte and the Taoiseach that no Member should be treated in an unfair manner in relation to any family business. However, will the Taoiseach agree that the guidelines outlining what might be reasonably regarded as being in conflict with the public office held should be adhered to?  As that is the situation at present, as the Government takes such a serious view of a potential conflict and the fact that under the new Bill it is proposing prison sentences and other heavy penalties, will the Taoiseach agree it is disingenuous to suggest that he was not aware that a very substantial investment was made in a company which he had built up before he became a Minister and Taoiseach and which has remained in the family?  Would it not be reasonable for a member of the family to say: &ldquo;Great news, we have got an investment of over £500,000&rdquo;?  Is the Taoiseach telling the House that no member of the family, perhaps over a cup of tea or in other circumstances, alerted him to the fact that such a substantial investment in the company was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people who invest money in this country are entitled to respect and not to have their names denigrated and dragged through the mud by those who want to promote jobs here.  Indeed, people who carry out confidential business &mdash; and this has always been recognised by this House &mdash; will be given the protection of confidentiality and treated appropriately. We must not project the image that we do not welcome people wishing to invest in this country.  We must not be hypocritical; we either want investment or we <Col N="1403" /> do not.  This scheme and the ethics Bill will come before the House and Members will have every opportunity to make whatever changes they feel are required but no one has been more forthcoming than I in relation to my business associations, all I own and what I do not own. There have not been many instances where a Taoiseach was involved heavily in business before coming into this House or happens to be involved in business. Perhaps that situation needs further clarification and more guidelines, but for Deputies to come into this House and throw innuendo around like snuff at a wake is doing no service to investment here.  If Members have something to say it should be said in the open where it can be answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare by the eight regional health boards.  Under the legislation governing the scheme the determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board.  The legislation provides also for an appeals process and an appeals officer <Col N="1406" /> has been appointed in every board for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The SWA scheme is designed to offer immediate assistance to people in need and, therefore, a rapid and localised response to supplementary welfare allowance appeals is required.  Given the often urgent nature of provision under the SWA scheme a balance needs to be struck between the introduction of more formality to the appeals system and the need for a speedy response to appeals. The priority is to improve the capacity of the scheme to determine appeals speedily, fairly and with consistency between and within boards.</P>
    <P>Discussions are being held with the health boards on improving the appeals system and next week I will be hosting a major seminar on the appeals system which will be attended by the eight health board programme managers and appeals officers and invited speakers.  The purpose of the seminar is to bring forward proposals for improving the quality of the appeals service to all clients.</P>
    <P>The provision of better information to clients at the initial decision stage is of crucial importance in this regard.  It is important that the basis on which decisions are made is available to clients. I am on record with regard to my intention to publish all such guidance as soon as possible.  Guidelines in relation to rent and mortgage supplementation, for example, are nearing completion and will be published later in the year.  At the end of the review of the appeals arrangements currently under way I intend to set down in regulations the basic operating principles of the SWA appeals system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the matter were not so tragic and serious the Minister's reply would be amusing.  He said that because of the urgent nature of the scheme a hasty decision is required.  Is he aware that the period of appeal can vary from 24 hours in one health board to six weeks in another?  Does he realise that the chances of winning an appeal vary from 50 per cent in the Eastern Health Board to 4 per cent in the Southern Health Board?  Will the Minister bring the social welfare <Col N="1407" /> allowance scheme into line with the other social welfare benefit schemes so that an independent appeals system will operate instead of the &ldquo;ad hocery&rdquo; which exists at present as shown by the FLAC investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a social welfare allowance scheme; it is a supplementary welfare allowance scheme devolved to and administered by the health boards. There is concern about the variation that exists between health boards, which matter is currently under examination.  A seminar is being held with representatives of the health boards to discuss and clarify the approaches taken to different matters which arise.</P>
      <P>There is need to do something further about the question of appeals as they are a matter of concern.  As the Deputy is aware, I established what is generally regarded as a good and successful appeals system in the social welfare appeals office which is an independently operating office.  That is now well established.  I would consider broadening that kind of system into this area.  Where there is discretionary power there will be variations of one kind of another.  We want to minimise them and ensure people have the best possible information.  We must ensure that the guidelines are clearly seen.  However, there will be variations because it is the line of last defence for people who have difficulties and a decision must be made on their case.  I am examining the position and hope to be able to come back with further developments reasonably soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that applicants for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are the most marginalised and least well off people in the community?  Is the Minister telling me it is acceptable for a person with no other income to wait for up to six weeks for the result of an appeal on a decision by a health board not to pay him or her?  Is he prepared to stand over the procedure whereby each health board judges the decision of its own staff, or <Col N="1408" /> will he set up an independent system comparable to the one he mentioned?</P>
      <P>For 18 months we have listened to the Minister say he will issue new guidelines for mortgage and rent payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  How long more must the most marginalised wait until the Minister makes a decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be well aware from the several debates in this House in recent months of the ongoing legal proceedings arising from the delay in 1984 in implementing the equal treatment directive. Three cases in which proceedings have been initiated are to be heard in the High Court next week.  As the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I am constrained from discussing issues which will have to be determined by the courts.  Within these constraints, I have provided all possible information in relation to this matter as evidenced by my recent attendance at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>The estimate of £354 million is based on the cost of paying all those affected by the delay in implementing Directive 79/7 on the basis sought in the legal proceedings. This would involve making double payments in many situations.  For example, where both of a couple were in receipt of a social welfare payment in the period of delay, it would mean paying each of the couple an increase for their spouse as an adult dependant in addition to their personal rate of payment and paying each of the couple the full rate of increases for children.</P>
      <P>Effectively, this would mean paying the same families twice &mdash; two personal rates, two adult dependants and double payments for the children.  It would also mean paying people &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; payments in the form of transitional payments for a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; which they did not suffer.  The payments made to those involved were actually increased on the implementation of equal treatment in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My knowledge of the letter written by FLAC is confined to Deputy Rabbitte's statement during the debate on the Private Members' Motion on this issue on 18 May last.  I have not seen the taxt of the letter nor am I aware of the context in which it was written.  As to the confidentiality <Col N="1412" /> clause itself, the settlement was negotiated and agreed between the legal representatives of both sides, with the consent of both parties to the proceedings. I have already made clear that the confidentiality clause has been a standard feature of the various settlements agreed since 1991, and in each instance, was included in the settlement agreement with the consent of both parties.  Being an agreement made with the consent of both parties, it would not have been possible for either party to impose any condition on the other side.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment further on any negotiations which were involved in reaching these agreements.</P>

      <P>I will keep my questions short if the Minister agrees to keep his replies short.  I wish to raise a number of questions which relate to issues which have been dealt with and which are not affected by the <i>sub judice</i> rule.

      <P>The Minister denied my allegations that he had imposed terms of confidentiality on the settlement reached with FLAC on the steps of the High Court in regard to the 1,800 cases.  He also stated that he did not impose terms of confidentiality on the cases settled with 800 women in Cork city.  FLAC has denied asking for the imposition of terms of confidentiality.  Having regard to the statement by FLAC that it is prepared to allow the terms of the settlement to be made public, will the Minister tell the House the terms of settlement in both cases?  We are speaking about taxpayers' money and the Minister should put on the record of the House the full terms of settlement.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister read the Official Report of the Democratic Left Private Members' Motion in which the FLAC letter was read in full by Deputy Rabbitte?  Will he agree that FLAC made it clear it did not seek a confidentiality clause, rather that it was sought by the departmental representatives and agreed to by FLAC at the time because the Department had sought it?  Given that he has political responsibility for his Department, the <Col N="1414" /> Minister is, therefore, ultimately responsible for the confidentiality clause.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline in more detail the estimate of the cost of the equality payments which are due?  He said that £354 million would be payable and that a number of payments would be double payments.  Will he outline the number of claimants accounted for by this sum of £354 million, the number which are double payments and the number which are transitional payments?  That information can have no effect whatever on the claims before the courts which he says are <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of Government support to assist people with housing costs, either through direct assistance for people in private or public housing or through various reliefs in the tax system.</P>
      <P>Under the income maintenance schemes for which I am responsible, help with housing costs is provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered by the health boards on my behalf.  Under that scheme people dependent on social welfare are entitled to help with rent or mortgage payments in certain circumstances. Expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements under the SWA scheme amounted to some £47 million in 1993.  My Department also administers a separate rent allowance scheme for tenants of formerly rent-controlled dwellings.</P>
      <P>Other schemes of direct housing assistance are operated by local authorities or by voluntary organisations with local authority support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> The question of a housing benefit scheme which would subsume the different schemes which currently exist for assistance with housing costs would have major implications from a financial and administrative point of view and in terms of its possible effects on existing recipients of housing support.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present, in consultation with the health boards, revising the guidelines for the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation under the SWA scheme and the revised guidelines will be available by the end of the summer.  In this context the issue of housing supports is at present under examination in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat bewildered because the Minister has not answered the question asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is nothing new. The Minister says that what is suggested in my question would have major cost implications and so on whereas I suggest it would have major cost savings implications. Would he agree that it is vital to co-ordinate the activities of all those bodies associated with housing, with housing benefit and so on?  Would he agree that at present many voluntary organisations are endeavouring to help people with their various housing needs, people who are not at all adequately provided for under the existing house letting schemes?  Would he not re-examine the possibility of co-ordinating their efforts under the aegis of his Department or, alternatively, reach agreement with other Departments that at least one of them should undertake a co-ordinating role in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the Deputy's question in so far as it applies to my Department, the remaining aspects being applicable to other Government Departments. I have said that we are examining some aspects.  There is not a housing benefit scheme under the aegis of my Department; <Col N="1422" /> I am not responsible for such a scheme.  The Deputy would appear to be saying that perhaps there is a need for one.  It is the Department of the Environment that is responsible for housing. Most of the people the Deputy mentions appear on the Department of the Environment's lists within local authorities, who would provide rent supplements of various kinds, such as rent supports, grants towards housing or whatever.  We are involved only in the supplementary welfare arrangements with regard to rents.</P>
      <P>I have gone somewhat further than my brief in replying to this question.  It may appear to the Deputy that my reply does not specifically cover, say, the responsibilities of the Department of the Environment in that area, but those are issues which would warrant a separate question tabled to another Minister.  We are undertaking a review, part of which could lead to such proposals.  There will have to be some sorting out of that overall position because, among other things, there is a large switch into voluntary housing, as the Deputy will know, which is being supplemented by the Department of Social Welfare rather than the Department of the Environment.  It will be seen that a new position is developing. It was for that reason I initiated this review, to examine overall what is happening. Expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme now amounts to £47 million, a substantial amount.  We are currently examining that position but it is a matter that would have to be referred back to Government.  I cannot give commitments on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear the Minister is making a case for what I am seeking. The position is not that I do not accept a certain amount of what the Minister is saying.  I am making the case for co-ordinating all of these efforts.  My question is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will establish a special review <Col N="1423" /> committee on housing needs and costs comprising of representatives of his Department and the Departments of the Environment and Health including representatives from local authorities and voluntary organisations which would consider the introduction of a housing benefit scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Many efforts are falling between the cracks.  The Department of Social Welfare is doing its own thing whereas the Department of the Environment has responsibility in relation to housing.  My contention is that there should be co-ordination of the efforts of all Departments involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer technically for other Departments.  I can say that I perceive the problem and that we are undertaking a review, following which I will make the position very clear to Government.  Total expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements has risen from £7 million in 1989 to £12.2 million in 1990, £30 million in 1992 and last year £47.9 million, clearly demonstrating that expenditure is increasing substantially on the supplementary welfare scheme. These issues are being addressed and I will make known the outcome of those discussions and review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>With whom is the Minister consulting?  Is he giving the House a commitment that a co-ordinating role will be undertaken by his or another Government Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to say who has the co-ordinating role; that is a matter for the Government.  I have responsibility for a certain number of schemes, one of which is the voluntary housing scheme. There has been a substantial increase in the number of voluntary housing groups throughout the country, responsibility for which is shifting to the Department. That whole issue is being discussed.  I cannot say what the outcome will be but it will be a matter for the Government <Col N="1424" /> to decide.  I am doing the homework to provide the basis on which that matter can be examined in detail by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter for which the Minister has responsibility is the guidelines in relation to exceptional needs payments. Twelve months ago the Minister told us they would be published shortly. Now we are told they will be published by the end of the summer.  What is the reason for the undue delay?  Can the Minister justify that long delay in view of the fact that the bill for supplementary welfare allowance has escalated in relation to rent and mortgage payments? Can the Minister say what proportion of that £47 million is paid by way of rent subsidy to persons on local authority waiting lists who are in subsidised private accommodation?  The vast bulk of the £47 million is haemorrhaging from the system into the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I have given a comprehensive reply to the two questions, one with which most Deputies would be happy.  The matter is under review and I hope to have the outcome of that review in the near future.  These are matters on which the Government must decide and, as I have stated in the reply, have substantial financial consequences.  The matter is being reviewed.  I have established a special committee who are carrying out the review and we will report in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Each year over one million cases are decided by deciding officers, the first decision making level in my Department. Of this number about 18,000 cases, 1.8 per cent, are appealed to the independent appeals office which I set up in 1990.</P>
      <P>In his annual report for 1992, published in September 1993, the chief appeals officer drew attention to the number of appeals awaiting determination and the time taken to dispose of an appeal.  His report shows that the social welfare appeals office received 17,610 appeals during 1992 and that the number of appeals awaiting determination at the end of that year was 7,053.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last autumn I appointed two additional appeals officers to the social welfare appeals office.  A subsequent vacancy in the appeals office arising from the retirement of an appeals officer has also been filled.  I am pleased to say that these increased resources have resulted in a rapid reduction in the number of appeals on hand.  Despite the fact that the number of appeals registered in 1993 <Col N="1426" /> exceeded 18,000 the number of appeals awaiting determination at the end of the year had been reduced to 5,317.  I am pleased to say that this improvement is being maintained and that since the beginning of this year the number on hand has been further reduced to 4,551. I am confident that there is scope for this trend to continue over the coming months resulting in a reduction in the time taken to process appeals.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be pleased to know that I recently set up a new social welfare decisions advisory office to provide better information and advice to customers about how their entitlements are worked out under the social welfare law.  The new office will provide advice and guidance to deciding officers.  There are some 700 deciding officers who determine entitlements in my Department.  Deciding officers are appointed by statute and their powers are set out in the Social Welfare Acts.  They are independent in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The new office will also have the responsibility of improving communication of the decisions to customers. I am particularly keen to see the introduction of individual personalised letters for customers explaining each decision and how it was made in relation to their own individual circumstances, especially where a claim is being disallowed.  The requirements of natural justice will be at the centre stage in improving information for the public.  The new office will help customers to understand better the reasons for the decisions in their cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that for any person dependent on social welfare payments a four to five month delay is unreasonable and unacceptable?  Will he further agree that the ongoing delay in dealing with appeals is putting undue pressure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme?  Is he aware that one of the key recommendations of the FLAC study in relation to the unsatisfactory nature of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was that the undue delay in dealing with appeals by the independent appeals office was putting <Col N="1427" /> pressure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the figures I have given that the social welfare appeals office is doing a good job.  The proportion of appeal cases is 1.8 per cent.  The number of appeals awaiting determination at the end of the year had been reduced from 7,053 to 5,317 and has been further reduced to 4,551.  Since decisions of this kind can involve substantial reassessment or reinvestigation of means from claimants' holdings, obviously there will be some cases which will take a considerable period.  In some instances the information is not supplied.  It is clear that the backlog is being reduced.  I agree with Deputy Allen it is important that the burden be taken from the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, otherwise it will not be available for people who need discretionary payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual report of the appeals office pointed out that of the order of 42 per cent of all people who appealed subsequently had their claim either fully or partially restored.  Will the Minister not agree that such a high figure indicates that wrong decisions are being made at a fairly high rate and that the correct information is not being given to claimants when they make their claim? Will he agree that serious steps need to be taken &mdash; not so much at the appeals level, although steps have to be taken there &mdash; to ensure that staff dealing with claims in the first instance are fully apprised of the rights of claimants so that they are not put through a process of appeals which can take up to four or five months and have to live on supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Appeals on unemployment assistance account for 44 per cent of all the appeals and are the single biggest element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty-two per cent of claimants subsequently have their <Col N="1428" /> claims restored, fully or partially.  These people are on elementary income and are deprived of it while waiting for an appeal to be processed.  They have to live on supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime.  There is something seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment assistance appeals account for the largest proportion of the total.  The steps taken have resulted in the backlog being reduced.  It must be borne in mind that we are talking about 1.8 per cent of all cases; a huge volume of applications is processed without any difficulty.  One of the problems is that the legislation appears to be restrictive; social welfare officers do not have the same discretion as supplementary welfare officers.  In the case of the self-employed it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a person has an income which can give rise to problems in making an assessment and Deputies come across such cases frequently. As an appeal is processed more and better information is provided. Consequently, a solution is found.  By the time a case reaches the appeals office all the information needed to make a decision in favour of the applicant is available.  We are trying to ensure that people receive good information and that is the reason for establishing the decisions office.  I hope it will be of help in making decisions much earlier before a full appeal is heard.  That is the practical way to proceed.  That office has now been set up and will provide the information people need.  Training will also be provided for deciding officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the most satisfactory form of appeal is the oral hearing and that while he may produce figures to show that the appeals process is speeding up oral hearings are not?  What proposals, if any, does he have, to reduce the length of time an applicant has to wait for an oral hearing? I can cite many examples where people had to wait between six to eight months in connection with an application for unemployment assistance which is <Col N="1429" /> usually at the bottom of the list.  I am sure the Minister agrees that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but one would need to examine each individual case to discover the reason for the delay.  It may be that land transfers and other difficulties can lead to delays.  It would be far better if a decision was made before the stage of holding an oral hearing is reached.  That is what we are concentrating on to try to ensure better decisions are made and to reduce the number of cases where an oral hearing is held.  In general, I agree with the Deputy; we are trying to streamline the system under which many appeals are heard and a large number of decisions made.  The number of outstanding appeals has now been reduced.  We are going further and trying to ensure that better decisions are made in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred constantly to deciding officers but I put it to him that the report to which I have referred, the 1993 report of the appeals office, states that over 42 per cent of all appeals resulted in a revised decision partially or fully in favour of the claimant.  This is a horrendous figure given that a person is deprived of the income on which to survive from week to week.  There is a need to ensure that adequate information is provided to a claimant when they make their claim.</P>

      <P>That is the area on which we are concentrating to improve the quality of the information provided to clients and the quality of decisions taken in the first instance, on health matters for example.  If a person is not happy with the decision of a medical referee the matter can be referred to a second medical referee.  It may be that adequate information is not provided to the person concerned who is not properly prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree; this is what the decisions office will be concerned with &mdash; the quality of the decision and the quality of information provided to claimants before an appeal is heard.  For instance, if a person is asked to attend a medical referee it is important that they are given a clear indication of what they should do.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the reduction in the number of appeals outstanding there is a problem, particularly in cases where it is  decided on medical grounds that a person is capable of work and has to attend a second medical referee. Unfortunately, the medical referee is expected to be an expert on all aspects of medical care but he is not.  The problem is that people are advised by their general practitioner and their consultant that they are not fit for work but the medical referee says that they are.  This is unsatisfactory and unfair.  We come across such cases far too often.  I appeal to the Minister to find some way of having an independent arbitrator who would decide.  I know of one man who is anxious to return to work to complete his pension contributions but his medical advisers will not allow him to do so even though the appeals officer says that he is fit for work.  These are genuine cases and the people concerned feel hard done by. While I welcome the reduction in the number of appeals outstanding people are being affected.  This is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>It may be that a company will not allow a person to return to work on medical grounds because of its insurance arrangements; yet, a person may be fit for work after a lengthy period of illness. This gives rise to the question as to whether the person is suitable for the work.  This can be hard to fathom or understand; I have come across such cases.  One would generally expect a consultant's report to be definitive.  That may not be true in all cases but, in general, when an adequate consultant's report is presented it should carry the day for the person involved.  However, on some occasions it does not and I have had <Col N="1431" /> similar experiences to those outlined by Deputy Wallace.  That is where the independent appeals office comes into play. The person involved is no longer dealing with a medical person but with an administrative appeals officer who will consider the matter from all sides to determine whether the complaint is legitimate.  A back problem is one of the most frequent complaints.  In general, a consultant's report should have a major influence on the decision.</P>

      <P>If the Minister believes that he is innocent, is the performance and, more importantly, the attitude of medical referees monitored?  Very often people are treated in a discourteous and abrupt manner, sometimes not even allowed to put their case in the manner they wish. I know a lady who was forced to attend a medical referee on crutches last summer. Even though it was physically obvious that she was unfit for work she was disqualified from receipt of disabilty benefit. I am sure the Minister is well aware of what I am talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> The means testing arrangements for the carer's allowance will be significantly improved.  From next month an earnings disregard of £100 a week will be introduced in respect of working spouses and the standard initial weekly means disregard of £2 will be increased to £6.</P>
    <P>These improvements will mean that an estimated 600 additional carers may now qualify for the carer's allowance where previously no allowance would have been payable.  For example, a carer whose spouse had earnings of £160 a week and who has not heretofore been entitled to any allowance will from next month receive a weekly payment of £37.00.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further 350 existing carers will get increases in their weekly payments.  My Department has already reviewed some 300 cases in payment resulting in an estimated average increase, from next month, of £29.60 where the spouse has earnings.  We have also contacted a further 600 carers, who previously did not qualify for payment, inviting them to reapply as they may now benefit under the new improved arrangements.</P>
    <P>Carers who will not be affected by this change in the means test will benefit from the general 3 per cent increase in weekly payments from next month which will bring the personal rate of the allowance to £61.00.  In addition, a pensioner being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance will, in future, retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance where previously it would have been discontinued because the living alone condition would no longer have been satisfied.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the respite care fund which I launched with £500,000 last year to assist voluntary and community groups who provide respite in a variety of ways for those who week in week out look after the elderly and those with disabilities.  The Government later gave me approval for a doubling of that fund from savings that were made available in my Department.  During 1993 we supported a total of more than 90 separate initiatives put forward by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> I am glad to say that the respite care fund is being continued again this year and was advertised in the national newspapers on 27 April last.  The closing date for receipt of application was last Friday, 10 June, but there is still time for voluntary groups to get their application in over the next few days.</P>
    <P>I introduced the carer's allowance in November 1990, since when the numbers claiming and the costs involved have been increasing steadily.  At the end of 1990 the number of allowances in payment was 2,563 at a cost of £0.4 million. At the end of 1991 the corresponding figures were 3,959 allowances in payment at a cost of £7 million.  In 1992 and 1993 the figures were 4,437 and 4,748 recipients respectively with corresponding expenditure of £11.3 million and £12.2 million respectively.  This year it is estimated that the scheme will cost £14.5 million.</P>
    <P>In introducing the carer's allowance nearly four years ago, I took full account of the vital and essential role played by carers in our society.  That was the first time a basic income maintenance payment was made directly to the carer. Since its inception, the carer's allowance has been expanded and improved each year.  I will continue to improve and develop the scheme as resources permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>

In other words, have they considered making it possible for more people to continue to reside in the family home with back-up from carers rather than being institutionalised in a nursing home and availing of subvention of £120 per week from the Department of Health?</P>

He referred to an expenditure of £14.5 million in 1994, a huge increase on the initial expenditure of £0.4 million in 1990.  I appreciate this matter does not come under his brief, but is he aware of the expenditure on nursing home subventions and grant aids to people who require&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he and the Minister for Health will jointly explore the feasibility of the potential that exists for a carer's allowance payment?  Given the expenditure of £14.5 million on the scheme will he support my view that there is an even greater potential, which may involve more expenditure for people to avail of a carer's allowance in the family home?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire Deputy Callely's innocence in putting forward that proposal which was made last year and which the Minister is still considering.  Will the Minister indicate how many extra persons will qualify for the carer's allowance this year as a result of the improvements? Does the Minister consider it appropriate to have a co-ordinated approach between his Department and the Department of Health in relation to the carer's allowance, the respite care scheme and the home help scheme operated by health boards?  Under such a co-ordinated approach additional expenditure to cover improvements would be self-financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who will benefit directly from the improvements is approximately 1,000, made up of 600 new applicants and others who will receive a substantial increase because their spouse is working.  We will have to wait and see how it works out.  The Department has contacted people with a spouse working who may have applied previously.  The point about co-ordination was made by Deputy Callely, and I agree with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister stated that he wished to promote care within the family home, as far as possible. There is a flaw in the carer's allowance scheme in that it does not allow a carer to live outside the home of the person being cared for even though, in the case of a family, the carer may live next door. Will the Minister agree that a simple adjustment of the rules to allow the carer to live outside the home of the person being cared for should be made?  Will he give an undertaking to consider that proposal sympathetically?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the general question of care.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheme for which I have responsibility is a social welfare scheme specifically for people of low means working full time in the home.  In any consideration of extension, improvement or co-ordination of schemes with the Department of Health, that aspect should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased the Minister acknowledged that 600 new carers only will come into the scheme and that 400 will receive an increased allowance as a result of the budgetary regulations which will come into force next month. What are the Minister's proposals to deal with the other carers &mdash; approximately 6,000 &mdash; who do not qualify for the carer's allowance despite providing a service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year caring for relatives in their homes.  Will he make regulations to enable those people to qualify for the carer's allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme the Government allowed me to introduce in 1990 was for people on low means.  Through the scheme we provide payment equivalent to the long term unemployment assistance, which is one of the higher social welfare payments in that area.  We have extended the scheme to provide for people whose spouses are working, some of whom may have been eligible previously for a reduced carer's allowance. As a result of changes in the budget, approximately 400 people will benefit from an increase in the scheme and approximately 600 new carers will come into the scheme.  Those changes involve extra cost and can be considered only at budget time.  Before the next budget I will consider the scheme and the elements that have been discussed.  The expenditure on the scheme has been increased from £0.4 million in 1990 to £14.5 million allocated this year, a substantial amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into account the demographic changes in society, namely our ageing population and whether the increased numbers taking up the carer's allowance are primarily a result of that phenomenon rather than greater numbers qualifying in terms of their income?  There is an urgent need to address the absence of residential places for the elderly.  Perhaps if a better carer's scheme was introduced pressure on such residential places could be relieved.</P>

      <P>Account must be taken of the approach by the Department of the Environment to housing for the elderly. The fact that the population is ageing will have a considerable effect in the future. In the meantime the improvement in the means test is the main factor which has resulted in the increase in numbers participating in the scheme with approximately 1,000 benefiting from the overmade in the budget, apart from the overall change of the 3 per cent increase which applied to all payments.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise <Col N="1579" /> the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Gay Mitchell &mdash; the need for the immediate introduction of amending legislation or regulations to facilitate the sale of maisonettes and flats in view of legal advice received by Dublin Corporation; (2) Deputy Killeen &mdash; the need for an amendment of the decision in relation to Aeroflot pick-up rights at Shannon Airport, particularly in relation to transit passengers from former USSR states; (3) Deputy Deenihan &mdash; the need for the Minister for Health to intervene in relation to the pay claim by speech and language therapists; (4) Deputy Quill &mdash; the basis on which home-school-liaison teachers have been allocated in view of the failure to allocate such a teacher to schools (details supplied) despite the fact that allocations were made to neighbouring schools where identical factors apply and (5) Deputy Connor &mdash; the serious disruption of the farm development service in County Roscommon due to the transfer of agricultural officers from the service leading to suspension of pollution control and other grant-aided activities of the service.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by Deputies Connor, Killeen, Deenihan and Quill have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 33, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" />&ldquo;33.&mdash;(1)  A person shall not determine or disseminate the starting price on any horse race at a race-fixture at an authorised racecourse save under and in accordance with a starting price licence.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Authority shall, subject to this section, grant a starting price licence, subject to such conditions or restrictions as it sees fit, to a person who is acceptable to it and is nominated by the executive of an authorised racecourse or a body representing authorised racecourses to determine and disseminate the starting price in respect of horse races&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of a nomination by the executive of an authorised racecourse, at race-fixtures at its racecourse, or</P>
    <P>(b) in the case of a nomination by a body representing authorised racecourses, at race-fixtures at any or all racecourses which that body represents.</P>
    <P>(3)  It shall be a condition of a starting price licence that the person who makes the nomination under subsection (2) shall not have any involvement in the determination or dissemination of the starting price or any property rights in relation to the starting price to which the licence relates.</P>
    <P>(4)  In the absence of a nomination acceptable to the Authority under subsection (2), the Authority may grant to another person a starting price licence, subject to such conditions or restrictions as it sees fit, to determine and disseminate the starting price in respect of horse races at race-fixtures at any racecourse specified in the licence in respect of which a starting price licence has not been granted under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(5)  There shall not be more than one starting price determined for the purposes of dissemination in respect of <Col N="1588" /> any particular horse in any horse race at a race-fixture.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Authority may, in order to protect the integrity of the starting price return&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) restrict who may be granted a starting price licence, or</P>
    <P>(b) limit the number of starting price licences.</P>
    <P>(7)  A starting price licence shall be in force for such period as the Authority may decide and in order to protect the integrity of the starting price return different licences may be in force for different periods.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Authority may, in order to protect the integrity of the starting price return, revoke or suspend for such period as it thinks fit a starting price licence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 on the principal list of amendments are being replaced now by one single amendment, amendment No. 23 on the current list.</P>
    <P>The starting price return is the return made by a person at a race fixture which has examined the generality of the odds available to punters at the track and from the on-course bookmakers.  This person takes into account what level of bets is being placed with the different bookmakers at the particular odds and then calculates what he assesses to be the odds which are typically available to punters at the track on each horse at each race at the off.  These odds are then used by bookmakers on the high street for paying bets.  It is obviously critical to the off-course betting scene that the integrity of the starting price return is maintained. The system for returning the starting price for the past few years has been the subject of a contract between the people calculating the starting prices and the Association of Irish Racecourses.  A situation has developed in recent years where two contracts existed and, therefore, for certain events there were two starting prices which, obviously, led to confusion.  It does not protect the integrity of the starting price return and could <Col N="1589" /> have serious consequences for off-course betting on Irish horse racing.</P>
    <P>In the section as published it was not our intention to alter the current regime in any way other than to ensure that as soon as possible there is no more than one starting price disseminated in respect of any race, that the situation whereby two starting prices were being disseminated is not allowed to recur and that the job continues to be carried out by independent and reputable people.  The section did not refer to any association representing racecourses and hence gave the impression that it was intended to allow up to 26 licences, one for each racecourse.  It was not envisaged that it would work out like this in practice.  The proposed amendment clarifies the intention considerably.  It is envisaged that the licence will be issued to an independent and reputable organisation but this will be done on the nomination of the association representing racecourses.  A provision is included to allow individual racecourses to nominate a body.  It is not anticipated that this will be used except in the exceptional circumstances where the association was not able to continue to represent all racecourses.</P>
    <P>There will now be a specific requirement, by the insertion of a new subsection (5), that there will be no more than one starting price returned for any particular horse in any race.  The definition of &ldquo;starting price&rdquo; in the old subsection (6) is also being deleted as, by its nature, the phrase does not lend itself to definition in precise terms suitable for legal terminology and those involved in that aspect of the industry are very familiar with the term and its meaning in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. Section 33 in the Bill as published was parliamentary gobbledygook of the worst order.  With respect to those who drafted it, it meant very little to people in the industry who were trying to make sense of this difficult question.  For the past three years at least there have been two systems of determining the starting price at virtually all racecourses.  We have <Col N="1590" /> had different starting prices on the one horse in the same race published in the different racing press and the national dailies could have a different SP from that in <i>The Sporting Life.</i>  On occasions, when the two systems were operating in parallel, there were two different favourites in the race.  That may seem unlikely but it happened.  There are instances where accumulator bets were struck nominating the favourite and if two different favourites were returned by the racing press&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As we know the bookmakers pay only on the IRS return and that added further to the complication. If there was a differential between the Press Association return and the IRS return, as quite frequently occurred and occasionally the differential was substantial, it caused mayhem.  The integrity of the whole system was brought into question.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's amendment. Above all we must maintain integrity in the system.  There can be no question about how the system operates, it must be above board and transparent.  There can be no confusion that could allow two different SPs to be returned on a horse in a race.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has got it about right.  He is removing the confusion under the present system which was compounded by the section as originally drafted. This appears to be a good section and I look forward to seeing it operate in practice in the best interests of the consumer &mdash; for &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; read &ldquo;punter&rdquo;.  This section seeks to eliminate confusion on starting prices and maintain the integrity of the system beyond question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this amendment. It deals with a very important area in the Bill.  As Deputy Doyle outlined, a ridiculous situation has been prevailing whereby two different sets of starting <Col N="1591" /> prices are being returned.  This has created difficulty on a regular basis because people who are being paid a certain price in the betting offices feel they are entitled to more.  It is ridiculous that such a situation developed and this section will put an end to it.</P>
      <P>Serious consideration should be given before a licence is granted to an independent organisation.  It is important not to have a repetition of the &ldquo;Yellow Sam&rdquo; incident as anyone who was at that race and saw the starting price returned on that horse would have been very surprised. In the interest of protecting the integrity of the starting price it is important that an independent organisation is charged with it.  It should be given to someone with a proven track record and with no question marks over his dealings with racing over a period.  Integrity is vital as someone with bad intentions would have an opportunity to abuse the system.  It is important to have an independent structure that will provide the true starting price.  There may not be a definition but in my book the starting price is the one generally available at the off in any race meeting.  That is the price that must be returned, and it is important that it happens.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I understand an agreement has been reached between the Irish Racing Services and the Press Association, the two groups now providing SPs at racecourses.  Under the aegis of the Association of Irish Racecourses there has been agreement to amend the terms of access of the Press Association to racecourses, thus ensuring that from now on they will take the SP returns of the IRS. In a sense the industry has seen the writing on the wall in terms of what the Minister is trying to achieve and only one body, the IRS, will be making the SP returns available for the Press Association to publish.  Having said that will the Minister state whether there is any risk of returning to a monopoly?</P>

    <P>I feel comfortable with what I understand to be the new arrangement that will soon be announced given that the <Col N="1592" /> Association of Irish Racecourses has brokered it.  Concern was expressed in regard to the monopoly and the prices the IRS was charging the media generally before the Press Association gained access to the racecourses.  That concern was caused by an apparent monopoly in the delivery of the SP returns.  Is there any possibility that we would get back to that with the new agreement that is about to be reached?  I am happier now because it is with the agreement of the Press Association that this new arrangement is about to be put in place and I understand that the Association of Irish Racecourses will have a say in the price Irish Racing Services charge the media for the general racing returns, including SP returns, that it will sell as their product.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister concerned that if a single company provides SP returns and the other racing information services, there will be a monopoly in this area and that there could also be a question of overcharging?  Is the Minister satisfied that the new arrangement will be satisfactory?</P>

      <P>First, I thank Deputies Doyle and Power for speaking on this amendment and accepting it.  We have had wide-ranging discussions with various interests and sought to have this amendment to cover all eventualities, to ensure the transparent return of starting prices and to have one starting price. Subsection (4) of the amendment states that &ldquo;the Authority may grant to another person a starting price licence, subject to such conditions or restrictions as it sees fit ...&rdquo;.  I believe that addresses the Deputy's concern in relation to monopolies or any other activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question in relation to section 34 (b) (ii) which refers to regulations made under the Totalisator Act, 1929?  In the interest of clarity I would like the Minister to put on record exactly what that refers to.  Is there any risk it could be interpreted to confine the tote indefinitely to on-course betting? What is the point of that subsection given that ours is the only tote in the world that loses money, and it is a monopoly.  I am concerned about the future operation of the tote.  We need to hear the Minister's views on this subsection and whether there is any risk that it could in fact <Col N="1594" /> narrow the operation of the tote in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that much criticism was voiced on Second Stage that the existing tote is not making money and that it is probably one of the few tote operations that has not been able to pay its way.  The provisions of the Bill will affect the tote and how it may be structured and will allow the Authority to reorganise the way in which the tote is operated so as to put in place the structure which will be more efficient and, hopefully, more profitable.</P>
      <P>In this section, the Authority or company of the Authority may hold and operate a totalisator licence.  This is a continuation of the provision in the 1945 Act simply giving the Authority power to operate a tote betting service.  This section allows for the service to be provided by a subsidiary company.  The Authority or the subsidiary company could then go into joint ventures if necessary on developments in this area.  An amendment of the Totalisator Act in section 63 of this Bill will remove the one technical restriction in that Act which would have prevented the extension of tote betting to, for example, the high street.  What we are doing is allowing that to happen.  Simple amendments to the Department of Finance tote regulations and the Racing Board's tote licence could then provide for such an extension of the tote if the Authority makes a case for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at this point but this section will allow the Authority to examine the tote and see for itself that it is not making a profit and is not providing the service which the racecourse operators or the punters want.  It will be a matter for the Authority at the earliest possible time to rationalise the tote as it sees fit and, if necessary, set up an independent stand alone company to provide this service efficiently and profitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>SECTION 35.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 35 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be strongly opposing this section.  In the absence of hearing the Minister's detailed views on the necessity of having the section in the Bill, I find it difficult to understand why the State now needs to become involved in the role of bookmaker.  It cannot operate the tote efficiently and it is now telling us that there is something in relation to the new semi-State Authority that is being established that will operate the bookmaker business better than the private sector is doing at the moment.</P>
      <P>I see no logical reason for the State to become involved in the business of bookmaking.  There are those who question whether it should have the monopoly with the tote section but that is a matter for the new Authority to examine.  Will the Minister put on record his thinking as to the logic in extending to the State Authority the role of bookmaker?  Legislation exists in relation to bookmakers. There are some difficulties in relation to bookmakers; updating and amending might be necessary but there is one call I have not heard from any sector of the racing industry and that is for the State to become involved in the bookmaker business.  I am not sure why the Minister feels he can set the State up in competition to the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have talked about this Bill nationalising horse racing.  This is one area where the Minister thoroughly deserves that tag.  I firmly believe that the philosophy of the Minister's party is that the private sector should be allowed to get on with providing services and products generally and that the only role of the State is protecting the common good or providing a service the private sector cannot or does not provide well.  Perhaps I am missing the point but I fail to see why the new Racing Authority, a semi-State <Col N="1596" /> Authority, needs to set itself up as a bookmaker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Doyle in questioning this section.  It goes to extraordinary lengths to make clear what the Minister has in mind because it explicitly refers to the formation of a company to perform the functions conferred on the Authority by the Bill as set out in section 10.  They are widely drawn although one has been removed.  It refers to the operation of a totalisator and the Minister has drawn our attention to section 63 of the Bill which covers that.  It then goes on to state that it can form a company for the sole purpose of carrying on business as a bookmaker.  Who wants this?  I am not sure that Deputy Power is hell bent on there being more bookmakers, particularly if there is one which will not be accessible to the Deputy and would be impervious to his blandishments at any time in the future if, as I am sure he does, the Deputy wishes to expand his business.</P>
      <P>It is inappropriate at a time when there is substantial rationalisation of the bookmaking business.  It is out of keeping with that to talk about setting up a new bookmaker. Many people in the business have a more colourful word than &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; for what has been happening in the industry over the last number of years.  The last thing the industry needs is for a State company to become involved. People at race meetings do not grab your elbow and say they want the State involved in the betting industry.  Unless the Minister has a good, solid reason &mdash; I have not heard or seen it &mdash; he will need a third list of amendments to modify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation came from the industry.  It is not intended under this section to allow the Authority to operate as a bookmaker.  It will allow a subsidiary of the Authority to apply for a bookmaker's licence.</P>

      <P>It is qualified further in section 36 that such a company could only <Col N="1597" /> be established with the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance. Deputies are concerned about the risks that may be involved in a State body operating as a bookmaker.  It is almost 50 years since a Racing Board Bill was enacted and it may be as long again before such a major change as this is made.  If there are developments during this time which would make the bookmaker option a desirable one to pursue this section would allow for that.</P>

      <P>There are on-course and off-course bookmakers.  In the last few years a betting office was opened at Leopardstown race track for the first time in the history of Irish racing.  It was a tremendous success but the on-course bookmakers objected to it.  It was situated away from the betting ring and it brought people out from there.  It made a number of changes which prevented the betting office on the track taking bets on Irish racing.  They could only bet on British racing.  Eventually after a lot of controversy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital that agreement is reached between on-course and off-course bookmakers.  I was in Leopardstown last Wednesday and the busiest bookmaker on the track was the one who was betting on the night racing in Britain. There is a demand for that.  If we cannot attract customers to the race track it will not survive.  It is important to give the customer what he wants and if the Minister's efforts help to achieve that, so much the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Deputy and the Minister propose that this Authority would go to the trouble of setting up a company solely devoted to carrying on business as a bookmaker to take bets on night racing in England?  The Minister has not given any reason for this except that it might be another 50 years before the Act is modified and, in the meantime, it might be handy to have this provision. That ain't no way to run a railroad.  There are umpteen other things the Authority might decide it would like to do sometime in the next 50 years for which the consent of the Ministers might be required.  It has wisely been said: &ldquo;There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in our philosophy&rdquo; but we do not legislate for them.  If the Minister does not have a specific reason for making this provision he should not do so.  If, in 24 years' time, the Authority needs some power the Minister of the day could bring an amendment to the Act before the House.  To say that someone might have a gleam in their eye sometime in the next 50 years is the reason we need this provision is nonsense and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contribution by Deputy Power. May be the ethics Bill should indicate he would declare from where his expertise in this area comes.  We know but others reading the Dáil report may not be so <Col N="1599" /> well versed.  His point is well made but it has nothing to do with what we are talking about.  There is need for debate as to whether we have on-course bookmaker shops such as were driven recently from Leopardstown.  We should look after the consumers' wishes and examine their demands in this area.  I have heard the consumer demanding that the State provide this service.  The Minister has not said why we should legislate for the State to become involved in the bookies business. I suggest that the State stays a million miles away from it.  Enough bookmakers are struggling to make a living without adding competition from the new Racing Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the authority would not set up as a bookmaker.  With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, we are speaking to two sections &mdash; I do not know whether this is advertently or inadvertently. I was referring to section 35. Section 36 states that the authority may, either by itself or with another person, promote and take part in the formation of establishment of a company.  In other words, the authority can become involved in the bookmakers' business either on its own or with others.  The bookmaking industry, a private sector industry, should stand on its own feet. This provision is indicative of the Minister's philosophy regarding this Bill.  I am surprised that he, a Fianna Fáil Minister, would want to nationalise the bookmaking industry or allow the State to get involved in it.  There is absolutely no need for this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>God help us if we do not get an opportunity to discuss this multi million pound industry some time within the next 50 years.  This provision is unacceptable in the extreme and I ask the Minister to delete sections 35 and 36 (1) (c).  There is no logical reason this provision should be included in the Bill.  The Minister said that the industry has demanded that the new racing authority should be able to set up as a bookmaker but he has not given us even one reason the industry made this demand or told us which components of the industry are in favour of <Col N="1600" /> this provision.  Is it the Association of Irish Racecourses, the Turf Club, the regulatory body, the chairman, certain members of the board, some of his special advisers or a sectional interest who want the new authority to become involved in the bookmaking industry?  We need to know this information as the integrity of the new board has already been besmirched by the nomination procedure proposed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>If there is another reason for the inclusion of this provision in the Bill then we should be told what it is.  We will debate the Ethics in Government Bill next week or the week after, and the way we behave in this House and the reasons certain provisions are included in legislation must be totally transparent.  This Bill must be in the best interests of the horseracing industry and the consumer. However, I see nothing in sections 35 or 36 (1) (c) which leads me to believe that this provision is necessary.  On the contrary, bookmakers, a private sector component of the horseracing industry, should be allowed to stand on their own feet and sink or swim depending on market forces.  There should be no distortion of this industry by including a provision in legislation which will enable the authority to become involved in it.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Power would have a stronger view on this issue.  I accept his lecture about the Leopardstown Racecourse needing its own bookmakers' office, but I still do not know his views on whether the State should become involved in the bookmaking industry.  I suspect that he agrees with me but I understand the delicate position in which he finds himself.  I would like to hear his views on this matter and promise not to call a vote if he is straight with me.  I do not understand what Deputy Power and his colleagues in the bookmaking business stand to gain from supporting legislation which will enable the State to become involved in their industry.  Does the Minister really want to nationalise a private sector industry?  Can he give me one reason section 35 should be included in the Bill?</P>

      <P>This section was included in the Bill on the recommendation of the industry.  The part of the industry which made this recommendation was composed of a broadly based group which included the Turf Club, the Racing Board and the Association of Irish Racecourses.  It was a unanimous recommendation of what is generally known as the Dowling Committee. This enabling provision was included in the Bill to allow the authority to establish a company sometime in the future with the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance.  Permission to do this would not be given unless serious research was first carried out and detailed proposals submitted which would justify such a development in the future.</P>

Has the Minister accepted the principle of the Dowling Committee recommendation that the new racing authority may own on or off course bookmaker shops on its own or as a joint venture?  The Minister said that the Turf Club, the AIR and others suggested that this provision be included in the legislation but I still do not know the case they put forward which persuaded the Dowling Committee <i>et al</i> that the new racing authority should become involved in on and off course bookmaker shops. What case did they put forward?  I do not understand why the private sector cannot continue to operate the bookmaking business.  If there is a reason it should not continue to do this I have failed to extract <Col N="1602" /> it from the Minister, apart from a statement that representatives of the industry wanted the authority to become involved in the bookmaking industry.

At the very least, if the Authority is to establish, lease and operate racecourses it should be obliged not only to give notice to the executives of all authorised racecourses who will be affected but endeavour to get some agreement from them &mdash; the purpose of this amendment &mdash; to provide that this be done subject to the agreement of a majority of the executives of all authorised racecourses.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 28, which is related, is to insert, at the appropriate place, a specific and explicit condition that racecourses operated by the Authority would be subject to the same conditions of authorisation as any other authorised racecourse because that is not clear from the text of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can give us any more reason than he did in the course of the last discussion why he believes the Authority should establish racecourses.  Other members, I willingly admit, are more intimately and frequently acquainted with all these matters than, I, I regret to say; I wish I had more time for them &mdash; but our problem is that we possibly have too many racecourses. There have been occasions in the not too distant past when problems led to the closure of a racecourse.  There are several places nationwide which I will not name because I do not want to embarrass anybody, where racecourse executives are put to the pin of their collar to devise ways of ensuring that their racecourse continues in existence and has the wherewithal to provide the facilities punters want.  Deputy Power knows perfectly well what I am talking about in relation to one racecourse.  They are using their ingenuity to ensure that their racecourse survives.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister stipulated that this new Authority will have the statutory right to establish or lease and operate racecourses.  The Minister would have to give us some explanation if he simply came forward and asked that the Authority be given power to lease an existing racecourse, but he <Col N="1605" /> wants it to have the power to establish a new racecourse, or racecourses, at various venues nationwide.  What evidence suggests that we do not have sufficient racecourses?  Can the Minister tell me that the complaints and difficulties voiced by racecourse authorities nationwide are without foundation, that there is no problem of two many venues and that we could do with a couple of new racecourses run by an Authority established by the State?  I have not heard anything to indicate that the Irish racing industry lacks a few extra racecourses to be run by the State.  Yet the Bill wants to give the Authority power to do these things.  I want to know why the Minister thinks we may need extra racecourses, what is the evidence, what would their function be and how would they fit into the present scheme of things?  If they are to be established by this Authority or leased and operated by it, how will they be regulated? I do not like the idea of an Authority which has the power, under the terms of this Bill, to lay down conditions for the authorisation of racecourses being able to operate a racecourse without being specifically charged with the duty of observing the standards it stipulates for other authorised racecourses.  I do not like the Authority being judge and jury in its own case, particularly when it is a matter of getting into competition with people already in the business of running racecourses; that is an extremely bad principle.  The fact that somebody suggested it would be a good idea to have this power in case it might be needed over the next 50 years is not an argument for inserting such a provision.</P>
    <P>The sensible way of going about this would be to recognise what the dogs in the street, or perhaps the horses on the road, will tell you any day of the week, that our problem as far as the number of racecourses is concerned is that many venues are competing for events and fixtures; that we would be doing a very good job if we got an Authority that could compile a list of events and fixtures in comfortable and convenient racecourses. If we could be confident of a series of attractive fixtures in existing racecourses <Col N="1606" /> and persuade more people to attend them, we would not have any worries about the idea of setting up new racecourses. I want to know the Minister's thinking on that.  Let us have none of this &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; somebody might feel it was a good idea over the next 50 years to set up this Authority, that we want to have this power included.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another possibility and I should like the Minister to tell me whether this is behind the proposal. Giving powers to the Authority to establish or lease and operate racecourses might be the way of undertaking what might be described as a rationalisation of racecourses by the Authority; in other words, the Authority would need the power, to become a tenant, take a lease on or purchase a racecourse and, to have that power, something like this provision would have to be inserted in the Bill, when it would move in as a tenant or an owner of a racecourse to close it down. Is that the reason the Minister is inserting this power into this Bill?  If it is he should inform us of that fact because we should know what we are getting into before we give these powers to the Authority.  Is this one of these &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; provisions, in case somebody might think it was a good idea over the forthcoming 50 years? Is it being inserted because we do not have sufficient racecourses or because the Minister feels he might want to have an instrument to acquire racecourses and close them down as part of a rationalisation procedure?  We need answers before giving an Authority the kind of power sought in this section.</P>

      <P>I will pick up where Deputy Dukes left off &mdash; or could this be the Mallow racecourse clause?  Perhaps that is what this section is all about, that if by fair means or foul the Minister cannot acquire Mallow racecourse the new Authority will be able to move in, lease or operate it.  Is that what is in the Minister's mind?  Under the provisions of sections 35 and 36 the Minister has effectively attempted to rationalise the bookmaking industry and section 38 seeks more rationalisation of the horseracing industry. <Col N="1607" /> This new Authority, whenever it wishes and for whatever motivation, may decide to move in and take over, lease, purchase or control racecourses throughout the country and close them down. What is the hidden agenda in relation to this section and what is it really about? As Deputy Dukes said, is it another &ldquo;just in case clause&rdquo;?  Will it be another 50 years before we come back to discuss this industry again?  I see no logic for extending the remit of the Authority over and beyond that of the present board. Is it beyond doubt that any racecourse owned and operated or leased by the new Authority will be subject to the exact same standards and <i>modus operandi</i> of all other privately owned racecourses? If not, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the Minister's amendment No. 33, which seeks to delete lines 25 to 30 and substitute &ldquo;to license racecourses under the Rules of Racing&rdquo;, extends to all racecourses including those owned and operated by the board which will transfer to the Authority.  I assume it also extends to any racecourse that the Authority may, after giving notice to the majority of the executives of all authorised racecourses, establish or lease and operate and that they will, whatever their relationship with the new Authority, be operated to the same standards and requirements as those in the private sector.  Under the provisions of section 38 why are the present powers of the board being extended in relation to the operation, maintenance and closing down of racecourses?  We want to know the real agenda.  What racecourses are for the chop?  What has been decided by the Minister and the triumvirate that put all this together?  Three committees later we still have the <i>a la carte</i> version.  Did the Dowling committee recommend this too and, if so, at what page in the Dowling committee report so that I can see exactly what in the legislation is relative to the Dowling committee?  Is there an agenda with some of those whom the Minister has spoken with privately and, <Col N="1608" /> if so, what is it all about?  What is the future for Wexford, Kilbeggan and Roscommon and the smaller racecourses which are vital to the local economy? Racecourses are a very important part of the leisure industry in the towns and the hinterland they serve.  Why further rationalise an industry that should be left to the private sector?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes on this section.  This section is a nonsense because the dogs in the street know that there are many tracks in the country struggling for survival.  It is beyond the bounds of possibility that a new track will open at any time in the future following the financial disaster that occurred in the Phoenix Park.  The only locality that could possibly sustain a new track in the future is Cork city.  Like Deputy Doyle I ask what is the position about Mallow racetrack and why is it cloaked in secrecy?  Will the Minister tell us the likely future of that track.  The inclusion of this section is a nonsense.  I ask the Minister to look at the existing 27 tracks with a view to some type of rationalisation of racing in each of those tracks.  There is no doubt that the mixed bag on offer to some of the country tracks, such as Dundalk and Wexford, is neither viable nor attractive to punters. The Dundalk track took a wrong turning many years ago when flat racing was promoted for, perhaps, a particular individual's benefit and when the national hunt racing, which was essential to that track, was sidelined.  I prefer flat racing but it is not suited to tracks such as Dundalk, Wexford or Bellewstown.  The new Authority should have a role in identifying the future of these tracks because there is no doubt that in the next ten years several tracks will cease racing.  The inclusion of this spurious section is a nonsense. As Deputy Doyle asked, what is the hidden agenda about Mallow race track and why can we and the racing world not be told what is its future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very straightforward section.  First and foremost this section emanated from section 14 of the <Col N="1609" /> 1945 Act and has been in existence for some considerable time.  This section gives the new Authority power to establish, lease, maintain, develop and operate a racecourse.  Before it leases or operates a racecourse the Authority must inform the executives of all existing racecourses.  Amendment Nos. 27 and 28 are being taken together.  Amendment No. 27, if accepted, would require the Authority to get the agreement of a majority of the existing racecourses before it could establish a racecourse.  If adopted, this amendment would allow the existing racecourses to prevent the Authority from ever establishing a racecourse even where such a course of action might be in the best interests of the horseracing industry.  Surely, if a majority of the racecourses felt that the Authority should not establish a particular racecourse they should use their two places on the Authority to persuade the other members of the Authority not to support the development.  I could not, after going to such lengths to create a good representative balance of interests of the whole industry on the new Authority, then give a veto on certain developments to one particular section of the industry.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 28, Deputies Doyle and Dukes wish to have it stated in section 38 that a racecourse operated by the Authority or a subsidiary will be subject to the same conditions of authorisation as any other authorised racecourse.  There are no exclusions to the application of the provisions of section 59, which deals with the authorisation of racecourses.  Therefore, this amendment is not necessary and I oppose both amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of tracks in the country are privately operated; only a small number is owned and operated by the racing board.  Reference has been made to Wexford, Kilbeggan and other racecourses. Certainly the consumers in those areas go racing and would wish racing to continue in those areas.  On Second Stage Deputy McGahon bemoaned the fact &mdash; many people agree with him &mdash; that the Phoenix Park and Baldoyle closed down. This was not due to insufficient punters <Col N="1610" /> or the lack of people to support racing but the problem lay with the type of racing provided there.  Under the provisions of this section the new Authority can examine a privately operated track which wants to go out of business when the consumers in the area wish to keep it in existence.  Apart from Navan, Tipperary and Leopardstown &mdash; the Curragh is operated by the Turf Club &mdash; all other racecourses are operated privately.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred specifically to Mallow.  The position is that agreement has been reached with the private owner, Mr. Fahey; the minute details of the transaction are still being worked out. I had hoped that they would have been worked out long before now because, as Deputies are aware, an allocation has been provided to modernise that race-track. In the southern part of the country, particularly in Cork, there are sufficient racegoers and people interested in the horseracing industry to support it.  As everybody who has attended it knows, the facilities are not great and need to be upgraded.  This section is the old section 14 of the 1945 Act and it is appropriate that it should be included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given an alternative to his previous excuse on the previous amendment &mdash; the idea that we might need it some day &mdash; the hairiest old one in the book, that is, this power has been in existence since the 1945 Act was passed.  We all know this, but the section the Minister is talking about will give the Authority powers to establish, lease and operate racecourses.  Will the Minister indicate how many new racecourses have been established since 1945, outline the circumstances under which they were established and state if he expects similar circumstances to emerge in the future?  I already know the answer to the first part of that question but I am interested in hearing the Minister's answer to it as well as to the second and third parts.  It is not enough to say that because this power has been in existence since 1945 for a different kind of Authority and a different set of circumstances we should carry it on.  While the Minister <Col N="1611" /> seems to be prepared to contemplate the possibility that the position might change some time in the next 50 years and we should therefore give the Authority unspecified powers to do certain things, he does not seem to recognise that the position could change so much that the powers that already exist could be totally irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me how many racecourses have been established since 1945 under the provisions of the 1945 Act?  Under what circumstances were such racecourses, if any, established? Why does the Minister expect similar circumstances to emerge in the foreseeable future?  Otherwise, he has no reason to include this section.</P>

      <P>I will answer the question for Deputy Dukes: no tracks have been established.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Phoenix Park.  That was a terrible disaster for Irish racing, apart from the individuals who invested a large sum of money in it.  Is there any vestige of hope that racing will return to that venue, perhaps a different type or a more varied programme?  The facilities there are on a par with those provided at any race track in Britain or France; the turf is excellent.  I understand that it could be reinstated in two to three months.  It is a tragedy that this beautiful track in the centre of Dublin is not being used.  If the Minister considers that it does not have a future as a race track surely the Government could use it as a national recreation and sports centre. The Government should acquire it.  As someone who used to enjoy racing there I ask the Minister to encourage the sport to consider the possibility of reintroducing racing there, perhaps not on the same grandiose scale but it should be utilised for the benefit of racegoers and the horseracing industry.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> Does the Minister consider that there is a conflict of interest in the chairman-elect of the new Horseracing Authority calling for the establishment of a casino as part of an overall package at the Phoenix Park?  There are those who would advocate the establishment of a casino &mdash; they have their own following &mdash; but experience in other countries shows that the operation of casinos is in direct conflict with the success of the horseracing industry. Is there a conflict of interest in the chairman-elect of the Horseracing Authority calling for the establishment of a casino at the Phoenix Park?  I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>

      <P>We are legislating to take us into the middle of the next century. I am aware that there are at least two racecourses which have a difficulty with the ground at their present locations; the tracks are not very good. They have plans to relocate.  They may not be in a position to continue to operate but consumers at those locations want them to continue.  Under this section the new Authority in its wisdom will have an opportunity to acquire the tracks or continue racing on new tracks.</P>
      <P>It is my personal wish that racing would continue at the Phoenix Park but the market will dictate.  I will convey the views of those Deputies who have stated that it is their wish that racing would continue to the new Authority.  This would be a matter for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sensible section.  Where consumers want racing to continue at an existing racecourse or at a new location the Authority will have an opportunity <Col N="1613" /> to acquire the existing racecourse or establish a new one in the general locality.</P>

      <P>In page 21, line 19, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was intended originally to provide in the Bill for the continued representation of the regulatory body at international events at which the governing bodies previously had representation and at other events to be decided by the Authority. Also, the function of licensing racecourses was omitted from the Bill.  In error the functions stated were restricted to race fixtures.  The Turf Club was also <Col N="1614" /> concerned that there was no mention of its other activities, such as operating the Curragh racecourse, and that these provisions might restrict its functions in the future.  The amendment covers all those issues.  The functions are now stated to be &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  The Turf Club as a private body may therefore commence or continue to carry out its functions including operating racecourses, provided they are lawful and not inconsistent with its regulatory functions under this Act and are not functions assigned to another body, such as the Authority under this Act.  Where it was inappropriate, the reference to &ldquo;race fixtures&rdquo; was deleted and reference to representation of horseracing abroad was also deleted as that is a practical day to day affair to be dealt with as the need arises and is not appropriate to legislation. The licensing of racecourses as a function of the regulatory body is inserted in the new paragraph (d)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no overall difficulty with the Minister's amendments.  They go a long way towards improving this section which was quite contentious as originally published.  The Minister is introducing a reference to the licensing of racecourses.  Why did he omit the licensing of jockeys and race horse trainers? He will probably tell me that is superfluous and that the Turf Club will continue to carry out its functions in that regard unless responsibility for the matter is changed in the legislation.  It would have been tidier to include all of the Turf Club's remit under one section. I am unsure as to why the Minister omitted those functions of the Turf Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what the Minister means about representation overseas.  Am I correct in understanding that members of the Turf Club or the racing regulatory body can continue to attend race meetings overseas in an official capacity or otherwise without the consent of the Authority?  I assume the new racing Authority will not have the final say in regard to the regulatory body attending race meetings abroad.  Paragraph (d), as printed in the Bill, insisted on the Authority <Col N="1615" /> considering it appropriate for the new regulatory body to represent Irish horseracing outside the State.  Am I correct in understanding that the new racing regulatory body can continue to represent Irish horseracing outside the State and that the Authority will not need to deem it appropriate for it to do so?  In other words, is it free to go as it pleases? Is that a correct interpretation of the position?  Otherwise, the Minister's amendments improve this section.</P>

      <P>I will address amendment No. 36 first. Subsection (1) is rewritten in its entirety to make its intention absolutely clear. When the regulatory body is setting its charges under section 40 it must take into account all the revenue it receives from the management of funds acquired by it in the course of performing its functions under the Act.  Because there was not this clear distinction in law before the publication of this Bill the position in regard to funds collected before the establishment day is dealt with by a provision that the regulatory body must also take into account revenue from funds held on that day on behalf of owners and others licensed under the Rules of Racing.  This is necessary to include official funds for the benefit of the industry and to exclude all private funds of the Turf Club in which the State has no interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's final point is covered by my amendment.  The Minister's amendment refers to all revenue from the management of funds held by the racing regulatory body collected or acquired in the course of performing its <Col N="1618" /> functions under the Act and revenue from the funds held by that body on behalf of racecourse owners or persons licensed by the racing regulatory body under the Rules of Racing.  What the Minister intends is what I want to happen, but the industry believes that if this matter was tested in court there would be ambiguity in relation to the wording of the Minister's amendment. My amendment strengthens the Minister's case in that it clearly states that the funds referred to in the Minister's amendment should exclude funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and are under the direct control of its trustees. As the Minister's amendment highlights, there can be no argument about the funds managed on behalf of owners or persons licensed by the racing regulatory body, but there is ambiguity as to the status of the funds which are now under the direct control of the trustees of the Turf Club, for example, investments as a result of running its shop efficiently over the years. That matter needs to be put beyond doubt.  Therefore, will the Minister accept my amendment which strengthens the point made in his?</P>

      <P>A great deal of time was spent discussing this matter.  I had discussions with representatives of the Turf Club because they want the matter to be clear.  Amendment No. 36 was tabled following consultation and consensus with the Turf Club.  I reiterate that this amendment is necessary because we want to exclude all private funds of the Turf Club in which the State has no interest.  The Turf Club was concerned that the State might get its hands on some of its private funds.  I believe the Turf Club is happy with the position.  Deputy Doyle's amendment suggests the insertion in the Bill of a statement to the effect that the revenue from the management of funds which the regulatory body must take into account when determining its charges &mdash; referred to in section 41 &mdash; does not include funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and are under the direct control of its trustees.  That is not necessary as section 41 (1), as amended <Col N="1619" /> by amendment No. 36, is very clear on the question of funds.  All other funds are excluded.  It would be a duplication to insert a list of funds which are not included.  I oppose amendment No. 37 on the basis that my amendment adequately covers the position.  This matter was discused in detail and I understand the Turf Club is satisfied with the position.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw my amendment if I have leave to resubmit it on Report Stage.  Will the Minister check again with the Turf Club on this matter before we take Report Stage tomorrow? It is my understanding that its legal advisers want to put beyond doubt the question of funds directly controlled by its trustees. What the Minister and I are trying to achieve for the Turf Club is the same thing.  My information differs slightly in emphasis from that of the Minister. Given that there are substantial funds held under the direct control of the trustees of the Turf Club, we do not want to give a day in the sun to the legal people in trying to establish the nuances of the section.  Their legal advice is that it needs to be put beyond doubt, lest it is ever challenged.  So long as the wording of my amendment does not conflict with the Minister's intention, I ask him to accept it if it copperfastens beyond doubt the point made.  Perhaps we could come back to this on Report Stage and the Minister might consult his contacts on this, who I suspect may not be different from mine.</P>

      <P>Integrity services are defined as meaning those services at a racecourse provided at a race-fixture or related to the running of it which are operated by or on behalf of the Racing Regulatory Body for the purpose of <Col N="1621" /> enforcing discipline and ensuring the horses are run fairly and properly.  The balance which we will have with the new Authority will ensure there is integrity and fair play in as far as is possible in this sport.  The industry would decline rapidly without transparency and the clear perception that horses run fairly and up to their full merit.  The point has been made repeatedly that in the racing industry the consumer is all important and it is my intention to ensure that integrity, fairness and above board practices apply throughout the industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the consumer.  I am thinking of the consumer who might have had his or her monthly mortgage repayment on Flashman, which was beaten last week at the Curragh in the most blatant display of non-trying I have ever seen.  What consolation is there for the consumer, who may have lost six months mortgage repayments in the Flashman incident when the jockey was dealt with by way of an Irish solution to an Irish problem, namely, a suspension for four days? The horse was given an easy run in the open spaces of the Curragh in the full glare of television cameras.  How does the Minister propose to deal with that type of horseracing?  Does the Minister accept that where a man has been found guilty of injudicious riding a four day suspension is a severe enough penalty? Will the Minister agree that is one of the reasons there has been a dwindlng in attendances at Irish tracks?  More and more people are in the SP offices watching and betting on English races.</P>

      <P>The regulatory body has been responsible for the integrity services for two centuries.  There is general agreement that by and large there is integrity in Irish racing and the Rules of Racing are enforced fairly and adequately.  Of course, there are occasions when this type of incident occurs.  The racing industry will be much improved with the reorganisation of the industry, a good representative authority and an increase in prize money.  Prize money will be an <Col N="1622" /> extremely important attraction for owners, jockeys and everyone involved in trying to win the race.  In the classics, group and listed races where there is generous prize money that type of incident does not occur.  When account is taken of all those matters there will be better and fairer racing and consumers will be protected and given a fair deal for their investment.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the manner in which Deputy McGahon has made a scapegoat of a jockey and a trainer.  In his contribution we have seen a repetition of the manner in which he referred to another trainer involved in a race in Leopardstown a few years ago. The jockey in question had to account for the riding of the horse and received a holiday this week when he would much prefer to be in Ascot.  We have a body referred to as part of the integrity services of racing.  The experts are always in the stands and able to judge where the jockey went wrong and where the horse was not trying.  Stewards look after that.  In the incident to which Deputy McGahon referred, the jockey was found not to have made a sufficient effort and for that reason was suspended for a few days. There could be 101 reasons why that happened and the Deputy is wrong to single out a trainer and a jockey.</P>

It is just too bad that he has not gone to Royal Ascot &mdash; I would have sent him to Rockall for what he failed to do on that horse.

    <P>Concern has been expressed that the process envisaged may have been viewed as interfering with the independence of the regulatory body in this function <Col N="1624" /> clearly given to it without condition under section 39.

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1) line 26, to delete &ldquo;it&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an Appeals Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the type of appeals procedures that is proposed and the timing of the establishment of the appeals procedure.  It is not clear from the Bill what precisely is involved.  My other concern is that, as it is worded, it offends a basic tenet of natural justice, that is, the <Col N="1625" /> rule against bias.  The section provides that where the racing regulatory body imposes a sanction against any person involved in horse racing it shall afford that person on opportunity to appeal to it against the sanction imposed.  Surely the whole point of having an appeals procedure is that one is expected to go back to the decision makers to appeal a decision that they have already made.  It is unfortunate that this vagueness and lack of clarity appears in this section of the Bill.  My understanding of this Bill is that it is to include all aspects of horse racing under one Act.  I am concerned that in this aspect where cases may be controversial &mdash; for example, the suspension of a jockey &mdash; the type of appeals procedure is not spelt out and is not independent of the RRB itself.  There is an offence against natural justice, and even against constitutional justice, that needs to be addressed.  I do not feel that the Minister has done that.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal allows for a tribunal but still allows for people to be involved in that procedure who were part of the decision.  I ask that the Minister clarify the position and ensure that there is an appeals procedure that is independent of the RRB in order that natural justice can prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of Deputy McManus' words and her amendments, which is why there are amendments in my name and in the name of Deputy Doyle to provide for an independent chairman of a tribunal and a majority of independent members on that tribunal for all the reasons Deputy McManus has set out.  In this section, as in other sections of this Bill, it is undesirable that an authority be judge and jury in its own cause.  That applies to other parts of this Bill.  It is not an argument for the Minister to say, as he probably will, that the kind of situation for which this Bill provides has existed for the last 40 or 50 years.  That simply is not good enough and we do not have to go back very far to think of cases where a good many people felt that injustices had been done.  It is not so long ago that many of <Col N="1626" /> us here felt that an Irish jockey had been treated very severely in the United Kingdom and there was subsequently a rethink on that case.  There was no other means of redress available to that person. Neither would there be here.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister may argue that, broadly speaking, the system that has been in force up to now has worked reasonably well, it is not enough just to say that.  We have an opportunity now to make sure that the system works better, that it is a fair system and that it is seen to be fair.  It is appropriate that we should do that when we are not only setting up an Authority that has broadly the same powers that have been there in other hands since the 1945 Act was brought in but when we are in a number of respects giving that Authority further powers and revising the way a number of things are being done in the horse racing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot speak for Deputy McManus but she may agree with me when I say that I would not claim that the amendment in my name and in that of Deputy Doyle is necessarily the best way of dealing with the matter.  I am not sure that Deputy McManus would make that kind of argument for her amendment &mdash; it is the kind of argument I have not heard from her up to now because she tends on the whole to be a very reasonable person.  However, what is coming to the Minister from this side of the House is a concern with fairness and equity in relation to a sport that we hope will attract much more support. I do not know whether Deputy McManus would necessarily agree with that, but I would like to see it gaining much more support and if punters can feel that every aspect of the business is run fairly that is a good argument for them to get back into it.  For the people involved it is essential that they have the feeling that things are being done fairly and in a manner that allows them some redress if they think they are being unfairly dealt with. One cannot feel that if the people who apply the sanctions are the only ones to whom one can appeal, and at the moment, that is the case.  As the Bill stands, that would be the case from the enactment of this Bill.  If the Minister will <Col N="1627" /> do nothing else, there is plenty of reason for him to think again between now and Report Stage and come back to us with a system that takes up the concern that has been expressed on this side of the House and that deals with the situation where people feel from time to time that an injustice has been done.</P>
    <P>That applies to the matters in this section.  If you will allow me to make a slightly broader case, Sir, the same applies to a great many other sections of this Bill.  We will not have time to deal with them all in detail.  There are places in this Bill where the Authority has certain powers either to discipline or to make regulations or charge people money, and unless the Minister makes a change in the Bill there is no way that the people who are affected by the exercise of those powers can appeal against what seems to them to be an unfair or unreasonable decision.  I do not think, in 1994, it is reasonable to proceed on that basis. There are simple ways, such as the amendments we are talking about, of remedying those defects in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The industry, top trainers and jockeys, are divided on this very contentious issue.  Some of those who have fallen foul of the Turf Club and have come out on the wrong side of the argument as they perceive it believe there is a need for an independent appeals system, tribunal body to which to appeal their case.  Others have felt so strongly that they have taken their case to the courts.  Interestingly, in the most recent case the court upheld the decision of the Turf Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to find people for an independent appeals body or tribunal with the expertise of those in the Turf Club to hear cases independently of the Turf Club.  However, I accept the case made on natural justice.  At present, with the exception of the courts of law, there is no appeals procedure within the system. There is a case to be made for an appeals procedure and for the present system. What is the Minister's view on this matter?  Perhaps leave could be granted <Col N="1628" /> to re-enter these amendments on Report Stage when he considers the points that have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Turf Club operates an appeals procedure for people affected by its decisions and it has updated its procedures in this regard.  This section obliges the regulatory body to continue to provide an appeals procedure and to ensure that appeals are heard in a fair and impartial manner.  Amendments Nos. 39 to 43, inclusive, are being taken together and I will address amendments Nos. 39, 40 and 43 first.</P>
      <P>These amendments propose the establishment of a special appeals board or a tribunal independent of the regulatory body to hear appeals under section 45 against decisions of that body which impose a sanction against any person. As Deputy Doyle said, this is a very contentious area and there are different views on it from different parts of the industry.  I want to get a reasonable balance in this matter.  The Turf Club has updated its procedures and I am confident it will continue to provide an appeals system that will be fair and reasonable and that will adequately protect the integrity of horse racing as it is generally accepted it has done for two centuries.  I am aware of the case referred to by Deputy Doyle.  The people involved know the business of racing better than most &mdash; it could be argued they know it better than any independent tribunal that may be set up.</P>
      <P>The revised wording of subsection (2) of section 45 which is proposed in amendment No. 41 is intended to make clear that the regulatory body must continue to provide the appeals procedure and that the appeals must be heard in a fair and impartial manner.

Deputy Doyle said that if you go outside the regulatory body you are not guaranteed expertise will be available.  While some people have reservations about the way they have been treated in the past, this system is the lesser of two evils.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was unsatisfactory.  There should be a right of appeal for anybody against whom a decision has been made and I do not accept it is possible for a body, no matter how good it is, to be, as Deputy Dukes <Col N="1631" /> says, judge and jury.  That is not the way the system works.  For an appeals system to work people must feel confident that those who made the original decision will not also determine the appeal.  It is interesting that the High Court held in a case in 1989 that the decisions of the Turf Club were not open to judicial review. What is the position for people who believe they have been unfairly treated? If they believe that the racing regulatory body has not acted in a fair and impartial manner, what recourse do they have if there is no appeals system outside of that body?</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (2), line 11, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;request the Garda Síochána to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory. Section 47 (2) states:</P>
      <P>An authorised officer or a person acting under the direction of the executive of an authorised racecourse who has reasonable cause to believe that a person is not an authorised bookmaker or a person specified in a course-betting representative permit and is carrying on the business of a bookmaker at an authorised racecourse may remove the person (by force if necessary) from the racecourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our amendment we suggest that they request the Garda Síochána to remove the person &mdash; by force if necessary &mdash; from the racecourse.  The spectre of representatives of the racecourse or an authorised officer getting into physical conflict with an unauthorised bookmaker or whoever is not acceptable.  The Garda Síochána are present at all race meetings and if there is a problem I think a request should be made to the Garda Síochána <Col N="1633" /> to remove the person, with force if necessary. We do not want racecourse personnel to get into the bouncer business, as was mentioned earlier when we discussed a similar amendment.  I urge the Minister to accept the commonsense of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is seeking to transfer from authorised officers and racecourse executives the power to remove a person from a racecourse who is carrying on the business of a bookmaker without a permit and to vest that power solely in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The power to issue, suspend or revoke permits and to generally regulate the business of book making at racecourses is vested in the Authority.  It is then the racecourses that control the bookmaker pitches and when any of these rules are broken it is reasonable to give some power to the Authority and the racecourses to deal with the matter in the first instance.  The power to remove unauthorised bookmakers has been vested in the Racing Board's authorised officers and the racecourse executive since 1945.  In extreme circumstances it may be necessary to involve the Garda but certainly not in every case and I, therefore oppose the amendment.  I think it makes a great deal of sense and I undertake to look at the section again and will consider bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that will allow for the involvement of the Garda whenever necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> In page 23, subsection (1), line 13, before &ldquo;The Authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Subject to subsection (3),&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is a long section, with 19 subsections. It sets out in detail the permits that may be granted or refused, the period of such permits, the conditions which may be attached, the obligations on the Authority where it proposes to refuse a permit or suspend or revoke a permit granted and other related matters.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 are being discussed together.  Amendment No. 46 proposes to make subsection (1) subject to the new subsection (3), proposed in amendment No. 47 as subsection (1).  It deals with permits in general and subsection (3) introduces a special restricted permit.  The new subsection (3) to section 48, which is proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 47, will restrict any permit issued to a subsidiary of the authority which is a licensed bookmaker not to allow such company to operate from a pitch on a racecourse.  In my view it would be inappropriate for a company of the Authority to be competing with other bookmakers in the ring where the control of the Authority itself is as great as it is.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48 proposes to delete the reference in the old subsection, which will now be subsection (4), to the possibility of the Authority refusing a permit based on a recommendation to that effect from a racecourse.  A betting permit does not refer to a particular racecourse but permits a bookmaker to operate on any racecourse provided he or she gets a pitch.  The provision as it stood could have been interpreted to mean that the Authority would have to consult all 26 racecourses before deciding on any permit and this would not be practicable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 in my name proposes to add a definition of &ldquo;employee or agent&rdquo; in a final subsection of section 48. Under existing arrangements for representative permits the phrase &ldquo;employee or agent&rdquo; has a very limited meaning, which is defined in Racing Board regulations.  As the phrase is now being used in the Bill, the definition must be given in the Act.  There is provision in <Col N="1635" /> paragraph (b) of the subsection for its amendment by regulation.</P>

      <Col N="1636" /> Why does he believe it necessary to extend the definition of &ldquo;employee or agent&rdquo; to include those covered in paragraph (i)?  A spouse or parent I can understand, but it is a little less easy to understand child and others.  I think it is the first time I have seen &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; in a definition in legislation and nephew and niece are also included.  I wonder why siblings, nephews and nieces are included?  Deputy Power should have a particular interest in this, having a couple of fine strapping sons coming along; but I understand he has several siblings and I wonder if they would be happy to be included in the definition in this way?  If siblings, nephews and nieces are included here, why are cousins not included also? Why is it necessary to draw the net that far?</P>

This amendment is self-evident.  In the event of authorised racecourse operators and bookmakers failing to reach agreement, I have no difficulty in the Authority becoming involved and sorting matters out between them.  I have major problems, however, with the Authority dictating to the racecourse operators the charges they may levy on bookmakers, for example, and other matters that relate to the excellent relationship that exists between bookmakers and racecourse operators.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this important issue and I urge minimal interference by the Authority generally in terms of existing relationships between different component parts of the industry.  The racecourse operators and the bookmakers are well able to sort matters out between themselves and only in the event of them failing to do so or a difficulty arising should the authority be brought in to arbitrate.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill attempts to deal with some of the major problems which exist with the content and administration of our system of criminal law.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, almost three years ago on 8 November 1991 the then Minister for Justice indicated that he would soon circulate details of a Bill to reform the law on insanity.  This was in the context of the Gallagher and Ellis cases about which there was widespread public concern. These cases had caught the public imagination and focused yet again on the inadequacies of our criminal law relating to the defence of insanity.  At that time there was a widespread perception &mdash; unfortunately it had substance &mdash; that it was possible for somebody to be found guilty <Col N="1643" /> but insane, which is an acquittal, and to be released shortly afterwards because they are no longer insane within the meaning of the law.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing aspect of all this is that even though the Minister for Justice indicated in that context that he would shortly circulate a Bill, nothing has emerged from the Department of Justice in the intervening three years.  This perhaps has more to do with the fact that public concern about the issue abated once the court cases which arose out of the Gallagher and Ellis cases disappeared from the headlines.  Another disturbing aspect is not that it has taken the bones of three years for anything to be done on the floor of this House about this issue but that it is approximately 14 years since an interdepartmental committee reported to the Government of the day on this issue and prepared draft legislation. That committee was made up of very senior people, including the present Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Justice Henchy who was Chairman and a member of the European Commission on Human Rights.  That committee put a lot of effort into proposing amendments to our law relating to criminal insanity, yet nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Recent events, which I do not want to go into but which have been notorious, underline yet again the necessity for reform of the law in this area.  People are not happy that the present law is workable or just and it would be terrible if some of the more recent notorious crimes fell to be dealt with yet again under antiquated legislation which has very little to do with reality and much to do with totally outdated views of the criminal law and insanity.  Without attempting to engage in political point scoring, the delay is unforgivable as failure to legislate in this area is now of such long standing that virtually every party in this House has been tainted with the blame.  It nonetheless remains imperative that we should act quickly and decisively in this area.  The substance of the Henchy committee's report deserves to be converted <Col N="1644" /> from a draft Bill into legislation even after 14 years.</P>
    <P>This Bill incorporates and updates the content of the draft Bill prepared by the Henchy committee in relation to insanity and the criminal law.  It is a scandal that we have had to wait for so long for legislative action on this matter.  It is important to note that Part III of the Bill, which completely restates the law relating to criminal insanity, contains new measures as to how people who have been found not guilty by reason of mental disorder are to be dealt with afterwards.  The Bill also contains a new measure which would allow juries in murder cases and what used to be called capital murder cases and treason cases, which are very rare, to bring in a verdict of guilty but to add to it a finding of diminished responsibility in which case the mandatory penalty of life imprisonment in the case of murder could be dealt with on a different basis by the court which would have the power to impose a lesser sentence by virtue of diminished responsibility.</P>
    <P>All those principles are accepted and command widespread support throughout the community.  The fact that our criminal law dealing with people who are suffering from mental affliction of one kind or another is so antiquated and that the major measure in this area is still called the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, shows conclusively that this State has never faced up to the issue of insanity in the criminal law and what should be done about it.  I think the Minister will agree it is time we faced up to this issue and legislated in this area.</P>
    <P>The second area with which the Bill is concerned relates to bail.  Because of the attitude taken by the Supreme Court in the O'Callaghan case, which has recently been confirmed, it is not possible within our Constitution to deny a person bail on the basis of a suspicion that he will commit a further offence or offences while on bail and, without a referendum, there is no scope for preventive detention of that kind.  However, the Progressive Democrats have been making the point for some time now that the only obligation of a bailsman at present is to <Col N="1645" /> ensure that the accused person turns up for his trial.  There is a long standing legal procedure which enables courts to bind people over to keep the peace and be on good behaviour on the application of the prosecutor.  It seems to the Progressive Democrats, and many people who have considered what it is possible to do in relation to the abuse of bail without a constitutional referendum, that the best course now would be to allow courts to make bailsmen sureties for the good behaviour of the person admitted to bail pending trial.  The effect of such a change would be to allow for the forfeiture of bail where a person committed a serious offence &mdash; in this Bill an indictable offence &mdash; while awaiting trial on another charge.  In that context, most people find it offensive that bail can be abused by persons accused of crime who are relying on the low rate of detection in order to commit a multiplicity of crimes while they know that they are going to be convicted and sent to jail once the inordinately long processes of the criminal law bring them to trial and sentence.</P>
    <P>In considering changes to the law of bail a balance must be struck.  First, the presumption of innocence must be given legal weight.  We simply cannot have a system under which people begin serving their sentences as a matter of course, when arrested and charged with an offence.  In an ideal world trials would be speedy and nobody would be in prison pending trial unless he or she could not be relied on to turn up for trial or was likely to interfere with witnesses. However, we do not live in an ideal world.  As the rate of detection of offences is quite low habitual burglars and drug addits find it remunerative to engage in further offences while on bail, hoping that those further offences will not be detected.  Admittedly, in 1984 the Criminal Justice Act provided that there should be consecutive sentences in respect of convictions for offences committed while on bail.  That did have some effect on the abuse of bail but recent experience tends to suggest that the provisions of the 1984 Act in relation to <Col N="1646" /> consecutive sentences were not a sufficient deterrent.</P>
    <P>There are many people being admitted on bail whom everybody knows &mdash; the Garda in court, the victims of their crime and the judge who is dealing with them &mdash; intend to abuse that bail in order to commit further offences and the person who goes bail for them, the bailsman, only stands to lose his bail if they fail to turn up for trial.  Therefore, the proposal in this Bil is to render the bailsman liable to forfeit his bail where the accused who is admitted on bail abuses his liberty to commit further indictable offences.  The effect of this would be substantial because people who were habitual offenders would find it difficult to obtain surety for their good behaviour and would find themselves facing pressure from their bailsman not to commit further crime or, alternatively, experience difficulty in getting a bailsman who would risk a substantial amount of money in order to set them at liberty if such bailsman reasonably suspected that all they would do would be to commit further offences.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with pardons, remissions and the temporary release of prisoners.  Again, I am not endeavouring to score any party political points.  I know there has been recent controversy in relation to this.  The Minister may feel this is aimed at her; it is not.  Section 49 is intended to give statutory expression to the concept of free pardon.  When somebody is found, in retrospect, to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, it is now customary to grant them a pardon. Unfortunately, as a recent debate in this House showed, in the context of the Criminal Procedure Act, the exact effect of a pardon has never been teased out. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, was not in a position to tell this House what exactly is the effect of a pardon; whether the person concerned, having been given a free pardon, stands to be regarded in Irish law as never having committed the offence in question.  It seems to me that Irish law should be brought into line with other common law jurisdictions in <Col N="1647" /> relation to the effect of a pardon, a person who receives a free pardon should be able to state, as a matter of law, that the effect of the pardon is to put him in a position of being regarded as never having been convicted.</P>
    <P>Another feature of Part IV of the Bill is the proposal for a new requirement of transparency in relation to remissions and commutations.  Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the Minister for Justice and the Government are given power to remit and commute sentences.  They are not obliged to record the fact that this has been done nor is the public entitled to know whether it has been done.  That is a very serious matter because it naturally gives rise to disquiet among members of the Judiciary, members of the Garda Síochána and members of the public that punishment can be remitted in a secret process, that the wrongdoer effectively is relieved of the penalty imposed by the system of justice in circumstances about which nobody knows.  Again, without scoring any political points, it seems to me that the fact that a conviction has taken place and a sentence has been imposed, as a matter of constitutional law, is a matter of public record.  Why then is its commutation or remission a secret?</P>
    <P>Curiously, there is precedent for the concept of publishing remission of penalties. For example, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, special provision was made for the publication of remissions dealing with persons who were disqualified from driving.  Section 23 (5) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, provided that, where a person disqualified from holding a driving licence was the subject matter of a Government remission, that fact should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but that was changed in 1961 at which stage the power of the Minister and the Government to remit disqualifications of licences was completely removed.  The motivation for that particular requirement of publicity is difficult to work out at this stage but, presumably, it was to make it more obvious, more transparent, that when somebody <Col N="1648" /> had their driving licence restored to them by ministerial act, the public would be entitled to know about it and, therefore, the process would not be secret but rather one in which the public would have confidence. The only circumstance now in which a licence disqualification can be remitted is when the President, on the advice of the Government, exercises her powers under the Constitution.  I presume that that rarely, if ever, happened.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that, if justice is required to be administered in public, remissions and commutations of penalties should be a matter of public record.  I have no difficulty with the idea of the Executive remitting penalties. I do not share the view that there is something inherently wrong in a Minister remitting a penalty.  I believe in many cases it may be necessary, but I do believe it should be done by a process about which everybody knows.  Since everybody can read in the evening papers if somebody is meted out a jail sentence, fined, disqualified from driving or whatever, why should the case be cancelled secretly?  What is the logic of that?  If the Executive is surrendering the benefit of a punishment I believe it should be done by a public process.  In addition, the proposal in this Bill &mdash; where it is proposed to remit or commute a penalty the court in question must be informed &mdash; is not merely a courtesy but also underlines that it is a public matter.</P>
    <P>Second, the suggestion that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> should contain a notice or a schedule of remissions made by the Minister is a good thing.  I can accept that there are very limited circumstances in which it would be appropriate to commute a penalty privately &mdash; I cannot imagine all of them but I can imagine some cases where it might be in the interests of justice that the process should be confidential.  The Bill makes such provision by allowing the Minister to apply to the court for liberty to dispense with the obligation to notify the public through <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, where that is consistent with the common good.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of temporary release.  In relation to temporary release orders, there is widespread <Col N="1649" /> anxiety that the prison system is being conducted on the basis of a revolving door policy.  Many people believe that the prison system does not have adequate capacity to deal with the volume of persons sentenced to imprisonment by our courts.  It may be that too many people are being sentenced to jail; it may be that that is something we shall have to face up to, but there is also a widespread belief that the State is responding to overcrowding in prisons by releasing people on an arbitrary basis before they have completed their sentences.  That is done under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Temporary release orders are made in respect of people in circumstances in which it is not clear why temporary release orders are being made.</P>
    <P>There is no transparency in relation to this practice.  Clearly there are many reasons a temporary release order could be made.  For example, somebody might be allowed out for a week on compassionate grounds; somebody might have the remainder of their sentence effectively made the subject of a full temporary release order and be set at liberty in that way.  It seems to me that there is nothing wrong with the principle of requiring that every temporary release order made should be put into a register, save in exceptional circumstances where that would endanger the well being of the victim or the person being released and in those cases the public should know that somebody who was sentenced to prison is now at liberty.  That seems to be basic fairness and nothing more.  The effect of such a provision would be that the public would know whether people were being temporarily released from prison months and years in advance of their due date of release under the ordinary provisions of the law.</P>
    <P>Sadly, it has become apparent in recent times that very serious crimes are being committed by people out of jail on temporary release.  There must be accountability and transparency in the administration of the temporary release regime under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  The Bill proposes <Col N="1650" /> to create such transparency.  This should not be seen as a slight on those involved in the administration of the prison system or those in the Department of Justice who oversee the scheme.  The public simply have a right to know what are the effects of the operation of the 1960 Act in respect of the punishment of offenders. All efforts to elicit such information in the Dáil in the past have been wholly unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Bill also proposes that not only should there be a register but that the Minister for Justice should lay before each House of the Oireachtas each year a report showing the nature and extent of remissions and commutations made by the Government during the previous year and the number of temporary release orders made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  The purpose of that is simply to let the public know exactly what kind of regime, in practice, operates in our prisons.  It is probably embarrassing in some respects to disclose that, on anecdotal evidence alone, many people are allowed out on temporary release well in advance of their due date of release.  It is a fact, and one we will have to face up to, that many people are released from prison simply because a batch of remand prisoners is sent from the courts to Mountjoy and room has to be made for them.  That is how the system is operating and there is no point codding ourselves that it is not happening.  There is a knock on the cell door and the prisoners are told they are being released temporarily. They are allowed out on licence simply to make room in the cell for somebody else who has just been convicted or who has been remanded in custody pending trial.  That is an unfortunate consequence of the overcrowding in our jails and the absence of sufficient room to accommodate those who are sentenced.  It is a process which the people are entitled to know is being conducted in a proper way. I am not suggesting any impropriety in the manner in which it is being done but I suggest there is an active policy of concealment of the extent of temporary release orders because the people would <Col N="1651" /> be gravely disquieted if they knew the truth.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with proposed changes in criminal procedure.  In regard to the deposition procedure in the District Court the Bill proposes major changes.  Nobody can deny that the present system is ridiculously Dickensian.  It is open to an accused person or a prosecutor under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, to bring anybody before the District Court, to have them examined on oath in relation to the offence and to have their evidence taken down in longhand by the District Court clerk and made available for signature.  I have to tell the Minister that this is being abused right, left and centre to delay the prosecution of serious crimes.  The fact is that the 1967 Act gives an absolute right to depositions.  Persons accused of very serious offences &mdash; some of them notoriously guilty &mdash; have succeeded in delaying their trials for months and even years by prolonged and entirely unwarranted use of the deposition procedure.</P>
    <P>In one case a significant drug dealer was found in possession of considerable quantities of heroin and was actually ladling heroin from one container into another when the Drug Squad raided the premises where he was carrying out this operation.  He had a spoon in his hand, a weighing scales and a mountain of heroin on one side of the table and sachets into which he was dividing it on another.  This was a major discovery by the Garda.  That individual used the deposition procedure to delay his first trial to such an extent that the District Judge, before whom the case was being heard, became so frustrated that he stopped the process and sent him forward for trial half way through the deposition procedure.  The Director of Public Prosecutions had to apply to the High Court to quash the district judge's order and the process recommenced in the District Court.  The upshot was that the District Judge lost patience a second time and made a second invalid order and the drug dealer in question was never brought to justice. That shows just how bad the abuse can be and that is not the only case.  There <Col N="1652" /> are ongoing cases where people are using the deposition procedure to frustrate and to delay their trial.</P>
    <P>How can we possibly stand over a process which takes hours where a District Court clerk, not even a stenographer, has to take down evidence in long hand?  It would take a long time to complete the proceedings of this House if every word had to be taken down in longhand and signed by a Deputy before he sat down, yet that is what happens in the District Court to avoid the consequences of the judicial system so far as major criminals and their exploits are concerned.  The Garda and the Minister presumably know about this abuse but the public, unfortunately, are unaware of its extent or its consequences.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for a system of return for trial in serious cases without preliminary examination.  There are cases where it would be appropriate to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General to send for trial on indictment a person without going through the process of preliminary examination. These cases, which would be exceptional, should be provided for in our law.  They are provided for in the law of England and there is good reason in exceptional cases the Irish State should be able to have somebody sent forward for trial on indictment without the lengthy procedures involved in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 55 the Bill provides for a new proposal in Irish law to make people suspected of serious offences amenable to formal examination before a judge of the District Court.  At present, persons convicted of criminal offences can be arrested under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and detained and interrogated in private by the Garda.  Frequently they refuse to answer questions in a Garda station and in other cases the Garda claim they have made verbal admissions which the arrested persons deny.  While the right to remain silent in a Garda station is an important one, it does not follow that a person suspected of serious offences, when examined before a judge of the <Col N="1653" /> District Court in respect of their suspected involvement, should be entitled to remain silent with no prejudice to their position subsequently.</P>
    <P>Section 55 proposes to create a new jurisdiction of formal examination of suspected persons with a view to creating a transcript of the questions and answers put to them for later use in a prosecution. Thus, a prosecutor, for example the Fraud Squad, would be able to ask a businessman what had become of, say, the £50,000 he was given.  If he refuses to answer on the grounds that he might incriminate himself, a jury can find out that, at an early stage in the criminal investigation, he was given an opportunity before a judge of the District Court to give an explanation and that he failed to do so.  In those circumstances, a jury can draw an inference from his failure to answer the questions put to him in a formal venue.</P>
    <P>This section does not take away the right to silence, that cannot be done in any event.  The right to silence is a constitutional right.  Nobody can be forced to incriminate themselves on pain of committing a criminal offence, nobody can be obliged to condemn himself from his own mouth.  That is a principle of constitutional law which is recognised under the Irish Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights but &mdash; and this is a very important point because some people tend to confuse the right to silence with the effects of remaining silent &mdash; there is no accepted principle of international law that a failure by a person to give an explanation when required to do so can amount to nothing in his or her case, that in those circumstances no adverse inference can be drawn from silence.  In some sense, the right to silence is not merely a right not to incriminate yourself but a right to have nobody draw any inference from the fact that you have remained silent.  There is no principle of natural law, international law or constitutional law which makes people's silence something of absolutely no significance.  No punishment would attach to any person for remaining silent but if a jury or a court of trial is presented <Col N="1654" /> with a transcript on examination before a judge of a person suspected of a criminal offence, the jury will be entitled to know what the response of the accused person was to the questions put to him and would be entitled to draw inferences from any response given or from a failure to respond to the questions put to them before the District Judge.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 56 were originally devised by the English Criminal Law Revision Committee in a report in the late 1970s and were incorporated in section 16 of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983, which became the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 but, as a result of public controversy, they were removed on the basis that they went too far.  I shared the concern at that time that the qualification of the right to silence, implicit in section 56, might be unfair but in the intervening years I have come to the conclusion that it is wrong that someone can come up with an explanation for his behaviour at a trial on indictment which he has never given before to anyone in circumstances where it would be perfectly reasonable to expect him to give that explanation. As the law stands, he cannot even be asked why he did not give that explanation before the case came to court.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of this in criminal cases.  On many occasions when I acted for the prosecution I was permitted by the trial judge to ask the accused why, if the explanation he was giving was correct, he had not saved himself the bother of a trial on indictment and told somebody months or years before that he had a perfectly rational explanation for his activities or had some exculpatory facts which supported his innocence.  I discovered recently to my horror &mdash; one learns something every day &mdash; that I should not have been allowed to ask that question, that it is not proper for the prosecution to ask an accused person why he never mentioned these facts to the police and for the judge to say to the jury that it is an extraordinary fact that Mr. McDowell accused on indictment of a serious offence is now for the first time mentioning something.  The judge cannot say to the jury: &ldquo;Do you <Col N="1655" /> not think that this is suspicious?  Do you not think, if this is true, he would have mentioned it months or years ago?&rdquo;  It is an extraordinary piece of Alice In Wonderland law which leaves that particular provision in place.</P>
    <P>If the existing law was strictly enforced many questions which tend to impugn an explanation given in court for the first time would be disallowed.  If neither the prosecution nor the judge can ask questions or make comments in a trial on indictment dealing with the failure of an accused to give any explanation until the day of his trial, the law is artifically stacked in favour of the accused.  It is not a necessary adjunct of the right not to incriminate oneself that one can proceed to trial and offer an explanation for the first time without any adverse criticism or cross-examination as to why the explanation was never offered before.  On balance that is a sensible provision and the law should be changed.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Bill is also based on a proposal of the English Criminal Law Revision Committee, many of whose proposals were incorporated in the 1984 Act.  It proposes that at the end of the prosecutions's case, the court can, at the instance of the prosecution, call on the accused to give evidence and that a jury can draw an inference from the failure of the accused to give evidence to corroborate other evidence which suggests that the accused is guilty.</P>
    <P>In the 19th century an accused was not entitled to give evidence.  Now accused people have to give notice of alibis so that they can be checked and they are not entitled to give unsworn statements to juries without risking cross-examination. If the State produces a significant volume of evidence in a criminal case in which an accused is involved, it is fair and proper, that the court of trial can call on the accused to give evidence and can indicate to him that if he does not do so, the jury may draw an adverse inference and may use the fact that he failed to give evidence to corroborate the case against him.  I do not think this would give rise to any risk of a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> At present judges are entitled to comment on the failure of an accused to give evidence but for some reason the prosecution is not, which is ridiculous.  This means that the people who are intent on securing a conviction, the prosecution, are not entitled to make a good point whereas the judge, who is supposed to be impartial, is if he feels so moved.  The English Criminal Law Revision Committee was correct in proposing a change of this kind in the law and that it would not lead to injustice.  I stress that the right to silence does not entail as an adjunct a right to have no adverse inference drawn from one's silence and it is a mistake for extreme civil libertarians to believe that it does.</P>
    <P>Section 58 proposes to close a loophole in the law.  At present persons remanded in custody are not amenable, except for fingerprinting and perhaps photographing, to be examined for the purpose of forensic tests by members of the Garda Síochána.  In recent cases this has been of some significance.  If a person is remanded in custody on one charge and it transpires that the police are seeking that person in relation to another matter and they might require a sample of hair to make a comparison or a blood sample for DNA testing, say, where the person is suspected of rape &mdash; this has happened in a number of cases &mdash; the Garda cannot go to that person because that person is effectively granted immunity from further investigation while in custody and cannot be arrested.  The current provisions for taking samples from people are predicated on an arrest being made and once a person is in custody awaiting trial he cannot be lawfully arrested.  On some occasion &mdash; it may be that the occasion has already arisen and I do not propose to be more controversial than that &mdash; it will be a significant impediment to the proper investigation of a serious offence and the consequence will be major embarrassment if this loophole is not closed.</P>
    <P>The final Part of the Bill deals with infanticide.  The present law on infanticide is set out in the 1949 Infanticide Act.  As the Minister will be aware, that <Col N="1657" /> Act is extraordinary because it provides that where a woman is being charged with murder or manslaughter of her child and the child is less than one year old she can be acquitted of murder or manslaughter and found guilty by the jury of infanticide if they find that the balance of her mind was affected by giving birth to the child or &mdash; and this is the most amazing aspect &mdash; as a consequence of lactation. I do not know what notion underlay that statute &mdash; I presume it was based on English precedent &mdash; but I do not believe there is any psychiatric or medical evidence to suggest that that is a reasonable basis on which to find that the balance of someone's mind was affected.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill would reform our law in accordance with a well worked out precedent of the English Criminal Law Revision Committee and would suggest that in those circumstances a woman cannot be convicted of murder or manslaughter if the balance of her mind was affected by reason of giving birth or the consequences of giving birth.  I believe &mdash; and you do not have to be a woman to believe this &mdash; that the idea that a woman could be found guilty of infanticide under the 1949 Act and that a jury could come to the view that the balance of her mind was affected by giving birth and that as a consequence she killed her own child and that it was not murder and is liable to a term of up to life imprisonment is horrific. This Bill proposes instead a maximum sentence of five years.  I would go so far as to say that in the great majority of such cases where a woman engages in the destruction of her own child, either through neglect or a positive act because the balance of her mind is upset, the public would not regard it as appropriate to impose a custodial sentence. This Bill provides that the procedures to be applied in the case of those found guilty of offences by reason of dimnished responsibility should also be available, including release on conditions set by the court.</P>
    <P>The Henchy committee's report proposed to leave the Infanticide Act largely intact, but in view of changing social attitudes and changes in psychiatry it would <Col N="1658" /> be indefensible to leave that Act in place. That would be unacceptable in terms of the modern views of the causes of this most unfortunate behaviour on the part of some women in relation to their children. It is not acceptable to leave such draconian penalties in place for women who, because of an imbalance in their minds, are guilty of the offence of infanticide. The proposals in this Bill are humane, sensible and caring and reflect a modern view of the matter.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I commend the Bill to the House.  I apologise for the short notice given to the Minister, but that was due to other distractions to which I will not refer.</P>

      <P>The time has come to face up to the issues of the criminal law on insanity and of infanticide.  The time has come to allow juries draw inferences from people's failure to give explanations and to require people suspected of criminal offences to give an explanation at some stage or, perhaps, have an adverse inference drawn by a court of trial later if they do not do so.  The time has also come to do something about bail. We should address these issues and not allow the law to stand in its present slumlike condition where injustice is being done and where, on the criminal insanity front, a major injustice may soon result. Those areas of the law are crying out for urgent reform.  A substantial portion of this Bill has been in preparation for the best part of two decades.  If we are in a position to do something about this, now is the time to get on with it.  The Minister should accept this Bill.  She may object to parts of it but she should get on with the process of addressing these problems and not continue to put them on the long finger.</P>

      <P>It is only right initially to commend the work which Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell have to put into the <Col N="1659" /> preparation of what by any standards is a substantial Bill.  We should acknowledge that much of it is taken directly from the draft Bill which was included in the Third Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Government is not in a position to support the Bill.  I can assure the House that this does not arise by virtue of the fact that this measure has been brought forward by an Opposition party rather than the Government.  In this regard it is a matter of public record that I have been sympathetic in the past when Private Members' Bills have been brought forward.</P>
      <P>In rejecting the Bill I should make it clear too that it contains much with which I would have no fundamental difficulty, but even in relation to the measures which it contains &mdash; on which I suspect there would be general agreement on all sides of the House &mdash; the view which the Government takes is that in practical terms it would be more efficient for the Government to bring forward its own proposals in the areas in question rather than attempting to tinker around with the measures contained in this Bill.  There are measures proposed in the Bill with which we would have definite difficulties and others where we remain to be convinced that the balance of advantage would lie with their acceptance.  Nevertheless, I believe that the introduction of this measure provides the House with a valuable opportunity to discuss the issues in question and I can assure the sponsoring Deputies &mdash; and, indeed, the House generally &mdash; that in bringing forward our own proposals in areas dealt with by the Bill we will have full regard to the measures which it contains and what is said about them during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>The first substantial part of the Bill deals with bail.  I am, of course, aware of the legitimate and widespread public concern about the operation of our bail laws, and, indeed, I have already made it clear both inside this House and elsewhere that I share that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> It is an unfortunate reality that serious offenders facing the likelihood of long periods of imprisonment on other charges are tempted to &mdash; and sometimes do &mdash; use their time on bail to commit further offences.  That situation is clearly unacceptable and the Government is determined that it will be addressed effectively.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the measures in relation to bail contained in the Bill are put forward on the basis that they are practical measures that might be implemented in the absence of a constitutional amendment.  I have to say that I see merit with the broad thrust of what is being proposed in the Bill and, indeed, they are along the lines of measures which I looked at myself earlier this year when considering what to do about our bail laws, but one of the problems I kept on coming up against is that there is substantial doubt as to how far we can go in taking legislative measures to tighten up our bail laws without falling foul of the existing constitutional right to bail.  Putting it at its simplest, the issue is whether measures designed to tighten up our bail laws would in practice operate as a restriction on the constitutional right to bail.  I will give a fairly crude example: if we were to purport by our laws to provide that bail could be granted only where there was a surety of a large amount of money &mdash; say £100,000 &mdash; it is reasonable to suggest that the courts would take the view that in practice this would represent an unwarranted restriction on the constitutional right to bail.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that no legislative changes are possible in this area in the absence of a constitutional amendment.  It is precisely because of the type of complexity which I have mentioned that the Government earlier this year decided &mdash; at my request &mdash; to ask the Attorney General to refer the question of changes in our bail laws to the Law Reform Commission.  I am sure the House will appreciate that having taken that decision the Government would not be in a position pending receipt of the Law Reform Commission <Col N="1661" /> report to accept proposals for change in the law in this area.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of bail it might be helpful for me to confirm to the House that, if after considering the commission's report, the Government concludes that the most effective way of improving our bail laws lies with an amendment to the Constitution, then we will have no hesitation in going down that road.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill concerns the criminal law and mentally ill persons.  In the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> a clear commitment was given to introduce legislation to reform the law with respect to criminal insanity. As has been made clear in this House on a number of occasions &mdash; most recently on 10 May 1994 &mdash; appropriate legislation is already at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and will be published as soon as possible.  I would also draw attention to the Green Paper on Mental Health published by the Department of Health which addresses certain issues related to mentally disordered offenders and which will, subsequent to the publication of a White Paper, lead to legislation being brought forward by the Minister for Health. There is no argument, therefore, over the desirability of reforming the law in this area and, indeed, it is encouraging to see that the Deputies share the Government's view that this area of the criminal law is in need of reform.</P>
    <P>The question of criminal insanity and how it should be addressed has given rise to much debate in other jurisdictions and I would hope that a similar level of interest and healthy debate would take place in this jurisdiction.  It is not a simple issue; there is no clear right answer and a level of constructive criticism and critical analysis is essential if we are to achieve improvements in our existing law.  I had looked forward to studying the detail of this part of the Bill because I was interested to see what approach would be taken and whether any new ideas would be put forward.  However I hope I will be forgiven for saying that I was a little disappointed, looking at the provisions <Col N="1662" /> set out in Part III of the Bill, to note that they are all taken directly from the draft Bill included in the Third Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally III and Maladjusted Persons, often referred to as the Henchy Committee.</P>
    <P>The Henchy Committee Report was published in November 1978.  There have been a number of publications since then which merit consideration when looking at reform of the law in this area.  In October 1979 the report of the Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders was published in the UK and it provides a comprehensive assessment of all aspects pertaining to mentally abnormal offenders.  In 1989 the Law Commission in England published a draft criminal code including measures dealing with insanity and fitness to plead.  In both instances an approach radically different to that proposed by the Henchy Committee was put forward.</P>
    <P>At present the issue of fitness to plead must be determined at the outset of the trial or as soon as the issue arises.  This can lead to a situation where a person could be found unfit to plead and detained even though if the trial had proceeded up to the opening of the defence, the jury might have been directed to return a verdict of acquittal on the grounds that there was no case to answer. A campaign was launched in the United Kingdom highlighting individual cases where persons accused of crimes were found unfit to plead, detained but subsequently it transpired that they could not have committed the crimes of which they were accused.  This campaign culminated in a Private Members' Bill in the British Parliament which was accepted by the British Government and enacted as the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act, 1991.  That Act allows consideration of the issue of fitness to plead to be postponed until the opening of the defence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, even where a person is found to be suffering from a disability there is a special provision allowing the jury, if the evidence supports it, to return a verdict of acquittal.  While I am not <Col N="1663" /> aware of similar cases to those identified in the UK occurring in this jurisdiction, the potential for such cases does exist and I am of the view that any Bill dealing with this area of law which does not address this particular problem is flawed.</P>
    <P>There have been developments in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom as well.  For example, in the United States there has been widespread review and debate of legislation dealing with criminal insanity arising from the Hinckley case.  Here in Ireland only last year a book was published dealing with insanity, psychiatry and criminal responsibility. The point I am making is that no matter how perfect the proposals of the Henchy Committee might have been when they were made, they still have to be reviewed in the light of developments since then. While it would not be appropriate at this stage to get involved in a detailed debate on the recommendations of the Henchy Committee, on which Part III of this Bill is based, there are some general points which are worth mentioning.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty as Minister for Justice if I did not critically assess every report submitted to me on issues relevant to my areas of responsibility. There can be no question of accepting the recommendations of any report until I have had the opportunity to consider the recommendations and determine whether the balance of the public interest lies with accepting those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have carefully examined the Henchy Committee report and I am in favour of many of its recommendations.  In particular in the legislation which I will bring forward I will address the procedures for determining fitness to plead, the power of the District Court in the whole area of insanity, the verdict of insanity, the question of diminished responsibility, the procedures for determining the release of persons found insane and the question of appeals against determinations of insanity.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, is pursuing those recommendations of the report which pertain to his area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> While I am generally positive towards the report there are, however, certain aspects of the Henchy committee report which raise difficult questions.  In particular I am concerned that the report devotes only 11 lines to the crucial issue as to what degree of mental disorder justifies absolving a person of criminal responsibility and how that is to be determined. This issue has given rise to heated debate and a variety of approaches in different jurisdictions and could have benefited from a more detailed analysis and an outline of the various arguments and their respective merits.</P>
    <P>It is not at all clear from section 22 of the Bill on what basis a jury is to determine that a person was suffering from a mental disorder that was such that he or she should not be found guilty of the offence charged.  Is it to be determined by the jury without any guidance from the Legislature or case law as to what degree of mental disorder justifies an acquittal and, if so, will this not lead to great inconsistency in verdicts?  Alternatively, is it intended that section 22 be interpreted in the light of existing case law which establishes some guidelines as to that degree of mental disorder which justifies a person being absolved of criminal responsibility?  This is the crucial issue in any reform of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>Another issue which I feel warrants more detailed consideration is how the Bill proposes to deal with persons who commit criminal acts and who are suffering from a mental disorder but not of such a degree that it would justify their acquittal.  These are offenders who, under the existing law, would be regarded as fit to plead and who would not be regarded as criminally insane.  The Henchy committee in its report emphasises its view that the courts should have wide powers to refer such persons, both before and after conviction, to a designated centre rather than to a prison. This Bill, which follows the Henchy committee draft, proposes that such a person, before conviction, may be referred to a designated centre for periods up to six months where it would be detrimental to his or her health to bring him or her <Col N="1665" /> before the court.  However, it makes no provision for a convicted person to be referred to a designated centre except where that person was tried for treason or murder and found to be suffering from diminished responsibility.</P>
    <P>Despite the recommendations of the Henchy committee this matter is not properly addressed in the Bill as no provision is made for the court to send convicted persons suffering from mental disorder directly to designated centres, except in the limited case of diminished responsibility.</P>
    <P>At a technical level I would like to point out that certain of the details of the Bill raise a number of questions.  For example, section 14 and the Second Schedule of the Bill propose to repeal the Criminal Lunatics Act, 1800, in so far as applicable.  The advice I received from my officials is to the effect that the 1800 Act is not and never was applicable in Ireland as it predates the coming into force of the Act of Union.  The High Court took a similar view in the DPP <i>v.</i> Neilan case on 23 April 1990.  If the Act was never applicable obviously it does not make sense to appeal it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not wish to get involved in a debate on such detailed issues at the moment, but the point I am making is that the Bill raises a host of minor technical issues which would have to be addressed if we were to proceed with it in its present form.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be clear to the House that the issues concerned merit a separate Bill dealing solely with criminal insanity.  As I have said, my own proposals are reasonably well advanced and if it was not for the fact that other legislative measures have been accorded priority I would have hoped to have a Bill published by now. The House will appreciate that I cannot divulge details of my proposals at this stage.  However, as I have already made clear, many of the recommendations of the Henchy committee will be taken on board.  I should also like to stress that I will be approaching this whole area of the law with a very open mind.  I have almost completed my initial examination of the topic and have formulated most of <Col N="1666" /> my proposals and I look forward to their early publication.</P>
    <P>Before I move from the topic of mental disorder and criminal responsibility I would like to comment on Part VI of the Bill which addresses the issue of infanticide but is also relevant to some of the provisions of Part III.</P>
    <P>The offence of infanticide occurs where a mother is responsible for the death of her baby within 12 months of the birth and where the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having recovered from giving birth.  The offence was introduced in this jurisdiction by the Infanticide Act, 1949, and, in effect, reduces what would otherwise be murder to the lesser crime of infanticide. Infanticide is punishable in the same way as manslaughter: there is no mandatory life sentence and a judge may at his or her discretion impose any sentence up to life.  I should point out that it is extremely rare for prosecutions to be brought for infanticide and I am not aware of any conviction for infanticide having occurred in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the provision in the Bill, I note section 59 (1) follows the format recommended by the English Criminal Law Revision Committee. However, I do not wish to concentrate on the technical aspects of the definition of the offence at this stage.  Rather I would like to make the point in respect of subsection (2) that I fully agree that it could well be appropriate to send a person convicted of infanticide to a psychiatric centre rather than to prison. By definition it is accepted that a person convicted of infanticide has had the balance of the mind disturbed and clearly some form of psychiatric help is appropriate. I am aware that the Minister for Health has proposals for legislation which would allow the courts on conviction to send such people directly to a psychiatric centre rather than to prison. The Minister for Health's proposals relate not only to infanticide but to other offences as well and I am confident that his proposals will cover this matter adequately.</P>
    <P>I have certain questions about dealing with infanticide in the same context as <Col N="1667" /> criminal insanity.  If the woman's mind is unbalanced to any serious degree it may well be that he would fall within the scope of section 22 of the Bill and be acquitted with a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental disorder.  If she is not acquitted, then it is recognised that she does have criminal responsibility but the question is to what degree.  How does this fit in with the concept of diminished responsibility in section 23 of the Bill?  Should we try to integrate infanticide with the provisions on mental disorder or should it be treated as a completely separate issue?</P>
    <P>As to the question of reducing the maximum potential sentence of life imprisonment to five years, as proposed in section 59 (2) of the Bill, my understanding is that in the past when on the rare occasion a case of infanticide has come before the courts they have been very lenient.  In practice, therefore, I do not think that the proposed reduction would be of any great practical significance. However, I would be slightly concerned about the principle involved. If we accept the principle that a mother who kills her child in the circumstances envisaged by the section should be guilty of a criminal offence, is there a danger that reducing the penalty for infanticide will lead to accusations that we are placing a lower &ldquo;value&rdquo; on the life of a child under 12 months compared to a child or, indeed, any person over 12 months of age.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this is the case. I am just cautioning that this approach might be viewed as inconsistent with the general provisions of our law and it could be argued that logically such women should be either completely acquitted of criminal responsibility or they should be treated as being in the same category as other persons who are found guilty of the unlawful taking of human life in circumstances which do not amount to murder.  I will listen with interest to views expressed during the debate about this matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Part IV of the Bill which deals with pardons, remissions and temporary release of prisoners.  Part IV of <Col N="1668" /> the Bill commences by seeking to define the effect of a free pardon.  It is identical to an amendment moved by Deputy O'Donnell on the Report Stage of the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1993, which was fully debated in this House as recently as last November.  What was at issue then, and the issue that section 49 of this Bill seeks to reopen, is whether the effect of a pardon should be statutorily defined.</P>
    <P>That question was considered in my Department both during and subsequent to the debate in this House last November. On the basis of all the advice available to me I am satisfied that there is no need to define by statute the legal effect of a pardon.  Apart from constitutional or other considerations involved, a definition would be unnecessary since, under existing procedures, pardons can be worded in such a way as to achieve for practical purposes the same effect as a definition, including the definition proposed in section 49.  The remainder of Part IV of the Bill deals with the publication of details relating to remissions, commutations and temporary releases.</P>
    <P>I have serious objections to section 51 which provides for a register of those granted temporary release from custody and could not accept it.  It is a fundamental principle in the management of offenders that in serving their sentences offenders should be left in peace to repay their debt to society.  If we are to have any hope of leading such people to a constructive crime free lifestyle in the community on release we must provide them with services and facilities to encourage them but, above all, we must avoid stigmatising them for life.  The publication of a register of those granted early release would have that stigmatising effect.</P>
    <P>The proposal is especially objectionable in the light of the fact that a significant number of temporary releases are given under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service as part of the rehabilitative &mdash; resocialisation process. I will shortly be publishing a strategic plan for the management of offenders which will include a substantial <Col N="1669" /> development of such supervised early releases.  Does the House seriously expect offenders to commit themselves to that kind of rehabilitative supervision, which by the way is no soft option, if their co-operation is, in effect, to be shouted from the rooftops, their names, their offences, their sentences?  Surely not.</P>
    <P>We try to manage offenders in this country in a way which is appropriate to a modern, civilised community.  The philosophy is one which emphasises the concepts of care, fair play and justice.  We are bound to that philosophy by international commitment.  I see care, justice and fair play demolished by an arrangement which would never give an offender the opportunity to leave his or her past behind and start a new life without publicity and that would be the result of keeping registers of the kind suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Most countries operate extensive systems of parole in one form or another, but I have yet to hear of any which publishes lists of those who may avail themselves of it.  Temporary releases in this administration are granted for a variety of reasons and for varying lengths of time &mdash; for compassionate family reasons, for short periods as part of the resocialisation process, on a renewable basis at an appropriate stage of sentence, etc.  They are all subject to conditions which, if broken, mean that the offender can be returned to prison immediately without the need for fresh proceedings.  I have difficulties too with section 50 which would require the publication of personal details relating to remissions and commutations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the implicit acceptance in the Bill of what is known as the petitions procedure.  The Executive's power to commute and remit penalties is provided in the Constitution and is exercised by the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government.  It is not part of the judicial system and there is no constitutional requirement to consult or notify the Judiciary.  However, the appropriate court offices are in practice notified of the outcome of all petitions for administrative <Col N="1670" /> reasons.  This is done in order that the details may be entered on court records and thereby facilitate the issue of warrants and enable receipts to be reconciled with the relevant entries for accounting purposes.  There is no reason to extend the arrangement to include appeal courts because all appeal decisions are automatically referred by the appeal courts to the originating courts to follow-up action; in the circumstances it is clearly sufficient to inform the originating courts.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with my reservations about publishing details of temporary releases and some similar considerations of confidentiality arise in relation to commutations and remissions. It has never been the practice to publish details of individual cases involving the commutation or remission of fines and sentences of imprisonment under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and delegated Authority of Government dated 30 March 1951, and I see no valid reason to change the practice.  I am sure Deputies will agree that there are good reasons for this, including the fact that individuals who make petitions are entitled to a certain degree of privacy concerning their personal affairs.  I do not think that publishing the names and addresses of those who, for personal reasons &mdash; very often inability to pay &mdash; have decided to avail of the petitions procedure is in any way justified.</P>
    <P>In opposing the publication of individual personal details in these cases I should emphasise that I have no difficulty with the principle that statistics in relation to the exercise of powers of remission, commutation and temporary release should be publicly available. Indeed, the annual reports on prisons and places of detention contain statistics in relation to temporary releases and the House will be aware that I have provided statistical information about petitions in response to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a series of measures dealing with criminal procedure. In this context I should mention that I have at an advanced stage of preparation <Col N="1671" /> a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and if it emerges during the course of the debate that it would be worthwhile pursuing some of the provisions contained in Part V of the present Bill, then this can be done as part of the miscellaneous provisions Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 53 and 54 of the Bill are concerned with the preliminary examination of indictable offences in the District Court.  The effect of section 53 would be to allow a judge of the District Court before whom a preliminary examination is being conducted to refuse, on a number of specified grounds, a request to require a person to attend the examination and to give evidence in deposition.  In addition, the section makes provision for the recording of depositions and would allow a preliminary examination to be adjourned while they are transcribed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, provides that at preliminary examination both the DPP and the accused shall be entitled to require the attendance of a witness and to examine him or her by way of a sworn deposition. Section 7 (3) of the 1967 Act states that the deposition of a witness who is examined by virtue of subsection (2) of that section shall be taken down in writing, read over and signed by the witness and the judge.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the provisions of the 1967 Act, in so far as they relate to the taking of depositions, have been criticised as being slow and cumbersome and open to abuse in that they can be used by a defendant to prolong a preliminary examination merely to cause problems for the DPP or to delay a trial.  I am also conscious of the fact that depositions have become the exception rather than the rule in preliminary examinations.</P>
    <P>I should mention that my Department is currently examining what legislative changes might appropriately be made in relation to the taking of depositions at preliminary examinations in the District Court.  That examination is being undertaken in the context of the preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) <Col N="1672" /> Bill which I have already mentioned. While, as I have indicated, I would not be prepared to accept the present Bill, I will ask my officials to take account of the proposals in this area in their review of the law on the taking of depositions.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Deputy's Bill would allow the DPP to decide whether a preliminary examination should be conducted in the District Court in the case of a person accused of an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>I know, that over the years, doubts have been expressed about the value of the preliminary examination.  As Deputies will be aware, the purpose of that examination has been to ensure that the evidence against a person can be heard and weighed by a judge who is independent of the prosecution and the defence before an accused is put on trial before a jury.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the then Minister for Justice requested the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure &mdash; which is composed mainly of judges and practising lawyers and publishes reports on the operation of the courts &mdash; to consider the question of whether the preliminary examination of indictable offences might be moved from the District Court to the court of trial with a view to reducing delays and securing speedier trials.  In response to that request the committee indicated that it did not accept that the current arrangements for dealing with preliminary examinations gave rise to undue delay and that in its opinion any delays that arose were more often than not attributable to the compiling and furnishing of the Book of Evidence and were not procedural.</P>
    <P>In the light of the views of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which I have just outlined I would be reluctant to support any move to abolish the preliminary examination which is, in effect, what the Bill proposes.  While I can see my way to bringing forward legislative proposals to improve the operation of the preliminary examination &mdash; for example, in the area of depositions &mdash; I remain to be convinced that the case has been made for what is proposed in section 54.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> Sections 55 to 57 relate to the thorny issue of the right to silence and I will return to them in a moment.  However, I would like to dispose first of the final section of Part V which deals with the forensic examination of persons remanded in custody.  I must admit that when I read this section for the first time there were a number of aspects of it that surprised me.</P>
    <P>In particular I was concerned that the section apparently fails to take account of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which enables the Garda Síochána to obtain bodily samples for the purpose of forensic testing in certain specified circumstances.  As Deputies may be aware, the Forensic Evidence Act empowers a member of the Garda to take, or cause to be taken &mdash; by a doctor, for example &mdash; any of a wide range of samples, including blood, saliva, etc., from a person who has been detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  In addition, and this is significant in the context of section 58 of the present Bill, the 1990 Act also provides for the taking of samples from persons who are in prison whether on remand or following a conviction.</P>
    <P>There is only one respect in which the section proposed by the Deputy goes further than the provisions of the Forensic Evidence Act.  This relates to the fact that the 1990 Act does not permit a sample to be taken from a prisoner in connection with an offence for which he or she is on remand.  I understand that that restriction was accepted by my predecessor who was responsible for introducing the legislation and piloting it through the Oireachtas on the advice of the Attorney General who considered that the appropriate point at which a sample should be obtained from a suspect is when that person is in Garda custody and not when he or she has been remanded to prison by a court in respect of the same offence. That advice is in line with my own thinking <Col N="1674" /> on this point and, as I have already explained, the Garda already have the opportunity of obtaining a sample or samples from a suspect who was detained under the 1939 or 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>I should mention that even if I could accept the extension of the power to take samples that the Deputy has proposed, I would have to insist that the specific safeguards which operate in relation to the taking of samples under the Forensic Evidence Act, including the destruction of records and samples where a person is acquitted, would apply to any such extension.  The Bill before the House does not cover this and other important matters which are dealt with in the 1990 Act.  For reasons I have given I would be reluctant to accept either the principle or the detail of the proposed section 58.</P>
    <P>Sections 55, 56 and 57 relate to the right to silence.  I have no proposals at present for changes in the law in this area, but I have made it clear to the House already in response to parliamentary questions that it is an area of the law which I am keeping under review. I have an open mind on this question and, while I have substantial difficulty with the detail of some of what is proposed in the Bill, I will take careful note of what is said during the debate.  I am not opposed as a matter of principle to changes in this area but before I and the Government would be in a position to bring forward proposals, we would have to be satisfied that they represented a proper balance between the complex and competing rights which arise.</P>
    <P>We would need to be satisfied too in such a sensitive area that a large degree of consensus existed as to the approach which should be taken.  In this context I might mention that section 56 of the Bill &mdash; which essentially allows inferences to be drawn from the failure of a suspect to answer Garda questions &mdash; is not dissimilar in its scope to a provision which was included in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983.  That provision did not command widespread support in this House and as <Col N="1675" /> a result was deleted and replaced with the much more limited provision in what became the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, where inferences can only be drawn in specified circumstances, such as failure of a suspect to account for his or her presence at the scene of a crime.</P>
    <P>On my initial reading of the Bill I was a bit puzzled as to what further purpose would be served, assuming section 56 was acceptable, by section 55 which allows for the questioning of suspected persons by a judge of the District Court and the drawing of inferences at a subsequent trial.  In any event section 55 would involve for the first time our courts in the investigation of offences before a person had been charged.  This would represent a fundamental departure and it is not one which I would be prepared to support.</P>
    <P>Section 57 would allow a court to compel an accused to give evidence at his or her trial or allow inferences to be drawn from a failure to do so.  There is a long standing rule under existing law that an accused cannot be compelled to give evidence at his or her trial.  This rule is based on what seems to me to be the fundamentally sound precept that it is a matter for the prosecution to prove guilt rather than the defendant to establish innocence.  Section 57 would turn the existing situation on its head and I would take an awful lot of convincing that such a fundamenntal change would be warranted.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, I have no hangups about changes in the law relating to the right to silence, but I believe that, taken together, there is a danger that the sections of the Bill would go too far.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I think that it is fair to remind the House that the present Government has shown great commitment to reform of the criminal law. Already we have had the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993; the Criminal Justice Act, 1993; the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; the <Col N="1676" /> Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, 1993; the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993; the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994; and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.  The Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill is before the House at present.  I hope that in the context of that proven commitment the House will accept my undertaking to bring forward legislative proposals as quickly as possible in a number of the main areas dealt with in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that it may be suggested that the Government should accept Second Stage of the Bill and bring forward amendments on Committee Stage when its own proposals are finalised.  While that is superficially attractive I believe in reality that, given the extent of amendments which would be necessary, it would represent a logistical nightmare and confer no advantage.  In any event, as I suggested earlier, areas such as criminal insanity warrant the introduction of separate measures in their own right.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the opportunity which the introduction of this Bill has presented to the House to debate the issues with which it deals.  Unfortunately, for the reasons which I have outlined, I cannot commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage. Like the Minister, I did not receive the Bill until very recently and I do not have great back-up to support me in researching its contents; but in principle the Bill should be supported on Second Stage with a view to making necessary amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a contentious point before I proceed to the rest of my contribution. I was rather taken aback to read in the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>We try to manage offenders in this country in a way which is appropriate to a modern, civilised community.  The philosophy is one which emphasises the concepts of care, fair play and justice. We are bound to that philosophy by international commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> I wish to raise a point on sections 50, 51 and 52 which will be raised time and time again until something is done about the matter.  Abuses of the prisoner temporary release system for blatant political advantage amounts to inhuman and degrading treatments of prisoners and should be considered by the European Court of Human Rights in view of the fact that Labour Party TDs are not prepared to insist on an end to this corrupt practice by a Finna Fáil Minister.  The personalised abuse of individual and discrimination in favour of the constituency of the Minister for Justice and against the rest of the country emphasises the need for a full scale parole board and inspector of prisons.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister for Justice continue a practice that is so outrageous? Democracy has not failed.  Malpractices which receive the silent support of Labour make the public sick.  This public malady will continue until honest and open practices are restored in the administration of our prisons.  It is sick that the Minister for Justice should seek to obtain electoral support in her constituency by personally reviewing the applications of prisoners from Galway who apply for compassionate release, temporary release or transfer to open prisons.  Many prisoners, both men and women, have been reduced to tears because they are not treated in the same manner as other prisoners.  This is one more scandal for a scandal-ridden Government and it needs to be addressed.  It runs completely counter to what the Minister says is Government policy.  I will raise the matter no further this evening, but it will continue to be raised until fairness and justice is introduced and the international commitment, which the Minister says exists, of care, fair play and justice in the prison system and the criminal justice system generally is fully restored.</P>
    <P>On the issue of bail, whereas I welcome the provisions put forward in the Bill &mdash; they have much to commend them &mdash; they do not go far enough.  I do not see <Col N="1678" /> why the matter has again been referred to the Law Reform Commission because we know that what is required is an amendment of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court in 1966 &mdash; this was confirmed in 1988 &mdash; interpreted the constitutional right which guarantees liberty and the presumption of innocence to mean that a court should grant bail unless it is reasonably probable that the accused will interfere with witnesses or fail to turn up for trial.  Twenty eight years later we live in greatly changed times.  It is time to revise the Supreme Court ruling to allow courts refuse bail where they consider it is desirable to do so.  The objective of the Fine Gael Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 1) Bill, 1994, which was recently put forward, proposes to allow courts greater discretion to admit or refuse to admit any person or persons to bail pending trial.</P>
    <P>In the 28 years since the Supreme Court decision, society has become more violent and criminals have become more organised.  As a Garda magazine editorial recently stated: &ldquo;Bail for serious crime for the current breed of organised criminals is simply an opportunity to build up a nest egg for the time when they come out of prison&rdquo;.  Bank and post office workers have asked that the bail laws be amended, but the Minister for Justice has chosen to ignore these requests and to play politics by referring the matter yet again for review by the Law Reform Commission.  We all know precisely the reform that needs to take place.  Detaining persons while on bail will require additional prison space &mdash; there is no point pretending it will not.  However, the State must provide for the detention of persons if the courts decide that in the public interest those persons should be detained.  Prison reform is a burning issue and one which needs to be addressed separately.  To refuse to address the bail question because there is insufficient prison places is akin to institutionalising the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    <P>Recently, according to press reports, a <Col N="1679" /> notorious bail bandit charged with more than 20 separate robberies was back on the streets after being caught during his most brutal hold-up to date.  The criminal, who is well known, did not even wear a mask when he ran amok, smashing a shop with a hammer and terrorising customers and staff during one of his robberies.  These matters have been brought to the attention of the House in the past and they need to be repeated until action is taken to deal with them.  It is reported that this robbery was one of nearly two dozen this man has admitted being involved in and has been charged in the past 12 months.  As soon as he is bailed out he again goes into action.  Since it is very clear that this man is a danger to society, is it not reasonable that the courts should have the power to remand such a person in custody?</P>
    <P>The pendulum has swung too far in one direction.  It is time to make realistic provision for containment of bail bandits. Since we do not have a national bureau of crime statistics, precise data on offences committed while on bail is not available. However, it is clear from Garda sources that a high proportion of crime, including serious crime, is carried out by professional criminals while on bail.  The problem must be tackled without further delay.</P>
    <P>European elections were held last week which provided an opportunity to put this matter before the country, but we did not take that opportunity.  We have been promised that a divorce referendum will be held next year which will present yet another opportunity to put the matter to the country.  It is time this question was put to the people and the opportunity should be taken to do so next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill put forward by Fine Gael proposes to amend Article 38.1 of the Constitution by adding these new subsections as follows.  Article 38.1.2 would read &ldquo;The courts in their discretion may admit or refuse to admit any persons to bail <Col N="1680" /> pending trial&rdquo;.  Article 38.1.3 would read &ldquo;In exercising the discretion given to it by this section a court may take into account such matters as it thinks fit. However, nothing in this Constitution shall operate to prevent a court from refusing to admit any persons to bail where, in the opinion of the court, such person is likely to commit further offences while on bail&rdquo;.  Article 38.1.4 would read &ldquo;Where bail has been refused to any person pending trial, that person shall have the right to an early trial&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have a comprehensive plan to deal with crime.  Fine Gael is greatly concerned that hardened criminals continue to enjoy excessive protection from the law while law abiding people, especially the most vulnerable members of the community, such as the elderly, are being imprisoned in their homes.  It is time for the scales of justice to be tilted in favour of the law abiding community.  It is nonsense that the courts should not have greater discretion in this area and I believe that this imbalance should be redressed.  The public should be given an opportunity to have their say at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The proposed Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill should, if the law does not cover it already as the Minister of State claims, deal with the whole question of paramilitary drilling displays in public, as happened in this city in the past few weeks.  The Offences Against The State Act empowers a chief superintendent to say in evidence that he believes a person is a member of the IRA.  As that power exists I fail to understand why it was not possible to have the people who recently paraded in military fashion brought before the courts on the evidence of a chief superintendent to make them answer to the courts.  What does the Government think these people were doing, if they were not members of the IRA?  Certainly they were not traffic wardens.  I am flabbergasted that the provisions of the existing legislation have not been used against these people.  If the <Col N="1681" /> legislation does not cover this, I challenge the Minister to make provision for it in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which she proposes to bring forward.  It is wholly unacceptable that members of a terrorist organisation can drill in such a fashion on the streets of our city.  I, for one, am not prepared to wait until they are at the gates of Leinster House before I speak up.  It is quite clear that the vast majority were taken aback by that military display and I want to see the law deal with it straighway.</P>
    <P>We are constantly expressing concern about the explosion of Executive and parliamentary Government and how we should try to contain it.  In trying to contain expenditure we should not be too quick to run down the role of additional judicial appointments until we see the judicial system working in a more satisfactory manner.  I would like to see the courts sit for longer hours and more days in the year and some of those who are <i>au fait</i> with the situation might be in a position to explain why the courts sit for such a short time throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to put forward my views on the question of bail. The provisions of this section are worthy of examination.  Section 3 will go some way to reduce the incidence of crimes committed by people on bail because bailsmen will be wary.  I do not think it will deter serious criminals, nevertheless it is a welcome proposal.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill refers to the treatment of defendants showing signs of mental disorder and it appears to be designed to close loopholes in the law that have enabled defendants to abuse the insanity plea.  It recommends setting up a mental care review body to review the detention of persons committed to designated centres, including the Central Mental Hospital.  In principle, that is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>Section 49 in Part IV of the Bill provides that a free pardon can, unless otherwise expressed, mean that the offence was never committed.  In section 50 it is <Col N="1682" /> suggested that each decision should be recorded in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  There is merit in that suggestion but I have a slight reservation about the register of temporary release orders.  The Minister expressed concern about having such a register.  There is an argument for and against it but it should be published somewhere, perhaps in a report published annually by the parole board or some other body such as the National Bureau of Crime Statistics.  If the Minister does not want to make individual cases known, the bureau would have the opportunity to publish details without giving the names of persons.  It is difficult to see how a register of temporary releases open to the public would serve any useful purpose and I think publication by a parole board would be preferable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind is that if somebody committed an offence while on temporary release a pressman would be able to say that the Minister allowed him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly worth considering.</P>
      <P>Section 55 requires further explanation. It is certainly novel but it would need to be explained in greater detail as would section 53.</P>
      <P>I am naturally cautious about changes which take away the rights of individuals. If they are necessary, let us have them. A Committee Stage debate on sections 56 and 57 would give us the opportunity to tease out this issue and I would certainly welcome that opportunity.</P>
      <P>The provisions in section 58 seem very desirable in that evidence may come to light when an accused is remanded in custody.  There seems to be a gap, as pointed out by Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the section which deals with infanticide seem reasonable but I need assurances on the protection of infants.  The Minister said that the law works well and that there has not been a <Col N="1683" /> prosecution for ten years.  Nonetheless, a review of the section would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>On the question of a register of petitions and the Minister's right to receive petitions and mitigate fines, this right should be retained by the Minister for Justice.  I am aware of a case of a deserted wife who had grave difficulty meeting her family needs and had not paid her television licence, which she normally would, and who was brought to court, fined and given time to pay the fine.  In the interval between the imposition of the fine and its collection, her circumstances worsened. She is not in a position to go back to the courts.  I am aware that a judge has said publicly that there is a procedure whereby somebody may go to the registrar of the courts and have the whole matter re-examined. I think the Minister for Justice should have the right to review fines in such cases but that is not the problem.  The problem is that it is not seen to be done at arm's length.  A publican brought before the courts was told by a judge he felt he should endorse his licence but that in view of the fact he had shown remorse, he would fine him £3,000 or £4,000.  The fine was not paid but appealed to the Minister and, of course, a second offence followed and an endorsement applied in that case.  If someone can go behind the back of a judge who has shown leniency and play politics with the situation, it is an abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>There should be some public record of mitigated fines and sentences.  I understand there was a record in the 1960s but that the system was changed.  Also, the Minister should consult the judge in cases where enormous fines are reduced or at least tell the judge that she is considering such a petition.  There is room for change in the petition system.</P>

    <Col N="1684" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me permission to raise this important issue in the House this evening.  This problem should never have arisen.  The situation has led to the suspension of the farm improvement scheme, the control of farm pollution scheme and the land improvement scheme, to hundreds of farmers in north and west County Roscommon.  In addition it has delayed the start-up of the rural environment protection scheme in north and west County Roscommon, an area where there is huge interest in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the problem goes back to 14 February last when the three higher agricultural officers who operate all those schemes in the region were, without consultation, informed by the Department that they must cease operating from their home offices and transfer to an office in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim which, for most of them, is miles from the location of their general operations.</P>
      <P>This decision to transfer the officers bore no relationship to any necessity or common sense and had nothing to do with saving money or making the service more efficient or effective.  It seemed to be wholly related to internal machinations within the Department and the need for someone to exercise authority.</P>
      <P>The arrangement by which these officers operated from their home offices was most satisfactory and efficient.  The location of their offices was conveniently spread in the area they serviced.  The applicants were well aware of the location of their offices and the officers involved provided an excellent service to them. They were often available for consultation, advice and, indeed, inspections well outside office hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officers, understandably, resisted through their union the very peremptory manner of their office transfer.  The situation came to a head on 13 May last <Col N="1685" /> when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry agreed an order removing these officers from the payroll of the Department, even though they had continued to work satisfactorily right up to that date and to carry out all the duties assigned to them.  In effect, they were not or could not be punished for dereliction of duty, only for not obeying the ridiculous edict that they remove themselves from the work location that was convenient, effective and efficient for everyone to an office in another county that suits nobody apart from someone with an axe to grind.</P>
    <P>The industrial action that followed this comedy of errors is having the most damaging effect on hundreds of farmers who have files being dealt with or due to be dealt with by these three officers.  Every year in recent years these officers dealt with at least 200 new applicants under the various farm improvement and pollution control measures operated by the Department.  In addition to the new applicants there was the carry-over and the ongoing work to deal with and to supervise.</P>
    <P>These officers are no longer working and their colleagues, quite rightly, will not undertake any of their work.  For the farmer applicants caught up in this dispute the situation is disastrous.  Many of them are waiting for long overdue grant money.  Others are waiting for inspections to be carried out and cannot commence work on silage slabs, control or effluent, winter housing and better holding facilities.  May and June are the time of year when most of this work is done, there was a very large backlog this year as no work could be done because of the appalling weather in the first four months.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this will be that hundreds of farmers who want to better their operation or control or eliminate their effluent problems will not be able to undertake such work this year.  As far as they are concerned, and as far as I am concerned as a public representative <Col N="1686" /> living in the area, the service that existed heretofore worked well.  It was conveniently located for the farmer applicants and was effective and efficient.  The farmers want that service restored and so do I.  I call on the Minister to intervene in this dispute.  I believe it is a matter of internal machination within his Department and it is for him to resolve it.  I call upon him to do so as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to set out for Deputy Connor the framework within which these transfers are taking place.  The position is that all areas of work within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are subject to review on a regular basis to ensure the most efficient use of resources available.  In this context, a review of staffing arrangements in the farm development service is being undertaken countrywide to ensure efficient implementation of schemes in the most cost effective manner.  In addition, the duties of field officers in this work area is evolving with a resultant reduction in &ldquo;on-farm&rdquo; inspections and an increase in office based duties.  Consequently, it is considered necessary to relocate a number of officers to departmental offices in a number of counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office in Carrick-on-Shannon, located on the Roscommon border, is geographically well located to allow the three officers concerned to service North Roscommon and I am satisfied that the transfers will not adversely affect the service to farmers in that area.  The reorganisation envisaged is vital because of the evolving work role of field officers in the farm development service.  At present, the level of activity in relation to pollution control and the farm improvement programme is quite low, pending the outcome of the negotiations for funding for these schemes under the national plan.  However, there is adequate staff in County Roscommon to <Col N="1687" /> provide a service and give information as required in relation to these activities.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department, where possible, to house headquarter staff in official accommodation when it is available.  I wish to remind the Deputy that agreement on payment of allowances to field officers who are based at their homes, and as negotiated by their union stipulates: &ldquo;Should it be possible to headquarter an officer at a local Department office, at present or in the future, that officer would automatically lose entitlement to payment of an office accommodation allowance.&rdquo;  In this context it should be noted that over many years my Department has conducted negotiations with the trade union concerned regarding locating officers at their homes.</P>
    <P>The union has consistently emphasised the element of inconvenience to these officers and this was the reason for the payment of office allowances.  It was always understood that the most appropriate headquarters for any officer should be in an official office.</P>
    <P>I should also emphasise that the conditions of service under which these staff were appointed requires them to serve at whatever headquarters is required by the Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that coupled with this, the evolving role of field officers in the farm development service makes it necessary to locate officers in departmental offices wherever possible.  I am further satisfied that the relocation of these officers to Carrick-on-Shannon is in the best interest of the provision of the most efficient and cost effective service to the farming community in North Roscommon.</P>
    <P>If there are individual grant cases of which the Deputy is aware where there are difficulties, I will be happy to take representation on them and offer what assistance I can.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Aeroflot Rights At Shannon Airport.</Title>
    <Col N="1688" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter which is of grave concern to workers at Shannon Airport and others who have an interest in it.  I put on record my appreciation of the Minister's interest in this matter when I raised it with him some months ago and the trouble he went to with regard to it. I hope his response tonight will allay some of the fears of those working in Shannon Airport and in the region generally.</P>
      <P>It is important to clarify that I am not seeking general pick-up rights to New York for Aeroflot but merely that they be entitled to carry transit passengers from the former USSR states which, in effect, is a continuation of the situation which pertained up to two years ago when Aeroflot was the only airline operating out of the then Soviet Union.  Aer Lingus currently carries to New York a small number of passengers who originate in Minsk and travel on Air Belavia as far as Shannon.  I understand this business is worth about £1 million to Aer Lingus but the loss in terms of ground handling revenue should the service be discontinued to Aeroflot would be at least four times that.</P>
      <P>Air Ukraine currently flies eight times weekly to New York from Kiev via Shannon but their circumstances are rather difficult and there may be changes in that in the short term.  Their service could be guaranteed if they were in a position to fly to Shannon and have their passengers carried further by Aeroflot.  They would, of course, have major difficulty regarding their currency if they were forced to transfer their passengers to Aer Lingus at that stage.  There is also a regular service from St. Petersburg which could terminate at Shannon, with considerable advantage, were passengers in a position to transfer on to the Moscow-New York flight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of travelling with Aer Lingus, though subsidised for those travelling <Col N="1689" /> from Minsk, is a major deterrent to the numbers travelling.  If transit rights to Aeroflot were available the number of passengers availing of the service would be multiplied tenfold or more and the Kiev business would be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect is that a partial or total pull out by Aeroflot from Shannon would be a complete loss to Ireland.  It could be argued in the case of the changes under the Cahill plan that Shannon's losses were largely held in Dublin though there is no evidence of the promised gains from Manchester and London.  However, in the case of Aeroflot, airport authorities in Prestwick, Stansted and elsewhere are waiting for them with open arms, cheque books and pick-up rights.  It would be a monumental tragedy if the excellent groundwork by Aer Rianta in attracting the Russians to Ireland and the great development which took place under Aer Rianta International were undermined.  The presence of Aeroflot and other eastern airlines at Shannon has been a major plank of Aer Rianta's hub strategy.  It is widely believed that many of the recommendations in the task force report which we hope to see published in the next week or two hinge on the presence of Aeroflot at Shannon.  There is great potential for developing this already fruitful relationship and it should not be thrown away. Our geographic position as a natural air cross-roads between the Americas and the emerging states of Eastern Europe means we have an outstanding opportunity to share in the massive expansion of tourism and trade which will inevitably follow US and European investment in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The arrival of Aeroflot at Shannon made the airport profitable and guaranteed year round services and jobs not just at the airport but in the surrounding area. It guaranteed continued work for Aer Lingus ground handling staff.  If is widely believed that the decision to deny Aeroflot transit rights from the former Soviet states has been taken in an effort to protect <Col N="1690" /> the Aer Lingus service on the transatlantic route.  I share the genuine wish of every Shannon worker that Aer Lingus should prosper and that the new air bus fleet will guarantee its future on the north Atlantic and the continuation of the new daily year round service.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Aer Lingus continues to undermine its credibility at Shannon.  On the second day of the new air bus service the flight from Shannon was held up because the crew was an hour late arriving from Dublin.  Airport workers had been told this crew was based at Shannon. Twice in the past week the flight from New York to Shannon did not operate because the Shannon plane was switched to the Dublin route on the return flight.  It is difficult to persuade people involved in tourism and business interests in the Shannon region to take Aer Lingus executives seriously when the airline has failed twice to get its flights into Shannon since the inception of the service.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the position in the context of the task force report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record the Government's appreciation of Aeroflot's contribution to Shannon Airport over the past 20 years and hope that this partnership, which has yielded benefits to both sides, will continue to develop well into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our air links with Russia have grown from Shannon Airport being initially an important transit point to its now being an important hub linking the Russian Federation with a whole range of points in the western hemisphere.  Following the break up of the Soviet Union, we were one of the first countries formally to sign an air transport agreement with the Russian Federation in March 1993.  In this agreement and subsequently outside the formal agreement, we have given very generous rights to the Russian Federation at Shannon Airport.  These rights exceed those available to the Russian <Col N="1691" /> Federation anywhere else in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I should like to spell out clearly these rights.  Aeroflot Russian International Airlines has full fifth freedom rights at Shannon, that is, rights to pick up all transfers and local traffic for all points in Central and South America and for Washington and Miami in the USA and Gander in Canada.  On top of this we have, outside the agreement, given Aeroflot temporary fifth freedom rights to Chicago and Tampa, Florida, at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Aeroflt has recently sought wayport rights, that is, rights to pick up transfer traffic from points in the former USSR states to all points in the United States. Given that Aeroflot already has these rights to all the points I mentioned earlier, including Washington and Miami, what is really at issue here is rights to New York and Boston.  Contrary to press reports, these rights were not formally available under the old agreement with the USSR.  Pick up rights for transfer traffic to New York have never been granted by my Department to any airline other than Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It has never been policy to grant rights to third country operators on transatlantic routes served by Irish carriers.  Granting rights, either full fifth freedoms or unrestricted transfer rights to New York, could have major implications for the continued viability of Aer Lingus's transatlantic operations.  It is against this background that the Aeroflot request has been examined.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind this House of the level of worry and concern in the Shannon region when the original Aer Lingus proposal for a transatlantic service was unveiled in the strategy for recovery, and the subsequent sense of relief when, following Government approval for the new A330 aircraft, Aer Lingus was in a position to announce a daily year round Shannon-New York service.  I am anxious to be as helpful to Aeroflot at Shannon as possible but not <Col N="1692" /> in a way which would compromise the daily Shannon-New York service.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus advised my Department that it has a contract with Belavia, the Belarus airline, which operates twice weekly into Shannon, to carry traffic onward to and from New York.  According to the company this traffic is worth £1 million per annum to Aer Lingus. Currently Belavia is the only non-Russian CIS airline disembarking passengers at Shannon.  On the other hand, Aeroflot contends that traffic is being lost by Shannon to other destinations, for example Warsaw, Prague, Helsinki etc, due to the lack of competitiveness of Aer Lingus prices.  It claims it could entice this traffic to Shannon if it had the rights to pick up all CIS transfer traffic.</P>
    <P>Following conflicting claims regarding the importance of CIS transfer traffic at Shannon, my Department convened a meeting of interested parties on 24 May to establish certain facts.  On the basis of the information provided at the meeting the following interim, and I stress interim, decision was made by my Department: Aeroflot would be granted additional <i>ad hoc</i> rights to operate wayport rights to all destinations, including New York but only in respect of traffic from the Russian Federation, and no fifth freedom or wayport rights for non-Russian Federation traffic would be granted to Aeroflot in respect of points served by Aer Lingus, that is Boston and New York at present.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought further information from the various parties on CIS traffic and comparative prices for such traffic.  The matter will be kept under review in the light of this information and future developments in transatlantic traffic to and from former USSR states.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that there is no connection between the overflying of Shannon by Aeroflot on its Moscow-New York services and the recent decision regarding wayport rights.  It has been public knowledge for a considerable time <Col N="1693" /> that when suitable aircraft were available the Moscow-New York services would operate direct.  The acquisition of new Western aircraft capable of the non-stop service has given rise to the recent announcement.  My Department has for some time been examining proposals to seek extra traffic opportunities to offset these developments.  The recent granting of the new substantial additional rights to Aeroflot is an indication of our goodwill in this regard.</P>

The pay claim by speech and language therapists has been advanced on the basis of the following considerations. The adequacy of the level of pay of speech and language therapists has never been the subject of independent examination or arbitration.  Pay levels were arbitrarily determined when the grade of speech and language therapists was introduced to the health service in the 1950s and pay increases were determined by way of specific reference to adjustments in the pay of nursing grades during the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the union's contention that the pay level for speech and language therapists compares unfavourably with that of other graduates recruited to the health services and takes no account of the continually developing role and increasing demand on their skills.  The existing salary scale for a speech and language therapist does not reflect the duties and responsibilities of the post.  Speech and language therapists are autonomous in the diagnosis and treatment of communication and swallowing disorders.  The differentials between the various grades of speech and language therapists within the existing grading structure do not provide adequate compensation or reward for <Col N="1694" /> accepting positions of higher responsibility.</P>
    <P>The assessment, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of communication and swallowing require a high degree of scientific knowledge, expertise and appropriate personal and interpersonal skills.  The profession of speech and language therapy is a discipline in its own right.  The therapist undergoes a rigorous academic and clinical training in the field of speech pathology and therapeutics and increasingly employs research methods in assessment, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  The speech and language therapist has also become involved in providing technologically based augmentative communication devices for those who are unable to acquire or regain oral language.</P>
    <P>The above points form the basis of the pay claim and highlight the indispensable nature of the profession.  Speech and language therapists have skills to enhance the qualify of life of a child or adult. However, this service is rendered inadequate when only 214 therapists are employed instead of the recommended 807.  This contributes to the unacceptable length of waiting lists, which is up to four-five years in many health board areas.</P>
    <P>This crisis if further compounded by the significant wastage of experienced personnel from the profession.  Therapists who have been trained at great expense to the taxpayer are going abroad where salaries and career opportunities are better or leaving the profession in search of better paid jobs at home.  Their colleagues in comparable professions earn up to 48 per cent more than they do.  The potential earning capacity of a speech and language therapist is between £14,000-£23,000 per annum while psychologists can earn between £19,000-£39,000 and community welfare officers, who are not required to have a third level qualification, can earn between £9,000-£29,000.</P>
    <P>A claim was lodged by the union on behalf of the speech and language therapists' <Col N="1695" /> salaries working party in June 1991 with the Local Government Staff Negotiation Board under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  No arbitrator was appointed by the Government for most of 1993.  Following this period the rules were suddenly changed when the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> replaced the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Having pursued their claim under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and been hampered by the non-appointment of an arbitrator, speech and language therapists are now suddenly expected to work under the new set of rules.  This manipulation of circumstances and avoidance of negotiation is unprincipled and will not help to build a healthier future.  I am sure the Minister of State will convey to the Minister for Health my appeal to intervene on behalf of this very important group of health care workers who provide a vital service for a very vulnerable section of our population. They deserve a better deal.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health who has asked me to reply on his behalf. The Minister does not accept the need for ministerial intervention in regard to the pay claim by speech and language therapists.  In February 1994 the union, IMPACT, submitted a statement of case for arbitration in support of this pay claim.  In the light of the pay provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, speech and language therapists withdrew the statement of case and then opted, through their union, to enter into preliminary negotiations with the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on the possibility of pursuing the pay claim on the basis of restructuring under Clause 2 (iii) of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The first stage of these negotiations took place when both parties met on Friday, 10 June 1994, and a follow-up meeting is scheduled <Col N="1696" /> for 18 July 1994.  As this claim is being actively pursued through the normal industrial relations channels and within the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate Minister Howlin's reluctance to intervene in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to the famous North Mon, the North Monastery, in Cork city.  This school, which has made its mark for more than three-quarters of a century, numbers among its past pupils people as eminent as the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and leading civil servants, businessmen, actors and writers.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the school applied for a concessionary post and had met all the requirements that would render it eligible for the granting of such a post, but unfortunately the appointment was not made.  Following repeated applications this year the school applied for a home-school liaison teacher in accordance with the new scheme working very well in schools in the area.  Again, the school met all the criteria and requirements. While posts were allocated to schools in the immediate locality whose pupils have identical home conditions and educational requirements, no post was sanctioned for the North Monastery School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister possibly justify the granting of such a post to one school with identical home and school conditions and the withholding of a post to another school where the conditions are identical?  How can that be justified?  I can see no argument to justify that.  Will the Minister state on what basis the decision was taken to grant a concessionary post of a home/school liaison teacher to St. Vincent's School across the road, a school where I taught for a number of years, while withholding a similar post from the North Monastery <Col N="1697" /> School which boys from the same families attend?  There is no justification for that.</P>
    <P>A gross mistake has been made and a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask his Department to reconsider its decision and sanction the appointment of a home/school liaison teacher to the North Monastery primary school.  The issue is as simple as that.  I will not spend any more time putting it forward because my case is self-evident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for having raised this matter and giving me the opportunity to explain the position of my Department in this case.</P>
      <P>The home/school/community liaison scheme is one of a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the problems of underachievement and marginalisation of young people, as well as poor participation in education, in areas of socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The focus of the home-school-community liaison programme is to support schools in establishing contact with parents, encouraging parents to become involved in their childrens' education, organising locally-based activities which contribute to closer contact between parents and teachers and establishing links with voluntary and statutory groups in the area.  Many previous strategies have been school-based, did not include parents and communities and, as a result, addressed symptoms rather than root causes.</P>
      <P>The liaison scheme is a preventative approach to the challenge of eliminating educational disadvantage and is focused on bringing about changes in attitudes and behaviour of those adults, parents and teachers, who impinge on the lives of children.  The scheme was established in 1990 as a three-year pilot project. There are now 106 primary schools in the scheme, with a total enrolment of some 34,000 pupils.  The total cost of the scheme in 1993 was in excess of £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme operates through co-ordinators <Col N="1698" /> working on a full-time basis with schools.  A national and an assistant national co-ordinator have been appointed to support the schools.  There is a national steering committee, representative of the interested bodies, which advises the overall direction of the scheme.  The scheme is being evaluated on an ongoing basis by the Educational Research Centre in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  Final evaluation is due shortly.</P>
    <P>Certain schools, which were already designated as disadvantaged, were selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of their forming clusters of schools in a locality that would facilitate local meetings and support for individual co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>An essential part of the scheme has been the provision of in-service programmes for local co-ordinators and principals of schools involved.  I am satisfied that this scheme has proven its value in enhancing educational participation by disadvantaged young people.  It was for this reason that the Minister placed the scheme on a formal footing within the educational system for the current school year.</P>
    <P>I believe that home-school-community liaison has implications and positive benefits for all schools.  In further expanding the scheme it will continue to be based on the principle of partnership and the collaboration of the complementary skills of parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Minister's recent announcement on the 1994 education provision, I have allocated an additional 15 posts, effective from September 1994, to facilitate an extension of this programme to other disadvantaged areas. This will bring the total number of schools in the scheme to 132, embracing 38,000 pupils with the services of 75 local co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>Schools were selected from among those in the disadvantaged areas scheme. The principal factor taken into account in this selection process is the comparative degree of deprivation among schools. <Col N="1699" /> Other considerations relate to liaison initiatives already undertaken in the areas concerned and, in order to minimise the possible isolation of individual co-ordinators, extensions to the scheme are on the basis of enlargement of existing clusters and by the formation of new clusters.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of this scheme is to promote active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of the children.  To date each liaison co-ordinator has served some 500 to 700 pupils.  Frequently, this comprises two large schools, in many cases a junior and a senior school on the one campus.  In other areas one co-ordinator has served several small schools.</P>
    <P>It is important for the success of the scheme that schools' management and staff be aware of the preventative aspects of the scheme and the issues around partnership. The whole school approach, which presupposes changes in schools as well as in parents' readiness to become involved in their childrens' education, and the use of existing resources are <Col N="1700" /> vital factors in considering a school for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The schools referred to by Deputy Quill are both included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and, as such, have already been allocated a shared concessionary teaching post.  I understand, however, that the schools in question have not found it possible to share this post.  Both schools receive additional capitation funding at the rate of £17 per pupil.  An amount of £2 per pupil of this grant is specifically intended to fund school-based initiatives in the area of home-school-community liaison where schools do not have the services of a local co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible to include these schools in the home-school-community liaison scheme in this latest extension of the scheme.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of these schools will be taken fully into account in the context of any further supports becoming available under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 June 1994.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a comprehensive information service at local and regional level through its extensive network of offices throughout the country. This locally-based service is supported by a central information section which employs a wide variety of methods to ensure that customers are aware of the full range of services available to them and of any improvements or new services introduced from time to time.</P>
      <P>Methods used in this regard include the issue of detailed information leaflets and booklets relating to specific schemes, constant broadcasting of a wide selection of general information on Aertel and extensive advertising in local and national media.</P>
      <P>The selective use of free phone services is also availed of from time to time to advise on new schemes or improvements to existing schemes.  For example, a free phone service is currently in operation to help customers who require information or application forms relating to the new survivor's pension which will come into operation later this year and will, for the first time, entitle widowers to a contributory pension on the same basis as widows.</P>
      <P>In general, it is found that the vast majority of people availing of our information services require specific details relating to their individual needs. Queries of this nature can be satisfactorily dealt with only by reference to the individual case file and, therefore, the use of a centralised free phone service would not be the most effective method of dealing with such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All local offices of my Department are now computerised with online access to <Col N="1441" /> the main central records data base.  This enables staff to deal with even the most complex inquiry at local level without undue delay.  In any case where the inquiry cannot be completed promptly, staff will return the call when the relevant information is to hand to avoid unnecessary delay or expense for the caller.</P>
    <P>Some of my Department's services have been decentralised in recent years and information can be obtained by either calling those offices directly or, if it is cheaper to do so, by calling the Department's main number in Dublin and having the call relayed without additional costs to the appropriate office. The current arrangements offer a high level of service to the public throughout the country.  This service will be further improved as my programme of localising the Department's schemes and services develops further.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the report prepared by the inner city renewal group and Ringsend action project on welfare take-up in Dublin's inner city.</P>
      <P>The report was based on a survey covering 101 households, 92 of which were dependent on social welfare payments and ony nine of which were in receipt of income from employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that 87 per cent of those surveyed were not claiming all of their entitlements.  This was based on an estimate by those conducting the survey as to what the people concerned might possibly qualify for and the people concerned were advised to make the appropriate <Col N="1442" /> claims.  In the event one third of possible claims were not pursued by claimants, 27 per cent were found to be ineligible and a further 16 per cent were awaiting decisions at the date of publication of the report.  In 137 cases referred as a direct result of this report, community welfare officers were able to assist in 17.5 per cent and a further 15 per cent were under consideration when the report was published.</P>
    <P>The largest proportion of non-take-up of benefits identified in this report relates to exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  These payments are made on a discretionary basis to meet exceptional needs and an assessment of possible entitlement depends on the circumstances of each particular case.  It is not possible to assess in advance the outcome of any particular application.  I am taking measures in co-operation with health boards to ensure a greater measure of consistency in the application of the guidelines in relation to those payments throughout the country and to ensure that people are adequately informed of the payments which are available.</P>
    <P>The fact that this survey was based on a relatively small number of households in a specific area where a very large proportion are already in receipt of social welfare payments must be borne in mind in considering how representative the results might be.  I am concerned that those who depend on the social welfare system for their livelihood are informed and assisted to avail of the full range of payments and services.  The provision of simple but comprehensive information remains a priority within my Department. All developments and improvements in social welfare services are widely advertised using a mix of media at local and national level.</P>
    <P>Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from any of the Department's local offices throughout the country.  The network of local offices are computerised and, using a direct link with the central computer records, staff can provide detailed information <Col N="1443" /> on the full range of services locally.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the valuable role that the voluntary sector can play in relation to the provision of information. In that connection, I recently hosted a seminar to discuss and plan how my Department can work more closely with community and voluntary groups to ensure that information, advice and assistance is readily available to those who need to access the social welfare services and I will be taking action based on the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I am primarily responsible for the provision of social insurance benefits and pensions and for the management of the social insurance fund so that it is adequate to meet the obligations incurred by the fund.  I am also determined that no avenue should remain unexplored in our national effort to create new jobs, preserve existing ones, and in doing so, reduce the risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>I have over a number of years, while meeting the needs of the social insurance fund, taken measures to ensure that the social insurance system operates as far as possible to encourage employment.</P>
      <P>In 1992, I introduced the employers' PRSI  exemption scheme whereby employers who take on additional full-time employees directly from the live register will not have to pay the employer element of the PRSI contribution in respect of such employees for two full years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> This year I introduced three main PRSI changes, as part of a PRSI package aimed at creating and preserving employment:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a two-tier employers' PRSI contribution structure, with a new lower rate of 9 per cent applying in respect of employees earning less than £173 per week,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of the employers' PRSI exemption scheme under which employers pay no PRSI for two years in respect of new employees taken on from the live register,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the waiving of the employer's liability to pay the health contribution and employment and training levy on behalf of employees who hold medical cards.</P>
    <P>These changes taken together with measures on the employee side such as improvements in family income supplement, the abolition of the temporary 1 per cent levy and the relaxation of the means test for lone parents in employment, add up to a substantial package of measures designed to provide a stimulus to employment and economic growth. They support workers on lower incomes where reform has potentially the greatest effect on employment.</P>
    <P>The scope to reduce the main employee's rate of social insurance is, however, more limited than the Deputy's question might suggest.  Abolition of the ceiling would give some scope for a general reduction in the rate, but this would obviously have serious effects for people on middle and upper levels of earnings. The benefits of PRSI exemption are seen at the lower end of the income distribution. I would view the introduction of any general levies at lower incomes as a retrogressive step.  The response to the measures so far introduced has been positive and I will keep this situation under review.</P>

      <P>Income from farming is assessed as means for unemployment assistance under Rule 1 (3) of the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as the yearly value accruing from the use of property.</P>
      <P>The procedure is to take account of all receipts associated with the farm and deduct the expenses necessarily incurred. Sources of income taken into account include the sale of livestock, crops, milk, receipt of grants, headage payments, calf premiums, hiring out of machinery and the letting of land, as appropriate in each case.</P>
      <P>Expenses allowed include items such as rent of land, stock replacements, fertiliser, crop sprays, seeds, veterinary expenses, the cost of feeding stuffs, repairs to farm buildings, the cost of electricity and petrol used for farm purposes, depreciation of farm machinery, the cost of non-family hired labour and the interest on borrowings for farm purposes.</P>
      <P>The legislation relating to unemployment assistance is designed to ensure that the means assessment reflects the actual position taking account of all income and expenses associated with the farm.  I am concerned to ensure, however, that smallholders, and other people in receipt of unemployment payments, are given the incentive to improve their situation and get back to employment. In this connection the back-to-work allowance which I introduced in 1993 is also available to smallholders. The question of further incentives for enterprise activity by smallholders, including the exemption for means test purposes of certain EU premia for environmental protection is also being examined and I hope to bring forward proposals in this area in the near future.</P>

      <P>A person is entitled to disability benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work as long as they satisfy the relevant contribution conditions.  Such incapacity is certified by the person's doctor at weekly, monthly or other intervals.  A deciding officer decides on entitlement to payment and may take account of a second opinion on incapacity provided by one of my Department's medical referees.</P>
      <P>At the outset of a claim, the question at issue is whether the person can be considered incapable of their normal occupation.  If it becomes clear in the course of the illness that there is no reasonable prospect of the person becoming fit to resume their ordinary occupation, a different criterion of incapacity is applied.  Consideration is then given to whether their condition is such that the person is capable of performing other remunerative work of a type which a person of their training, education, experience and age could reasonably be expected to undertake.  There are, however, certain types of work which a person may be allowed to do under the regulations whilst continuing their entitlement to disability benefit, including work done as part of treatment while in hospital or other similar place; work which is not full-time and is part of a rehabilitation or occupational therapy programme or an approved training course to fit the person for another job if they are not able to do their usual work.

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January, 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time of entering insurable employment if later.</P>
      <P>Social insurance contributions paid before 1953 under the national health insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable.  These were &mdash;national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pensions and unemployment insurance contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.  The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension. However as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements <Col N="1448" /> operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been particularly concerned for some time about the problems of moneylending and indebtedness.  I commissioned a report entitled Moneylending and Low Income Families which the CPA published in 1988.  I then set up a steering committee to tackle the problem and in 1992, my Department funded the establishment of pilot projects around the country, aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending.  Five projects were set up at that time in Cherry Orchard, Dublin city, west Clare, Cork city, Limerick city and Waterford city.</P>
      <P>In 1993 we commissioned an evaluation of the first year of operation of the original five projects.  The evaluation concluded that these projects were meeting a real need for support and advice for people who were caught in a cycle of debt and despair.  A further eight projects were subsequently funded in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the specific conclusions of this evaluation, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library, was that there are strong indications that the extent of <Col N="1449" /> illegal moneylending is on the decline in Cork city, where we have the longest established project in operation.  This view is supported by the money advice project itself, by the local Society of the St. Vincent de Paul, whose work closely involves them with families with debt problems, and by the local Garda authorities. These agencies are closest to the ground and in the best position to judge this matter and I accept their expert knowledge and their assessment of the situation.  There are also indications that the extent of illegal moneylending is on the decline in some of the other areas serviced by money advice projects funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the Government's strategy can break the back of illegal moneylending.  Our strategy involves strengthening the law against illegal moneylending, to give the gardaí the powers they need to combat and eliminate illegal moneylending and to give responsibility and resources to the Director of Consumer Affairs to license and monitor moneylenders.  This is being done in the Consumer Credit Bill which is making its way through the Oireachtas at present.</P>
    <P>The second part of our strategy is to expand the number of money management and debt advice projects being funded by my Department.  I have appointed a national co-ordinator in my Department to spearhead the development and expansion of this initiative. Already this year I have approved funding for new projects in west Waterford, Mullingar, Longford-Westmeath, Laois-Offaly and Dundalk.  I have also approved in principle the establishment of other new projects in Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway and Sligo and areas of Dublin not served by existing projects. Work is well under way in setting up these projects and I expect to be in a position to announce details shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition to new projects already announced for establishment this year, my Department has also received a number of inquiries from other areas about the extension of this service, which are being examined at present with a <Col N="1450" /> view to supporting the establishment of further new projects in those areas as the resources available allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Conference of Major Religious Superiors of Ireland, in their submission Towards Full Citizenship for All, published in late 1993 make a number of recommendations in the social welfare and related areas, including a more flexible approach to employment, increased rates of social welfare payments, and integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  All of these are areas where the Government is already taking action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to rates of payment, during my time as Minister for Social Welfare I <Col N="1451" /> have ensured that social welfare payments have more than kept pace with inflation.  All long term rates now exceed the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates, and from next month short term rates will be brought up to at least that level.  The measures announced in this year's budget were a continuation of the policy of above-inflation increases in social welfare rates.  From July, all weekly payments will be increased by 3 per cent.  A 6 per cent increase is being given to all on the lowest rates, to bring them up to the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  A further increase is being given to unemployment benefit and disability benefit claimants; this gives an overall increase of 10 per cent in the personal rates of these payments.</P>
    <P>To give some examples of the level of increases: the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance will be 61 per cent higher than in 1987, a real increase of 33 per cent.  The increase in the short term rate is 73 per cent, or 43 per cent in real terms.  A person on long term unemployment assistance with a dependent spouse and three dependent children will now receive £137.20.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a number of initiatives allowing unemployed people to take up a range of options in the areas of education, training, part-time work and voluntary work.  In addition, the school-leavers jobs scheme which I introduced gives work experience to school leavers who would otherwise be unemployed, and the back to work allowance scheme allows long term unemployed people and lone parents to retain a proportion of their payments including secondary benefits while seeking out opportunities in indigenous sectors or self-employment or work with voluntary and community groups.</P>
    <P>The CMRS put forward proposals for a scheme whereby unemployed people could be employed voluntarily by public bodies or voluntary organisations to undertake work of a public or social nature.  In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced that £35.3 million <Col N="1452" /> was being made available this year through the Department of Enterprise and Employment for a new community employment programme, and that, as part of this programme, there would be a pilot scheme to test the concept put forward by the CMRS.  The pilot scheme has now been launched and will involve 1,000 of the 40,000 places available under the community employment programme. The CMRS have undertaken to keep me informed of the progress of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton, has been given special responsibility in this area and in 1993 established an expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The group will be examining a number of possible strategies for closer co-ordination and/or integration of the two systems.  The group issued an interim report in December and is expected to submit its final report before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>My Department advised all health boards in November 1993 that participants on the back-to-work allowance scheme are entitled to retain all secondary benefits to which they were entitled prior to participation on the scheme provided that the combination of income from employment or self-employment, the back-to-work allowance and family income supplement is less than £250 gross per week.  Payment to participants of rent or mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary <Col N="1453" /> welfare allowance scheme is subject to a monthly limit of £250.</P>
      <P>People who participate on the scheme receive 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare entitlement for the first year of payment and 50 per cent for the second year.  Every participant on the scheme is issued with a book of payable orders from my Department which can be cashed weekly at their local post office.  The client's name, address, claim number, the name of the scheme and the amount to be paid are pre-printed on each payable order.</P>
      <P>In general, where a client presents his or her back-to-work payment book to a health board community welfare officer this will be accepted by the board as evidence of participation on the scheme for supplementary welfare allowance purposes.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of deserted wife's benefit from my Department at a rate of £128.60 per week for herself and four dependent children. She was also awarded £80 per week maintenance under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 in the District Court, Cork on 18 March, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions contained in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 specify the obligation on people to maintain their spouses and children under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social <Col N="1454" /> welfare income maintenance, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
    <P>This liability may be offset by the transfer to my Department of any maintenance payments which they are making to their spouse in compliance with an order of court.  When the person concerned was awarded deserted wife's benefit her husband became liable to contribute to my Department towards that benefit.  Because he is paying maintenance on foot of a court order the legislation requires that the moneys payable to the court must be transferred to my Department to offset his liability.  I am not in a position under the legislation to waive this requirement.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was asked to consent in writing to this transfer arrangement on 26 May, 1994.  She telephoned my Department when she received this request to transfer to ask if she had to transfer the maintenance payments.  My Department informed her that if she did not comply with the request her weekly rate of benefit may have to be reduced by the amount of the maintenance payments i.e. £80.  Her consent has not been received to date.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned signs her consent to the transfer of the maintenance payments she will continue to receive her deserted wife's benefit in full each week from my Department while she meets the qualifying conditions.  If she refuses to transfer the maintenance payments then the legislation provides that her weekly rate of benefit may have to be reduced by £80.  Regarding the question of mortgage repayments, the Department has taken the view that in cases where it is stated in the court order that the amount which the maintenance debtor is to pay the maintenance creditor is in respect of a mortgage, or part of it is in respect of a mortgage, the amount in respect of the mortgage would not normally be transferrable to my Department.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Deputy's question, I have asked my Department to contact the person concerned again to verify the situation in relation to her mortgage, and <Col N="1455" /> to resolve her maintenance transfer obligations based on that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>A major survey of household income and poverty was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1987 and partially funded by my Department. That study has given rise to a considerable number of reports and papers which have added immeasurably to the information available on poverty and helped to create a more informed debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Many of the results of the ESRI analysis have found their way into the recent publication &ldquo;Poverty and Policy in Ireland&rdquo; and I congratulate the ESRI on the comprehensiveness of this publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key findings of the ESRI's work is in relation to the changing incidence of poverty over the 1970s and 1980s. Comparing the results of the 1987 survey with those of earlier studies, the ESRI <Col N="1456" /> found that the unemployed comprised less than one in ten of those below the 50 per cent income line in 1973; this had risen to over one in three by 1987.  This contrasts with the position of the elderly which improved substantially over the 1970s and 1980s as the real level of social welfare old age pensions increased rapidly relative to other incomes and occupational pension schemes matured and covered more of the retired.</P>
    <P>According to the ESRI, the increase in unemployment during the 1980s has meant that households with children, particularly larger households, faced a much higher risk of falling into poverty at the time of the survey than they had previously.  This insight has been reflected in many of the developments in social policy since the survey was undertaken.</P>
    <P>Given the link between poverty among households with children and unemployment generally, tackling the problem is inevitably linked with the Government's broader strategy to promote employment and facilitate the reintegration of the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed, into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>In addition to this broader strategy significant progress has been made in recent years to improve the position of families with children.  There have been increases in the basic rates of all social welfare weekly payments and substantial increases in child dependent payments. Initiatives which I have introduced to promote the take-up of the family income supplement have given rise to a 70 per cent increase since 1987 in the number of recipient families and a 50 per cent rise in the number of children who benefit. Recent budgets have also seen significant increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of poverty amongst women, the ESRI's publication &ldquo;Poverty and Policy in Ireland&rdquo; concluded that &ldquo;women were not found to be at high risk of poverty relative to men&rdquo; and therefore there was not a &ldquo;feminisation of poverty&rdquo;. Nevertheless, the report did identify certain categories of women who were at a higher risk of poverty.  This was <Col N="1457" /> particularly true of women who were lone parents but was also evident for spouses of people who are unemployed or in low-paid employment with large families.  The ESRI reached the conclusion that the position of these categories of women could best be improved through facilitating their access to the labour market. This suggests that not only should rates of payments continue to be improved but that this should be coupled with improvements in the incentive to work.  I share this view and have given it effect in the last budget through a major improvement in the incentives for lone parents to take up work while retaining benefit.</P>
    <P>The ESRI noted that there are complex questions surrounding the issue of how best to provide income support. These complex issues are currently being looked at by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The views of this group will have an important bearing on how the social welfare system addresses the needs of children, women and indeed, social welfare recipients generally, in the future.</P>
    <P>This year I am arranging with the ESRI for a further survey to be carried out on similar lines to the 1987 survey.  This study will provide up to date information on the current situation and allow for an assessment of development since the previous survey.</P>

      <P>The Government fully recognise the strong tradition of support and respect for the family in Ireland and the importance of the family in our national life.  Accordingly, it decided earlier this year that the steering committee representing voluntary family organisations, which was established in 1992 to undertake preparations for the international year of the family, should retain its existing <Col N="1458" /> status of representing the non-governmental sector and should receive a grant-in-aid to assist them in their preparations for the year.</P>
      <P>This approach is very much in line with that recommended by the United Nations itself which strongly encouraged the active participation of non-governmental organisations in celebrating the year and indicated that their efforts should be supported at State level by way of financial and technical assistance.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £400,000 was made to the steering committee on 14 February last when I officially launched the international year in Ireland.  That grant-in-aid has enabled the steering committee to set up its own office and secretariat and also to financially assist family organisations who are organising events to celebrate the year.  To date, the steering committee have organised a number of events and others are planned for the remainder of the year.  It is also in the process of deciding on grants to some 800 organisations who have applied for funding for their special activities to mark the year of the family.</P>
      <P>In addition to its commitment to the work of the steering committee, the Government also established an interdepartmental committee to prepare its own programme for the year.  That committee, which is under the aegis of my Department and represents the relevant Government Departments dealing with the family, has met on a number of occasions.  It works closely with the steering committee in relation to overall co-ordination of events to mark the year. It is also in the process of drawing up proposals to promote the year and a calendar of events will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my own Department is concerned, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the introduction in Ireland of children's allowance, now called child benefit.  To celebrate that event and as a contribution to the international year of the family, my Department is hosting a conference next September which will address a number of themes relating to child and family income support both in Ireland and other countries.  We are also <Col N="1459" /> promoting through a special grant of £250,000 and through our community development and voluntary grant schemes the development of locally based family resource centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I have taken a pro-active and work supportive approach to assisting unemployed people.  A wide range of initiatives have already been introduced by my Department to assist the long term unemployed to enter the active labour force. A number of measures have also been introduced to encourage the creation of new job opportunities for the unemployed and to assist employers in hardpressed labour intensive sectors.  Unemployed people can also avail of the educational opportunities programme which I introduced to enhance their prospects of obtaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced the back to work allowance last September as a pilot scheme designed to encourage the creation of new job opportunities for up to 3,000 unemployed people or lone parents. Under the scheme the long term unemployed and lone parents can retain up to three quarters of their weekly entitlements and a range of their secondary <Col N="1460" /> benefits for two years.  This helps to provide a financial cushion during the early years of employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>Even though the scheme has only been in operation for a little over eight months, to date it has brought forward some 3,400 jobs with almost 50 per cent of these in self-employment.  There are some 2,300 people currently in receipt of the allowance at an average weekly payment of £78.  I am very pleased with the success of this scheme and in recognition of this success the Government recently increased to 4,000 the upper limit on the number of participants.  I have no doubt that, if circumstances justify it, this limit will be further increased.  It has undoubtedly encouraged the creation of new job opportunities particularly in the indigenous industries identified in the Culliton report as having potential for expansion.</P>
    <P>More importantly it has given a major incentive to the long term unemployed as is evident from the significant number of people who are engaging in self employment as a result of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a pilot scheme and as such it is being carefully monitored by my Department. I have a team of job facilitators in place in each of my Department's eight regions and they are responsible, as part of their role, for marketing the scheme at local level among employers, the long term unemployed and lone parents. Their close personal contact with all of these groups gives facilitators a valuable insight into their reaction to the scheme. It will also enable me to have a sound basis for assessing what changes and modifications are needed when the scheme is being evaluated in my Department. I am very pleased with the positive response which the scheme has received to date from unemployed customers, employers, and other agencies.</P>
    <P>Under the job facilitation programme which I have introduced job facilitators work closely with unemployed people and lone parents.  They will help these customers to assess their needs, support them in seeking job opportunities and direct them towards the wide range of <Col N="1461" /> initiatives and options provided by various Government Departments, agencies, voluntary bodies and community groups.</P>
    <P>A package of measures has also been included in this year's Social Welfare Act which will assist employers in the labour intensive sectors to retain employment and encourage all employers to create new employment.  The package includes:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new two year employers PRSI exemption scheme for 1994-95 and 1995-96; the previous scheme was very successful in assisting employers with 4,000 new jobs created for unemployed people; it is expected that the new scheme will result in the creation of 2,000 further jobs by 5 April 1996 when the scheme ends;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a reduction in the employers share of PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent in respect of employees earning £173 or less per week.</P>
    <P>A programme of educational opportunities is also available to unemployed people.  These optional schemes encourage people who have been out of the education system for a long time to take up second chance education and increase their chances of obtaining employment. This year around 7,000 people will participate in the programme, of which over 1,000 will be attending third level courses.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide a cash boost to families, bringing up children, on low earnings.  As a result of the improvements which I made to FIS last year and other initiatives taken by my Department to promote the benefits of the scheme, the number of families receiving FIS payments has increased by over 22 per cent to about 9,800 since mid 1993.  Under the FIS scheme, a family with four children with an income of £180 per week would receive FIS payments amounting to £1,700 annually.  I announced further improvement of FIS in the 1994 budget and my Department will be mounting a new campaign to increase awareness of its benefits in this year of the family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> I will continue to take a very pro-active and work supportive approach to job creation and to ensure that all relevant programmes administered by my Department are geared towards this objective.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the above measures will assist the unemployed in returning to the workforce.  My Department will continue to support and encourage unemployed people in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently developing a new computerised system which will integrate all short term payments including supplementary welfare allowance.  This new system will support a range of modern payment methods and will facilitate the co-ordination of multiple payments, such as those referred to by the Deputy.  It is planned to introduce it on a pilot basis in the health boards in mid 1995, and to have it fully implemented in all boards during 1996.</P>
      <P>Under the present system, in order to minimise inconvenience for clients who must attend at health centres for payment of rent or mortgage supplements, monthly payment has been introduced, where possible, by health boards.  In a number of areas, rent or mortgage payments are posted to clients.  These initiatives, which continue to be developed, have reduced significantly the frequency of attendance at health centres for the clients involved.</P>

      <P>The report in question was commissioned with the aid of a £15,000 grant from my Department under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations in the social services area.  It is a very useful and constructive report with a number of recommendations in this area relevant to the services provided by health boards and to the respite care fund itself.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that the respite care fund should focus on funding projects designed to alleviate the burden on carers in the first instance, rather than respite care places in institutions.  The report specifically recommends that my Department should consider funding holiday schemes run by voluntary organisations in the field and indeed I was able to allocate grants for a number of projects of this nature under the 1993 scheme. The recommendations in the report that relate to my Department's role in this area are being considered in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>The original allocation for the respite care fund in 1993 was £500,000 and I secured Government approval towards the end of the year to double the allocation to £1 million, by diverting savings that became available in my Department at that time.  The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to make support for carers and provision of resources for respite breaks a priority.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme which I introduced for the first time last year proved to be a major success. <Col N="1464" /> The scheme was a very positive development, of benefit to both students and to local communities.</P>
      <P>As of week ended 10 June 1994 9,400 jobs have been offered by 1,714 sponsors directly involved in community and voluntary work.  A booklet containing details of these jobs will be sent to each eligible student.  I am confident that the number of jobs being offered will continue to rise with eventually over 10,000 jobs becoming available.  At this stage over 5,100 student applications have been received in respect of these jobs. Applications are expected to continue to come forward in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a number of important improvements to this year's scheme. These include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a longer operating period from 1 June to 30 September;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the number of hours has been increased from 160 to 192 for students;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the potential earnings for students have been increased from £400 to £540.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements give a considerable degree of flexibility as to how the work is allocated within a project. Sponsors and students can arrange, where necessary, to complete their projects over a period from six to 12 weeks. In addition the facility for interim payments to help voluntary and community groups overcome any short term cash flow problems will continue this year.</P>
      <P>I have also made arrangements to have the appropriate insurance to cover employers and public liability put into place in respect of any students taking up work under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt but that the introduction of this scheme has enabled the participation of students in every worthwhile work in the community and voluntary sectors.  The scheme has enormous value for the students, the sponsors and the communities in which they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 May 1993, the World Health Assembly decided to seek an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the following question: &ldquo;In view of the health and environmental effects, would the use of nuclear weapons by a State in war or other armed conflict be a breach of its obligations under international law including the WHO constitution?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 14 September 1993 the deputy-registrar of the court invited the Government to submit a written statement to the court.  In response to this invitation, the Government submitted the following statement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 9 June 1994:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> 1.  Ireland has consistently supported effective progress towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>2.  It has been the long-standing position of successive Irish Governments that the use of strategic nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences in view of their indiscriminate character and the devastating effects which they would inflict on mankind and on the environment. Though small-scale tactical nuclear weapons are less indiscriminate in their effects, there is a very serious danger that the use of such weapons could escalate and lead quickly to the use of strategic nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and indiscriminate effect. For these reasons Ireland has urged that every effort should be made to achieve the complete abolition of this whole category of weapons and it has worked for, and given its support to, proposals to this end.</P>
    <P>3.  The Irish Government recognise that a number of States already possess such weapons, and that those States which do so have seen the deployment of these weapons, and their use as a deterrent to attack, as a crucial factor in their security policies.  The Irish Government consider it important that the steps which they want to see taken towards reductions in the levels of nuclear warheads and their ultimate elimination should be such as to avoid destabilising consequences for the States concerned and thus for the international community as a whole.  In particular, the dismantling of nuclear weapons should not lead to increased safety risks or to the spread of these weapons to countries which do not yet possess them.</P>
    <P>4.  In pursuance of this approach, Ireland has welcomed agreements reached through negotiation between <Col N="1467" /> the nuclear powers which have resulted in significant reductions in the levels of the nuclear weapons which they hold. It has seen these agreements as both valuable in themselves and important as steps towards the larger goal of the complete abolition of nuclear weapons throughout the world.</P>
    <P>5.  While the possession and deployment of nuclear weapons by a certain number of States already gives rise to grave dangers, it is evident that the spread of these weapons to other States would increase the danger even further and add greatly to the risk that these weapons will eventually be used.  The further spread of such weapons would also increase the dangers of local arms races.  It could also encourage weaker States in a region who may not have the ability or the means to acquire nuclear weapons, to seek to acquire other weapons of mass destruction as a deterrent against attack or threat from a dominant local power armed with nuclear weapons.  In all of these ways, the spread of nuclear weapons would add greatly to global instability.</P>
    <P>6.  For these reasons, Ireland has always been strongly of the view that it is vital that the further spread of nuclear weapons be halted by agreement; and Ireland has worked for and strongly supports the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Indeed, as early as 1958 Ireland took the initiative at the United Nations in putting forward a resolution calling for the negotiation of such a Treaty; and when the Non-Proliferation Treaty was opened for signature in 1968 Ireland was the first State to ratify it.</P>
    <P>7.  The Irish Government believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is still of central importance; and that universal accession to the Treaty and full compliance with its obligations would be a major contribution to the maintenance <Col N="1468" /> and promotion of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>8.  The Conference to be held in 1995 under Article X.2 of the Treaty will provide an opportunity to ensure that the non-proliferation regime, based on the Treaty, will be reinforced and further extended.  Ireland, in common with all its partners in the European Union, favours the indefinite extension of the Treaty in its present from.  It attaches great importance to the achievement of a successful outcome to the Conference; and it is concerned that the prospects for a successful outcome to the Conference should be enhanced by all possible means.</P>
    <P>9.  The achievement of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, would also constitute a major step in limiting the further development of nuclear weapons, as well as ensuring an end to the unacceptable health and environmental effects of nuclear weapons tests themselves.</P>
    <P>10.  In summary, the approach of the Irish Government as outlined above has been to work politically, by every means open to it, towards the aim of the ultimate abolition by agreement of nuclear weapons.  As steps towards this end, and because of the importance of such measures in themselves, the Irish Government has worked for, and supported, international agreements which would end all nuclear testing and stop the further spread of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>11.  The approach which Ireland has taken in promoting and supporting efforts to bring about the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons has been political in character.  The present referral to the International Court of Justice by the World Health Assembly requests an advisory opinion on whether the use of nuclear weapons by a State in war or other armed conflict would be a breach of its obligations <Col N="1469" /> under international law including the WHO Constitution.  The Irish Government do not see this approach which situates the issue within the framework of obligations accepted by States under international law as in any way incompatible with their own efforts in the political field to secure the abolition of such weapons.  The Irish Government, therefore, look forward with great interest to the Opinion of the Court which they believe will clarify the legal issues which arise for States in relation to this most dangerous category of weapons.</P>

      <P>The person to <Col N="1471" /> whom the Deputy refers was one of 33 Irish citizens known to have been in Yemen when civil war broke out there early in May.</P>
      <P>As there is no Irish diplomatic or consular mission in that country, my Department immediately asked the foreign ministries of several of our EU partners, including those of France and Germany, for their assistance in ensuring the safety and, if necessary, the evacuation of Irish citizens.  These ministries extended their full co-operation and 24 Irish citizens are known to have been evacuated.  The person named by the Deputy was evacuated to Djibouti on 10 May on a flight arranged by the German authorities.  There is no Irish mission in Djibouti and most of our people evacuated to there were helped by the French authorities who arranged onward flights to Paris.  I understand that, unlike most others, the person referred to by the Deputy did not go to Paris but instead travelled to Abu Dhabi.  We are not aware of dissatisfaction on the part of his family about the handling of the case; however if there are aspects that they would wish to discuss with us, we would be glad to hear from them.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise to the Deputy that in situations of crisis our priority is the evacuation of our citizens from areas of danger; in areas where we do not have diplomatic representation, we are dependent on EU partners to act on our behalf and we do not always have as much control over arrangements as we would wish.</P>

      <P>The proposal raised by the Deputy involves a consideration of some of the key factors governing the tax treatment of pension funds.  If the proposal were implemented it would mean a radical change in the present arrangements and it is not clear what the end result would be in terms of the impact on the future pensions of the individual employees in funded occupational pension schemes. Those pensioners who would under the existing arrangements and the existing tax law pay little or no tax on their pensions <Col N="1474" /> could in fact lose out unless there was some special cross-subsidy provision. The impact on employer costs and on the financial services sector would also need to be carefully examined.  From the point of view of the Exchequer there would be an immediate gain in the withdrawal of the tax deductibility of employer and employee contributions but this would be counterbalanced at least in part by the future tax loss from the proposed tax exemption of the pensions.  However, there is also the danger that employees might opt out of funded occupation pension schemes which could put major pressure on the State's social welfare pension schemes when those employees reach retirement age.  There are indications from at least one other OECD country that the implementation of a similar proposal in the recent past has in fact resulted in employees opting out of funded occupational schemes.</P>
      <P>In the light of the above, the Deputy will appreciate that the matter is a very complex one that would require a very detailed and comprehensive analysis including an actuarial study before proceeding any further with it.</P>

      <P>The residence of an individual for tax purposes in a particular year can only be determined at the end of the year having regard to all the relevant circumstances. As the case to which the Deputy refers appears to relate to the current tax year, she will appreciate that it will not be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to make a final determination until 5 April 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this year's Finance Act contains new provisions relating to the residence and ordinary residence of individuals in the State for tax purposes.  Generally, these provisions apply from 6 April 1994. However, in a limited number of cases, described in the legislation, the new residence tests have been deferred until 6 April 1995.  Thus the old residence tests and certain administrative and legislative practices related to them which applied until 5 April 1994 will remain in force for those cases until 5 April 1995.  It would appear, based on the limited details provided in respect of the person to whom the question refers, that this case may <Col N="1476" /> require to be considered by reference to the old rules.</P>
    <P>An information leaflet prepared by the Revenue Commissioners, dealing with all aspects of the new residence rules and the transitional provisions, will be provided to the Deputy and the person to whom the question refers, which should help to clarify any queries arising from the changes.</P>

      <P>The present position concerning the decentralisation programme to Dundalk is that a total of 85 staff of the Revenue Commissioners have already moved and are <i>in situ</i> in temporary accommodation. The Office of Public Works will not have staff moving to Dundalk; the question of designating a section of another Department to make up the overall target figure for Dundalk of up to 150 staff is at an advanced stage of consideration at present.</P>
      <P>The decentralised staff will be located in a new building at Newry Road where a site is available.  Following a public advertisement, a number of developers applied to be included on a short list of those specially invited to submit their proposals for the building.  This list will shortly be finalised and tenders invited from the developers concerned.</P>

      <P>Open competitions for the appointment of persons with disabilities to positions as clerical assistant and other grades in the Civil Service are held from to time by the Civil Service Commission.  It is common practice in competitions generally for the panel from a previous competition to be discontinued by the Civil Service Commission when a new panel becomes available. This is to ensure that a successful candidate at a competition is not excluded for an unreasonable length of time from appointment due to the assignment of candidates from an earlier panel. The last competition for the appointment of persons with disabilities as clerical assistants was held in 1990 and a fresh competition is therefore appropriate at this stage.  Appointments will continue to be made from the 1990 panel should suitable vacancies arise until the panel from the recently advertised competition has been set up.  Apart from the highest placed qualifiers in the written examination at the 1990 competition candidates were given no promise that they would be called for interview.</P>

      <P>When the Royal Canal was taken over by the Office of Public Works in 1986, CIE retained ownership of the canal bank at this location.  Only the water channel was transferred and the Office of Public Works have therefore no powers in relation to the adjoining lands which CIE retained.  Proposals for the future development of this property are therefore a matter which should be addressed to CIE.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Finance Act, 1992, persons who bring a second-hand car into the State must, unless authorised by the Revenue Commissioners, register the car with the commissioners and pay the vehicle registration tax, VRT, due on the car.</P>
      <P>The disabled drivers scheme, established under and governed by the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, provides significant tax concessions to qualifying disabled drivers and passengers with severe mobility problems in respect of the purchase and requisite adaptation of vehicles for their use.  To qualify under the scheme, drivers and passengers must satisfy medical criteria specified in the regulations and be duly certified by a director of community care and medical officer of health in the local health board.  In addition, qualifying claimants must have certified adaptations carried out to the vehicles involved to take account of their particular disabilities.  In the case of qualifying disabled passengers, the adaptation requirement is that the VAT-free cost of the adaptations must amount to at least 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of the vehicle.  The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and qualifying claimants under the scheme must be registered with the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concessions available under the scheme include the refund of the VRT paid at the time of registration to a qualifying disabled person who imports a second-hand car which was suitably constructed or adapted for his-her use.  The qualifying person concerned, or somebody acting on his-her behalf, may also claim a refund of the VAT paid on the adaptations provided the work was carried <Col N="1490" /> out by a VAT registered trader in the State.  The total amount refundable in any two year period is limited to £7,500 for a qualifying disabled driver and £9,000 for a qualifying disabled passenger respectively.  Other concessions include excise duty refunds on up to 600 gallons of petrol or diesel annually and exemption from road tax.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it has no record of a determination of the eligibility of the person concerned having been made.  Accordingly, the first step is to determine the eligibility of that person.  I have requested the commissioners to forward to the mother of the person concerned details of the scheme and the necessary application forms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under new arrangements which I will introduce shortly, time spent working in the home rearing young children or caring full time for elderly or incapacitated people will be disregarded in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  Prior to this, people in this situation would have had a gap in their PRSI record which could have <Col N="1491" /> prevented them from qualifying for a pension.

      <P>Social welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional weekly payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payment of a diet supplement is determined by the health boards by reference to standard costed diets.  The supplement paid is in respect of the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that the level of supplement payable in respect of the daughter of the person concerned has been revised upwards from £2 to £8.90 per week following a recent review of the case.  The person in question has been advised of the increase and that appropriate arrears will be paid by the board as soon as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by many elderly people in maintaining the payments for their phones or in having phones installed in view of the fact that the present regulations prevent payment of a free telephone rental allowance in the case of a married old age pensioner irrespective of his or her age if his or her spouse is under the age of 66 and in theory capable of getting help in an emergency; his views on whether this creates hardship for many couples in such a situation with limited means and perhaps living in lonely or isolated places and who must have a phone for their own peace of mind in case of illness or any other sort of emergency; if, in view of all these considerations, he will make a free telephone rental allowance available to such people who would otherwise qualify; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A free telephone rental allowance is available only to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or persons who are so incapacitated that they could not get help in an emergency.  The number of people getting the allowance at present is about 114,000 at an annual cost of some £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course, an old age pensioner living with a spouse does not qualify for the free telephone rental allowance unless the spouse is so incapacitated as to be unable to get help in an emergency.  However, I am introducing two improvements in that regard from the beginning of next month.  First, a pensioner being cared for by a recipient <Col N="1493" /> of a carer's allowance will be able to retain the free telephone rental allowance. Secondly, pensioners aged 75 years and over will qualify for the free telephone rental allowance even if they have a spouse or another adult living with them.  Any extension of this concession to pensioners under 75 years of age would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the EU regulation in relation to the one stamp rule whereby a social welfare applicant requires one additional stamp in the country in which they are applying for benefit; the action, if any, he has taken to address the difficulties this regulation presents; the progress to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The EU regulation to which the Deputy refers is Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 and the implementing Regulation No. 574/72.  These regulations provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes for workers, self-employed persons and their families moving throughout the European Union. With effect from 1 January 1994 they also apply to certain EFTA states, namely, Finland, Austria, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.  The one stamp rule relates to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of options available to unemployed Irish people who last worked in an EU member state or one of the other states referred to above.  They can, subject to satisfying certain conditions, have their unemployment benefit payments from the state in which they were last employed paid to them for up to three months when they return to Ireland in search of work.  They can on returning to Ireland qualify for Irish benefit if they satisfy the conditions for entitlement based on their Irish PRSI contribution record.  Their Irish unemployment benefit is, however, not payable <Col N="1494" /> for any period during which they are in receipt of unemployment benefit from another member state.</P>
    <P>If a person fails to qualify for Irish unemployment benefit based on his-her Irish PRSI contribution record, there is provision, under the EU legislation referred to above, for taking into account periods of insurance or employment in all states to which the regulation applies in order to determine an individual's entitlement to unemployment benefit.  In order for such periods to be aggregated it is necessary that the person was last insured or employed in the state in which unemployment benefit is claimed.  This provision, together with other provisions of Regulations (EEC) Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72, are directly applicable in and binding on all states concerned.</P>
    <P>We have raised the issue at Social Affairs Council level particularly in relation to countries where we have &ldquo;close ties&rdquo;, such as the UK.  There is no agreement to amend the present arrangements which are set out in the EU regulations.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by people working in the building industry who are obliged to obtain C.45 certificates to become self-employed who, when they lose work cannot obtain unemployment assistance; and if he will consider cases where people participate in the back to work scheme and then revert to unemployment assistance so that they will be favourably considered in means test circumstances so that they will not be penalised for having been on a C.45 certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation referred to by the Deputy.  The position under the Social Welfare Acts is that Rule 1 (2) of the Third Schedule, Part 1, to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) <Col N="1495" /> Act, 1993, provides that all cash income which an applicant may reasonably expect to receive during the coming year, other than specific payments-allowances excluded by the Act, must be assessed as means.  Income from self-employment is assessable under this heading.</P>
      <P>In cases of self-employment means are assessed on an income and expenditure basis i.e. gross income less expenses incurred in earning that income.  The net figure is then divided by 52 to calculate weekly means.  In assessing means, deciding and appeals officers have regard to the previous work pattern of the claimant and whether this is likely to be replicated in the future.  Where it is likely that the recent work pattern will not be repeated and earnings will be reduced, this will be reflected in a reduced means assessment. It is open to any claimant to appeal the means assessment to the independent social welfare appeals office if dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>Where a person resumes claiming unemployment assistance after having been in employment or on a training-education course, means are reviewed only where there are grounds for believing that an existing assessment no longer reflects the current situation.  The same practice will be followed in relation to persons who reapply for unemployment assistance following participation in the back-to-work scheme.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> recognises concerns identified by the social partners in relation to the operation of the C45 system.  A specific commitment in the programme provides that the Black Economy Monitoring Group, which is drawn from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare, CIF, IBEC and ICTU, will be asked to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 scheme and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the scheme generally.  A special sub-group of the Black Economy Monitoring Group has been set up to study the C45 scheme and is due to report to the group by the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The Deputy will also be interested to know that I provided for regulatory powers in the recent Social Welfare Act, under which entitlement to certain occupational injuries benefits may be extended to categories of workers not covered at present for those benefits.  It is my intention to use the regulatory powers in this section to extend occupational injuries benefits to workers whose work arrangements have changed in recent years requiring them to become sub-contractors, and thereby insured for PRSI pensions only, rather than remain as workers insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  Changes in working arrangements in the construction industry will receive particular attention.</P>

      <Quest>if her Department undertakes any monitoring of consultants, solicitors or others who act as intermediaries in regard to applications for naturalisation under the business migration scheme; the plans, if any, she has to issue guidelines for such intermediaries in view of evidence that some of them may have been operating the scheme in a racist way; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am not clear as to what kind of monitoring is contemplated by the Deputy or what might be considered an appropriate exercise for my Department to conduct in this regard.</P>
      <P>Many naturalisation applications submitted under the business migration scheme have been strongly supported by legal and accountancy firms which are amongst the largest and most highly regarded in this country.  With the best will in the world, I could foresee considerable resentment on the part of the firms concerned if the Department of Justice proceeded to monitor their activities simply because they acted as intermediaries in this particular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware, it is not the practice for any Government Department to undertake monitoring of solicitors, <Col N="1502" /> consultants or other individuals who make representations on behalf of their clients and a question that has to be asked is whether it would be considered somewhat sinister and intimidating if any such measures were adopted by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>For the sake of clarity, it should be said that applicants for naturalisation, by way of investment or otherwise, may apply direct to my Department.  There is no requirement for applicants to avail of the services of intermediaries.</P>
    <P>I would be most concerned if third parties assisting applicants have behaved in a racist way or have suggested that my Department implements policy and procedures in relation to naturalisation in a racist manner.  I would condemn such behaviour in the strongest terms.  If the Deputy has evidence of such behaviour I would ask him to bring it to my attention immediately.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is contained in the following tabular statement.  That detailed information is not readily available for the years 1989 and 1990.  However, in 1989 there were 36 applications and one was granted.  In 1990, there were 62 applications and one was granted.  With regard to the nationalities of applicants, it is not the practice to disclose such information having regard to the confidential nature of the applications.  Because the total numbers are relatively small it would be quite easy to identify individuals if nationality statistics were provided.  I should add that the advice of the UNHCR on whether refugee status should be granted, has been accepted in all cases which have been finalised.</P>

The District Court Rules, 1948, set out the present procedures in relation to the exercise of the summary jurisdiction of the District Court, which includes most traffic cases.</P>
      <P>In the case of traffic offences, it would not be practical to have such cases heard in the court area wherein the accused resides as this would involve the prosecuting garda having to attend District Courts throughout the State.  As such, this would be an uneconomic and inefficient use of Garda resources and serve only to increase the amount of time spent by gardaí in court.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces pension schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £3.51 a week in addition to the basic pension to a soldier for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.  As a general rule, this special increment ceases to be payable when the soldier pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension, at age 65, or to a contributory old age pension, at 66.  The personal rate of either social <Col N="1516" /> welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment.</P>
      <P>The discontinuance of the special increment is in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Soldiers are so insured.</P>

      <P>Apart from the recommendation which involved reckoning military service allowance for pension purposes and which has been implemented, the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson commission, considered that any further changes in the superannuation arrangements should be introduced only in the context of a fundamental revision of the Defence Forces pension schemes.  The Commission recognised that such a revision would be a task of considerable technical complexity and would involve a fundamental reappraisal of the existing arrangements.  At present a detailed review of the Defence Forces is being undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group and the outcome of the review will also be a factor in this matter.  Detailed consultations and discussions with the representative associations will be required in due course.</P>

      <Col N="1537" /> The ewe premium scheme is payable in accordance with EU regulations.  Normally payments are made by way of three instalments.

      <P>A motorised transport grant scheme for disabled drivers has been in operation in my Department since 1968.  The scheme was introduced to help disabled drivers to get a job and was later extended to include disabled drivers who needed a car to retain their employment.  To be eligible for this scheme the applicant must need a car in order to earn a living.  However, a person who lives in a very isolated area may also qualify for this scheme. Payment of the grant is also subject to a means test and the current maximum grant is £2,500.  Disabled drivers may also avail of tax concessions under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989 which are administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>A mobility allowance for handicapped persons to finance the occasional taxi journey for severely handicapped persons unable to walk or use public transport who would benefit from trips from home is also administered by my Department. This allowance is normally paid in addition to the disabled person's maintenance allowance of £59.20 per week or other social welfare payments.  The mobility allowance is currently £432 per annum.</P>

      <P>I see teachers' centres playing a central role in helping to deliver a high quality teacher in-career development programme and I plan to establish a network of centres nationwide.  In relation to criteria, an effective teachers' centre must be capable of responding to the in-career <Col N="1551" /> development needs of the education system and also to the needs of schools and individual teachers.  It must be capable of promoting real change in the classroom and be efficient and cost effective in the development and delivery of in-career development activities.</P>
      <P>This year is the starting point of the development programme to upgrade and expand the network of teachers' centres. The process of setting up the network has already begun in accordance with the above criteria.  I have sanctioned the building of new purpose-built centres to replace the existing centres at Blackrock, County Dublin and in west Dublin.  I have announced the upgrading of the teachers' centres at Carrick-on-Shannon, Portlaoise and Tralee to full-time status and, if necessary, new purpose-built centres will be provided in those locations.  I will be considering the position of the other teachers' centres and have invited them to contact my Department about their plans and to apply for inclusion in the development programme.</P>

    <P>The position regarding the allocation of national lottery funds by the Youth Affairs Section to Lucan is that up to 1991, the section's grants to Lucan Youth Service were included in a general allocation for the provision of youth services in the Clondalkin-Ronanstown-Lucan area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that at present it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion on the existence of scotopic sensitivity syndrome as a condition.  It has generally been described in terms which are not very precise and as a set of symptoms which, in some cases, appears to respond to a certain treatment, including the provision of tinted lenses.  The fact that a set of symptoms can be dealt with in a certain <Col N="1554" /> way, in the case of some people, does not mean that a syndrome exists.</P>
      <P>In recent years a small number of applications for special consideration in examinations, in which scotopic sensitivity syndrome has been cited, have been made to my Department.  All the applications were made on the grounds that the candidates were impaired by a specific learning difficulty.  It was suggested that the candidates' specific learning difficulties resulted from scotopic sensitivity syndrome.</P>
      <P>All applications for special consideration based on the existence of a specific learning difficulty are referred to the Psychological Service of my Department. Special consideration is approved where my Department's psychologists are satisfied that the condition is of such a degree that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers.  It is also approved where the examiner would have difficulty in deciphering the candidate's handwriting.</P>
      <P>In the particular instance adverted to, an application for special consideration on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty was made to my Department on 25 November 1993 by the candidate's school.  The application was accompanied by samples of the candidate's written work, a psychological assessment prepared by the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, and a report from the Irlen Institute stating that the candidate had been diagnosed as having the visual dysfunction of scotopic sensitivity and recommending that he wear tinted lenses.</P>
      <P>The application was referred to my Department's Psychological Service for consideration.  Having evaluated the reports and the samples of the written work, the psychologist concluded that a regular examiner would have no difficulty in reading the applicant's work and expressed the opinion that the candidate had no need of special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that my Department's scheme of special consideration is intended for candidates who have learnt the knowledge to be examined but who <Col N="1555" /> would be impaired in communicating it to an examiner because of a physical or psychological disability.  Special consideration does not mean more lenient marking.  My Department's aim is to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment. A range of facilities is available and these are tailored, as far as possible, to the needs of the individual candidates.</P>
    <P>A wide range of facilities is available in the case of a pupil who is impaired.  A candidate who is unable to read, or is effectively unable to read, may be allowed the service of a person who will read the questions.  A candidate who is unable to write, or is effectively unable to write, may be allowed the service of a scribe or the use of a mechanical aid such as a tape recorder, a typewriter or a word processor.  Extra time may be allowed where the candidate is unable to make adequate use of the services or aids allowed.</P>
    <P>The facility which is afforded the majority of candidates who are impaired by a specific learning difficulty is, however, simply to ensure that their answerbooks are marked by examiners who are experienced in marking the work of such candidates and in deciphering their handwriting.  These examiners will ensure that full credit is given for all work done.</P>
    <P>As already stated, special consideration often consists of simply referring a candidate's scripts to an examiner who is used to deciphering poor handwriting. As there was no need even for this, in the opinion of my Department's psychologists, the school was informed on 27 April that my Department was not prepared to grant special consideration in respect of this candidate.</P>
    <P>I should add that the existence of a specific learning difficulty does not automatically qualify a candidate for special consideration in examinations.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling they may not require the provision of any <Col N="1556" /> special facilities provided that they can read the question papers of the required level and write legibly and intelligibly. Each individual case is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>In considering appropriate educational provision for children with autism it is necessary to take account of factors such as the severity of the autistic symptoms and the level of intelligence and of language development.  No one type of educational provision will meet the needs of all children with autism. There is a continuum of special education needs which is best served by a corresponding range of educational provisions. Accordingly, some needs may be catered for in the ordinary school, while <Col N="1559" /> more acute needs can best be met in a more specialised setting.</P>
      <P>Depending on individual circumstances, educational provision can be made in any one of the following: (a) an ordinary national school with the support of a remedial or resource teacher; (b) a special class in an ordinary national school; (c) a special school for mentally handicapped children; (d) a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>A range of special education facilities is provided in the County Limerick area and these facilities focus on the assessed needs of children in the area.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has particular cases in mind and can provide further details, I will have those cases fully investigated. Without such details, I am not in a position to comment on the appropriateness of existing provision.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, there were 131 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus four assistants for the 1993-94 school year. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>There were 121 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus three assistants for the 1994-95 school year. The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 127 pupils in order to retain the post of fourth assistant in 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school may qualify under either of these exceptions, my Department will be happy to examine the position on receipt of projected enrolment details.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school in question applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socioeconomic criteria.</P>
    <P>Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of the Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools.</P>
    <P>As I recently announced in the context of the 1994 education budget, an additional 55 schools have been designated as disadvantaged for capitation grant purposes in the current year.</P>
    <P>I regret that the school in question did not rate high enough on the priority list for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in dealing with the special needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary classes.</P>
    <P>The approval of resource teacher posts in a particular year is governed by the teaching resources available in that year. Where such posts are available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.</P>

      <P>In the first instance parents should appeal a decision on enrolment with the board of management of the school concerned.</P>
      <P>It is the board of management that sets the enrolment policy for a school and while parents are usually able to have their children enrolled in the school of their first choice, local circumstances may be such at a particular time, that a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to those from a particular area or a particular age group.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is recognised by my Department <Col N="1568" /> as a school serving a disadvantaged area and as such has an additional concessionary teaching post and receives additional capitation funding at the rate of £17 per pupil.  As stated in my recent announcement on the 1994 education budget I have allocated an additional 15 co-ordinator posts to the home-school-community liaison scheme with effect from September next.  These extra posts will facilitate a significant expansion of the service and the schools were selected from among those in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>I regret that it was not possible on this occasion to include the school mentioned by the Deputy.  However, the needs of this school will be considered in any further expansion of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the appointment of 100 additional remedial posts for primary schools, which will bring the total in place to 1,133.  The posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.  The school mentioned by the Deputy already has the services of a full-time remedial teacher. Unfortunately, the school's application for an additional remedial post was not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint a substantial number of additional teachers in the coming years.  The needs of all schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a phased programme of financial assistance by way of a supplementary capitation grant for the provision of caretaking and secretarial services in schools has been introduced from 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>The school in question has benefited under the new scheme and is in receipt of a grant towards the cost of clerical services from September 1993.</P>
      <P>I regret that it is not possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time secretary to the school.</P>

      <P>I plan to meet the chairman of the Higher Education Authority in the near future.  In relation to the question of teacher training places I refer the Deputy to my reply to a parliamentary question on 31 May in which I indicated that the number of places in postgraduate teacher training in 1994 will be 980.  I went on to state that this is a reduction of 47 on the total number of places for postgraduate training in 1993 and an increase of over 200 for 1991 and 1992 and indeed is a significant increase for all of the previous years back to 1988.</P>

      <P>In the case of the pupils referred to by the Deputy, an application was made to my Department by their school for special consideration in examinations on the grounds that each was impaired by a specific learning difficulty.  The application also stated that each was a member of a special class for mildly mentally handicapped children.</P>
      <P>My Department's scheme of special consideration is intended for candidates who have learnt the knowledge to be examined but who would be impaired in communicating it to an examiner because of a physical or psychological disability. Where an application is based on the existence of a psychological disability, special arrangements are approved provided my Department's psychologists are satisfied that the following conditions are fulfilled: on the basis of the evidence put forward or adduced, the candidate's level of general intellectual ability is not below the average range; the candidate's level of general intellectual ability is not reflected in much of the candidate's schoolwork because of specific difficulties in reading or in writing; the degree of disability is such that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers or is such that a regular examiner would have difficulty in deciphering the candidate's handwriting.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the learning difficulties of the mentally handicapped are not due to specific difficulties in reading or in writing but are due to their level of general intellectual ability, which is below the average range.

      <P>I recently announced the appointment of 100 additional remedial posts for primary schools, which will bring the total in place to 1,133.</P>
      <P>The posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's primary inspectorate. Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputy were not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint a substantial number of additional teachers in the coming years.  The needs of all schools, including the schools mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>My Department is prepared to make grant-aid available towards the provision of a prefabricated structure at the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, it is open to the school management, if it so wishes, to offset this grant against the cost of a permanent classroom, with the additional cost being a local liability.  I understand that proposals are at present being drawn up by the school management for a permanent classroom.</P>
