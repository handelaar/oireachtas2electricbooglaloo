      <P>On a point of order, I would like your guidance, Sir, about the rules governing the making of personal statements by Members. Yesterday you allowed the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make a personal statement attempting to rebut a newspaper article about a circular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Indeed, and that is why I would like to ask whether you will allow the Tánaiste to make a statement rebutting the false promises he made to the people before the last election. I would like him to make a statement on that matter. The precedent that was used by <Col N="262" /> Deputy Taylor should be used by the Tánaiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inquire about No. 13 relating to the budget. In regard to an apparent change in Government policy on means testing widows' pensions, it appears that the Government is going to apply the means test to young widows who have to go out to work but not to wealthy widows who have large properties and huge incomes. This seems to be blatantly anti-PAYE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem is that the Government seems to be changing the budget. The debate cannot easily proceed if the Government is changing its proposal all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Government's proposal in regard to widow's pensions? It seems to change every time an adverse newspaper headline appears on the matter.</P>

      <P>This is by far the best budget for the low paid in 20 years. There has been very little recognition by the Opposition that the budget will improve the position of the low paid to the tune of £200 million in PAYE tax relief. The reductions in PAYE, health and employment levies and employers' PRSI will lead to an expansion of employment in the service sectors. It also opens up the possibility of employers offering work on a part-time basis to take advantage of the PRSI reductions. Even after the measures proposed in the budget, unemployment is forecast at a level of 289,000. This is not acceptable to the Government, and it is certainly not acceptable to me. I urge the Government to consider giving additional incentives in the Finance <Col N="270" /> Bill which will prompt voluntary work-sharing on an extensive scale. I welcome the measures taken by the Minister for Finance to improve conditions for the low paid. To echo his comments in relation to tax collection, an essential characteristic of a good tax system is the collection of taxes which are due. That was one of the most significant remarks he made in his Budget Statement.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to one of the major changes in the area of taxation. Like my party, I welcome the move away from the imposition of taxes on income towards the imposition of taxes on property. We can see the logical progression in this area by the removal of some of the very unfair reliefs on mortgages at the higher rate and VHI contributions. With regard to the residential property tax, one can see from its history that the vast bulk of this tax was collected in the Dublin area. While many of us are very anxious to see movement in the creation of a structure of funding for local government which will bring in approximately £200 million per year, I suggest that the residential property tax, as currently framed, will not bring in that level of funding. I ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider this issue in the Finance Bill. The residential property tax is a very blunt instrument which impinges primarily on householders in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the many measures in the budget which will encourage enterprises to develop. I am referring in particular to the fund of £100 million which will be administered by the Industrial Credit Corporation, the reduction in PRSI to 9 per cent for those earning £173 per week, the changes in capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, the BES limit and the roll-over relief. All these changes will <Col N="271" /> give an incentive to entrepreneurs to develop.</P>
      <P>On the question of entrepreneurial development, the budget will mark the end of what has been a bad phase in terms of taxation policy and hopefully the begining of a new phase in which the Government will play a much more direct role in job creation. I would urge the Government to look at the national work sharing programmes in Holland and France, which we could usefully copy to encourage more women into the workforce. Even with the additional 20,000 jobs which hopefully will be created as a result of the measures in the budget, we still need to develop this third method of employment. A national work sharing programme along the lines of that proposed by the Labour Party is the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time with me. Framing a good budget is probably one of the most difficult tasks undertaken by a Minister for Finance or a Cabinet. We all know of the many conflicting demands by various sectors, some of which are particularly articulate and well connected. I suppose it is necessary for a Minister for Finance to step aside from those pressures and to take an objective look at the economy. First and foremost, it is necessary for him to give considerable thought to the present position of the country and where we see ourselves in the future. Considerable thought also needs to be given to developing a vision for the country, deciding the kind of society we want and, having done that, working out a very clear strategy to bring about that kind of society.</P>
      <P>The key social and economic challenges facing us can be easily summarised. We must ensure that economic growth translates into job creation, that those disadvantaged by the absence of jobs are enabled to lead lives of dignity and fulfilment and that they are freed from the kind of hopelessness and sense of futility which now saps the morale of many of our people and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> Labour's primary purpose in Government is to ensure that these challenges remain in the forefront of our thinking and that they are tackled with as much skill and ingenuity as we can bring to bear upon them. We must ensure that the combined resources of the State, the social partners, the financial institutions and the voluntary and community organisations are applied to tackling this emergency which is as threatening to our future as any emergency in the past.</P>
    <P>In general, the direction of this budget deserves to be supported. Some steps have been taken which prepare the way for more fundamental reform in years to come. Some sensitive targeting of key areas and groups take account of concerns which the Labour Party has been voicing for some time. In this regard I welcome the targeting of low paid workers by the removal of the two levies and the shift in policy on PRSI for low paid workers. I have campaigned for this and I particularly welcome the fact that the employers' PRSI is now reduced to 9 per cent for employees earning below £9,000. Of course, there is still a long way to go before Irish jobs can fully compete with jobs in the United Kingdom and I hope that in future budgets we could reduce this to the 6.6 per cent rate which currently obtains in the UK. I hope, too, that employers' PRSI will be graduated so that a person who earns more than £9,000 is not immediately hit by the top rate.</P>
    <P>I also endorse the remarks by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, in relation to work sharing. There is a need for an imaginative approach to the whole question of how we structure our working week as there is huge potential here for creating new job opportunities. I hope that the whole issue will be teased out in the near future and look forward to initiatives in that area over the coming year.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the initiatives in relation to developing the community employment programme and the fact that there are plans to increase the number of places to approximately 40,000. There is great potential for developing the idea <Col N="273" /> of community work schemes. This is in evidence in my constituency in the Ballymun and Finglas areas where schemes have been used to good effect to give recognition to the huge amount of work in the voluntary sector. I believe there is further potential there to develop work within the whole environmental area.</P>
    <P>One of the main planks of the Labour Party's agenda is to continue with the local authority house building programme which commenced last year so that the unacceptably long housing waiting list can be significantly reduced in the shortest possible period. In this respect I welcome the fact that, as was the case last year, 3,500 new houses will be built this year and I look forward to this programme continuing at least at the present rate for the duration of the Government's term of office. The £21 million allocated to social housing is another welcome provision in this area.</P>
    <P>I am particularly proud of the developments in education which are clear proof of our commitment to it. I congratulate the Minister for Education for securing this additional funding and commend her for the priority basis of her approach to education spending, in particular, the targeting of the disadvantaged and the significant increase in capitation for children in special schools.</P>
    <P>A particularly notable provision is the £10 million for the further implementation on the Child Care Act. I hope the implementation of this Act, which is long overdue, can be speeded up over the coming years. I also welcome the increased grants to the many voluntary organisations. Another interesting pilot scheme announced is the imaginative scheme to develop &ldquo;over the shop&rdquo; residential accommodation. This has great potential and it will be interesting to see the outcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the 1 per cent levy, people regard this as merely getting back what was always theirs, nevertheless its abolition is welcome. I also welcome the gradual move towards widening the tax base. Most of us will agree it is highly unsatisfactory that this State, with such high levels of unemployment, <Col N="274" /> should rely to such a large extent on income taxes. Few will seriously argue with the principle that a greater proportion of tax revenue should be raised from sources other than earned income but if this principle is to be fully accepted as a legitimate and appropriate alternative source of revenue, it must be developed and applied with care and with a greater regard to perceptions of equity than we have shown up to now.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive and fair property tax will cover much more than simply house property and it could be argued that the family home should be the last property to be hit. If it was fair it certainly would not militate against families, against those who have extended their homes to cater for growing children or who have older working sons or daughters living at home. It should not so heavily discriminate against urban dwellers, particularly those who have no intention of leaving relatively modest homes whose values have been artificially inflated by market conditions. As Deputy Broughan said earlier, effectively the property tax is a Dublin tax and it is very hard to justify a family living in a relatively modest home in Dublin having to pay property tax while a family with a similar income living in possibly a larger house outside Dublin is not obliged to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>In framing an equitable property tax it must also be recognised that many houses are substantially owned by banks and buildings societies paying proportionately little to the Exchequer while those put to the pin of their collars to meet mortgage payments must find the extra tax on properties they do not expect to own for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to other provisions many of us will profoundly regret that we have been unable so far to develop a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. Social welfare increases are disappointing. Keeping pace with inflation is a small achievement when the base payment is barely at subsistence level. It is remarkable <Col N="275" /> how little attention is paid by commentators to the impact of the budget in the social welfare area. This area, of course, affects one in every three citizens at the very core of their lives while aspects of the property tax, affecting fewer than one in 20, consume acres of newsprint and hours of radio and television debate. Perhaps social welfare legislation is too complex for the commentators to understand but it is hardly more complex than the taxation system or the minutiae of the property tax. Yet it seems that columnists, commentators and talk show hosts continue to think in terms of a model which envisages only home owning salaried couples targeted by the advertisers who pay for newsprint and air time.</P>
    <P>There is little in the budget to demconstrate that, as yet, we are prepared to afford the kind of priority we owe to children and families. In that respect it is regrettable that the progress made last year in improving the level of child benefit has not been continued.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the major gainers from the tax changes announced are still the better off. I would have hoped that the Minister would have raised the exemption limits of PAYE. I look forward to further expansion of the standard rate in next year's budget. Of course, the major difficulty <i>vis-á-vis</i> the tax system is that, because of its complexity, it creates a large number of tax shelters. There was no attempt to streamline the tax system, which is regrettable. In addition, it was unfortunate that no extra resources were provided for tackling tax evasion.</P>
    <P>While there was some reference in the budget to covenants, another area in need of major reform, there was no provision made for reform. I look forward to covenants being reformed under the provisions of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to special allocations it is unfortunte that consideration was not given to the major problem of drugsrelated crime, particularly as it affects Dublin city. A special allocation in this area would have been money well spent.</P>
    <P>I might make one other point in <Col N="276" /> relation to the special allocation of £5 million for Croke Park. Many people will find this allocation particularly difficult to understand since the high profile campaign for the development of Croke Park was the subject of much opposition by my constituents, particularly those in the Drumcondra area. When that campaign was launched by the GAA one of its main selling points was that there would be no public money required. The £5 million allocated for that development could be spent much more beneficially among the many clubs struggling to survive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody once said it is a clear sign of mediocrity if one is niggardly in one's praise. A Minister for Finance in a position to lash out £300 million in any budget must help somebody. There are those nationwide who will certainly reap some benefit from this budget.</P>
      <P>The series of decisions taken in the preparation of this budget is very difficult to understand. Clearly what has been produced does not form part of the Programme for Government but rather constitutes a critique and analysis of how the parties in Cabinet are performing internally. It is very obvious that there are strains and a certain amount of tension among them.</P>
      <P>I should have said that I should like to share my time with Deputy Seán Barrett.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of pandering to the Labour Party as the junior partner in this Government. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who really is the Minister for unemployment &mdash; nice man that he is &mdash; presides over circumstances in which 400,000 people are out of work. We have witnessed the spectacle of Ministers, indeed some Ministers of State, travelling around the country pulling out segments of the £8 billion cheque from their pockets, referring to programme managers, telling people that this and that factory will be built, that they will <Col N="277" /> bring industry to certain parts of the country, that they will look after the development of this pier and that port, that they will look after all the other problems, such as county roads and infrastructural developments, all of which will be dealt with out of European moneys. They claim that all these matters will be dealt with, saying in due course when the environmental impact analyses are submitted.</P>
      <P>This budget is a bonanza of publicity for this Government. It affords them an opportunity to cover up every issue of importance to people in small and large towns nationwide. The projections already issued for 20,000 job losses this year make a mockery of what is supposed to be the core value in this Government's attempts to rectify the country's problems. For example, there has been the announcement of schemes to put 40,000 people working or participating in social employment schemes. This means that, together with the other job losses predicted, at the end of this year we will have somewhere between 360,000 and 400,000 people still out of work, given new entrants onto the labour market and so on. The corollary of this is that in January 1995 we will have another budget, carefully constructed, demonstrating that all had been well in 1994.</P>
      <P>These budgetary provisions do not address the heart of Ireland's problem, which is that people are not at work, that the climate and environment conducive to the creation of jobs is not available to those who have money, initiative and enthusiasm. While the budgetary provisions go some small way to address those problems they do not address the core problem. The Minister had an unprecedented opportunity to do so on this occasion but failed miserably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One element of exclusion from designated areas in urban regions which should be examined immediately is office accommodation. Probably it is fair to say that if one undertook an analysis of available office accommodation, particularly in the Dublin area, one would discover an over-supply. Outside Dublin, in towns where designated areas provisions apply <Col N="278" /> or will apply, such survey would clearly show there is not an over-supply of office accommodation. If initiative and enthusiasm is to be fostered in existing designated areas outside Dublin, and in newly designated areas, surely office accommodation would be of immense importance to the development and carrying forward of that initiative for the creation of jobs. I call on the Minister to stipulate that, in designated areas outside Dublin, office accommodation can be included in respect of tax benefits for development.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that nothing was done in this budget to alleviate the problems obtaining in the clothing and footwear industry. For example, a survey carried out by the Clothing and Footwear Federation illustrated clearly that up to 1,690 full-time jobs will be lost in 1994, a rising trend since that figure stood at 1,300 last autumn. It is very difficult for retailers, in a hard-pressed, competitive business, to make ends meet when they do not receive any assistance from the Government in real terms. Despite intense lobbying and the very clear expression of their difficulties by the Clothing and Footwear Federation I very much regret the Minister for Finance did not see fit to grant them some real relief.</P>
    <P>So far as the general public are concerned, probably the central issue of this budget is the residential property tax. Many speakers will address this issue. It is beyond belief that the junior partner in Government, who said it would be absolutely invidious to have anything to do with a Fianna Fáil Party in Government, should produce a clear list of their stated intentions and then completely renege on them. The response to advertisements produced in the run up to the last general election clearly indicates that people voted for change on the promise that such matters would not be touched, but we find now that that is not the case. In the Dublin area Niall Andrews, MEP, decides to say that this is not Fianna Fáil policy. If it is not Fianna Fáil policy then it must be Labour Party policy and, if that is the case, somebody from the Labour <Col N="279" /> Party should spell out exactly what it means.</P>
    <P>I read with interest an interview by Damien Kiberd with the Minister for Finance, reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of January 30, 1994. In that interview it was very obvious that, in his replies to the interviewer about the residential property tax, all the Minister for Finance wanted to do was get away from it, to lessen its impact in the shortest possible time. For example, the interviewer said to the Minister: &ldquo;You have a long term tax strategy and the bits are now in place&rdquo; to which the Minister replied: &ldquo;Yes, yes&rdquo;. The interviewer then said: &ldquo;It seems that only 20,000 pay at present and only another 12,000 will enter the net. This seems absurd&rdquo;, to which the Minister replied: &ldquo;The tax has never brought in...&rdquo;. The interviewer went on to say &ldquo;But it is unbelievable&rdquo;, and the Minister replied that had been the Revenue experience, that it is a selfassessment tax.</P>
    <P>In reply to a further question on whether the take would be significant, the Minister said that the maximum is £15 million.</P>
    <P>The interviewer responded that many people expect property values to rise this year, to which the Minister replied that the tax had been in existence for 12 years but had not brought in anything substantial.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that the Government, which has at its disposal the best experts and accountancy mechanisms in the land, can say that only an additional 12,000 will enter the property tax net. Surely it is obvious that this figure will be exceeded in the Dublin area. In general, the perception is that country people are against concessions being granted to Dublin but all Irish people believe that a man's house is his castle. It is morally unjust and unfair to tax a person's home, and by so doing grind him into the ground. Indeed in cases it could probably be unconstitutional. A person owning a detached or semi-detached house in Portmarnock, Malahide, Sutton, Howth, Raheny, Clontarf &mdash; and most areas south of the <Col N="280" /> Liffey &mdash; will probably end up in the residential property tax bracket. It is absurd for the Government to say that only an additional 12,000 will be caught in the net. Does this mean that the Government has quietly told the Revenue Commissioners to note what assessment people put on their home and then to go after them? I think this tax was concocted at the midnight hour. It reminds me of a vampire tax in that it drives a stake through the heart of home ownership, through enthusiasm and initiative, and sucks the life blood of people who want to own their own home and better their position.</P>
    <P>If the Government fail to appreciate the passion with which people will defend their rights to own their home and have it looking as well as it should, it is making a serious mistake. Residential property tax is the one issue in the budget causing great anxiety to those who come within its thresholds. It is also causing great stress to those on the verge of the thresholds who fear they will be sucked into the net next year. It is obvious that the Minister's figure is out of line. He should be up front and say that at least 100,000 houses in the country will now come into the tax net and asked to pay accordingly. Of the 400,000 people out of work many are highly qualified graduates who could be sent around the country for three weeks, even with a minimal method of valuation they would come back with the figure of at least 100,000 houses in the tax net. The Government is making a very serious mistake.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I will refer briefly to another matter &mdash; the report last week of Údarás na Gaeltachta's success in creating jobs in Gaeltacht areas. One of the greatest scandals in my country is that several Údarás factories lie empty on Achill Island. When the former Deputy O'Donnell was Minister for the Gaeltacht in the mid 1970s seven small industries were active in the Achill area and sustained the economy. The area is now dying on its feet due to a number of factors, emigration, the population structure and the fact that there is no employment in the area. Surely this is a challenge <Col N="281" /> to Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Government. I do not know if the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht visited the Gaeltacht areas in Mayo, I know his Minister of State visited the area but he does not seem to have had the enthusiasm to travel to Gaeltacht areas apart from that in his own constituency. Given that people from the area are working in Boston, Chicago and London, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs knows what I am talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surveys indicate that up to half a dozen primary schools will either have to close or be reduced to the status of a one teacher school in the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous that in the week prior to the election last year the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was able to lash out 50,000 cheques for premium and headage payments to farmers around the country. It is beyond belief that farmers are expected to linger in uncertainty as to when premium payments, their due entitlements, will be paid. The PAYE sector would not stand for that, and rightly so. If the farming community have to apply for grants, premia and headage payments by a particular date they should be entitled to receive payment on a particular date. It would not matter what date is set but at least they should be guaranteed payment by a certain date. That makes good business sense. If we value farming as a business enterprise, we should ensure that farmers receive their due entitlements on time. Given the level of technology, efficiency and enterprise in the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="282" /> Food and Forestry it is not beyond it to achieve this. I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make his mark in this area at least as he has failed dismally in so many others. Farmers have to wait anxiously for the postman to arrive to see if their cheques are in the post and I hope the Minister will ensure that in future they will receive their cheques by a particular date.</P>

      <P>A very clear message. I <Col N="283" /> have had the pleasure of knowing the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for a very long time but I think this is what is destroying politics. We campaign and ask people to vote for us on the basis of certain policies. They voted for Deputy Spring and the Labour Party in their thousands at the last election. In fact, in Dún Laoghaire and Dublin South the party got almost three quotas between the two constituencies. People put their trust in the Labour Party because they were told it would put trust back into politics. Twelve months later not alone has the residential property tax increased but it is proposed to reduce the relief on VHI and mortgage interest payments. What do young people in particular think of politicians when they are told one thing at election time and as soon as the party gets into Government it does the direct opposite? I have to listen to some people who lecture us about ethics. They want us to disclose whether we own a house, a few shares or whatever we may have because we want openness, honesty and ethics in politics.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of thing that annoys so many of us. I do not mind being beaten in a straight fight but these were blatant lies. The advertisement on 25 November 1992 was in response to a Fianna Fáil advertisement which made various accusations against the Labour Party. The words, &ldquo;Labour's property tax is official&rdquo;, was printed by Fianna Fáil the Republican Party. Now that both parties are in Government, one party having accused the other at election time of going to do certain things while the other denied there was any truth in it, they do exactly what they accused each other of. The so-called property tax is so unacceptable that if I was a member of the Government and if I was to leave politics I would vote against the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to some Government Deputies complain bitterly about the property tax, Deputy Broughan followed by Deputy Shortall, saying how unjust this tax was and the other evening, Mr. Niall Andrews, MEP described this as a Labour Party tax. This is not a property <Col N="284" /> tax, this is a home tax. There is no benefit-in-kind in having a home so that the Government can tax it. What benefit is the value of my home to me or to anybody else. I am not getting any income from it. Why choose to tax my home? Some people save their money and invest it in a nice house for their family while others invest their money in vintage cars or paintings. The Government has decided to tax the home rather than vintage cars or paintings. The original property tax was bad but to increase it is much worse.</P>
    <P>A person living in a modest semi-detached house in my constituency or in Deputy Shatter's constituency of Dublin South, valued at between £100,000 and £120,000, would pay £650 approximately in property tax out of a taxed income. The person who has to pay £650 in property tax has to earn in the range of £1,300 net per month. A house in the constituencies of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or Dublin South worth £120,000 is no mansion; it is an ordinary semi-detached house in a reasonable area. It is not our fault that we were born in that part of the country and it is not our fault that we have to work from that part of the country.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy telling me I am lucky that I will have to pay the property tax? This tax is so ridiculous when you compare properties in one part of the country with another; one owner will pay property tax and the other will not. Houses in the Tánaiste's constituency are probably twice or three times the size of the houses I am talking about in my constituency. If a house is located in a certain area the owner has to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not bad enough to give the unfortunate home owner a shock over property tax but to add insult to injury the Government reduced the mortgage interest relief, despite the fact that the Tánaiste in his message on 25 November 1992 said Labour would not reduce mortgage interest relief. In addition to the property tax home owners will now have <Col N="285" /> their mortgage interest relief reduced. The person who provides for his or her family in the event of illness will have the tax relief on VHI premiums reduced. Anybody who does anything to improve their position will get a lash; it is as simple as that. In his message of 25 November 1992, the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;Labour will not reduce VHI tax relief&rdquo;. He said the Fianna Fáil lies and distortions were dangerous and complained about what Fianna Fáil said about the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The owner of a house who has children will suffer as a result of the property tax, the reduction in mortgage interest relief and on VHI premiums while the Government abolish the 1 per cent income levy. This is supposed to be the great favour to the PAYE sector. The 1 per cent income levy should not have been introduced. Taking into account the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy and the so-called tax reductions in this budget very few people will gain anything. All we have heard about this give-away budget and the tax relief are based on the fact that the 1 per cent income levy has been abolished. For the ordinary house owner there is nothing in this budget, despite all the propaganda and publicity, except hardship.</P>
    <P>We now hear that the Government is considering means-testing those who are paying their PRSI and contributing towards a contributory pension, for example a widow's pension. Those who contribute will now be means-tested on the benefits they paid for. This is like suggesting that the person who invests in an insurance policy for a number of years should, when the policy matures, be means-tested on the benefits. One cannot change the rules in this way and retain respect with society.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about unemployment. All Members share concern for the unemployed. A small number of people create the wealth to pay social welfare benefits to the unemployed, the old and so on and that figure is reducing. Soon a handful of people will be trying to earn a few shillings to help pay the State benefits to us.</P>
    <P>I object to the fact that if one is employing <Col N="286" /> people in manufacturing, one pays 10 per cent corporation tax whereas if one is employing people in service industry one pays 40 per cent. What is the justification for a 40 per cent corporation tax when we are being told that services are the area in which to create future jobs? This tax is crippling people. In the light of the Finance Bill which will come before us shortly, will the Government seriously consider reducing corporation tax to give people in service industry a reasonable chance to create wealth and reinvest?</P>
    <P>I was delighted to be able to remind the Tánaiste of his message of 25 November, 1992 and I look forward to hearing his message this morning. In future when the Tánaiste is talking about ethics in politics he should not forget what he said on 25 November, 1992 &mdash;&ldquo;Put trust back into politics, I am urging you to vote Labour.&rdquo; He said that Labour would not reduce VHI relief, mortgage interest relief and had no plans to introduce a new property tax.</P>

      <P>When the budget was published last week I described it as another step on the road to fulfilling the promise we made in the general election last year, the promise to put justice into economics.

      <P>I never thought I would see the day when Deputy Rabbitte would be revealed as being to the right of Deputy Yates, but we were all treated to that revelation during the course of the budget speeches last Wednesday. Deputy Rabbitte and his party have come a long way. They have undergone many transformations since I first came to know them in this House, but even the party with a habit of donning a new name and a new identity every couple of years must have been hard pressed to see themselves as the champions of the property owning classes. It was a heart rending sight to see Deputy Rabbitte and his colleagues in Democratic Left choking back the crocodile tears and trying to control their emotions as they launched a truly magnificent and impassioned assault on everything they believed in. Labour has often been unfairly accused by Democratic Left of struggling with its conscience, but I have never before seen a political party publicly beating its conscience to a pulp as they did in this debate last week.</P>

      <P>The only thing that stopped Fine Gael struggling with its conscience over the tax reforms in the budget is that it has no conscience left. This is the party that is capable of proposing and opposing virtually everything and anything at the same time and sometimes, as in the case of the tax amnesty, on the same day. This is the party whose leader not so long ago published a six-point plan for job creation which included the taxation of all short term benefits immediately, <Col N="288" /> and then a nine-point plan a few weeks later which did not. This is the party which cannot make up its mind, like the famous mugwumps of old, their mugs on one side of the fence and their wumps on the other. This is the party which is pro-reform unless it is controversial, in which case they opt for the <i>status quo</i> unless it is risky, in which case they shout and roar until they are all blue in the face and then we are sorry we upset them. I find it hard to expect objectivity from Fine Gael any more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a budget that continued the work of improving essential services in health, housing, education, family services, culture and the arts. Above all, last week's budget contained the biggest improvements in take home pay for every PAYE worker of any budget in my time in politics. PAYE workers, in overall terms, are seeing significant relief for the first time in many years.</P>
      <P>Last year our critics said the temporary levy was here to stay. Its total abolition proves them wrong &mdash; as usual. As a result of the abolition of the levy and other radical measures, take home pay after the budget will increase by approximately 2 per cent with higher increases for those on lower incomes; this is in addition to pay increases still being negotiated under the new pay round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget displayed a wealth of imagination in big changes and in little ones and accomplished all its objectives while at the same time maintaining the necessary financial discipline to make our future more secure and to keep interest rates at their present low level. They are the kind of things that &ldquo;justice into <Col N="292" /> economics&rdquo; demands and this budget delivers.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake &mdash; this Government is determined to deliver on jobs. The budget will stimulate the economy in a responsible way improving even further the prospects for growth this year. No budget on its own can make the kind of impact we all want to see in the area of job creation but the three-pronged approach represented by the budget, the National Development Plan and the Public Capital Programme will bring new and realistic hope to thousands of unemployed families. The structured and coordinated jobs package in the 1994 budget is a major initiative in creating employment and in targeting that employment in areas and among communities of the greatest disadvantage. The incentives to enterprise, including a balanced new approach to employers' PRSI, will help to protect and create thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>In the area of tax reform, necessary and long overdue changes are handled sensitively to ensure that nobody is asked to bear an unfair share of the burden. The treatment of unemployment benefit as income for tax purposes is accompanied by significant increases in unemployment and disability benefit, for instance. Both this change and the introduction of a new widower's pension accompanied by a high income limit for all survivor's benefits in the future have all been recognised by objective commentators as equitable and fair.</P>

It has long been one of the most inequitable features of our system that those with high incomes derive more benefit from discretionary allowances than those on much smaller incomes. That inequity is now in the process of being ended.</P>

We had then and still have no plans for a new property tax.

      <P>I am particularly proud of the changes in the budget that will benefit people on low incomes. If the budget could be attacked on the basis that it was taking money from the pockets of the rich in order to give it to the poor, I would be happy to stand over and defend that. In fact the only difference between rich and poor in this budget is that the gains to the less well off have been better designed and targeted than in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the result been? I will restate, for the benefit of the Opposition. Personal tax allowances are up this year as much as in the past six years put together. The standard rate tax band has been widened by four times the most recent rate <Col N="302" /> of inflation. Before this budget an ummarried worker with the usual PAYE-PRSI allowances would pay the top rate on an annual income of £10,936. Now he or she can earn up to £11,636.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A married couple in similar circumstances would pay the top rate of tax at £20,786 per annum. That has gone up to £22,186 per annum. In both cases the PAYE workers at the top of the standard rate band would have to increase their earnings by more than three times the rate of inflation before moving on to a higher rate of tax. Overall, thousands of workers are out of the tax net altogether, take home pay will increase as a direct result of the budget by approximately 2 per cent and by up to twice that for people on low incomes.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal briefly with some of the other highlights of the budget. In the Book of Estimates we allocated a great amount of extra money for local authority housing. Our principal purpose in the past two years in relation to local authority housing has been to begin to undo the damage of recent years, especially the years that the Progressive Democrats were in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The spin-off in terms of direct and indirect jobs will be of the order of 14,000 jobs and the social progress represented by the restoration of a decent building programme is very considerable.

This year we intend to finally bring to an end the era of the long waiting periods for necessary treatment. In addition £100 million from the amnesty will be used to address long-running health board financial problems. It is, perhaps, not generally appreciated that the financial problems of health boards have had serious knock-on effects in local economies with many small suppliers often being forced to struggle to make ends meet because of the difficulty in having their bills paid by the health boards. For that reason this once-off injection will not only have a beneficial effect on the efficiency with which the health boards can deliver services, it will also help to protect and sustain thousands of jobs at risk. The measure will be accompanied by stringent legislation to ensure that we will not see a recurrence of the massive debt problems which have plagued the delivery of health care here in the past.</P>

      <P>In the local elections of 1989 the Labour Party campaigned for a crash programme to ensure that every house which needs a bathroom will get one. It is inconceivable that in the 1990s there are several thousand houses in Ireland whose occupants do not have and cannot afford some of the most basic sanitary facilities. Perhaps some of those who are complaining about the very modest changes in property taxation might do well to remember that there are others forced to live in conditions to which they would not subject their families.

      <P>In education we have allocated an additional £5 million towards extra secondary school buildings to bring total investment in school and college buildings to £98 million this year. In addition to the housing problem I mentioned a moment ago, the Minister for Education has identified 200 national schools which do not have the basic facility of proper toilets. This year that problem, which should have been addressed as a priority years ago, will also be eliminated.</P>
      <P>This year, too, will be the year of special education. The budget contains a dramatic increase that will transform the resources available to special schools, on top of the extra money for mentally handicapped services already in the Estimates. Many schools with pupils with special educational needs have struggled for years with inadequate capitation grants and were often forced to rely on voluntary subscriptions for basic necessities. The changes announced in the budget will represent almost a doubling of average capitation grants in this area and will be carefully targeted to ensure that the rights of people with special needs, especially their right to aim at a full independent life, are further enhanced and developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> In the area of infrastructure, one of the key complaints in recent years has been the deteriorating state of our county roads. An additional £20 million programme of investment in that critical area this year will not solve the problem but it will go a long way towards enhancing and improving the quality of life in many parts of Ireland, as well as contributing even further to our economic development.</P>
    <P>In the arts, work will begin on a major new national cultural centre in Collins Barracks which is uniquely situated to make it accessible to people from all over Ireland. I look forward to the day when that barracks will contribute to a thriving, vibrant and accessible understanding of Ireland's heritage and promise for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That promise will be further enhanced by the biggest allocation ever for the Arts Council which has been topped up in the budget to ensure that it meets all the demands.</P>
      <P>In the past year interest rates have tumbled, exports have continued to increase at record high levels and Ireland has enjoyed a growth rate well above the European Union average. A spirit of confidence has re-emerged in the economy. The National Development Plan, coupled with this enlightened and imaginative budget and the public capital programme, demonstrates the Government's determination to continue to raise the growth rate and to translate additional growth into jobs on the ground. We are determined to do this while maintaining equity and fairness in social policy and through pursuing necessary tax reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland still faces many challenges. No Government can allow itself to become complacent while unemployment remains at its present level. No Government can allow itself to become complacent about the range of issues of equity <Col N="306" /> and justice that still remain to be resolved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some time to put the budget into perspective. The financial statement the Minister made this day last week started with a claim that it formed part of a coherent strategy designed to give impetus to sustainable employment. Sadly, what followed that statement was an over-elaborate and over-extended budget which ultimately lacked both focus and coherence. The budget suffered from being over-hyped before it was published, from being over-blown while it was being published and as a result it is a major let down. It was not helped by the fact that the Minister took <Col N="309" /> the opportunity to ramble around his and indeed other constituencies and to bring in much extraneous detail which served to blur and bewilder rather than to clarify and enlighten. On budget day last week the problems which relate to the process as it operates were highlighted. This debate should take place before the budget, not afterwards. The budget does not need to be the overblown affair it has become. As a process it has become such a mess that people outside are much more concerned about missing the wedding on Coronation Street than about what the Minister for Finance has to say. A little succinctness would not go astray.</P>
    <P>It takes all of six minutes to read aloud the 1916 Proclamation. It takes 16 minutes to read the Downing Street Declaration, but it took the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, more than two hours to read his budget. It is not up to me to say how history will judge this Coalition Government's 1994 budget, but I suspect that as a document it will not rest for long in Ireland's pantheon of historic statements. It is a muddled budget that reveals muddled thinking and it is incomplete because, at the end of the day, the publication of the Finance Bill will tell the real story. As Peter Faulkner, a representative of small firms, pointed out, the opera is not over until the fat lady sings; the budget is not over until the Finance Bill is published. It is not even clear yet what song the fat lady will sing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's efforts to ward off adverse criticism by offering to review decisions already made served only to obfuscate and add to the confusion. He made a statement on the property tax which was promptly refuted by the Minister for the Environment who sits in Cabinet with him and presumably has some contact with him on such important matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance declared his taxation proposals would be pro-jobs and as employment-friendly as practicable. He then went on to establish a set of criteria which would be translated into a set of guiding principles for policy. The concrete proposals in the budget are <Col N="310" /> timid and merely tinker around with the present structure. There is not even the beginning of the root and branch reform of the tax system which we so badly need.</P>
    <P>This budget displays the deep conservatism of the official mind which believes that nothing can really be done about unemployment. The minds of policy makers are set against the idea that there might be some intellectually respectable argument that Governments can do something about unemployment. If we do not properly weigh up the costs of unemployment &mdash; poverty, psychological and physical ill health, high taxation, crime and social strife &mdash; we tip the scales towards inaction and fatalism and threaten the very existence of our free society and our democratic policy.</P>
    <P>The fundamentals have never been sounder, at least so we are infomed. The fundamentals are very sound indeed if, as Senator Joe Lee succinctly put it, we redefine the fundamentals by leaving out employment and emigration, the two traditional objectives of economic performance.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of shoddy thinking about economic policy. For example, it is commonly said that the objectives of an economy is to produce wealth. It is not. The objective of an economy is to produce well-being, that is, a flow of satisfaction. The provision of work for those wanting to work is a very important part of that flow. Economic theory had never been good at coping with the fact that most people of working age want a job &mdash; work is a plus, not a minus. The UN convention on Human Rights includes among those rights, the right to work &mdash; and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>However, when we return to our much vaunted &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; we find matters turned on their head. Interest rates, Government borrowing, balance of payments and debt-GDP ratio were once regarded as policy tools, a means to an end. Now they are the ends. This consensus, which redefined means into ends, was fully manifested when the Government of the time committed itself to the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria for monetary union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> It had been pointed out that Ireland has achieved very impressive levels of economic growth. This is true &mdash; although compared to some other late developers the increase in growth rates is less than spectacular. The real problem is that Ireland has a low translation of growth into actual jobs. In spite of high economic growth, policies have been skewed in such a way that each 1 per cent in GNP has generated at a rate of 0.08 per cent in employment. That rate is far lower than that of other countries.</P>
    <P>The central developmental task for Ireland is the maximisation of employment growth. It is not growth, but the structure and composition of that growth, which is crucial in determining how we are to solve our unemployment crisis. There is little evidence that the Minister has turned his attention to the question of what kind of development pattern is appropriate and feasible.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister really come to terms with the chronic failures of the recent past? Successive Governments have handed out vast sums of money to industry, in tax breaks and subsidies, in the hope that such measures would stimulate job creation. The consequence has been the mushrooming of multinational branch plants all over the country, conforming to no economic logic but the carrot of tax holidays and massive incentives. They were told they were wrong in 1980, by Telesis, in the mid-1980s, by the Commission on Taxation and more recently by Culliton, but they have proved to be remarkably hard of hearing.</P>
    <P>A cornerstone in job creation is tax reform. Unless there is root and branch tax reform people and companies will invest in non-protective areas which do not create jobs. Even if they invest in manufacturing and the tax system greatly subsidises machinery, as is the case in Ireland, machinery will be substituted for labour. If the Government massively subsidises investment in property, money will flow into this unproductive area, at the cost of jobs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget that clearly outlines taxation as an incentive <Col N="312" /> or disincentive system. What is more important than the overall level of taxation is how the structure of taxation is geared towards the needs of society, and how effectively tax revenue is spent. Professor Kieran Kennedy of the ESRI in his pamphlet &ldquo;The Unemployment Crisis in Ireland&rdquo;, points out that taxation has always been regarded as a disincentive and that taxes can also be used as incentives to achieve social goals.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the tax system contributed to job creation or job destruction. Many aspects of the tax system work against job creation, the chief one being the business expansion scheme, section 84 lending, low taxes on some unproductive areas, such as inheritances and property, and too many tax breaks going to the wrong businesses. The Government seems to have a myopic attitude to property in that it views it as the family home, but the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; covers a wider area, much of which escapes attention as regards taxation.</P>
    <P>Research has identified a plethora of such tax incentives to invest in housing, other property and financial assets. The contradictions in the taxation system make such activities attractive, even at the expense of indigenous industry. A decisive approach needs to be taken to reduce the range of tax and other incentives applying to rent-seeking activities which would encourage a redistribution of wealth rather than its creation. Such an approach would probably be much more significant than the labour market disincentives arising from the tax and social welfare systems which have attracted considerably more attention.</P>
    <P>The Joint Programme for a Partnership Government promised a third banking force from within the State sector. This was described as a significant force in banking with total assets of almost £3 billion, net profits of £25 million and a capacity to pay significant dividends to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that a budget package which included £5 million for Croke Park, £750,000 for marriage counselling services and £0.25 million for the new premises for the Sheriff Street youth <Col N="313" /> club might have included the major initiative of providing a third banking force as promised in the Joint Programme.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for a third force in banking. We all know of the dominance the &ldquo;Big Two&rdquo; wield at present. There is a lack of competition in the banking market with the major banks operating an effective cartel over services and controls. A third banking force would do much to develop competitiveness and provide for commercial enterprises that find it difficult at present to secure investment.</P>
    <P>A third banking force could play a vital role in industrial development as a long term backer of indigenous companies. However, it would appear that this opportunity has been dissipated and may be quietly buried. We have already seen how this Government, which makes clear and unambiguous commitments in its joint programme, can easily do a U-turn and make a contradictory commitment as soon as the temperature heats up. It is a Government that lacks the bottle necessary to deal with the Matrimonial Home Bill débâcle.</P>
    <P>I have little confidence in a Government which, in its joint programme, specifically states that it will provide legislation to allow for joint ownership of the family home; proceeds to introduce dodgy legislation which has been thrown out on constitutional grounds and compounds its error by declaring that there will be no action &mdash; legislative or by way of referendum &mdash; to live up to its commitment in the joint programme. Women are not fools. They know what has happened and that a fundamental right has been denied to them not because of our Constitution which is open to change but because this Government lacks bottle.</P>
    <P>The Government has walked away from its responsibility, from a promise it made, a commitment it said it believed in, and a legislative mess for which it is responsible. If this is the way it has operated in relation to the Matrimonial Home Bill will we see a jettisoning of the third banking force, abortion legislation or local government reform?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Its ability to set up a third force in banking and take on the huge vested interest that would be against such development is questionable. Many people had confidence in Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. They voted at the last election for change. What they got in the budget was bits and pieces of change which have served further to undermine people's confidence that the Government is serious in intent and, in particular, is serious about employment.</P>
    <P>For those living in sub-standard accommodation, in over-crowded conditions, the homeless, who have no hope of getting a council house in the immediate future, the budget did not offer any real recognition of the extraordinary length of the waiting list. We have a programme that offers a handful of houses if it is broken down into the various local authorities, but it is very limited. The budget did not provide any hope for the 1,000 or more families on the housing waiting list in my county of Wicklow. If these people were living in the constituency of the Minister for Finance would there have been a different response? Constituency massaging rules OK yet again.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health spending section in the budget an opportunity was missed to provide equity within the VHI. Instead of withdrawing tax relief from cover for luxury hospitals, the Minister decided to reduce tax relief on all VHI premia, even those that apply to the ordinary hospital. This is the kind of cover that many people cannot do without. There is no justification for allowing tax relief to the super rich to subvent their service in private hospitals that cater for them. I have no problem with private hospitals &mdash; if people want to pay for more luxurious service, good luck to them if they can afford it &mdash; but I strenuously object to the idea that the taxpayer should somehow subvent a luxury service for these people.</P>
    <P>Equally, the raising of the ceiling for tax relief on medical costs is insupportable. If the Minister for Health was serious about redirecting and reorganising health funding to be more effective and more efficient, he would <Col N="315" /> concentrate his attention on primary care. Extending the GMS and widening the eligibility of people for the GMS would ensure that the pressure on hospitals and the concentration on hospital care that exists at the moment in the health care services would be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health seems to prefer the superficial modifications that have provided the photo opportunity rather than better health care and more appropriate targeting of resources. One of the most important determinants of good health is the level of poverty and the likelihood of unemployment. If you are a middle-aged, unemployed male, you are twice as likely to have a heart attack than an employed, middle-aged professional male. If you are unemployed and poor, you are more likely to suffer from depression, psychological disorders and lung cancer and you are more likely to get a stroke.</P>
    <P>Right from birth, indeed prior to birth &mdash; even the level of stillbirths is related to poverty &mdash; people's health and life expectation are governed by the social class to which they belong. There has been absolutely no attempt by the Minister for Health to deal with this matter or in any way to target resources that would ameliorate and modify the effects of poverty on people's health. We have seen no attempt in this regard in the budget. Instead, those who are wealthiest in our society, those who are also the least unwell, are still getting the benefits of tax relief. The reality is that those who need the services least are those who can avail most quickly of them and enjoy tax relief in the process.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the measles epidemic showed up the correlation between disease and poverty. In Dublin 4, the vaccination level against disease was 90 per cent whereas in the poor areas of Dublin, they were below 40 per cent and two children died of measles. In a developed country like ours this is a tragedy. It is a direct result of neglect by the Department of Health and its inability to focus on the causes of ill health and disease. We have <Col N="316" /> seen yet again this blindness being displayed by the Minister in relation to this budget whereby the rich are yet again rewarded while the poor continue to be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Major Religious Superiors criticised the budget for following the old and failed model. It argued that unless the traditional economic thinking of the Government is changed, the economic future will look even bleaker. In a year when 289,000 people are expected to be unemployed the Government has conceded that there will only be a minimal gain over the next six years. With the growth in the labour force and emigration, the likelihood is that at the end of the day the total unemployed will be at its current unacceptable high level.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and poverty are the two key issues. More people in our society are getting poor and the gap that exists now between the poor and the better off, between the unemployed and the employed, is growing. This budget will do nothing to narrow that gap or to make any significant change of direction. Last year we were told by the Government that there was not time to bring any transforming element into the budget. This year the conditions could not have been better for transforming our tax system, our unemployment crisis and the conditions of poverty in which many thousands of our people live.</P>
    <P>The Minister prepared this budget at a time when the conditions could not have been more favourable. He had the wind at his back and public opinion with him. He had an historic opportunity to redirect financial policy towards resolving the problems in our society instead of simply side-stepping them. Recognition is needed, as the CMRS said, that the labour market has changed, that we need to introduce a basic income guarantee for all and to build a society where all may work, even if it is not in full time jobs in the traditional sense. On those criteria, which are the only criteria that the budget can be judged on, this budget has clearly failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1994 budget rightly focuses on job creation and social justice. The budget confirms and re-emphasises the commitment of the Government to maintaining financial stability and creating confidence in our economy. Both financial stability and confidence are essential pre-conditions if we are to ensure stronger investment, increased output and more work opportunities. As a small, open economy we cannot escape the effects of international economic developments; we have to adapt to world market conditions in order to generate greater economic activity. The National Economic and Social Council's observation 20 years ago in the context of maintaining essential competitiveness is equally true today &mdash;&ldquo;it is not possible to stop the world and let Ireland off&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We cannot be complacent about our relatively strong economic performance in recent years. We have to build on our success through further improvements in our competitiveness and productivity, and translate the results of our economic growth into fuller employment.</P>
      <P>This year's budget is built around a series of central policy parameters. These are: first, to sustain the progress made in recent years in bringing order to the public finances; second, to maintain a stable exchange rate within the EMS; third, to foster a competitive climate for employment growth; fourth, to support the development of social and economic infrastructure and, fifth, to align a range of public policies, in particular in the taxation area, more closely to the primary objective of employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important at this point to refute the allegation that this is a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; budget, by pointing to specifics under each of these headings. The general Government deficit has been set, and will be returned, at less than the 3 per cent figure specified at Maastricht for the EU as a whole. Our disciplined fiscal stance, strong balance of payments and low inflation outlook will support our exchange rate objectives. The provision of substantial tax relief to the great bulk <Col N="318" /> of taxpayers will prove a moderating influence on pay and on general input cost developments. The tax reliefs have focused in particular on the lower paid, in line with this Government's priorities. The expansion of the urban renewal scheme and the increased provision for social housing needs are practical examples of additional measures included in the budget which focus on the provision and upgrade of our economic and social infrastructure. Finally, the provision of low cost funding for small business and the grouping of a package of tax reforms to help business, especially small business, to create employment are practical examples of the way in which policy developments are being directed at areas where the maximum potential for returns in terms of employment exist.</P>
    <P>We know that the low level of employment in Ireland relative to our partners in the European Union is at the root of the divergence in income levels <i>per capita</i> between Ireland and the EU as a whole. Therefore, the twin issues of under-development and unemployment are inextricably linked. It is not possible to address the structural problem of unemployment without tackling the more general question of economic development and overall growth. It is this strategy which forms the cornerstone of proposed investments under the National Development Plan and which is further developed in the context of this year's budget.</P>
    <P>It is a regrettable fact that no-one can be satisfied at the performance of the labour market in Ireland in recent years, but it is important to put the issue in its proper focus. Employment has grown slightly in Ireland since 1990. In the European Union as a whole, it has declined significantly. Moreover, unemployment in Ireland has risen sharply in circumstances where net inflows to the labour force have increased, and will continue to increase, at a rate which is more than 12 times the European average. It is these facts, together with the challenge of increasing employment in the Irish economy which, quite simply, drive the <Col N="319" /> need for growth to the top of the political and economic agenda.</P>
    <P>Against this backdrop we have to ask ourselves does this budget help to create new jobs and protect existing jobs. I believe it does. The response of the social partners to the budget's contents and, in particular, the comments of those working in the small business sector suggest that there is general support for this view. In addition, the Construction Industry Federation has acknowledged that the budget lays the foundation for a recovery in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this budget does not simply address the need for greater economic growth and employment. The Government fully accepts that the success of small open economies in creating jobs is strongly related to securing broadly based economic development across all sectors of the community. Social exclusion is a double edged sword. It is rooted in under-development or unbalanced economic development but it can also severely constrain an economy's ability to grow. The Government, therefore, sees a clear integration between progress towards social objectives in the areas of education, health, housing and income maintenance and the pursuit of purely economic objectives. It is not possible to attack the unemployment problem without complementary support policies in, for example, the areas of education and training. Given the scale and composition of the long term unemployment problem, issues of access and exclusion in those sectors are of critical importance to the ultimate success of our economic policy.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to a number of the contributions to this debate and, in particular, to the comments made by Deputy Cox last Wednesday. These comments threw more light on armchair critics of the budget than they did on the budget itself.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to address is the notion that there is, in effect, a public expenditure spiral underway, a return to gross fiscal indiscipline, that all effort at expenditure control has been abandoned <Col N="320" /> and that we are set for a tax and spend spree. All of this is heady stuff, unfortunately unsupported by the facts. How does the allegation stand-up against a debt-GNP ratio which was reduced from 106 per cent in 1990 to 100 per cent in 1992? How does it explain away the stability of EBR as a percentage of GDP in Ireland in the period 1990-92 when this figure increased by over 50 per cent for the EU as a whole? If there had been spiralling public expenditure our industrial competitiveness would have been undermined, but between 1990 and 1992 the index of hourly earnings in manufacturing industry in common currency terms for Ireland increased at the same rate as that of our main trading partners and of the EU as a whole, showing that our industrial competitiveness has not been eroded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox's critique of the budget's approach to public expenditure policy raises other questions. The first is whether the remarks are for real or for effect. Do the criticisms apply to all public expenditure or just to current public expenditure? Perhaps he is suggesting that there are certain areas of capital spending on infrastructural provision and improvements part-funded by the EU which should not proceed. The Deputy should offer specific examples along with rhetoric. Social assistance expenditure covers the principal areas of social welfare delivery. Spending has increased from nearly £1.5 billion in 1990 to an estimated £2 billion in 1994. Spending on first, second and third level education increased from £1.2 billion in 1990 to £1.67 billion in 1994. Spending on health services increased from £1.3 billion in 1990 to £1.88 billion in 1994. While the increased level of public provision in these areas has run well ahead of the rate of inflation, it has done so for various reasons which were not pay-determined. These included increases in the number of recipients of the services in question, improvements in the basic standard of education and health services and higher real welfare payments for the least-well off members of our community.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is not to justify <Col N="321" /> each and every spending increase of recent years, but to illustrate the fact that this expenditure has ultimately resulted in reduced class sizes, better health services and increased social welfare payments among other changes. Is it enough, in the light of this fact, to offer broad ranging non-specific criticism of spending levels? Why not come off the fence and let us know where and how economies should be made, services eliminated, employee numbers reduced, pay levels cut and programmes abandoned? This budget demonstrates the Government's commitment to a sound fiscal stance in which control of the evolution of public expenditure has a key influence. The development of public expenditure is determined not solely by tax levels, spending commitments and needs but by the evolution of the broader economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments made about the growth problem and the dual structure of Irish industry again neglect the budget's content; in particular, the unique packaging of employment driven tax breaks for business and the low cost finance being made available for expansion and development. It should be noted that many of these incentives are specifically targeted at small businesses.</P>
    <P>However welcome the announcements of occasional spectacular inward investment projects and however professional and dedicated the work of the agencies operating in this area, the lessons of successful job creation in other countries demonstrate clearly that small and medium size enterprises are the bedrock of industrial performance and the principal engine of employment growth. There is a clear recognition of this reality in this year's budget. I believe that the package of measures announced last Wednesday will increase significantly the potential of small businesses as employment creators and as the engine of economic recovery. In fact, I am satisfied that the budget of 1994 will be seen as a milestone in enhancing the environment for indigenous small and medium sized enterprises; the measures announced last Wednesday will be seen as a part of a wider framework which will allow the <Col N="322" /> small business sector to flourish and thereby guarantee the jobs we all aspire to create.</P>
    <P>In this regard I want to point out three particular initiatives which will be of particular value to small companies. The provision of up to £100 million in low interest loan funding announced by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, will make it easier and cheaper for small companies to finance expansion and development.</P>
    <P>The increase of the company value limit from £150,000 under the business expansion scheme for owners of companies who want to invest in their own business together with the drop in the capital gains tax rate from 40 per cent to 27 per cent on the disposal of shares in an unquoted company will make it more beneficial for entrepreneurs to invest in productive enterprises in this country and, thereby, in employment.</P>
    <P>The directing of tax relief towards lower income levels directs the benefits of such reductions at employments which are the re-entry points into the workforce for most of those currently out of work. It is consistent with the growth of mobile, part-time and services employment which may, at least initially, fuel a significant proportion of employment growth. In this regard, I want to draw attention to the removal of the requirement for employer payment of the employment and training levy and the health levy for employees who have a medical card. In addition, employers' PRSI is being reduced by about 25 per cent in respect of low paid employees.</P>
    <P>The demonisation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by its depiction as a millstone around the neck of Irish businesses ignores the flexibility shown in many company situations in both private and public sectors in coping with difficult economic circumstances in the recent past. It also overlooks the major benefits brought about through lower losses by way of industrial disputes and increased investor security and confidence. As this House will be only too aware, tax driven or not, foreign industry in Ireland accounted for almost 50 per <Col N="323" /> cent of net manufacturing employment growth in the period 1987-91. If we are going to make progress in increasing employment we cannot ignore the potential offered by inward investment as well as indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The transport, energy and communications sectors, which come under my portfolio, have vital contributions to make in the realisation of overall economic objectives. In the case of transport, the primary objective is to support sustainable economic development and employment creation by, first, improving internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities on an integrated basis, thereby reducing transport costs and offsetting the negative effects on the economy of peripherality, and second, by improving the reliability of the transport system by removing bottlenecks, remedying capacity deficiencies and reducing absolute journey times and journey time variance.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for the Marine, and I will ensure that these objectives will be achieved over the coming years through an integrated programme of investment in our transport modes. In particular, I will be concentrating on upgrading and development of the national mainline rail network, with particular emphasis on strategic inter-urban links and on improving the accessibility of access transport facilities; ensuring substantial investment in implementation of the Dublin transportation initiative; development of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports to ensure the provision of adequate infrastructure for the national and international aviation links required by the traded economic sector and to meet projected increases in these requirements; and increasing traffic at the regional airports.</P>
    <P>On the latter point Deputy Cox, in his contribution to the budget debate, suggested that there is a lack of a level playing field as between the air services from regional airports and those from Cork airport. I would like to point out <Col N="324" /> that the essential air services programme which I initiated for regional airports agreed by the Government last May was specifically designed to guarantee a minimum level of service to the six regional airports. Traffic at these airports fell by 36 per cent between 1991 and 1993. In the same period traffic at the three State airports increased by 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>The European Commission insisted that our programme must comply with the very rigorous procedure set out under European regulations. My Department in turn asked the six regional airport companies for their views on the routes within Ireland to which public service obligations should apply and on the minimum level of air service necessary on those routes. Based on the information received, a detailed document was prepared and submitted to the European Commission for approval. The Commission approved the document and advertised the imposition of Irish public service obligations in the EU Official Journal as recently as 5 January last. The purpose of this advertisement is to see if any Community air carrier would be prepared to operate the routes without compensation. The next step in the procedure is to seek tenders, through the Official Journal, for the operation by any Community air carrier of the designated routes, either singly or as a group of routes. A tender document is in course of preparation. I have felt it important to enter these open and democratic arrangements for the essential air services in the record of the House. There is no question of tilting the level playing field &mdash; it is a question of striving to guarantee a minimum level of service to and from the regional airports.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of Cork Airport, I know that Deputy Cox will have noted, from my reply to a question in the House yesterday, that a fund of £500,000, financed by Aer Rianta, has been established for the marketing of Cork Airport. The purpose of the fund is to enable Cork Airport to tackle promotion of the airport aggressively and to expand its share of tourist and business traffic in the region. I am convinced that <Col N="325" /> improved marketing is the key to the development of traffic at the airport. The new fund, which compares to an amount of £116,000 spent on the marketing of the airport in 1993, will enable Cork Airport to build on its success to date and on the excellent facilities which it has to offer. I should add that the airport manager will chair a task force of business and commercial interests in the Cork area to coordinate the new marketing arrangements for the airport. These new arrangements are being designed to enable Cork Airport to maintain and expand its competitive position and to chart a course for its development up to the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>In the area of energy, I previously outlined in this House my policy for tackling the factors which induce uncompetitive energy charges in the Irish economy, as well as minimising inefficiencies in fuel consumption and energy infrastructure. The investment that will take place in the energy sector over the next few years will cater for increased demand from the economy in general, secure improved efficiency in energy supply and consumption and result in a more cost competitive supply infrastructure. The impact of energy use on the environment has taken on an increasing importance both at national and international level in recent years. Much of the investment planned for the sector will have the effect of increasing the efficiency of existing supply technology, thereby reducing energy losses. Conservation measures will focus directly on the efficiency of energy consumption by end users in the domestic, industrial and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the relatively moderate adjustments to oil product prices, following the budget, will not in any way distort current North/South trading patterns. These moderate adjustments are being made at a time when there is downward pressure on the prices of petroleum products generally. This downward pressure arises from a combination of excess world crude production in the face of stagnant demand for products in the main markets. A substantial recovery in <Col N="326" /> the level of international prices is not generally anticipated in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I hardly need to emphasise to this House the importance of telecommunications for Irish economic output and employment. The importance is underlined by factors such as its geographic distance from the principal European markets, the relative openness of the Irish economy, which increases the importance of telecommunications for industry as a whole, and the long-standing industrial policy of attracting exportoriented foreign direct investment, much of which requires advanced telecommunications technology. Modern, efficient and competitively priced telecommunications services are essential in pursuing our objectives of greater competitiveness in our economy. Deputies will, of course, be aware of the progress made towards achieving competitively priced cost based telecommunications charges during the past year.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann, as our national network operator, is investing about £182 million in the development of its network and services this year. Of this amount more than half will be spent on the development of both the local and national networks with the balance being spent on international networks, data communications, mobile communications and necessary support services.</P>
    <P>In addition to developments within Telecom Éireann, increased competition has emerged in telecommunications with the Directives on Open Network Provision and, in particular, on Open Network Provision in Leased Lines having taken effect in the European Union in the recent past. These allow service providers to lease lines from national operatives, such as Telecom Éireann, at costbased tariffs and provide telecommunications services, including voice services, to closed user groups while allowing Telecom maintain exclusive rights on the infrastructure and on public voice telephony. Such competition is welcome from the national point of view in that it allows industry the advantage of securing telecommunications services on a cost effective basis and complies with <Col N="327" /> the budgetary policy of maximising opportunities for job creation and retention in the economy as a whole. Subject to the protection of universal services requirements, active competition in telecommunications services can only work to the benefit of the Irish economy as a whole. Competition will, however, require that Telecom Éireann become a more efficient operator if it is to complete effectively in the liberalised market.</P>
    <P>Our national postal operator, An Post, has also to face more liberalised market conditions. I am pleased to record, however, than An Post's financial performance has continued to improve in 1993. Moveover, an agreement on measures to restore the company to financial health was signed by An Post management, the Communications Workers' Union, the Communications Managers' Union and the Labour Relations Commission last September and implementation of the recovery measures began at the end of October last. I am confident that An Post can achieve the policy set out for it in the partnership programme for Government, namely to provide Irish business and domestic customers with a first class postal services at an affordable price.</P>
    <P>Finally, in referring to the areas of telecommunications and postal services. I am pleased that the Minister for Finance has been able to allocate more than £70 million in the budget towards reducing the amount of the Exchequer debt to the superannuation funds of An Post and Telecom Éireann. While there was no question of the pensions of staff of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which have been paid by the companies on behalf of the State being in any way in doubt, this meeting of obligations will no doubt be welcomed by the trustees of the funds.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to acknowledge that no budget can be panacea or recipe for all our economic and social ills. What the budget can do is help move the economy in a direction which will enable it to address certain economic and social priority objectives. Our over-riding economic <Col N="328" /> and social problem is unemployment. The measures contained in this budget aim to address the immediate needs of those out of work in terms of income maintenance and by providing increased job opportunities and incentives through an extensive package of personal tax relief, especially for the lower paid. The great bulk of taxpayers will receive substantial tax breaks. Practical support and incentives are also provided for the enterprise sector, and small business in particular. The budget maintains the impetus of recent years for improved infrastructural provision and maintenance. In short, there is a consistent strategy, it is directed towards an objective shared by the whole community and I am confident that it will succeed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current budget deficit, at £262 million, represents 0.9 per cent of GNP. When one compares that with the budget deficit from 1993, of £379 million, or 1.4 per cent of GNP, one sees that this represents a clear 35 per cent improvement over last year. While one can appraise or argue the provisions of any budget it must be said that this one, in the matter of bookkeeping, is much better than that of 1993. For example, Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes has also <Col N="329" /> increased by 72 per cent which will certainly create more employment. It must also be pointed out that our total Exchequer borrowing this year is within the requirements of member states of the European Union, at £798 million, representing 2.7 per cent of GNP, whereas last year the latter figure was 2.8 per cent. That is a clear indication that the Government is keeping its budgetary and economic spending under control. As long as this Government continues to do so, people will have confidence in investing here, as will foreign investors.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister for Finance had the benefit of the proceeds of the tax amnesty of £230 million and of decreased interest charges on national debt repayments, leaving him in a sound position with £141.6 million credit before announcing his budget and, having announced his budgetary provisions, finishing up with a debit of £261.9 million. The difference between that credit available to him and the debit difference with which he finished amounted to a total of £403.5 million which he put back into circulation, thus maintaining and further improving employment here.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister raised £175 million in this budget, comprised of £21 million from income tax measures, £48 million on excise duties, a saving of £25 million in estimated departmental balances and a sum of £81 million representing the net effect on tax revenue of tax and spending &mdash; current and capital &mdash; changes. Again, he put that £175 million back into circulation. Therefore, it is utterly wrong for anybody to claim that the provisions of this budget do not help to maintain and-or increase employment.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to the social welfare increases, with a general 3 per cent increase in respect of all weekly payments with effect from late July next. The disability and unemployment benefit personal rate is to be increased by 9.7 per cent. In addition the personal rate in respect of disability and unemployment benefit is to be increased by 7 per cent, and there will be an increase of almost 20 per cent for child dependants, old age, retirement and invalidity pensions. Also <Col N="330" /> the personal rate in respect of supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance is to be increased by almost 6 per cent and, where a person has an adult dependant, the rate has been increased by almost 5 per cent. Again, it is utterly wrong of anybody to suggest that Fianna Fáil in Government does not look after those on social welfare. I am proud to confirm that my party is looking after those in receipt of social welfare and will continue to do so. Child benefit has been increased from £23 to £25 per month for the fourth and subsequent children and from £20 to £25 for the third child, to take effect from September 1994. It cannot be said that the Minister for Finance did not cater for those in receipt of social welfare benefits. These budgetary provisions mean that at least such people will have more to spend on their families which, in itself, will help trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £15 million allocated in the budget for county roads, which will be welcomed by all local authorities. However, this once-off payment, when shared between all local authorities nationwide &mdash; and I hope that it will be shared equally &mdash; will not resolve the serious condition of our many county secondary roads, laneways and <i>cul-de-sacs</i> This allocation will fill only one in every ten to 20 potholes on such roads. Indeed it is the opinion of many people that the condition of such roads will deteriorate further unless the Government make a realistic, serious effort to give some real help in this area. We must remember that many of our people live on these roads and they believe that the Government is not fully aware of the seriousness of the situation. I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, to listen to these people, to begin immediately to devise a national plan to help our local authorities to properly repair these county secondary roads, laneways and <i>cul-de-sacs.</i></P>

      <P>For example, the allocation of £15 million for this purpose represents a 113 per cent increase on the 1993 allocation, standing at £28.3 million for 1994. This means that each local authority should receive at least double its allocation for 1993. As a result, Meath County Council should receive £400,000 to £450,000 in block grants for expenditure in 1994 on the 1,530 miles of country roads in the county whereas last year we received £200,000. Meath County Council spent an average of £3 million from its own resources over the past five years or so, with little or no visible improvement as far as many people are concerned. Meath County Council, and most other local authorities, with their limited resources, are doing their utmost to repair roads. However, people believe that, if some action is not taken immediately, we will end up with motorways for traffic and muckways for people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes announced in the capital acquisitions tax which means that farmers will receive 80 per cent relief in respect of the first £300,000 gift value and 30 per cent on the balance. Farmers will also receive relief of 60 per cent on the first £300,000 inheritance value and 30 per cent on the balance. Other farming assets, such as livestock, machinery and so on, will qualify for 25 per cent relief on both gifts and inheritances.</P>
      <P>Spouses will be fully exempted from probate tax. It should also be noted that the market value of agricultural land and buildings is to be reduced by 30 per cent for tax purposes, both measures to be retrospective to 18 June 1993. These measures certainly will encourage farmers to plan better for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the extra £5 million allocated to Teagasc for research and rationalisation and the £2.5 million provided for the early retirement scheme for farmers, the £50,000 allocated to Macra na Feirme on their 50th anniversary, an <Col N="332" /> organisation doing excellent work nationwide. I also welcome the £1 million for the rectification of storm damage, which will help horticultural farmers especially for the major losses they incurred as a result of recent storms.</P>
    <P>This budget is pro-enterprise and positive and contains many changes and incentives to encourage business. This budget is the beginning of real reform, with a definite new taxation policy for future years. Its provisions are aimed at helping small businesses, with the less well off being given special attention, with somewhat more to spend on their families. This budget entails more spending which is bound to help trade, commence and alleviate unemployment. In addition, its provisions acknowledge the various organisations undertaking excellent work to improve social structures and sporting activities nationwide. I am confident that these budgetary provisions will improve the prospects of many in gaining employment. We must move tax from productive development and ensure greater control of public expenditure.</P>

      <P>With the benefit of hindsight my generous decision to share my time with Deputy Hilliard would appear to have been irresponsible and reckless in that he used his time trying to convince the nation, parents in particular, that an increase of £5 per month for the third and subsequent children, for children's allowance purposes, would generate economic activity throughout the community. I wonder what it takes to stand up and state seriously that an increase of £5 per month in the children's allowance for the third and subsequent children is of such advantage that it will end the terrible problems that people on social welfare have in trying to provide for their children. According to Deputy Hilliard it will <Col N="333" /> generate economic activity. Let us wait and see.</P>
      <P>Last week's budget won first prize for boredom. The level of boredom generated was evident on Wednesday last when the Minister for Finance formally confirmed the details that were already given to the nation on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and to the media in general in the run up to budget day. The only contest to the boredom we experienced on budget day was during the contribution by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who almost roused the House from its slumber when he asked how much time he had left. Indeed, that is evidence of the boredom he experienced during the delivery of his rigmarole.</P>
      <P>Sadly, the glamour, the intrigue, the uncertainty and the curiosity of budget day is now a thing of the past. The gallery is no longer crowded with eager and tense speculators wondering what the day might bring. Even the journalists have their headlines ready before the Minister for Finance stands up to speak. This is due, of course, to the fact that this is a media driven Government which is intoxicated with public image. It reveals and unveils all the crucial budget elements well in advance of budget day so as to keep on the right side of the one power to which it is a slave, the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expect the budget to be dull, bland and unimaginative. The record of Fianna Fáil in Government is that it continues to tinker around rather than make radical changes which would require not only courage and imagination but more importantly clear vision of where one is going and what one wants to achieve. Sadly, this Government has neither of those two elements. The budget showed it had no positive idea or aspiration as to what it wanted to achieve for the country and for the people. It does not know where it wants to go. We listened to speakers dwell on the positive elements of the budget. What are they? The abolition of the 1 per cent levy is welcome but, in effect, the Government is undoing the damage caused by the introduction <Col N="334" /> of this blatantly unjust and unfair tax last year. We on this side of the House protested strongly and urged the Government to reconsider this measure but it refused. Today, the Tánaiste tried to convince us that this tax was being removed because it was only a temporary measure but the dogs in the street know the trade unions forced the Minister for Finance to abolish the 1 per cent levy. They refused to start negotiations on a new programme for economic and social progress until it was abolished. The reality is that but for the trade unions the 1 per cent levy would still be in place.</P>
    <P>The most appalling trend of the Government is its obvious attack on widows. For two successive years Fianna Fáil and Labour have singled out widows as a means of raising revenue. This is a brutal assault on women who need and deserve support at this very crucial period. In the 1993 budget, the Fianna Fáil and Labour Government introduced a probate tax, which was mainly a tax on widows. Last year I pointed out in my budget speech that I considered it antiwidow and orphan, in fact anti-woman. It is obvious that by its very nature the probate tax is generally payable by women who inherit land or property on the death of a spouse or partner. It penalises women at a most vulnerable period in their lives, a time of grief and despair. Its harshness was further deepened by the regulation that it had to be paid within nine months of death or interest at the rate of 15 per cent would be added. This ignored the ability to pay and, worse still, it ignored the contribution that women made by their work in the home or by their earnings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's conversion to our belief that probate tax is and always will be a tax on death, a tax on people who can least afford to pay it. This is another example of the Government's ill-considered measures. I congratulate the ICA and the farming organisations who carried on a massive campaign to make the Government see the reality of the probate tax. While I welcome the step taken in the budget, nevertheless the probate tax must be <Col N="335" /> abolished, and the sooner the better. We must not pursue a tax on death. Now that the probate tax has been abolished for widows, let me remind the Government that it cannot ignore the anguish and despair of widows over the past 12 months. Nothing will compensate them for the agony caused by the unfair and unjust probate tax.</P>
    <P>The budget brought no comfort for widows. The partnership Government of Labour and Fianna Fáil is determined to make widows pay and again singled them out for harsh treatment by introducing a means test for the contributory widow's pension. This is disgraceful and will be fought tooth and nail by this party until it is changed. It is an insult to people who contributed all their lives to prepare for a time which they hoped would never arrive but ultimately does when their partner dies, but it is absolutely appalling that any Government should try to cash in on widows. It is despicable and will not be accepted. Does any Member believe that this measure is fair or justified? Widows and widowers have been ignored in our tax laws and the additional expense imposed on them by the fact they have lost a partner is being ignored. Is the Government not on its heels when it turns such a cruel hand on widows and widowers? How can the Minister for Finance justify his belief that the demands and the burdens of widowhood only lasts 12 months? The Government will and should be judged on its determination to proceed with this measure.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has no interest in the marginalised in our society. The Labour Party, with Fianna Fáil, has singled out-widows for punitive taxation in two budgets. The Fine Gael Party is determined to fight to the bitter end in the interest of those people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party does not want to be reminded of its promises on property tax, VHI and mortgage interest relief. Yet it is wise to remind its members again of their party's election manifesto. I wish to quote the following from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25 November 1992:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Labour has no plans to introduce a new property or house tax.</P>
    <P>Labour will not reduce mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>Labour will not reduce VHI tax relief.</P>
    <P>I consider it extraordinary that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, in trying to justify his change of mind and his lies and deceit to the electorate pointed out in the House that other Deputies have changed their minds in relation to the European elections. In other words, if others can tell lies so can he.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Spring that his deceit is costing taxpayers money and taking money out of their pockets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to withdraw the allegation that Deputy Spring has told lies. That language is slightly unparliamentary. I ask the Deputy to reconsider the use of the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>He misled the public. He fooled the public. I will always agree to change my language but unfortunately I cannot change the facts and that is the most serious part of the case. The people are paying for the fact that he misled them. Labour stated that it would not introduce property tax; would not reduce VHI relief and would not reduce mortgage interest relief. That is what Deputy Spring said; he misled the public, he fooled them. This is costing people money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures are anti family, the people who are prepared to go to work, the people prepared to be self-reliant, those who want to be independent and buy their own house and those who do not want to be dependent on the State for their medical expenses and who want to work. Those measures are regressive and show no compassion and understanding of the burden on people to meet their mortgage repayments. Ultimately, they will deter people from making the decision to buy their own home and we <Col N="337" /> will have a longer waiting list for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to VHI it is important that as many people as possible try to pay their own medical expenses. If they do, relief should be available to them. We are deterring people from being independent and self-reliant. Obviously, this is Labour Party policy. It is now against the worker, that is news to us and certainly to the worker. Labour in Government is anti-worker but at election time it is pro worker, pro unemployed &mdash; pro everybody.</P>
    <P>This budget is a clear statement of contradiction and lack of consistency with Labour Party policy before the election and Labour Party action in Government. I hope the electorate will not forget that, because the budget has done immense damage to those who are working and trying to be self-reliant.</P>
    <P>The budget failed to produce a comprehensive integrated programme to tackle the exclusion experienced by the marginalised in society. The end result will be a widening of the gap between the better off and the poor, whether they are on social welfare or in low paid jobs. The vast majority of people living in poverty before this budget will, sadly, still live in poverty when all its provisions are implemented.</P>
    <P>If I examine the budget from my own constituency point of view I see no hope. I welcome the extension of the urban renewal programme announced in the budget but, unfortunately, it is a disappointment to the towns of Cahir, Cashel, Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir &mdash; all of which were excluded from the new list of 12 small towns designated. I wish to remind the Government of the alarming unemployment level in south Tipperary. These towns would have benefited if they had been selected for designation. I am sad that south Tipperary has been ignored by the Government. No Government Department has been decentralised to south Tipperary and we have lost out hopelessly in attracting new industry. In the budget we were sacrificed yet again in that there was no <Col N="338" /> mention of those towns for an extension of the urban renewal programme.</P>
    <P>A budget hardly goes by without an attack on the cider industry, and industry, crucial to the economic life of south Tipperary where, in Clonmel, 450 people are employed. I had hoped that their competitive position would have been levelled out in this budget because the VAT increase in last year's budget put them at a serious disadvantage where they were trying to compete with other industries. This budget did nothing for them, it increased the price of cider by 3 per cent and left them &mdash; as they were before the budget &mdash; at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed the people. We have the highest emigration rate in Europe, the second highest rate of unemployment, the highest dependency ratio, one of the youngest and growing populations in Europe but we have no jobs for them. We have the best educated students but we have no opportunities for them. This budget was a lost opportunity and I regret it did not make use of the resources it had for the benefit of the marginalised and the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very kind. I would like to take up where Deputy Ahearn left off in relation to the lost opportunities. During his budget speech last week, the Minister made the point that it was a budget for jobs. Since then Government speaker after Government speaker strongly reinforced the argument that this is a budget for jobs, as we also heard 12 months ago. Now we have fewer jobs and more unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a budget for schemes rather than for jobs. Certainly there will be many new schemes and much tinkering with old schemes. Perhaps there will be jobs in the administration of these new schemes but how many jobs will be created for the unemployed? That will be <Col N="339" /> the test of the budget. When we return here in 12 months time for the 1995 budget how many extra people will be in permanent employment? I welcome any attempt to create new jobs even if it is part of the system of new schemes. I support the view of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment that up to 1,000 people should be taken on, on a trial basis, under the proposals put forward by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors. I hope this will be a pointer in a new direction. Because the Minister was willing to go down that road I had hoped he would also have given consideration to the proposals which have been before his Department and the Department of Social Welfare for the past ten years. Those proposals from Cork County Council simply request &mdash; it is a very reasonable and commonsense request &mdash; that moneys be transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to allow the employment of extra road-workers by Cork County Council. At a time when our roads are in a state of disrepair, when unemployment figures are higher than ever the transfer of moneys from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Enterprise and Employment would solve two problems by creating jobs and filling our potholes. While the Minister is willing to examine some schemes I ask him to examine the scheme from Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>This is an ideological budget. This time last year we debated the 1993 budget in the aftermath of the general election. People on this side of the House made the point that the Labour Party had sold out and it was entering Government for Government's sake. Unfortunately, we all forgot that the flexibility of the Fianna Fáil Party and its willingness at all times to grasp power for power's sake, to use power and to hold it, would be a Godsend to the Labour Party. The 1994 budget proved to be an ideological victory for the Labour Party. It appears that the economic driving force behind this budget comes from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I apologise to it for suggesting that <Col N="340" /> 12 months ago its input to Government policy would be mainly about social programmes such as the divorce referendum and, dare I say, the Matrimonial Home Bill. As far as I can see the Labour Party has done much better in that it has taken over the leading economic role of Government and put its socialist stamp on the Government. I disagree with that analysis but I concede it is a Labour budget. Of course, thare will be costs to the country from this Labour budget because it has created a clear political and economic divide. Frequently, many of us have to contend with the argument put forward by commentators and others that there is no difference in the political parties and that one Government is the same as the next. This budget disproves that theory because it lays the foundation for a clear political and economic divide between the Government parties and the majority of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The Government is in favour of more taxation, more spending and more bureaucracy whereas the vast majority of Opposition Deputies want to reduce bureaucracy, to promote enterprise and employment, self-sufficiency and home ownership. We want to advocate rather than condemn profits so that at the end of the day we will have more jobs.</P>
    <P>The budget is a severe attack on the middle classs. It is an attack on the people who pay their way, who do not have medical cards, who do not get education grants, rent relief for local authority housing. This is a severe attack on hundreds of thousands of our citizens. The budget is a product of those who speak platitudes about low paid and unemployed people but whose only solution is pathetic tax reform for those in low paid jobs and small social welfare increases for those who are unemployed. Fine Gael say that the only answer to low pay and unemployment is to introduce real projobs changes in the tax system and social welfare code. Deputy Ahearn referred to those in the poverty trap and the budget certainly has not let them out. At the end of the day, as acknowledged in the response of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, we have been given <Col N="341" /> more of the same. This budget will provide some short term solutions but it is not a pro-jobs budget.</P>
    <P>There are some features of the budget which I wholeheartedly welcome. I congratulate the Minister for allowing an extension of the urban renewal scheme to take in part of Mallow town. This will be a welcome boost to Mallow and it is something which Mallow Urban District Council and local politicians advocated for some time.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred this morning to the increase in the provision for local authority housing. There has been an increase but it has been an increase from a very low base. One hundred per cent of nothing is still nothing. Other measures will have to be taken to tackle the housing crisis. I had hoped for an announcement of an increase in the new house grant. A £5,000 new house grant would be almost self-financing because it would take a number of people over the threshold and enable them to build or purchase a new house rather than depend on the local authority. I had also hoped for an announcement in relation to house improvement grants. The basic fabric of houses in many rural constituencies is very poor and people will be forced to apply for council housing unless their accommodation can be improved. Even if the house improvement grants scheme was reintroduced on a means test basis it would help to take people off the council housing lists. It would make far better sense to give an improvement grant of even £10,000 than to have to provide a local authority house which could cost the State £30,000 to £40,000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of an extra £15 million for the country roads network. Speakers at local authority meetings continuously decry the condition of county roads which have never been worse. As one speaker said, we have highways, roundabouts and by-passes, but our byways are fast deteriorating. The allocation in not sufficient but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture I welcome the change in the probate tax although the change only corrects a problem which <Col N="342" /> the Government created last year. Probate tax in itself is unfair. It is designed to put a severe burden on families at a time of bereavement. It is immoral and it should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the capital acquisitions tax but as far as young farmers are concerned the changes are not enough. If we want to transfer land to the younger generation, retirement pensions are a help but capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax are a hindrance and we need to make more changes. The farm installation grant paid here is one of the lowest in the EU. EU regulations allow for an increase in the grant. I hope the Government will sanction such an increase as it would pay for itself.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues opposite for giving me extra time to heap more criticism on them although I welcomed some features of the budget. I hope to take up this debate again on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute before we adjourn. The Opposition Deputies should look to their own manifestos in relation to the types of tax now in place, some of which the Opposition were responsible for. Personal taxation has been reduced to 27 per cent and 48 per cent from 38 per cent and 65 per cent when the Opposition Parties were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the budget we must look to the conditions that prevailed last year. We had extremely high interest rates, speculation against the IR£ and a general lack of confidence in the economy. We now have historically low interest rates, the lowest inflation rate for 30 years and there is confidence in the Government and in the economy, giving rise to a general mood of prosperity due to the measures adopted by this Government. The budget should not be assessed in isolation but as part of the Government's overall plan to set the economy on a sound footing. The primary focus of the budget is undoubtedly job creation and to help the less well off in our society. <Col N="343" /> The Minister has succeeded in tackling the problem of low pay.</P>

      <P>At my invitation, Mr. Yasser Arafat, chairman of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation paid a visit to Dublin on 16 December 1993. Mr. Arafat led a four person delegation from the PLO.</P>
      <P>This, the first visit to Ireland by Chairman Arafat was part of a tour of European Union and Nordic states undertaken in the context of the Washington agreement of 13 September 1993 between Israel and the PLO and the ensuing negotiations intended to lead towards Palestinian autonomy and an eventual comprehensive settlement of the region's problems.</P>
      <P>At our meeting I praised Mr. Arafat's tenacity, courage and foresight in achieving that agreement. I further stressed the full support of the Irish Government for the Middle-East peace process. Chairman Arafat outlined the current position on the first phase of the Israel-PLO agreement and I assured him that the Government would do everything possible both directly and in concert with our EU partners towards resolution of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chairman Arafat further outlined the economic, infrastructural and social challenges which the Palestinian state would <Col N="344" /> face. I informed him of the Government's commitment to more than double Irish official assistance to the West Bank and Gaza in 1994 and to continue this in future years. I also advised Mr. Arafat that Irish companies were being encouraged to develop economic links with the new Palestinian state. On the issue of technical assistance I promised that Ireland would try to link in to World Bank and EU programmes.</P>
    <P>The chairman expressed the deep appreciation of the Palestinian people for Ireland's long standing record of support for their rights.

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has a major role in providing family and child income support through the social welfare system. He also represents the Government at international and European conferences <Col N="346" /> and seminars which focus on the family.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in addition to his responsibilities for promoting and implementing equality of treatment for persons experiencing disability, disadvantage or discrimination, has responsibility for implementing the Government's programme of family law reform.</P>
      <P>I am entirely satisfied with the manner in which these and other functions are presently distributed among various Ministers and I have no proposals to alter these arrangements.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the United Nations has designated 1994 as the International Year of the Family. In recognition of this, the Government has established an interdepartmental committee, under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare, to organise and co-ordinate a programme of events to mark the occasion.</P>
      <P>In addition, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, a steering committee representing voluntary family organisations, which was established in 1992 to undertake preparations for the year, will receive a grant of £400,000 from the Government to assist it in these preparations. The interdepartmental committee will work closely with the steering committee to undertake preparations for the year.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact, as the Taoiseach said, that 1994 has been designated as the International Year of the Family and that Article 41 of the Constitution is devoted to the family, describing it as the natural, primary and fundamental unit of society, guaranteeing to protect it as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State, does the Taoiseach accept that the family is in crisis in society given that there are 100,000 broken marriages, that in the region of 200,000 children &mdash; the victims &mdash; are caught up in this situation and that one out of every five children is born to single parents?

It is not true that the family is not particularly recognised in the context of social welfare payments. There is discrimination in favour of larger families in the social welfare code in relation to child dependants and child benefit. The larger the family the more child benefit is paid. I cannot accept what the Deputy says.</P>

I also welcome the positive news in relation to Galway City and the granting of urban renewal status to Ballinasloe. There is a need for these programmes which are of great benefit in rural areas.

However, the number of areas to be designated is a matter for the Government and we will be taking decisions very shortly.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that by the end of January 1994, 710 people on CEDP will have had their participation level extended by up to six months.</P>
      <P>The question of a further extension does not arise as details have been announced in the budget of a new programme &mdash; community employment &mdash; which will replace the social employment scheme, community employment development programme and teamwork in March 1994.</P>
      <P>Community employment builds on the strengths and experience of these programmes. The main features of the new programme are: participants may be recruited initially for one year but may be re-engaged by sponsors for a second year if they are key participants, they would benefit from continued participation in terms of additional training and development and if there are no other eligible suitable participants available.</P>
      <P>Older participants employed for more than three years may be able to participate for up to three years and 25 per cent of places will be reserved for the older unemployed. There will be an average of 25 days' training, with a minimum of 15 days, provided in the first year. Additional training will be provided for those retained in the second year.</P>
      <P>In addition all participants with a previous entitlement will retain secondary and other benefits.</P>
      <P>The new programme will cost an additional £35.3 million in 1994.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that statistics on the outcome of such programmes show that 85 per cent of people who participated are still unemployed a year after leaving the programme? Will he also agree that it indicates a need to extend the period of the programme as he initially planned? Why has he decided to cut back to a standard 12 month period? Was it not highly unsatisfactory that having announced there would be an 18 month extension available to all, the Government subsequently reduced it to just 15 months and also brought in a criteria of lack of alternative candidates that made a nonsense of the original welcome extension to 18 months?</P>

      <P>The changes are made in the light of the experience of the existing programmes, bringing together all the programmes under one heading which is desirable and widely accepted. There are clear targets. At the end of the programme there will inevitably be people who will not have found work for one reason or another. Reserving 25 per cent of all places for those over 45 and unemployed for three years or more is a recognition of the problem that the older one is the more difficult it is to become reemployed.</P>

Will it be open to them to go onto the new scheme in March? Will it be possible for them to have any further involvement in a scheme or will they simply be dumped back onto the dole queues?</P>

      <P>The range of statistics available on labour market issues generally and on unemployment, in particular, is comprehensive and compares favourably with the position in many other developed countries.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the live register of the type described by the Deputy &mdash; that is on the basis of area of residence &mdash; was carried out on a quarterly basis up to 1988. Following a general review of the live register statistics, this analysis was replaced from January 1989 by a monthly analysis based on area of registration.</P>
      <P>This area of registration analysis gives the total of registrants for each local employment office and also gives the totals for each county. It has many other advantages by comparison with the former analysis. For example, it is linked to the end-of-month count of the live register; it has a monthly rather than a quarterly frequency; details for each of the 129 local employment offices are published within 14 working days of the reference date; and separate details on registrants under and over 25 years of age at each local office are published.</P>
      <P>The current monthly area analysis of the live register is more frequent, timely and comprehensive than the area of residence analysis compiled up to 1988. A copy of the results for 31 December 1993, the latest date for which figures are available, is in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>

I am seeking additional information over and above that already available. Will he agree that, from a Government point of view, there is a different approach now to local community initiatives? In that context, will he agree there is a considerable need, regardless of what people do in other countries, for people at local level to arm themselves with accurate information to ensure that local community initiatives and the locally based bottom-up approaches frequently referred to are effective? I am disappointed the Minister of State is closing his mind to the widening of information to ensure that such local groups have proper and accurate information on which they can build their programmes. From the point of view of Government policy, will he reconsider his position in regard to developing programmes at local level? We cannot have the programmes without the information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy used the word &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo; a few times. The information is accurate, but I have no problem examining the figures and statistics on the basis outlined by the Deputy. However, she must appreciate that local community groups can extract the information they require for local community initiatives. To put additional responsibility on those who compile the statistics, <Col N="354" /> for example, officials in the CSO and the Department of Social Welfare, might hinder their work and the necessary compilation and publication of statistics within a reasonable period at the end of each month. I do not have a closed mind in this regard, but what the Deputy requests would not assist local community groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the record straight. I am talking about inadequate information which gives an inaccurate picture. In the town of Bray, a local community initiative was established and the first problem it faced was the fact that there was no published information on unemployment specifically for the town of Bray. Information in regard to the labour exchange is available, but that will not assist a local community initiative trying to combat unemployment in the town. Will the Minister examine this problem? I do not expect him to say he has changed his mind. Nevertheless, in view of the different approach now to community initiatives we must have adequate as well as accurate information on which to build initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider the matter, but I will outline the other side of the coin to the Deputy. The Deputy referred to Bray. How does one define the town of Bary? Part of our problem in compiling statistics up to 1988 involved the definition of the boundary of the town of Bray and the areas which are legally inside or outside the town. There are ways and means of extracting information from the current statistics without defining town boundaries. There is a difficulty in regard to all town boundaries at present, but I am sure the Minister for the Environment will resolve that difficulty. For staff to define exact addresses and decide whether a person lives inside or outside a particular area would involve a great deal of unnecessary bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I regard the unemployed and their skills as a very valuable resources, but requesting officials from the CSO or the Department of Social Welfare to collect that type of information is not necessarily the way to proceed. As Deputy McManus stated, local groups would be in a much better position to get those statistics and the details about available skills. The CSO through the Department of Social Welfare should not be involved in that type of work although such information is very useful. There are limits to the amount of resources available to the CSO. I will consider this matter, but I will not allow scarce resources in the CSO to be diverted to tasks which will take from the credibility of the statistics they produce at present in that area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means of a young person who is claiming unemployment assistance and living at home, account is taken of the value of free board and lodgings including the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and the facilities which the household enjoys. The value of free board and lodgings depends on the household circumstances and the amount of the assessment varies by reference to the parental income. Where a young person living at home qualifies for unemployment assistance he or she is entitled to a minimum payment of £5 a week and, as I announced recently, this is being increased to £10 a week from July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of relating the value of <Col N="357" /> board and lodgings to the income level of the household in which the applicant resides is designed to take account of different household circumstances in an equitable way and provides a mechanism for targeting scarce resources to those most in need.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the assessment of free board and lodgings would represent a substantial cost to the taxpayer. A recent estimate of the cost of abolishing the assessment was that the cost would be in excess of £60 million per annum.</P>

      <P>The minimum payment which I am increasing to £10 in July provides a limited measure of financial independence to young unemployed people living at home and claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to create opportunities for young people to participate in employment, education or training as an alternative to early dependence on social welfare and I am taking special measures through the school leavers' scheme to provide such opportunities.</P>

      <P>The Minister may put forward many academic arguments as to why he should not encourage this position. Will he not agree that teenage boys and girls are being forced out of the family home because of his Department's refusal to pay unemployment assistance for the reasons he outlined? Will he not agree that young people who leave the family home will receive not only unemployment assistance but may also receive supplementary welfare allowance in the form of a rent allowance and be placed on the local authority housing list? The Minister trotted out the figure of £61 million. Last year I asked the Minister to quantify the amount of money being paid to young people in respect of supplementary welfare allowance in the form of rent allowance. I <Col N="358" /> also asked him to quantify the amount of money being paid to young people who have left the family home because of the unemployment assistance position. Will the Minister indicate those figures which may offset the figure of £61 million and will he not agree that the provision in this regard is not only anti-social and anti-family, especially in this, the Year of the Family, and regardless of how the family is defined, but also puts young people at risk?</P>

      <P>Let us not forget the need for brevity at this time. A question should be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief in my reply. Deputy Allen raised the question of young people allegedly being forced to leave home. There are some cases where this is the position. The Department of Social Welfare's recently commissioned ESRI report, based on an analysis of the updated data from the 1987 household survey, found no clear evidence to suggest that the current assessment of benefit and privilege was encouraging young people to leave the family home in order to qualify for unemployment assistance and rent supplement. As Deputy Allen and I know there will be cases where that position will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate Department of Social Welfare study carried out among a random sample of people in the Dublin area, reached a similar conclusion to that of the ESRI report. I will give some details of that survey to indicate the position. Regarding the figure for single rent supplement recipients, 5 per cent moved from the family home because of family disputes; 19 per cent moved to cohabit; 32 per cent came from rural areas and are likely to have moved to urban areas to seek employment; one-third of the remaining 44 per cent were over 30 years and a significant proportion of the balance had previously been independent of the family home, having lived away from home while attending college, living abroad and so on. Unfortunately, I do not have a survey in respect of recipients <Col N="359" /> in Cork, but the survey for Dublin provides some indication of the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does. The figures given by the Minister indicate there is a problem. A considerable percentage of people are claiming the benefits I mentioned because they were forced out of the family home. The Minister is drawing unfair conclusions from the statistics. Can he answer the question I asked earlier, that is, to indicate how much is being paid in the country as a whole in rental subsidy under the supplementary welfare Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the delay, from December 1984 to November 1986 in implementing EEC Directive 79/7, a number of court proceedings were initiated seeking retrospective payments in respect of the period of delay. Some of these proceedings were initiated as far back as 1985. In the absence of implementing measures, settlements were made in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The Government has provided for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the directive. The necessary provisions are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 which came into force in June 1992. These regulations entitle married women affected by the delay in implementing the directive to the higher personal rate of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit and to the extended duration of unemployment benefit. The regulations also entitle married women to dependency increases in the form of a household supplement and to unemployment assistance. The legislation provided for the payment of arrears on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994.</P>
    <P>Claimants with potential entitlement to arrears were identified from my Department's records and were issued with claim forms in mid-1992. A total of 86,300 claims were received and of those 70,500 were entitled to payment. All arrears due were paid in 1992 and 1993. The final phase of arrears was not due to be paid until 1994. However, as the Deputies are aware I made special arrangements for the arrears due under this phase, amounting to more than £8 million to be paid before Christmas 1993. A small number of claims are still being received and these continue to be processed.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the retrospective legislation, legal proceedings have been initiated in about 60 cases involving some 5,000 individual plaintiffs. As already made known, these proceedings are being defended by my Department. Ultimately the matter will have to be determined by the courts and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement in the matter at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that 500 women gathered in Cork on Monday night to protest at his attempts to withhold information from them. Further such meetings will be held nationwide during the coming weeks. <Col N="362" /> Will the Minister come clean on this issue? He is attempting to muddy the waters today. Will he not agree that tens of thousands of women throughout the country who are entitled to approximately £140 million in the context of those payments are being denied that money? Will he not agree also that his Department has made settlements with a number of women on the condition that they do not disclose the level of the payments made? I would call such action blackmail.</P>
      <P>Settlements have been made also through solicitors and neither the people who should have received the payments nor public representatives who wrote to the Department are able to elicit the level of payments agreed on behalf of these women. This situation is ripe for exploitation. Will the Minister come clean on this whole issue and stop treating women as fools and second class citizens?</P>

      <P>Whenever this question is raised, the Minister unfortunately tries to filibuster in the House. I put it to him that the issue here is the question of transitional payments made up to 1991, which were phased out in that year. In the McDermott-Cotter II case it was decided that women were entitled to these transitional payments, as were men. In addressing that issue will the Minister tell the House how many cases were settled prior to the introduction of the June 1992 regulation and the total amount of money paid as a result of that settlement? How many applications have been received since June 1992 in relation to claims for transitional payments, which were made to men up to 1992 and to which, as the courts found, women were entitled?

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if social welfare recipients currently in receipt of mortgage subsidy or rent allowance will have the increases in social welfare effectively withdrawn by a corresponding reduction in their entitlement to these allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is determined by a health board so as to leave the recipient with a post-rent income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family size less the current minimum contribution of £5 which the person is required to pay from their own resources. Similar arrangements apply in relation to mortgage interest supplements. Those on payments at the supplementary welfare allowance level contribute no more than £5 towards their own accommodation while those on higher payments pay the £5 minimum plus the difference between the personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance and the personal rate of their particular payment. The minimum contribution of £5 will be increased to £6 from next July.</P>
      <P>The budget increased the rate of social welfare payments by 3 per cent from July with an additional increase of 3 per cent to bring the short term payments, i.e. unemployment benefit, short term unemployment assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance, up to the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this measure is to reduce the additional amount over and above the minimum contribution, payable by those in receipt of long term payments. People on long term payments, who are receiving rent or mortgage supplements, will pay less by way of a minimum contribution from their own resources than they had been paying prior to the budget <Col N="370" /> changes. They will experience a small net increase in their rent or mortgage supplement when the increase in minimum contribution is applied.</P>
    <P>Those on short term payments will experience a reduction of £1 in their level of rent or mortgage supplement when the increase in the minimum contribution is applied. However, this is more than compensated for by the 6 per cent or £3.30 increase in short term payment rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, contrary to the perception of the changes in social welfare in the budget, approximately half of those on supplementary welfare allowance will not gain due to the claw back system in operation? How many people are in receipt of this benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave some examples to show that people will gain from the changes; some will gain more than others. For example, a person on unemployment assistance who previously contributed a total of £8.60 from their own resources will now pay £7.10. That is the general picture right across the board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of people in receipt of this benefit, there is not reliable data available &mdash; new systems are being installed in the health boards which will provide the kind of data now available from the Department of Social Welfare. It is estimated that 13,500 rent supplements and 3,000 mortgage supplements are paid in any one week. The total cost of these supplements in 1993 was £36.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum payment of £5 will be increased to £6. In other words, the minimum contribution made by a person will be increased by £1. In some cases the payments will be increased by <Col N="371" /> £5.40 and approximately £3. There could be an extra contribution, but in any event all the beneficiaries will be better off. I referred to the position of a person on long term unemployment assistance and, if the Deputy wishes, I can get details in regard to other beneficiaries so that she can see how the system operates. There is no doubt but that everyone will be better off. As I said, the minimum payment will be increased from £5 to £6.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Connor</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental scheme operated by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or persons who, because they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency. People in those circumstances are vulnerable in various respects and, accordingly, the main purpose of the scheme is to ensure that they, particularly elderly people, have some way of getting help when it is needed.</P>
      <P>The number of people currently availing of the free telephone rental allowance is approximately 114,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be surprised <Col N="372" /> at what his colleagues wanted to know; they kept asking similar questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They were more relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The current annual cost of the scheme is approximately £20 million.</P>
      <P>A feature of the living alone condition is that it covers children under 15 years only, that is, children under that age may reside with the beneficiary without infringing the living alone condition. Children of 15 years and over are deemed to be capable of getting help in an emergency and this has been the position since the scheme was introduced in 1978. Proposals aimed at raising that age limit would have cost implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring that elderly people do not lose the allowance if someone comes to live with them, I am pleased to be able to make two important improvements this year, as I announced to the House last week. A pensioner being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance will in future retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance where previously it would have been discontinued because the living alone condition would no longer have been satisfied. Second, a pensioner aged 75 or over and no longer living alone will retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the age of a child who can live with a qualified person should be 18 years? Out of ordinary generosity, if nothing else, the age limit should be raised from 15 to 18 years. I am sure that the cost implications of that would not be great.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not think that this is a mean scheme; rather it is a very good and effective scheme, and I congratulate those who introduced it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the age limit, it has always been assumed that a person over 15 years would be able to get help, make a call, etc. That is the basis on which the scheme has operated. Raising the age limit to 18 years, which would bring more people into the scheme, would result in additional costs. This is a budgetary matter. I managed in the budget to introduce two very important improvements in the scheme, and I am surprised the Deputy did not say he was delighted that a beneficiary would retain their telephone allowance after a carer came to live with them. That is a marvellous development. Those over 75 years will retain their benefits, which is a further development.</P>

      <P>I welcome the very limited and paltry concessions the Minister <Col N="374" /> has included in the budget, but they do not merit the song and dance he has made about them. At the other end of the scale, a husband who is over 66 years, and his wife, who is perhaps between 60 and 65 years, are disqualified from receiving a free telephone allowance even though the health of either of them may not be very good. Will the Minister agree there is a need to extend the scheme where the qualifying person is 66 years of age but the spouse is 60 years of age?</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that anyone over the age of 15 should be capable of summoning help in the case of an emergency, which seems to be a reasonable assumption. However, will the Minister also accept that there are 140,000 people of 15 years of age and over up to the age of 18 in school? A total of 98 per cent of 18 year olds are doing the leaving certificate and for eight hours a day, five days a week, eight months of the year, these people are absent from the home but, because technically these people are sleeping at home, the parents are disqualified from this scheme.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about a considerable extension of the scheme to include families with children up to the age of 18 instead of 15. That would have significant budgetary implications and would have to be considered in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date no civil proceedings have been issued for the recovery of sums due by way of overpayments. The majority of cases where over-payments occur have a continuing entitlement to social welfare payments and any amounts overpaid are recovered <Col N="380" /> from current or subsequent entitlements without recourse to legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know the amount of these overpayments since what the Minister of State is saying is that overpayments are not collected; she is saying it is done over a period of time. What is the amount involved and are such overpayments collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms. Burton Ms. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague's question asked the number of civil proceedings issued for the recovery of sums due by way of overpayment. The point I was making was that, generally speaking, the Department does not have to resort to civil proceedings, that in the vast majority of cases overpayments relate to somebody continuing to claim while they have obtained casual work. Such a person may have a continuing entitlement to a social welfare payment. Generally the overpayment is recovered through their subsequent social welfare payments. Most Members will be familiar with that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another side to this question of overpayments as I discovered when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. Many overpayments result from errors on the part of the Department and a recipient, for one reason or another, may be paid £2 or £3 per week above their entitlement due to an error rather than the applicant's failure to advise a change of circumstances or whatever. Would the Minister of State agree that it is very unfair that she should seek refunds from persons who are not in very good financial circumstances who have been beneficiaries of small amounts of money from her Department resulting from errors by officials of her Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy will be familiar with a number of these cases, and will know that arrangements are made to recover the relevant overpayments on a phased basis taking into account the circumstances of the claimant. Obviously, in a number of cases <Col N="381" /> overpayments arise due to fraud. Many of those people would have a continuing entitlement to social welfare. The fraud may arise if they continued to claim during a period when they had casual work. In all such cases the relevant overpayments are subsequently recovered.</P>
      <P>The point Deputy Keogh was making was that perhaps civil court proceedings should be taken. That is not the policy of the Department. Rather it has been the policy, by arrangement with the relevant social welfare recipient, to recover such overpayment thus avoiding, except where absolutely unavoidable, court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister apply herself more specifically to the question I asked? She is dealing with questions of overpayments where recipients themselves are responsible for the overpayment, by fraud, through their neglect to inform the Department of a change in their circumstances and so on. There are many instances where, unknowingly, recipients receive payments due to errors on the part of her Department. Does the Minister have a position in relation to overpayments &mdash; very often small amounts, which are the direct result of errors in her Department and which have nothing to do with those who receive these sums unknowingly and which, when they are withdrawn, have a very damaging effect on their standard of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that falls within the scope of the question. The Deputy appears to be raising a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question. Perhaps the Deputy would table an appropriate question. My Department makes every effort to deal as sympathetically as possible with individual circumstances. Nonetheless, it is the policy of the Department to recover overpayments and, in general, to do so by way of deductions from subsequent social welfare payments where the applicant is in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="382" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister come clean with the House once and for all and admit that, in circumstances in which the Department makes errors regarding overpayments it is the practice of the Department to automatically reduce subsequent payments to the recipient or take court action? I agree with the Minister that, in most cases, it is done by way of deduction. Would the Minister agree that it is illegal for the Department to reclaim payments where the error was the responsibility of the Department, that in the past the Department acted illegally in many cases; that under the social welfare code the Department is not legally entitled to reclaim moneys that have been paid mistakenly by the Department? Will the Minister answer yes or no?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, that is a slightly different question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the regulations of Department are very clearly set out. In all cases, the Department seeks to take into account an individual's means. Nonetheless, the Department seeks to recover overpayments, as it is legally entitled to do. The Deputy's party on a number of occasions expressed concern at the level of public spending and my Department seeks to carry out its operations in an efficient manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How many cases are on hand in relation to repayments of overpayments on a phased basis? How many of those overpayments arose as a <Col N="383" /> result of errors by the Department? If the Minister does not have that information can she inform the House whether the Department has ever foregone an overpayment which arose as a result of an error by the Department because we must remember that we are here dealing with people on extremely low levels of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy table a separate question because we were not given notice of such a detailed question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should know the law; she has enough advisers and programme managers. She is acting illegally at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my earlier question &mdash; which relates to Deputy De Rossa's question &mdash; can the Minister say what is the total amount of these overpayments? We would all be concerned that payments would go to the most needy in our society. What is the Minister's view on what constitutes fraud and what constitutes overpayment? For example, is she happy with the position in relation to fraud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do think that any Minister would be happy about any fraud, of whatever percentage, in any Department. Nonetheless, the Department of Social Welfare makes many millions of payments. The point of Deputy Keogh's colleague's question was whether the Department was taking civil proceedings to recover such payments. Obviously, a proportion of overpayments arise in relation to fraud. Much of that fraud arises within the context of people failing to sign off properly when they engage in casual employment, when they fail to properly inform the Department. In such cases the Department attempts to deal with them in a humane manner, by making an arrangement to have such overpayments recovered on a phased basis. Given the concern of the Deputy's party about possible overspending of public funds, I would have thought she <Col N="384" /> would have welcomed such an efficient system of protecting Government and public revenues against possible loss or abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister of State a simple question and, if she does not know the answer would the Minister answer it? Has the Department the legal right to recoup payments from social welfare recipients for overpayments where such overpayment were made through an error by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clearly outside the scope of the question which was very specific, asking the number of civil proceedings issued for the recovery of sums due by way of overpayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue arises under the question. I am asking about the legal rights of social welfare recipients and the Minister of State cannot answer my question. Will the Minister answer it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I exhort the Minister of State to answer this important question. I suspect she does have the answer. Has the Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, ruled that where an administrative error occurs on the part of the Department leading to an overpayment, that the Department has no right to seek recoupment in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> Finance Act, 1992 (Commencement of Section 15) (Unemployment Benefit and Pay-Related Benefit) Order, 1994;</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 26th January, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1992, provided for the treatment as income for tax purposes of certain short term social welfare benefits. These are disability benefit, injury benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit. The section can come into operation generally or in relation to specific benefits or categories of recipients of benefits on such day or days as may be fixed by the Minister for Finance by order. Prior to such an order being made it is required that a draft of the order be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving of the draft be passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>A commencement order of 10 March 1993, brought the section into operation with effect from 6 April 1993, in respect of disability benefit and injury benefit. As I announced in the Budget Statement, I now propose to bring the section into operation with effect from 6 April 1994, in respect of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit. A draft order to that effect was laid before the House on 26 January.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss the making of these benefits reckonable as income for tax purposes, I would like to say a few words on the overall issue of tax reform. The Government is committed, through the Programme of Partnership Government, to continue the process of tax reform. Substantial progress has been made in this regard over recent years but further action is required.</P>
    <P>Our overriding economic and social objective is to resolve our critical unemployment situation. As I indicated in the Budget Statement the three yardsticks against which a &ldquo;pro-jobs&rdquo; taxation policy must be measured are those of assisting competitiveness, promoting the best economic use of our resources while favouring employment where possible, and being, in the broad sense, as employment-friendly <Col N="467" /> as practicable given that revenue must be raised.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that taxation policy is proemployment means increasing rewards and incentives for working and reducing the cost of employing workers. By reorienting the income tax and PRSI systems the Government is helping to promote wage moderation and to increase the competitive position of industry. Changes in this area are important for labour intensive industries, particularly those with large numbers of low paid workers. In general terms our tax system no longer stands out as having exceptionally high rates of tax. It is in the area of income tax that there remains considerable need for positive tax reform.</P>
    <P>The proportion of all tax which is collected from incomes is very high. Furthermore, the burden of income tax bears heavily on those with modest incomes. This is because of the speed at which individuals enter the tax net and, more importantly, the speed at which the higher rates of tax come into play. It is in these respects that our current tax system impacts negatively on enterprise and employment and where significant changes are essential. I was, therefore, delighted to be able to announce very significant improvements in the income tax position of all earners in the budget. In particular, I was delighted to be able to focus the benefits on low and medium earners.</P>
    <P>The budget reduced the overall take from income tax by almost £200 million in 1994 and by £333 million in a full year. It did this first by abolishing the temporary 1 per cent levy. The budget also increased significantly the personal allowances and the standard rate bands, helping to reduce the burden of taxation on the low and middle income earners. In addition, the rate of tax at which marginal relief is charged was reduced by 8 percentage points. This significant reduction in the marginal rate of tax faced by many low paid workers will alleviate the poverty trap and increase the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general income tax <Col N="468" /> measures mentioned here, a number of other measures was taken to improve the position of the low paid and to help improve the competitive position of those industries which employ large numbers of low paid workers. Finally, I have introduced a differential employers' PRSI contribution rate structure. From 6 April 1994 a reduced rate of 9 per cent will be levied on incomes up to £173 per week. Above £173 the normal rate of 12.2 per cent will apply on all income subject to a weekly ceiling of £496 equivalent to £25,800 per annum. It will cost £28 million in 1994. Secondly, an exemption from the health and employment and training levies has been introduced for those earning less than £9,000 per annum. The obligation for employers to pay the cost of these levies for those with medical cards has also been removed. The total cost of the changes in PRSI and these levels is £63 million in a full year. This represents a very significant boost to the cost structure of firms with large numbers of low paid employees and should improve significantly the competitive position of those firms.</P>
    <P>Of course, tax reform is not simply a matter of tax reduction. The overall level of taxation is primarily determined by the level and quality of services which we as a society decide should be provided or financed by the State either directly or indirectly. As I said, the strategy behind the tax changes involves a reorientation of the income tax and PRSI code to be more employment friendly. Focusing reliefs and reductions on the lower paid inevitably involves trade-offs elsewhere in the tax code. In the income tax area the base broadening measures which I have taken this year involve confining tax relief for mortgage interest and VHI to the standard rate and making unemployment benefit reckonable for tax purposes. While I will explain the specific equity arguments which point to the fairness of making unemployment benefit reckonable for tax purposes in a moment, it is essential to recognise that this change is part of the ongoing tax reform programme. Furthermore, the significant improvements in the tax position of the <Col N="469" /> low paid made in this year's budget will, of course, apply to those claiming unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Returning to unemployment and pay-related benefits, I should stress that making these benefits reckonable as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity. The reason for treating unemployment and pay-related benefit as income for tax purposes is merely to treat people in similar circumstances, with similar amounts of incomes in a tax year, in the same way. It is to ensure that for two people in similar circumstances having the same level of income, one does not pay less tax than the other simply because one person's income contains unemployment benefit and the other person's does not.</P>
    <P>The extent to which taxation will actually arise in a given case as a result of this change will, of course, depend essentially on the amount of other income that the recipient of unemployment benefit or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year. I would like to draw Members' attention, in this context, to a paper entitled &ldquo;Income Tax and Welfare Reforms&rdquo; published by the ERSI in 1991. As I indicated when the commencement order on the taxation of disability benefit was being discussed last year, the ERSI paper demonstrated the flaw in the argument that taxation of short term social welfare benefits would impact unfairly on those on low income. The study found that most of the benefit from the non-taxation of certain short term benefits, including unemployment benefit, went to those on higher incomes. In particular it found that 70 per cent of those tax units affected by the taxation of short term benefits are in the upper half of the income distribution range and that in removing the exemption fewer than one in ten of those affected would be in the lower income ranges. These figures are based on a study carried out in 1987. The increases in the income tax exemption limits since then and the introduction of substantial child additions to them should mean that the effect on the lower income groups would be even less now.</P>
    <P>The change to making short term social <Col N="470" /> welfare benefits, including unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, reckonable as income for tax purposes has been recomended by a number of groups, including the Commission on Taxation, the Commission on Social Welfare, the National Economic and Social Council and the Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; Culliton. The change now being made should ensure that persons are not better off because portion of their annual income arises from unemployment benefit than they would be if the same overall income arose from being employed. It will help to reduce the replacement ratio of those affected and make it more attractive for them to remain in or take up employment.</P>
    <P>A number of other PRSI benefits are already reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include, for example, invalidity pensions, disability benefit, injury benefit, retirement pensions, widows pensions and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments in general and unemployment benefit in particular have improved significantly in recent years. For example, in 1987 the personal rate of unemployment benefit was £42.30 per week. Following this year's budget the rate will be £61.00. This represents an increase of 44 per cent or over 20 per cent after the effects of inflation have been allowed for. The new £61.00 per week rate will come into operation from July of this year and will ensure that those on unemployment benefit will be receiving a payment which is above the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. Further progress in improving the unemployment benefit rate will be made in future years as economic conditions permit.</P>
    <P>When the House was debating the commencement order for disability benefit in March last, I indicated that when unemployment and pay-related benefits were brought into taxation in 1994 they would be taxed at source by the Department of Social Welfare. This would mean that in addition to paying the unemployment and pay-related benefits the Department would also make refunds <Col N="471" /> and deductions of tax where appropriate. This is still the intention for the permanent system. The necessary preparations for the introduction of the permanent system of tax are currently being undertaken by the Department of Social Welfare with a view to its implementation in 1995. Consequently in the short term an interim taxation arrangement will be operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The interim system will involve the Department of Social Welfare continuing to pay unemployment and pay-related benefit gross, that is, without deduction of income tax. Any tax due in respect of the benefit will be collected essentially through Revenue restricting tax refunds to take account of any unemployment and pay-related benefit received.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate how the proposed arrangements will operate in practice in some situations. Where a person ceases work during the tax year and goes on unemployment benefit, the person will continue to claim refunds of tax previously paid in the tax year from Revenue at four-weekly intervals as at present. However, Revenue will take the amount of unemployment and pay-related benefit received into account in computing the amount of any refund due. If the person's weekly receipt of benefit is less than their weekly tax-free allowance some tax refund, but at a reduced level, will still be due. If the benefit received is greater than the person's weekly tax-free allowance then no tax refund would in future be due. Of course if a person has paid no tax since the beginning of the tax year no refund would arise. This is what happens at present also.</P>
    <P>When a person resumes employment or takes up employment for the first occasion during the tax year, having been on unemployment benefit, the following arrangements will apply. Where the person's unemployment and pay-related benefit is less than their weekly tax-free allowance Revenue will instruct that the cumulative basis of PAYE will be operated in the employment, with the unemployment and pay-related benefit being <Col N="472" /> taken into account. The operation of the cumulative basis will give the employee immediate benefit of any unused tax-free allowances for the period of unemployment in the tax year which are not required to cover the unemployment and pay-related benefit received.</P>
    <P>Where the person's unemployment and pay-related benefit is greater than their weekly tax-free allowance the benefit received will not be taken into account on resuming or taking up employment for the first time in the tax year. However, the employer will be instructed by Revenue to operate the non-cumulative basis of PAYE, which is generally known as the &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; basis, in respect of the person's further taxation. Normal cumulative PAYE takes account of the employee's cumulative tax position from the beginning of the tax year up to the pay week that is being dealt with. &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; non-cumulative PAYE, on the other hand, looks only at the employee's tax position in the week that is being dealt with. &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; in this instance will, in order to prevent possible hardship to the employee, prevent collection of the undercharge which has arisen because the benefit was greater than the tax-free allowances. It will also deny the person any access to the tax-free allowances for the period of unemployment, thereby preserving such tax free allowances to be offset against any tax due on the unemployment and pay-related benefit received.</P>
    <P>The arrangements I have outlined are those that will apply in the great majority of cases, which are straight forward. In non-straight forward cases where the employee does not permanently cease work with the employer but is in receipt of benefit &mdash; for example, systematic short-time workers &mdash; the Revenue will, where appropriate and possible, restrict their tax-free allowances by the amount of their expected unemployment benefit. The employer will continue to operate PAYE on a cumulative basis in respect of their earnings from employment.</P>
    <P>In the case of undercharges of tax arising from this measure Revenue will, in general, follow the usual procedures <Col N="473" /> which normally apply in respect of other tax undercharges.</P>
    <P>I must again stress that the extent to which taxation will arise under this measure will essentially depend on the amount of other income which the person or the person's spouse has in the tax year. If there is no other income in addition to unemployment and pay-related benefit, the exemption limits will generally ensure that there is no tax to pay. The yield that it is estimated will arise from this measure is £18 million in 1994 and £30 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald and with Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most unemployed people would prefer to be offered a job than to be offered better welfare benefits. This budget provides for action on both fronts. Unemployment benefits are being increased by 10 per cent and this is accompanied by special measures targeted at the low paid and designed to reduce unemployment traps. The budget provisions in relation to unemployment benefit have to be seen in the light of what has been done on the low pay front and what has been done to alleviate unemployment traps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the macro-economic strategy to increase total employment, the budget has particular strategies targeted at unemployed people and ensuring they are facilitated in taking up new job opportunities. This budget was a budget for jobs, a budget which reduced the tax wedge considerably, which targeted income tax relief particularly on those with low and middle incomes. This budget saw the first reduction in employers' PRSI and simplified and streamlined tax affairs for small business. Most important, this budget marks the first step to real reform of the tax structure on the lines suggested by so many reports: Culliton, the Commission on <Col N="474" /> Taxation, the NESC and the Commission on Social Welfare, of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>The strategy is to build on the National Development Plan's programme for job creation by a complementary fiscal and tax strategy which will encourage the maximum job potential from this enormous investment.</P>
    <P>The prudent financial management of the Government, which has seen interest rates tumble, is a major fillip to investment and job creation. Everyone in this House maintains that the creation of employment is the first aim of economic and social policy. Attaining that aim involves change and sometimes taking tough decisions if we are serious about tackling unemployment. It would have been easier to have lower tax give-aways and leave the structure of our tax system alone. That structure, which has penalised productive earnings as compared with property investment, left the Irish economy with lower investment for growth and with fewer jobs than with a system restructured on the lines on which the Government has now embarked.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has consistently called for the implementation of the Culliton report, but they are not so good at calling for it when it comes to specifies. The core recommendation of that report is to move towards a tax system which rewards productive work and where individuals and businesses seek markets rather than tax breaks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the reason so many work schemes were introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Those tax changes will deliver higher growth in employment in the Irish economy. As a Government which is serious about its commitment to job creation, it would be irresponsible for us to bypass the opportunity to restructure the tax system while still leaving families better off in aggregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed in recent years about unemployment and poverty traps. Some of this concern has been focused on hypothetical examples, of which there are few if any to be found <Col N="475" /> in the real world, but we all recognise there have been areas of real problem. Much discussion has taken place in this House on the hypothetical example of the family with four children on FIS, moving from £7,000 to £15,000 and paying marginal relief. There are fewer than 1,500 families in that position and it is possible to target help in that area; we have done that in this budget without a major hullabaloo. The most significant problem is the unemployment trap, which makes it very difficult for people to get back into the workforce. In the Irish economy the people who lose their jobs and find it very difficult to get back in tend to be those with a lower skill base and with lower earnings potential.</P>

      <P>Could we have some order in the House? The most significant problem relates to the person with limited earning power who would not be much better off if he took up a job. There is little evidence that this factor influences the level of unemployment but it has an important bearing on it, in particular in putting parents of families at higher risk of being out of work. Recent social welfare statistics suggest that 45 per cent of parents with four or more children are without a job. Where the head of a household is out of work there is a strong likelihood that unemployment will pass from one generation to the next, so it is important that we address these unemployment traps.</P>
      <P>The budget focused in particular on helping the lowest paid, including people already below tax exemption thresholds.</P>

      <P>Health and employment and training levies are being abolished for those being paid under £9,000. This is focusing on many people already under the tax exemption thresholds, who would not gain if all the benefits were on the tax side in the budget. Tax exemption limits are being raised by £100 per child and they are up by £400 for a person with four children. It is the larger families that are hit worst by the unemployment trap. The marginal relief tax rate is reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent for those who are slightly above the income tax exemption limits. This will focus help on the low paid and will reduce their marginal tax rate. Personal allowances are being increased by £350 per couple and family income supplement, targeted at people in low paid employment, particularly at families, is up by £6 per week per family. Children's allowances are being increased for families with three or more children. There is a specific focus, and a higher percentage increase in this budget on the lower paid and that will help the prospects of people whose earning power is poor, to take up jobs.</P>

      <P>These changes, together with the abolition of employers PRSI for the low paid, and the abolition of employers liability to health and training levies for medical card holders, should help the supply of jobs on offer to people out of work and increase the attraction of taking up a job for those who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is being made for up to 40,000 places on a new community employment programme offering work, <Col N="478" /> progression and development opportunities for unemployed people, with 25 per cent of places reserved for the long term unemployed with a view to reintegrating people into the mainstream job market.</P>
    <P>Fifty five thousand people have been unemployed for three years or more. From research and practical experience we know that private employers are not interested in offering these people jobs. We need a programme which offers real work opportunities and an income ahead of social welfare rates. It must offer the opportunity to keep secondary benefits and offer real opportunities for training, development and progression so that people can be integrated into the economic mainstream and have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field for the additional jobs that will arise from the macro-economic strategy and change in the tax structure in this budget.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue which most people would not see as a popular measure. There has been a peculiar attitude to coherent change, and efforts made to introduce coherent change have been derided by the Opposition. If one believes that people should be taxed on income, the logic is that the more income one has the more tax one should pay. We all accept that we should take as many low paid people as possible out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have uniformity in how we organise our affairs. Since I entered the Dáil I have not seen any private members' motions from Opposition parties proposing that widows, old age or invalidity pensions should not continue <Col N="479" /> to be taxable income. If certain types of social welfare payment should be taxed and others should not, it is about time we had an explanation for the way the Opposition look at some social welfare payments as opposed to others.</P>
    <P>Long before I became involved in politics pensions were considered to be taxable income. If we disregarded all social welfare income, people on relatively high incomes would have an extra tax free bonus and to pay for that we would have to lower the threshold for the lower paid workers. On the other hand we could count all income as taxable and raise the thresholds at which people enter the tax net and decide on ability to pay tax with reference to gross income for a year. In the case of a couple where one earned £40,000 a year and the other earned £10,000 in nine months and then went on unemployment benefit and received another £3,000 giving that household an income of £53,000, why should the last £3,000 not be counted as taxable income? I have never heard a rational explanation for exempting such income. I cannot see how that would help the poor or the less well off.</P>
    <P>On the other hand a widow on old age pension in receipt of anything more than £4,050 must pay tax. If she has a small independent income she pays income tax. It is about time people stopped taking an emotional line on this issue of taxing unemployment benefit and looked at it rationally. Who could better afford to pay the tax in the examples I have outlined, the person with the family income of £53,000 or the widow with a family income of £4,300? Nobody would dispute that the second person is less able to pay tax.</P>
    <P>The thrust of taxation policy must be to take as many lower paid people as possible out of the tax net. I fail to see how any other proposal could lead to greater equity. I would therefore like to see people being taxed on gross income, taking their ability to pay into account. I have yet to hear a cogent argument against this.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that as many of the <Col N="480" /> low paid as possible are taken out of the tax net and that we use available resources to ensure that they pay tax at low rates. In this regard I was highly critical of the fact that people who found themselves just over the income threshold paid tax at 48 per cent. I compliment the Minister for reducing this to 40 per cent this year. For many of the people I represent this is a major step forward, but much more remains to be done. We will never be able to take the low paid out of the tax net and do all of the things that we are told week in week out should be done if we fail to ensure that all income is treated the same in a system in which the low paid pay the least amount of tax.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the reduction of the tax burden on the low paid in particular, this would be a reasonable step. When people try to twist things it may not sound popular, because it is easy to use slogans, to say we are taxing the unemployed and to misrepresent what is being done. The fact is that if the unemployed wind up being taxed under this system, the reason will not be that unemployment benefit is regarded as income for tax purposes but rather that the tax thresholds are too low. The way to rectify this is to raise the thresholds at which the low paid enter the tax system, reduce the marginal rates and increase the exemption limits in respect of children. That is the way we should proceed rather than bury our heads in the sand and continue to live with a system which is patently inequitable and in which social welfare payments are treated differently. That has been the position up to now. If people criticise this move, in all logic they should state whether all social welfare payments should be taxed, particularly contributory social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister and the Minister of State, <Col N="481" /> Dame Eithne, in relation to these matters. I always appreciate the lectures on tax reform; but I could not help thinking that if the Minister for Finance was to stand up and say he was putting 1p on the pint of beer and argue that this represented a major leap forward in reducing the income tax burden, people would not take him seriously. The amount of extra tax to be raised by way of the changes to the residential property tax is less than the amount that would be raised if 1p was put on the price of beer. Therefore we should not have any arguments that the residential property tax changes represent a radical step forward.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about economics and labour market dynamics, but very little from the Government side of the House about ordinary people, about people who have lost their jobs and will have to pay this tax and who do not know when they are going to find another job. I am surprised that this measure has not received more media attention, because we have been told that many aspects of the budget have a hidden sting. If we make a simple calculation we will see just how savage this measure is. The Minister states that in a full year he will save £30 million. As I wanted to get some idea of what this will mean for the ordinary unemployed person I rang the Central Statistics Office in Cork &mdash; not the easiest place to find but I am sure they are very welcome in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ask them how many people were in receipt of unemployment benefit last year and the year before to work out the average number of unemployment benefit claimants who will pay this £30 million in a full year. In 1992 the figure was 76,653 and 74,885 in 1993. Let us assume therefore that the average figure is 75,000. If we divide the sum of £30 million by 75,000, lo and behold we will find that the unemployed will have £400 a year taken out of their pockets, or £7.62 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that if the Minister for Social Welfare was to stand up in this House <Col N="482" /> and announce that unemployment benefit was to be cut by £7.62 a week there would be howls of anguish right across the country and that if we were in Government the Labour Party, and the present Tánaiste in particular, would lead the howls of protest. I remember the Fianna Fáil taunts about Thatcherite and monetarist government, about bookkeepers and accountants and my colleagues, Deputies Dukes and Bruton, being accused of all those things. But they never cut unemployment benefit by £7.62 a week on average.</P>
    <P>What we have seen in recent years, especially since this Government came into office, is a systematic dismantling of the benefits of insured workers. It started first by cutting pay-related and disability benefit. This time last year it was announced that disability benefit was to be taxed, while in this budget the abolition of pay-related benefit for those in receipt of unemployment benefit from 6 April this year was announced. Now, it is proposed to tax unemployment benefit. In addition, treatment benefits such as optical and dental benefits have been reduced. Finally, the widow's mite, the contributory widow's pension &mdash; this is the final straw &mdash; has to be attacked, cut and means tested. They are going to root around the cupboard to see what extra she has and if they can cut it they will.</P>
    <P>Those who have paid contributions, who are trying to be prudent and who have worked hard all their lives are now being told that the ground rules are to be changed and that they are going to get less. I should point out that the most significant study in this area was carried out by the ESRI and published in 1991. But if one analyses this move, one will see that it was based on a survey carried out in 1987. Therefore it is being put forward on data which is out of date.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments that has been advanced is that people are working and milking the system, that they are deliberately drawing unemployment and disability benefit when they should be at work, that they are claiming tax refunds and that therefore this acts as a disincentive to work. Regardless of what <Col N="483" /> argument can be made about people going sick during the final weeks of the tax year to claim a refund or disability benefit, this does not apply in the case of unemployment benefit, because one would first need collusion and connivance on the part of the employer to rig the system and this is not credible. Therefore those arguments do not apply with equal force in relation to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another significant group of workers to which little reference was made. In his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;The people I am most concerned about are short-time workers&rdquo;. We all know of firms, such as clothing and construction firms, which run into difficulties due to bad weather and which have to go a two or three day week for a limited period until the order book is full again.</P>
    <P>People working in such firms have to go on a three day week for a limited period until the order book is again full. The Minister acknowledged that there are complexities in calculating the wages of systematic short-time workers and says that the Revenue will, where appropriate and possible, restrict their tax free allowances by the amount of their expected unemployment benefit. This is a quagmire because people on short-time working will now suffer a cut in their income; their unemployment benefit will be cut, not at source, but as part of their pay packet and their tax free allowance will have to be reduced. This morning Mr. Jimmy Somers of SIPTU beseeched AT Cross not to lay workers off but to put them on short-time, but the Government is systematically destroying short-time working by ensuring that short-time unemployment benefit will be taxed. Half a job is better than no job but the people in AT Cross in Ballinasloe will feel the cold winds of the Minister's policies blowing down their backs when these taxation measures go through.</P>
    <P>Often we lose sight of the effect of these measures on married couples. I would like to examine in detail the effects on the standard case of a married man with two children. That man and his wife <Col N="484" /> are both at work in relatively low-paid jobs. According to the social welfare rates booklet if one spouse becomes unemployed he or she is entitled to claim but not for an adult dependant, and would only be entitled to claim an allowance for one child. Before the budget increase that person would have been entitled to £55.66 for themselves and £12.80 for one child, totalling £68.40. He or she would have got another £16.80 in pay-related benefit but, as we know, that has been butchered.</P>
    <P>The spouse who remains at work is on the top or standard rate of tax or below the exemption limit. Let us see how these measures affect them. The new tax free allowance exemption limit for a married man with two children is £8,100. The £68.40 a week which works out at £3,556 a year now becomes liable to tax. If the man stays at work and earns £88 a week, a very low figure, because his wife's unemployment benefit is now taxable their income will be £50 over the exemption limit of £8,100 and they will be in the tax net. In spite of all the nonsense we have listened to about lifting low-paid workers out of the tax net, this measure will bring many people into it.</P>
    <P>The second effect is in regard to people paying tax at the standard rate. This £3,556 is now liable to tax. When one works out the PRSI and the PAYE the effective marginal rate of tax, including the lower rate on the levies, is 32.75 per cent. Under this measure people on this rate will lose £1,164. For people on the upper rate of tax, the marginal rate is 55.75 per cent, and they will lose £1,982. It is Hobson's choice. The Minister may wax eloquently about his concern for all those people &mdash; low paid or middle income earners &mdash; but they cannot afford to lose money. The wives of really well-paid people are painting their nails at home because they do not have to work. These measures will systematically attack low and middle income earners and inflict gross hardship on them. They mean that a married man with two children will lose at most £38.13 at the top rate or £22.40 at the standard rate of tax. If one spouse is on £88 a week or more people who <Col N="485" /> would otherwise be exempt will be brought into the tax net.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's concept of well off people is very strange. The whole purpose of our tax system is that people should pay according to their ability and that those who have more pay more. I am not convinced by the arguments of the spin doctors although they are doing a very good job and giving very good value to the Government. They have massaged the media, put it across that this is an income adjustment which is perfectly reasonable, logical and fair. However, to the average punter it means a loss of £25 a week. There is no way this message can be massaged to the point that it can conceal the truth.</P>
    <P>My experience as a constituency TD is that those on unemployment benefit lose. I, and I am sure every other Deputy, have heard the problems of people who do seasonal work. In ports in my constituency people do seasonable work relating to tourism and the same applies to the construction industry. They work for, perhaps, 20 weeks, go off long term assistance and back on unemployment benefit; they lose the free fuel allowance, the £5 a week paid from October to March and the butter vouchers. If their child is 18 years of age and still at school, people on long term unemployment assistance can continue to be paid the child dependant allowance until the child is 21 years of age. If people are on unemployment or disability benefit, they cannot get that, or the Christmas bonus. It does not pay people to take up seasonable employment because they lose the benefits of long term unemployment assistance. This is a further erosion of the rights of people who want to work, to get away from being long term unemployed and who do not want to do nixers. There are severe potential losses involved for people on long term unemployment assistance if they take up a short term job because of the loss of the fringe benefits to which I referred. Before this budget the same married man with two children got £116.70 in unemployment benefit whereas on long term unemployment assistance he got nearly £4 more at <Col N="486" /> £120.30 a week. There are huge anomalies and discriminations in out system against short term workers.</P>
    <P>All these measures put an added administrative burden on employers, particularly small businesses. There is a voluminous report by the task force on small businesses and there were extensive leaks, with Minister of State Brennan preening himself as a Minister for Enterprise and Minister Quinn putting it out that Government wanted to remove the red tape from small businesses, to help the entrepreneur. There has been much rhetoric but in the fine print of this budget there is a further series of complex arrangements in relation to the application of the week one tax free allowance and the adjustments that will have to be made for people who have come off unemployment benefit. To calculate their tax free allowances one would need a computerised system.</P>
    <P>We will be voting against this measure, not on the principle of taxation on social welfare but because of the real hardship it will inflict on ordinary people, particularly married couples who both work, and because of the further diminution of the rights of insured workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is introducing taxation on social welfare payments such as unemployment benefit at a time when the abolition of pay-related benefits is also taking place. Those moves were clearly telegraphed last year by the Minister, but I understood they would take place only when the social welfare system was brought into line with the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. It was nauseating to listen to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, a Dublin 4 socialist, crying on the backs of the unemployed. She does not understand the realities of life outside the cloistered haven she represents. Today she gave a lecture on economics which was totally at variance with the realities of life with which some of us are familiar. The people we represent are in a totally different position to that referred to by the Minister. As a former member of the Commission on <Col N="487" /> Social Welfare, it should be her responsibility as a Minister to implement many of the recommendations of that commission. As our spokesperson on Finance stated, we must oppose this measure because it involves selective implementation of the commission's report and conveniently ignores many of its urgent recommendations.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is means tested for those who are made redundant, deserted wives benefit is similarly limited and as a result of this budget widows pensions will be means tested. Surely that is corruption of our social insurance system and must be questioned. I listened to the personal attack on the leader of my party this morning by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was once a Minister in Government with our party. It was nauseating to hear him insult the intelligence of the people of this country. Since taking up office he has been spineless in protecting the interests of the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. As I said previously, the Labour Party's perspective of life changed suddenly from the back of a Mercedes. The type of abuse hurled at Deputies on this side of the House this morning, because they are doing their job of representing the people, is unacceptable. It is fine for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in here with a script written by some other person and hurl insults from the reams of paper in front of him, but he is spineless in his defence of the sick, the elderly and the less-welloff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget announcement that a means test is to apply to widows' contributory pensions shows the Government up for what it is, an uncaring Government. In that context I will refer to a statement by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare on the budget debate on Thursday, 27 January. That Minister showed herself up in the House today for her lack of knowledge on the regulations of the social welfare code. In her speech last Thursday she expressed delight that widows aged 60 to 65 years would benefit from changes in <Col N="488" /> the regulations for free schemes. She described as perks the well deserved allowances in respect of telephone rental, fuel, television licences, butter vouchers and ESB, which are necessary for those less well off than herself. Perks such as the hiring of programme managers, a State car, two drivers and a mobile phone are luxuries the Minister may enjoy; but the allowances offered to widows in the 60 to 65 years age bracket are urgently needed. To say the least, her comments were uncaring, patronising and the widows of Ireland deserve a public apology from the Minister of State, Deputy Burton. A person with no real feeling for or sensitivity to widows should not be in her position. She should reconsider her position as Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare because she does not understand real life beyond the cocoon in which we work here. The widows of Ireland who are labouring under tremendous difficulties should not be insulted in that manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State would like to forget the phrase &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, came into this House and stated that the ghost of the dirty dizen should be laid to rest. The ghost of the dirty dozen should be laid to rest, because if not it will continue to haunt the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, throughout the lifetime of this Dáil. In the discussions taking place between Government and the social partners at present there is much talk about salary increases and wage payments, but when a comprehensive agreement is reached what exactly will be done in regard to the dirty dozen cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> As a result of this budget the unemployed and their dependants will be worse off. In his speech Deputy Yates outlined the reality of the position and not what the spin doctors and programme managers are feeding to the media. The increases given to social welfare recipients will simply maintain purchasing powers at their current level. The immediate increase in VAT on essentials such as clothing and footwear will erode part of that increase. In a few weeks time rents on local authority houses will increase and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, could do something in that regard. That will further erode the increases given to the unemployed, especially the elderly. Some households will be far worse off as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>Despite all that has been said there has not been any fundamental change or improvement in the overall design of the social welfare system. Ministers are unaware of the realities of life for the families of the unemployed. They appear to be insulated from reality. Daily, some children go to school hungry because of a lack of food, and I am not exaggerating in saying that. That is happening in my constituency and in many other areas badly affected by unemployment. Were it not for the commitment and dedication of both religious and lay teachers, those children would find it impossible to study because of hunger. Ministers appear to be unaware that this is happening, as they glibly give us lectures on economics and divorce themselves from reality. Those are the realities, but the scriptwriters, spin doctors and programme managers employed by the Government can never hope to understand the reality of life in real Ireland, not Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that a Minister who is relatively well off and insulated should introduce this measure, even having listened to the comments about its impact on those in need. Many families receiving unemployment benefit cannot exist on the levels offered. They are unemployed through no fault of their own but because of the failure of the Government's economic policies. They <Col N="490" /> are casualties of the Government's ineptitude.</P>
    <P>This piecemeal measure will seriously affect families. The reality for many families where one spouse is unemployed and drawing the minimum social welfare payment is that the other spouse is forced to work for long hours for low pay. In some cases one spouse needs to work and is condemned for it. I know the realities of life for many people and understand why they need to work, but those who work are labelled as spongers and fraudsters. Unfortunately, the spouses and many of the unemployed must take work at low pay and there are many service industries here who still exploit their unfortunate circumstances. There is an excess of people for the number of available jobs here. People are working longer hours for less money. As a result of working and in an attempt to keep body and soul together for the sake of their family, those families are to be further subjected to attacks which will force them out of employment back into the home where they will be forced to sub-exist on unemployment payments alone. This measure is not the sign of a caring Government and one that has so-called socialist involvement.</P>

      <P>It is an insult to the name. Socialists are caring people. It was appalling for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who should know better, to throw insults left, right and centre here this morning at Opposition Deputies. He is only covering up for his betrayal of the people he represents. The arrogance displayed by him does not surprise many Deputies. He is a great man to attack when in Opposition &mdash; he dealt it out hot and heavy to Ministers and the Taoiseach of the day in Opposition &mdash; but he cannot take valid criticism now. Such intolerance to criticism shows a horrible arrogance of someone who does not care. My party will be opposing the motion because it is not being considered in the context of overall social policy. It is a piecemeal and punitive measure. I will deal with this <Col N="491" /> matter in greater detail during my contribution tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The two Ministers representing the Department of Social Welfare today at Question Time used spun out texts written by civil servants in their replies which bore no relation to the questions tabled.

      <P>I was at a meeting in Cork the other night attended by approximately 500 women. Those women attempted during the past few months to get information regarding their entitlements arising from the McDermott case, about which the Minister is well informed. Every time questions are put to the Minister in relation to the entitlements of women under the holiday Act he gives a reply which succeeds in misleading the thousands of women who are entitled to benefit. Those women attending the meeting in Cork told of horrifying stories of deceit, misrepresentation, exploitation and blackmail by the Department of Social Welfare. People were intimidated into giving guarantees that they would not disclose details of payments they received in respect of social welfare equality payments.</P>

    <P>I will deal with this matter in greater detail during my contribution tomorrow, but I put the Minister on notice that the women of Ireland who are entitled to millions of pounds in social welfare payments <Col N="492" /> will not go away and will continue to press for their rights. In view of the Minister's response today I intend to table a Private Members' motion in relation to this matter which is affecting thousands of women in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Dublin and all urban and rural areas here.

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Allen's last point; he made a very good case in relation to that matter earlier today. The debate on this motion concerns the order under the Finance Act, 1992, to introduce taxation of unemployment benefit. Our party is not opposed to the principle of integrating the tax and social welfare systems. The Progressive Democrats believe that income from all sources should be subject to income tax on a similar basis. That is in line with our view that all income from whatever source should be treated in an identical manner. Where there is deviation in this regard certain groups of people, by virtue of where they derive their incomes, can gain an advantage over other compliant taxpayers. The taxation system of any country must be equitable. Unless taxation is fair, sections of the community will consider themselves justifiably hard hit and paying for everything while other sections get away with contributing nothing. I am not talking about those in receipt of welfare payments, but those who evade the tax net and for whom an amnesty was conveniently provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A priority for any reform of the tax and social welfare systems must be that all payments are uniformity treated. While I welcome the move to integrate the tax and social welfare systems and will support the motion, there are some questions about commitment to real tax reform that must be answered. The measure to include those on social welfare benefit in the tax net is one that must be addressed. Such a measure will do little or nothing to address the serious flaws in our tax and social welfare systems. Our party has said many times <Col N="493" /> that we need radical pro-jobs tax reform and a greater indication of commitment to such reform than was evident in the budget last week and in the Government's previous budget. More must be done than merely redefining income and ensuring equity.</P>
    <P>The tax system into which those in receipt of unemployment benefit will enter is manifestly unfair, anti-jobs and anti-enterprise. We know that work is taxed here at a rate and in a manner that is not remotely close to that in any other OECD country and is greater than any economy with a level of unemployment, economic development and population growth such as ours. Work is taxed at a rate more appropriate to luxury, but unfortunately it is a luxury in very short supply. We need pro-jobs tax reform which will reduce our tax rates further, greatly expand the lower tax band and dramatically reduce the gap between payroll expenditure, which must be met by employers, and the take home pay of workers. The Progressive Democrats believe Ireland needs a radical new programme of tax reform over a number of years during which tax, PRSI and levies will be amalgamated into a single upper rate and a standard rate of 25 per cent. That standard rate must also be extended to the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>Evidence of a real desire for tax reform or for the integration of the tax and social welfare systems cannot be proven by the motion before the House today. I remind the Minister that the taxation of unemployment benefit was first recommended by the Commission on Taxation as long ago as 1982. We have been dithering in regard to this matter for some time. At that time the taxation of incomes derived from receipt of all social welfare payments was also recommended. My argument is that we should not tax those on the lowest income level.</P>
    <P>This time last year this House debated and agreed that income from disability payments should be liable for taxation, and now we are extending the tax to unemployment benefit. This is a tax reform by default. The Minister is unfortunately <Col N="494" /> wandering around, doing bits and pieces and tinkering with the system. We need a coherent tax reform strategy designed to tackle all the inequities in our system within a reasonable period. I see no evidence of this to date and I appeal to the Minister and Minister of State to make it a priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State gave what some people described as a lecture &mdash; I have no doubt she felt she was giving very good advice which was well thought through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not doubt that. I am struck by one measure &mdash; I am in a sense pre-empting my contribution to the budget debate &mdash; that is employers' PRSI for the low paid. At first glance one would welcome the abolition of this tax. I would have no ideological difficulty with that because we want to see the reduction and abolition of tax on employment. However, I would sound a cautionary note in this regard. It is not acceptable that employers who pay employees a fair wage lose out by this measure. It may encourage the payment of lower wage rates by employers in certain sectors. We should have sympathy towards, for instance, the clothing industry, the at-risk jobs. I would ask the Minister to take on board the fact that the measure will encourage companies to eliminate fulltime employment and replace it with lower paid, part-time work. This is a genuine fear which should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the United Kingdom one-third of the jobs in the retail sector are estimated to be part-time and lower paid. There is evidence to suggest that the bulk of new jobs being created in the retail trade there are lower paid part-time jobs. It is interesting that in the United States, as shown by official Department of Labour figures, up to 95 per cent of new jobs in certain retailing sectors over a ten year period have been classified as dead-end <Col N="495" /> jobs. Let us not anticipate that result here, with the creation of dead-end, poorly rewarded, under-classed jobs, with all their inherent ills.</P>
    <P>I will not deal in this contribution with the property tax. I stated that a tax system must be equitable and fair and must be seen to be so. I have grave misgivings, as have the public, about the fairness of the property tax. However, our party will be supporting the motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points about this proposal. Now that the dust has settled on the budget and people have had an opportunity to examine its provisions in some detail, it has become very clear that it is far from the give away budget as it was described by many commentators the day after the Minister's speech. It is obvious that for any little thing Bertie gave away, he also took something back. This is very much a budget with 100 stings in the tail.</P>
      <P>This proposal to tax unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, which is proposed to be abolished by the Minister for Social Welfare under the Social Welfare Bill, is another example of the sting in the tail which will hit people on relatively low incomes. The Minister attempted to argue on the one hand that it would not hit many people on low incomes while at the same time he went on to argue that it would reduce the replacement ratio, thereby encouraging people to take up work. I intend to return to that issue because the two points are contradictory. Either the measure does not hit people on low incomes or it does not assist those who are regarded as unable or not prepared to take up work because of the replacement ratio. Both arguments cannot be made in support of the same proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure will hit people on relatively low incomes, reducing living standards and adding to the difficulties in making ends meet. It is another example of making people at the lower end of the income range cough up more while further concessions are provided for the well-off. The result of the implementation <Col N="496" /> of this order will be to take more tax from those on low and moderate incomes and to reduce the living standards of persons dependent on welfare.</P>
    <P>The decision to reduce the threshold for residential property tax has been the subject of widespread media and political criticism. The annual yield from the increased scope of the residential property tax will be about £5 million, a fact that has been so far ignored. Yet the annual yield from this order to tax the unemployed will be £30 million, six times higher than the expected yield from residential property tax. Another fundamentally unjust aspect of the budget is that while the miserable general increases in social welfare benefits will not be paid until the end of July, the provisions regarding taxation of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit will come into operation on 6 April, months before the general increases of 3 per cent will become available.</P>
    <P>The principal of treating welfare payments as taxable income could only be acceptable in the context of a full integration of the tax and social welfare systems and a substantial increase in both the basic level of welfare payments and the exemption limits for tax and PRSI payments. I suggest, as I have in the document produced by Democratic Left which argues for an end to the poverty and unemployment traps, that no tax or levies be applied below the exemption limits. In the case of the new exemption limit for PRSI of £9,000, if your income is £9,000 or less you do not pay PRSI but if your income is £9,001 you pay PRSI on all the money. That is what creates the poverty and unemployment traps. In the absence of such reform this measure is a further penalisation of those on low incomes and must be resisted.</P>
    <P>This order is part of a process started by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992 &mdash; I presume that is why Deputy Keogh took very little of her time to argue the issue &mdash; and it has been adopted with great enthusiasm by the Labour Party. The power to tax social welfare benefits was included in the Finance Act, 1992, and was at that <Col N="497" /> time opposed by the Labour Party. Last year the first steps were taken in implementing the taxation of disability benefit and now it is being extended to unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit. Not only did the Labour Party oppose the section of that Finance Act dealing with this aspect, but they voted for an amendment put forward by my party which would have allowed for the continued exemption of social welfare payments. Speaking in the debate on 19 May 1992, as reported in column 1903 of the Official Report, on the Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill, Deputy Quinn stated:</P>
    <P>The principle of persons earning income or getting income from any source and then paying tax on it is not one with which the Labour Party would disagree. With the present low threshold of income tax allowances, and bearing in mind the tax rebate as a result of redundancy or illness in one year, and in one year only, the Minister is being unnecessarily harsh and uncharacteristically cruel if that is all he is going after. There are other ways of collecting revenue, as the Minister has shown.</P>
    <P>The question has to be asked: what has changed to transform a measure described by Labour in 1992 as harsh and cruel into something now quite acceptable? There has been no significant increase in the tax threshold. There has been no significant increase in the level of general social welfare payments. Indeed, the National Economic and Social Forum presented a report to the Government the day before the budget was read into the record of this House in which it expressed dismay that something like only four social welfare payments had reached the minimum income level that the Commission on Social Welfare believed was necessary in 1985-86. It seems that the only thing that has changed to justify this dramatic U-turn is that the Labour Party was then in Oppossition and it is now comfortably in Government, that it was then professing an interest in the welfare of those on low <Col N="498" /> income and that it now regards these as soft targets.</P>
    <P>This order to impose taxation on social welfare payments which were formerly tax free is, in effect, another social welfare cut. It is a further extension of the process of social welfare cutbacks introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, in 1992 and subsequently dubbed &ldquo;the dirty dozen&rdquo; by the Labour Party. We warned at the time that what we were witnessing was the beginning of the end of the insurance based system of social welfare. Over the years the additional pay-related benefits which people paid for through their PRSI contributions have been whittled away. The benefits have been systematically reduced, but there has been no corresponding reduction in the level of PRSI. This budget represents the final nail in the coffin of the insurance based benefits system.</P>
    <P>If this order is passed it will mean that a further £30 million will be taken out of the pockets and purses of those on low incomes. There is no justification for that, especially when &mdash; as the then Deputy Quinn noted in 1992 &mdash; there are so many other ways of raising revenue. The treatment of those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs or to be ill is in stark contrast with the generous concessions granted to businesses and commercial interests in the budget. If the Minister needed to raise another £30 million to balance his books, why did he not look at a tax on land rezoning profits? In Dublin we have seen an orgy of rezoning which has led to profits of hundreds of millions of pounds for the speculators, a factor which feeds into the price of houses in the Dublin area. A relatively low level of rezoning tax on this activity would bring in the £30 million the Government is looking for in the measure before us today.</P>
    <P>Again, huge multi-million pound profits have been made from the obscene currency speculation which preceded the devaluation of the Irish pound last year. At that time the Governor of the Central Bank called for an anti-speculation tax and both the Minister for Finance and <Col N="499" /> the Taoiseach promised action to prevent further anti-social speculation of this type. However, no action was taken. Clearly, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government regards the unemployed and the sick as a softer target and an easier source of tax than either land or currency speculators.</P>
    <P>Compare the treatment of those from whom this extra £30 million will be extracted with the tax treatment of farmers. The annual total tax take from the unemployed and sick will now be the equivalent of the total tax take from the entire farming sector. The yield from tax on disability benefit and unemployment benefit will approach £50 million in a full year; yet the total tax take from farmers in 1991 amounted to just £36 million and to just £48 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who will now have to pay tax on their unemployment and pay-related benefit previously had to pay tax at a rate of 48 per cent on their wages. The tax take from farmers has been little more than a joke; yet farmers received further generous concessions in the budget. Between 1989 and 1992 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £3,122 to an average of £3,622. This represents an increase of £540 or 17 per cent, more than twice the rate at which wages and salaries increased during the same period. At the same time the average tax paid by farmers fell by £72 or 9.3 per cent, and the average tax paid by farmers is less than one-fifth of that paid by PAYE workers. Any Government with even a token commitment to the principle of tax equity should be seeking to extract a fairer contribution from farmers rather than tightening the financial noose on already heavily taxed PAYE workers who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs or become sick.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the Commission on Social Welfare as the justification for introducing this tax. The Commission on Social Welfare recommends that social welfare benefits should be taxed, but it does so in the context of a range of other reforms of the social welfare system, not least of which is <Col N="500" /> increasing social welfare payments to what they defined as a &ldquo;minimum adequate income&rdquo;. The fact is that most of the social welfare benefits and allowances are up to £12-£15 below that minimum adequate income which the Commission on Social Welfare recommended in 1986. If the Minister for Finance &mdash; I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will advise him on where to find a copy &mdash; reads chapter 9 of the report he will see what the commission had to say on the issue of a basic income, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The most important issue dealt with is the specification of a minimally adequate income. Social welfare payment should be set at a level that ensures a minimally adequate standard of living relative to incomes and living standards in society generally. While some social welfare recipients have additional sources of income, e.g. occupational pensions, or are living in households with additional sources of income, we believe that in establishing an adequate minimum income and an adequate basic level for social welfare payments, our primary concern should be to ensure that social welfare payments offer an adequate standard of living to social welfare recipients whatever their household circumstances and independent of any other income sources accruing to individuals or households.</P>
    <P>That was the objective which the Commission on Social Welfare proposed should be sought by the Government. We now have the extraordinary position where a Government, which has within it the largest number of Labour Party Deputies ever seen in this State, is proposing to reduce the level of people's income by taxing their unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that there was a contradiction between what the Minister for Finance said about the effects of this tax on those who will become unemployed, arguing that it would affect only those on high incomes, and his statement that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The change now being made should ensure that persons are not better off because portion of their annual income arises from unemployment benefit than they would if the same overall income arose from being employed. It will help to reduce the replacement ratio of those affected and make it more attractive for them to remain in or take up employment.</P>
    <P>That argument implies, although it does not say so explicitly, that the people who will be hit by this tax are in low paid jobs, otherwise the replacement ratio issue does not arise. The replacement ratio is a formula worked out by social scientists and economists to try to identify the difference between what a person would have to earn to be at the same level of income or standard of living as they would on social welfare. The Minister's argument fundamentally contradicts the point with regard to this tax not affecting people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, is right in saying that most unemployed people would prefer a job to getting better welfare benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they would, there is no doubt about that but it is not their choice. If the Government is serious about that, it could take on board the proposal to which it agreed when it negotiated the last <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement when it indicated it would examine the question of a statutory minimum wage. There is no doubt that the poverty and unemployment traps in which people on social welfare are caught are due to the deplorably low wages on offer, particularly to those who are unskilled.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, interestingly, also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of concern expressed over recent years about unemployment and poverty traps &mdash; [and quite rightly so] &mdash; Some of this concern has focused on hypothetical examples of which there were few, if <Col N="502" /> any, to be found in the real world but we all recognise there have been areas of real problems.</P>
    <P>She says it is hypothetical and that no real problems have been found yet it is something which the Minister for Finance says the taxing of unemployment benefit will solve. Therefore, we have a problem which the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, says does not exist because it is hypothetical while the Minister for Finance justifies the taxation of unemployment benefit to solve this hypothetical unemployment trap. These are the type of dubious arguments put forward in relation to taxing unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the proper integration of the tax and welfare systems, combined with raising welfare payments and tax thresholds to at least the minimum income levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, must be put in place before welfare payments can be treated as taxable income. There is no other way of doing it equitably. The Government made a commitment to examine the possibility of integrating the tax and welfare systems but progress has been painfully slow. The Interim Report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems, launched recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, was welcome in so far as it clearly identified some of the more glaring poverty and unemployment traps. Perhaps the Minister of State should show it to her colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, so that she will appreciate that poverty and unemployment traps are not hypothetical.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the fact that this was an interim report its recommendations were cautious and limited. It contains a number of useful suggestions but what is needed is a far more radical approach along the lines advocated in the Democratic Left's document, &ldquo;Ending the Poverty Trap&rdquo;, published last month. The experience in the past year has shown that the <i>ad hoc</i> approach to reform does not work and that only a phased but comprehensive approach will end poverty <Col N="503" /> and unemployment traps and provide a living income for all persons, whether in employment or dependent on welfare.</P>
    <P>In our document we set out an integrated approach which would significantly increase welfare levels, pitch social welfare rates and the exemption levels for tax at around the same point, abolish the PRSI ceiling while exempting the first £4,000 from PRSI and other levies, and integrate existing tax and social welfare child support schemes into one enhanced and comprehensive child benefit.</P>
    <P>In its final report, whenever it appears, the working group should bite the bullet and accept the need for this integrated, comprehensive approach. Until that is done and until the Government acts in this radical way, the Democratic Left will continue to oppose piecemeal measures such as this which clearly further disadvantage those in need.</P>

      <P>Long term payments, such as old age contributory and retirement and widows pensions, always have been reckonable for tax purposes. The treatment of these benefits as income for tax purposes is intended to bring them into line with other taxable income so that all income which exceeds the tax threshold will be liable to income tax. This means that people in similar circumstances, with similar amounts of income, whether derived from employment or social welfare benefits, will be treated in the same way for tax purposes. The move is a further step in the Government's commitment to closer integration of both these codes. There is no tax liability for social welfare income alone. The move does not mean that each recipient of unemployment benefit will pay tax on their benefit. The extent to which a tax liability will arise for people will depend largely on the amount of other income which the person or the person's spouse <Col N="508" /> has in the tax year. The potential liability to tax for people will be looked at in the context of total income, including income from employment, in the tax year. The exemption limits, which have been increased in this year's budget, will generally ensure that there is no tax to pay where there is no income additional to the unemployment or pay-related benefit payments. The proposed exemption limits for the 1994-95 tax year ensure that people whose sole income derives from unemployment benefit will not incur a tax liability in respect of this benefit. This is despite the fact that I have provided for a substantial increase &mdash; 10 per cent overall &mdash; in the personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of a single person the personal rate of benefit will amount to £3,172 per annum while the corresponding tax exemption limit will be £3,600. The benefit for a person with an adult dependant will be £5,075 and the exemption limit will be £7,200. The corresponding amounts for a person with a family of three children will be £6,822 and the exemption limit will be £8,750. Therefore, it is quite clear that taxation will not affect people who are dependent on their social welfare benefits alone.</P>
      <P>The proposed arrangements for the tax treatment of these benefits were outlined earlier by the Minister for Finance. My Department will continue to pay unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit without deduction of income tax, to all recipients of unemployment benefit, some 70,000 people. The Revenue commissioners will take account of these payments when determining claims to refunds of tax following unemployment, when employment is resumed, or when reviewing the tax affairs of recipients or their spouses. Recipients of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit will be obliged to declare such income on their tax returns or when establishing contact with their tax office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This move was recommended by various expert groups who have studied our tax and social welfare systems over the years. The change in the tax treatment of <Col N="509" /> unemployment and pay-related benefits has been recommended by among others, the Commission on Taxation, the Industrial Policy Review Group, better known as Culliton, the Commission on Social Welfare and the National Economic and Social Council. I would like to briefly outline to the House what these bodies recommended in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation stated:</P>
    <P>The exemption of short term social welfare benefits from income tax is contrary to equity principles, which dictate that the amount of income rather than its source should determine the amount of tax which is payable...</P>
    <P>They recommended:</P>
    <P>That those on social welfare benefits which are at present not charged to tax be brought within the tax net.</P>
    <P>A similar view was expressed by the Commission on Social Welfare, who stated:</P>
    <P>Short-term benefits should be treated as part of total annual income and should, therefore, be charged to income tax where such liability arises. This would remove the so-called incentives to absenteeism created by the current exemption of these benefits from tax but would, more importantly, deal equitably between people in similiar financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash;Culliton &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>The fact that certain low or middle income married workers with children would be as well off drawing unemployment and other social benefits is another demoralising and inequitable feature of the existing system.</P>
    <P>In this context the measure will minimise the effects of a practice which occurs in some sectors whereby it may be attractive for a worker to reduce his working week or cease working altogether for short spells in the latter part of each tax year because the benefits and tax rebates he would receive would exceed the net <Col N="510" /> income which could be received while working for that period.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council, in its paper entitled <i>Income Tax and Welfare Reforms</i>, stated:</P>
    <P>In support of the proposal (to tax short term benefits) it can be argued that it would remove a horizontal inequity: the exemption of short term social welfare payments from tax when persons on similar incomes from other sources have to pay tax.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear therefore that this is the direction in which we must move in the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, in the removal of disincentives and anomalies and in freeing up the systems so that the allocations and resources we wish to provide for people in need of them can be provided directly to them.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that last week I gave details of a substantial package of measures arising from the budget and costing some £157 million extra in a full year. These included special increases of up to 10 per cent in the personal rates of unemployment benefit and disability benefit. In addition, the budget reduced the overall take from income tax by almost £220 million in 1994 and by £333 million in a full year. This was done by the abolition of the temporary 1 per cent income levy, by very significantly increasing the standard rate bands and increasing personal allowances to reduce the burden of taxation on low and middle income earners. That is the specific objective of this Government: to use available resources to reduce the burden of taxation. That should and will apply to all people equally from whatever source their income arises.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House last week, the savings arising from the phasing out of pay-related benefit from July next will be devoted in full to providing the special increase in the personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit. At present only 45 per cent of all recipients of unemployment benefit qualify for the pay-related supplement. In addition to the full use of the pay-related benefit <Col N="511" /> savings, an extra £2.7 million is being provided to give the special 10 per cent increase to everyone on unemployment and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In relation to pay-related benefit not only have we put the total amount from pay-related benefit back into unemployment and disability benefits to build up the basic rates &mdash; as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; we are putting in an additional £2.7 million to bring it up to the 10 per cent special increase and everybody on disability or unemployment benefit will gain from that.</P>
    <P>Personal rates of disability benefit and unemployment benefit are being increased from £55.60 to £61 a week, an increase of £5.40 a week. The new rate for a married recipient with an adult dependant and three children will be £137.20 a week &mdash; an increase of £7.70 a week.</P>
    <P>The increases in the budget provide for real and substantial improvement in the position of those who depend on social welfare payments. I trust that once the tax and social welfare systems have been integrated in the way outlined today it will be easier for me, or any future Minister for Social Welfare, to get the level of increases we require at budget time for those who depend on social welfare. Clearly those who depend on social welfare will not be affected by these changes but where there is additional income over and above social welfare payments they will rightly come into the tax net and will be assessed on their total income.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to comment on a point made by Deputy Allen earlier in the debate. The record of the House will show that I did not use the term &ldquo;perk&rdquo; but instead used the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;perk&rdquo; was <Col N="512" /> in the speaking notes supplied by my Department but I corrected it in the official version and I did not use the word in the course of my speech to the House. Yesterday my office was in contact with Deputy Currie who first raised the matter and he was informed of the situation and invited to check with the records of the House and with the Ceann Comhairle's office. Ungraciously, he did not do so. I advise Deputy Allen to check the record and he will then see that the word I used was allowance.</P>
      <P>The integration of tax and social welfare has been a cherished ambition of public policy in Ireland for a number of years. As the Minister with responsibility for overseeing the integration of tax and social welfare I could bring to the attention of Deputies any number of reports which set out the basis on which such an integration can take place. The issue was examined by both the Commission on Taxation and the Commission on Social Welfare. In addition consideration was given to the matter by the Industrial Review Group, commonly known as the Culliton group and by the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
      <P>There was fundamental agreement by all the bodies on the basic principles involved in the issue, that is that the exemption of short term social welfare benefits from income tax was contrary to the principle of equity. Even Democratic Left in their recent policy document issued in January of this year, supports the principle of the taxation of all sources of income. That was stated no less than three times in the course of that party's document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the basic premises of integration of tax and social welfare is that all sources of income should be subject to taxation, and all sources of income obviously include social welfare payments. Deputies will be aware, of course, that a number of social welfare payments are already subject to taxation and have been for a long time, for example, old age, widow's and invalidity pensions. A number of social welfare payments up to now were exempt from taxation. We are bringing short term social welfare payments, <Col N="513" /> in this instance unemployment benefit, into the tax net in the context of major improvements in both tax free allowances and bands.</P>
    <P>Let me state unequivocally that an unemployed person whose only income is unemployment benefit will not have to pay any tax. Furthermore tax will not impact unfairly on the worst off sections of society. As indicated earlier by the Minister it has been demonstrated by the ESRI in its paper entitled, Income Tax and Welfare Reforms, published in 1991, that taxation of short term social welfare benefits would not impact unfairly on those with low incomes. The study found that most of the benefit from the non-taxation of these benefits, including unemployment benefit, went to those on higher incomes. In particular, it found that the majority, 70 per cent of people and households affected by taxation of short term social welfare benefits are in the upper half of the income distribution range and that in removing the exemption less than 10 per cent of those affected would be in the lower income ranges.</P>
    <P>Those figures are based on a study undertaken in 1987. The increases in the tax exemption limits since then, the introduction of substantial child additions to them should mean, in effect, that the effect on lower income groups will be even less at this stage. Therefore, there will be many unemployed people who will not be affected by this measure because their incomes fall below the appropriate tax exemption limits.</P>
    <P>If we are honest, Deputies will recognise that this is an essential component of reform. However, what we have had in the aftermath of last week's budget is a series of scaremongering exercises on its reform elements. The Deputies, whether from Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats or Democratic Left, who have called time and again for fundamental reform of our tax system have run away from the logical consequences of that reform. While it may be political point scoring, the effect is also to produce political gridlock. Democratic Left indicated it was prepared to enter into a coalition with Fine Gael and I put it to <Col N="514" /> that party that in the event of it entering Government it will reverse all of these reforms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, in an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year when commenting on his ideas for cuts in Government spending &mdash; Fine Gael held up a number of documents this morning and let me hold up this extract from <i>The Irish Times</i> which makes interesting reading and I will make a copy of it available to the Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I listened to Deputy Yates characterise the budget as a tax and spend budget.

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>How, then, can we proceed with a degree of honesty in the debate? We will continue to face an intellectual logjam on the issue of reform. The first report of the National Economic and Social Forum was agreed, less than two months ago, by all the participants and then included representatives of Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats. Its first report called for &ldquo;sweeping tax reforms&rdquo; and stated that this would involve painful adjustments. Why are those Deputies who put their names to that report saying something entirely different now?</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a number of other important changes to these short term benefits. The Government has provided that all short term payments are to be increased to the level of the priority rates, set by the Commission on Social Welfare, and that there should be a reallocation of the overall resources provided with the social insurance system for short term illness and unemployment. A general increase of 3 per cent is being provided to all social welfare recipients with effect from July next. This will ensure that the purchasing power of social welfare payments will be more than maintained throughout the whole year. In addition to this general increase, a further increase of 3 per cent, £1.60, is being added to all short term weekly payments to bring them up to the priority rates level set by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short term benefits include unemployment benefit, disability benefit, short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance <Col N="517" /> and unemployability supplement. Some 185,000 recipients will benefit from this special increase. From July next, all social welfare payments will have reached the priority level recommended by the Commission and will be at a level equivalent to at least 90 per cent of its recommended main rate of £65.40 per week. The cost of the special increase amounts to more than £15 million in a full year and almost £7 million this year.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided to restructure the benefits payable under the social insurance system in respect of short term illness and unemployment. In relation to unemployment benefit and disability benefit the total increase will be 10 per cent. This increased level will bring the basic rate into line with the basic rate for long term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Reform of the system is a more appropriate means of cushioning people against sudden reduction in income as a result of unemployment. The present payments structure takes account of adult and child dependants. This helps to cushion the impact of a sudden reduction in income for those with families. In the case of unemployment, many employees are entitled to redundancy payments which can also lessen the impact of losing one's job. At present some 45 per cent &mdash; 33,000 &mdash; of unemployment benefit recipients qualify, the vast majority of whom receive less than the maximum amount payable. It is intended that some 114,000 recipients will benefit from the special increase provided for in the budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn briefly to the issue of social insurance, and the Minister has already made this point. The social insurance fund which is financed by PRSI contributions from employees, employers and the self-employed is not self-financing. Any deficit between expenditure and income in any year has to be met by the Exchequer. For example, in 1993 total expenditure amounted to £1,720 million while income from PRSI contributions amounted to £1,600 million. This resulted in the Exchequer coming to the aid of contributors <Col N="518" /> to cover the shortfall of £120 million to ensure payment of all those who qualified for benefit. The social insurance system is an expression of social solidarity and citizenship in which the risks and costs are spread as widely as possible within the community. Contributions made to the fund confer a benefit entitlement on the individual contributor if and when a specific contingency arises.</P>
    <P>One of the reform questions we face is that fact that the social insurance system was designed at a time of a pattern of full-time, usually life time, employment from the age of 16 to 65. Every Deputy in the House will be aware that work patterns have changed. There has been a huge increase in part-time work, contract work and self-employment &mdash; what is sometimes called a typical employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to reform the system in such a way as to take account of the changes in employment patterns while retaining, as the bedrock principle, the collective responsibility and the collective solidarity which the social welfare system gives us.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, should have used so cynically here today the report of the National Economic and Social Forum. If that attitude is to continue to be adopted, it will only lead to the breakup of the forum. The selective usage of statements and reports, such as we had today, is not in the spirit of that forum. I am very disappointed, too, with the statements the Minister made in regard <Col N="519" /> to some of those who participated in the forum.</P>
      <P>The proposal to discontinue, with effect from April 1994, pay related benefit with unemployment benefit makes a total mockery of insurance for workers. Insurance is there to cushion the impact of becoming redundant, unemployed or ill while at work. The proposed change is a total contradiction of the meaning of insurance if one is working. It is another attack on those people who are working and it is a real attack on those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, those in short time or seasonal employment or those who become ill. I am disgusted that the Labour Party have stood over this imposition on the most vulnerable section of our community. Indeed, as Deputy De Rossa pointed out the Leader of the Labour Party criticised this move when it was mooted in the Finance Bill 1992. The support of Labour in this instance is but another of their major U-turns. So far as I can see there is nothing in the budget to indicate a reversal of the dirty dozen cuts.</P>

      <P>The taxation of unemployment benefit and disability benefit will have a devastating effect on over 75,000 people who, on average, will lose £400 per year. The Government estimates <Col N="520" /> that in a full year the measure will yield about £30 million. It has been put in place to save money, not to benefit people paying insurance or who become unemployed or sick. This money is being taken from the most vulnerable people. The average number of people on unemployment benefit in 1992 and 1993 who would be affected by this measure is 75,000. This measure will reduce their income by approximately £7.62 per week. That will erode all their benefits from other measures, like the abolition of the 1 per cent levy. They will end up as net losers irrespective of the concessions in the budget.</P>

      <P>The credibility of the pay related system has been dealt a major blow. Deputy Burton may use the research provided by her spin doctors but they are selective in their research. They should look at the Labour Party statements made a year ago so that the Minister of State does not come into the Dáil and contradict what her party said then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of PRSI contributions has been seriously eroded since the last budget. It started with the abolition of pay related benefit on disability and unemployment benefits, now there will be taxation of disability and unemployment benefits and optical and dental benefits have also been curtailed. The latest instalment is a cutback in widows' <Col N="521" /> entitlement to contributory pension. It has been argued that absenteeism from work has been due to the tax and social welfare system. Whatever argument can be made for that with regard to disability benefit it cannot be made with regard to unemployment benefit. One would need the collusion of the employer and that would be ridiculous. An employer would not deliberately make an employee redundant; it would not pay him.</P>

      <P>The effect of taxing unemployment benefit will be to cripple those on short-time work. One factory in Listowel would be closed now if it was not for this system of working for half a week while employees get unemployment benefit for the remainder. This applies to many business. This measure will close factories throughout the country. Unemployed people will generally find that they cannot get tax refunds as they have lost their jobs. On top of the trauma of being made redundant unemployed people will now face a cut in pay related benefit of up to £16.80 per week and the taxation of their basic benefit. The impact of this measure on married couples will be particularly significant. In the case of a married couple where both work and one becomes unemployed, where their combined income was below the income tax exemption threshold, the inclusion of unemployment benefit for tax purposes will now make them liable to income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who I think will be more tolerant and will not interrupt as often. When the Minister is uneasy, obviously there must be a feeling of guilt.</P>
      <P>We all respect the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who speak sensibly. It stated that the resources allocated to social welfare are disappointing. It is significant that of the total budget, £72 million was allocated to social welfare. Although there are good features in the budget and some social welfare increases are welcome, in many cases the increases will only match inflation.</P>
      <P>A major issue was the former discrimination against widowers with regard to contributory pension &mdash; which was rectified in the budget &mdash; and which the Government anticipate will cost £16 million during the year. It is interesting to note from where the £16 million will come. What the Minister giveth, the Minister taketh away. Given EU legislation it was only a matter of time before the discrimination between widows and widowers was highlighted. The Minister and the Department would have been in serious difficulty with the EU if they had persisted with the anomaly. In its comments the Conference of Major Religious Superiors referred to the inadequate amount of support documentation circulated with the budget. Its analysis is far more meaningful than all the Minister's speeches, including the speech on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has announced that the contributory widow's and widower's pension is to be means-tested. While many other benefits are means-tested this is a retrograde step. Many of us are appalled that shortly after the death of her husband a spouse loses her entitlement to free fuel. This displays a lack of sensitivity. I note, however, that <Col N="524" /> it is recognised in the budget that a widow should be allowed to continue to avail of free schemes. I welcome this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach constantly reminds us that the economy is performing well and refers us to OECD reports which describe Ireland's achievements as being significant. While the official unemployment figure is almost 300,000 the true figure is nearer 350,000. This includes more than 17,000 people in receipt of pre-retirement allowance &mdash; those aged 55 and over &mdash; 15,000 on FÁS courses and a further 20,000 on other schemes. It should also be borne in mind that many women who are not included in the live register would take up employment if they had an opportunity to do so. Therefore, one needs to be extremely cautious before one says that the economy is performing well. Much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of job creation, the number of places available on job training courses is to be dramatically increased while the social employment scheme, the CEDP and teamwork are to be streamlined under the community employment programme. Perhaps the most significant allocation that will be available to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will be that for training courses given that in the budget an extra £5 million has been allocated for the provision of advance factories around the country. To put the matter in context, will we end up, in order to avail of European Union funding, with FÁS and other agencies trying to create community enterprise projects and trying to find people to participate in them? One has to ask, will we get a return on these schemes?</P>
    <P>I am not talking about schemes on which we do not get a great return but rather about social employment schemes run by the local authorities. As we are aware, because of the lack of funding, most social employment schemes lead to significant improvements to footpaths and so on in towns and villages. I appreciate that these schemes will have a different title in the future but I hope to see a dramatic expansion in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister followed up one suggestion by the Conference of <Col N="525" /> Major Religious Superiors. He proposes to introduce a pilot training programme under which 100 places will be available for unemployed people who will be given meaningful jobs for which they will receive extra money. I have often said in council chambers that there is a great need, where problems exist, to create meaningful jobs within the local authorities. While there has been an increase in the number of places available on training courses the number of outdoor workers employed by local authorities has declined dramatically. We are all aware of the problems being experienced in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the free fuel allowance. During the week on Limerick radio I took part in a phone-in with Deputy Kemmy during which one woman asked if we knew the price of a bag of coal. The point she was trying to make was that the allowance had remained at £5 for many years. Fortunately for me, Deputy Kemmy answered first and mentioned a figure of £7 but the woman replied immediately that it was £8. It has never ceased to amaze me that the allowance has not been increased and has remained at £5 for many years. I would like to see this matter addressed.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the programmes I mentioned earlier. While travellers, ex-prisoners, the long term unemployed, lone parents and those in receipt of disability benefit can avail of these schemes &mdash; as I said, 40,000 places will be available on these training courses during 1994-95 &mdash; widows and widowers cannot. This amounts to discrimination. This matter should be addressed also.</P>
    <P>The old age non-contributory pension is means-tested. In this regard it is not fully appreciated that there is a special section in the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo which deals with the question of over-payments. Before an estate is administered that section writes to the solicitor to discover if information was withheld when the original application was made for an old age non-contributory pension. Sometimes a husband does not tell his wife everything. In this regard, I <Col N="526" /> am aware of a recent case where out of the blue a poor woman received a bill for £1,200. She was mystified by this but seemingly when her late husband applied originally for an old age non-contributory pension he withdrew money from his bank account and lodged it again once he received the pension. She only discovered this when the will was being administered. While it was true to say that he did not reveal this information when he applied for the old age non-contributory pension it was also true to say that he did not tell his wife what he was doing at the time. She was extremely upset when she discovered this. When I discussed the matter with the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo, it was prepared to modify the figure to £1,000. The point I am trying to make is that one must offer a sympathetic ear in such cases given that a husband may not necessarily tell his spouse what he is doing. Officials should show sensitivity when this happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When I entered the Chamber, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, was defending the use of the word &ldquo;perks&rdquo; in her script. I do not know whether it is a sign of the times &mdash; this is the most high spending Government we have ever had in terms of the number of advisers and script writers available to it &mdash; that somebody should use that word in a script. The Minister of State either reads a script like a newsreader on the 9 o'clock news or else she and the Minister have no influence. Anybody who would use the word &ldquo;perk&rdquo; to describe widow's allowance does not deserve to be in charge of social welfare or even to be dealing with it because they are out of touch. The Minister was able to produce a photostat copy that she did not have to obtain herself because there are so many people there to get it for her. At least the Opposition have to go to the bother of doing this themselves, it takes much work and one must have a good memory to know where to look for things. On the Government side all this stuff is handed out and Government spokesmen produce it as if they were whiz <Col N="527" /> kids. Maybe it is a sign of the times that people who are elected to the Dáil find themselves appointed Ministers on the first day. Perhaps that practice should end because there is nothing like the old dog for the hard road and people who have come up the hard way understand what life is all about.</P>
      <P>When Minister Burton was criticising the Opposition she used the phrase &ldquo;if they were honest&rdquo;. I find it difficult to listen to any Minister from the Labour Party talking about honesty. I do not intend to get into an argument about whether or not Fianna Fáil were telling lies &mdash; that is another kettle of fish altogether. However, for the Labour Party to put an advertisement in the paper saying that they had no intention of introducing property tax, charges etc. and do what they have done and then expect us to listen to a Labour Minister of State talking about honesty is stretching things a bit. The sooner they forget about discussing honesty the better for all of us, because nobody had done a greater somersault than the Labour Party, even though their leader can come into the Dáil and be hurt at things that are said to him. I remember quite well the way he folded his arms when in Opposition and savaged the then Taoiseach, and had no worries about doing it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tone is set in regard to the treatment of widows by the mere fact that anyone associated with the Department of Social Welfare would use the word &ldquo;perks&rdquo; to describe their allowances. If we cannot look after widows in this Christian country with some degree of decency and generosity we do not deserve to describe ourselves as Christians. Widows have enough to suffer from the loss of their partner and the added responsibilities thrown on them to act as father and mother. A Government which considers that widows' allowances should be means tested lacks any feeling or sympathy for widows, who should be getting above the odds if at all possible. I find it appalling that a means test would be devised for someone who is entitled to a certain rate of pension. It cannot <Col N="528" /> be justified if we deserve to be called Christians. We should be doing everything possible to make life easier for widows, who have a double role to play and often have to deal with difficult situations. Here we are deciding that they are living in luxury and even describing some of their allowances as perks.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure what is going on in this Government. Perhaps there are too many people giving advice. I note the Tánaiste said that the treatment of unemployment benefit as income for tax purposes is accompanied by significant increases in both unemployment and disability benefit. It is said &ldquo;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away&rdquo;. In this case the left hand giveth and the right hand taketh away. The Minister is giving an increase, but he is taxing it. I do not know if this is just a way to get one Department to contact another. The net benefit is of very little advantage to those getting it. We should give an increase and leave it at that instead of what we are doing now, giving an increase and taxing it, thereby taking back what we are giving.</P>
    <P>I am completely mystified by the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald. She said that a great deal of concern had been expressed in recent years about poverty traps and that some of his concern had focused on hypothetical examples, of which there were few if any to be found in the real world. She said that we all recognise there have been real problems areas and that the most significant problem had been the unemployment trap, whereby someone out of work with limited earning power would be little or no better off on taking up a job. She said there is little evidence that this factor influences the level of unemployment but that it had an important bearing on the composition of unemployment, in particular, in putting parents of families at higher risk of being out of work.</P>
    <P>Someone was paid to write that script and the Minister was paid to read it, but it takes much reading to make any sense out of it. I think what she is saying is that there is no poverty trap in existence in reality but only in theory. As someone <Col N="529" /> who came up the hard way, I can tell her that when I asked to get details of a job for a person who was unemployed and supplied those details, the person rang me to say he could not take the job as he calculated that he would need £250 a week to justify leaving the unemployment sector, taking into account what his medical card etc. were worth to him. There is many a good person working for £150 and paying tax on it. This poverty trap obviously exists, although Deputy Fitzgerald does not seem to understand it, but then she also found herself appointed a Minister on the first day in the Dáil. Maybe it proves the new theory I have come up with that newly elected Deputies should be debarred from becoming Ministers because they often do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste gives increases in unemployment benefit but at the same time taxes them. Poverty traps appear to Deputy Fitzgerald to exist only in theory, when I and everybody else knows they exist in practice. The reference to widow's allowances as perks &mdash; the Minister disclaims she used it but it was in the script because I saw it myself &mdash; suggests a lack of feeling for those who need our support. All this &mdash; and the fact that a Minister of State would talk to us about honesty when the assurances of costly advertisements have been contradicted &mdash; leaves me worried that, despite its huge majority, this Government is not doing a good job for the country. People who should be getting benefits and who should have a future are being fobbed off because there was a few pounds to spend from the amnesty. People were given £5 million here, £10 million there and finished up appearing to have something this year. What the Minister for Finance will do next year I do not know, because he will have that money. What the unemployed will do next year I do not know either, because there seems to be no Government policy. It is unfortunate that when there was an opportunity to do something positive, the Government missed the boat.</P>

      <P>Aside from what I said at the outset about equity &mdash; I am not particularly picking up what Deputy Browne said &mdash; it is extraordinary that we will not accept that people who get their incomes from different sources should be taxed in the same way.</P>
      <P>I have listened to all the arguments about equity in the past few days, but we spend a fortune commissioning expensive reports and getting the best brains in the country to compile them. Successive Governments have launched such reports in Dublin Castle. Members claim that the provisions of such reports should be implemented, in my 16 years in this House, I have not met many people who had the guts to do anything except talk but when a Minister proposes a measure the Opposition oppose it. In future when commissioning reports we should do what Brendan Behan proposed. When the Cabinet decide to implement a measure, there should be two choices, one for those who support it and another for those who oppose it and then Members can carry on with the same old waffle here. Members should be either for or against tax reform. Two sides of the fence do not seem to be enough for many Members of this House, but politicians should be able to take the heat.</P>

I have been involved in many <Col N="531" /> arguments about taxation on income from capital and other investment. All income must be taxable in an equitable manner and if we are not prepared to do that we should propose an income tax level of 15 per cent for Ministers and TDs and a level of 27 per cent and 48 per cent for others.</P>

      <P>We have done so in the budget by giving back £155 million in a year when inflation is at 1.5 per cent. The overall budget and Exchequer borrowing requirement strategy was designed to reinforce economic confidence as it affects investment, recruitment, consumption and interest rates. The underlying emphasis on tax measures was to promote employment; that is what this Government stands for. We will promote employment by securing wage moderation through reducing the tax wedge, in other words dealing with the levies, exemptions, margin reliefs, allowances and bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not possible to include everybody in those measures. The measure in respect of marginal relief affected 111,000 people and I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his support and excellent contribution on that topic. Approximately <Col N="532" /> 42,000 people will be taken out of the 48 per cent tax band. By and large we have improved the take-home pay of most of the 900,000 people in the tax net. A small portion of the funding came from the frequently recommended and modest tax reform measures based on equity considerations, for example, the reduction of mortgage and VHI tax relief to the standard rate, the objective of reducing the tax disadvantage to employment orientated business and commercial investment opportunities relevant to housing and the residential property tax. We also encouraged the development of small businesses as a major source of employment for entrepreneurs under the business expansion scheme, changes in respect of capital gains tax, roll over reliefs, capital acquisition tax, VAT thresholds, single registration forms, single tax clearance forms and so on. All those measures were introduced to promote fairness, enterprise and employment growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>There will not be any additional burden on employers in respect of the taxation on unemployment benefit. I had the pleasure today of addressing the national council of IBEC who are very happy about the measures we have introduced to streamline the burden on employers in respect of such issues. Deputy Yates stated that 75,000 was the average number in receipt of unemployment benefit on a weekly basis. The number of claimants on an annual basis is in excess of 200,000, perhaps up to 220,000. Therefore, a weekly figure of 75,000 does not appear to be accurate.</P>
    <P>Deputies Allen and De Rossa referred to the incentive to work. The budget will substantially improve the position of the low paid, alleviate the poverty trap and increase the incentive to work. The change proposed in relation to unemployment benefit will ensure that people are much better off because a portion of their annual income will come from unemployment benefit which will help to reduce the replacement ratio of those affected and make it more attractive for them to remain in or take up employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Deputy De Rossa stated that the measures should not reduce the living standards of those whose sole income is derived from welfare payments. The income tax exemption limits will cover that group. The tax liability will apply only to income in addition to welfare payments. If one's income is derived solely from unemployment benefit, it will not be affected. The same provision applied last year in respect of disability benefit. The income of both spouses is taken into consideration, which is the case in respect of PAYE and PRSI. Taxation of social welfare payments must be equitable and all sources of income taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deenihan and De Rossa referred to the £30 million yield from the 200,000 plus claimants. Again, tax payable will depend on additional income. Deputy Deenihan referred to systematic short-time workers who are no longer able to depend on the social welfare system to maintain jobs and said that the exemption from tax is used by companies in difficulties to fund payroll costs. He also referred to the amount of tax liability arising at the 27 per cent and 48 per cent rates on unemployment benefit. That is an inevitable consequence of bringing unemployment benefit into the tax net. However, the liabilities referred to by the Deputy will arise only where there is additional income.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of systematic short-time workers who usually work for three days a week and receive unemployment benefit for the remainder of the week or work a week on for which they receive full wages, and a week off for which they receive unemployment benefit. In either case such workers do not cease employment and, <Col N="534" /> therefore, would not need to approach the tax office for a tax refund. Any refund due would be made by their employer in the course of the operation of the cumulative PAYE system. In order to deal with those cases, it is proposed that workers on systematic short-time work will have their annual tax free allowances restricted by the amount of the unemployment benefit it is anticipated they will receive during the tax year.</P>
    <P>For example, a married man entitled to an annual tax free allowance of £5,786 on systematic short-time work for the full year, week on week off, will receive £97.60 per week. He will expect to receive unemployment benefit of £2,537.60, that is, £97.60 for 26 weeks in a tax year for the weeks he is not working. His tax free allowance which will be set against his earnings will include, an annual tax free allowance of £5,786 less expected unemployment benefit of £2,537 having a net tax free allowance of £3,249 or £62 per week.</P>
    <P>The measures we are attempting to deal with to make tax reform more acceptable and equitable will give rise to difficulties. I assure Deputies that, prior to the system being taken over fully by the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners will deal with this matter in as fair and equitable a way as possible. As it is a new system we will monitor it for any difficulties that may arise and ensure the matter is dealt with appropriately. Hopefully, late next year or early the following year the system will be taken over and administered by the Department of Social Welfare. I thank the House and you, Sir, for co-operating in quickly finalising this budgetary matter.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Broadcasting Authority Legislation: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael McDowell on Tuesday, 1 February 1994:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the continuing campaign of slaughter and destruction in Northern Ireland and in view of the failure of those engaged in or supporting the campaign of violence to accept the Downing Street Declaration as a just basis for developing a political settlement, calls on the Government to make orders under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, in the same terms as applied until 19th January, 1994, on a two-monthly basis until such time as those engaged in the campaign of violence and those who are in or associated with the organisations mentioned in the orders publicly commit themselves to an immediate and permanent cessation.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, recognising the maturity of the Irish people, welcomes the Government decision not to renew the order under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993, and expresses confidence in the professionalism of Irish broadcast media journalists in carrying out their responsibilities in compliance with the terms of Article 40 of the Constitution, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, and current broadcasting legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues for sharing their time with me and I am glad to see the Minister in the House. I do not really blame the Minister for this decision. He was consistent on this matter when he was in Opposition and so far he also appears to have been consistent in Government, a rare quality in this Government. He has probably struggled with his conscience about this matter. I am not suggesting that he is similar to a Secretary of State I once knew in Northern Ireland of whom it was said he was always struggling with his conscience and the problem was it always ended up in a draw. Clearly, in this instance the Minister came to a decision which he believes is the correct one. However, I think it would be fair to say that he is starting off from a different premise to me and does not properly understand the ramifications of the decision for matters in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I blame the Government for this decision. I blame those members of the Government who have been deeply involved in Northern Ireland matters &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice. They know the score and I thought that their attitude would have been different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters one has to bear in mind when speaking about this issue. The Minister told us &ldquo;It is a basic issue of freedom of information and expression versus censorship&rdquo;. I wish that were the case; I wish it were as simple as that. If it were as simple as that, then both the Minister and I would be on the same side. However, the matter is not as simple as that; it is more important than that. The greatest civil right of all is the right to life and it is in that context that this decision must be judged. It is also in that context that the conditions which pertain in Northern Ireland today must be considered. Those conditions cannot be divorced from the appearance on television of people who support and condone violence. I do not think the Minister <Col N="539" /> is sufficiently aware of that and I hope I can make him more aware of it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have had another illustration of the partitionist mentality to which I have referred on a number of occasions since I became a Member of this House. It is clear that no consideration was given to the effect of the lifting of the ban on areas of Northern Ireland where RTE is widely watched and heard, particularly in those areas where there is a big Nationalist population &mdash; for example, Derry, mid-Ulster, Fermanagh, South Tyrone and West Belfast, where people have gone to very considerable lengths to ensure that RTE is available to them.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister of my own experience in this regard. Unionists and committed constitutional Nationalists will not be swayed by honeyed words, those whose relatives have been murdered by the IRA are outraged and the morale of IRA activists and supporters has been increased. I say that from experience. During recent elections in Northern Ireland the ban was lifted and Sinn Féin candidates were allowed to make party political broadcasts and to be heard and seen on television interviews. I know the effect that has had not only on the relatives of Protestants who have been murdered by the IRA but on the relatives of Catholics who have been murdered by the IRA. They are disgusted to see on television people who are prepared to condone and support those who were responsible for those murders. I have also seen the effect of this on the morale of those who support Sinn Féin and the IRA. The appearance of their people on television, drawing around them the cloaks of the Nationalists position, suffering, etc., has increased their morale and reinvigorated their efforts at the polls and in other activities. The appearance of these people on RTE will have the same repercussions on those areas in Northern Ireland. I say that more in sorrow than in anger. I should like the Minister to bear that point in mind.</P>
    <P>It is only two weeks since the section 31 ban was lifted. We have seen a lot <Col N="540" /> of Gerry Adams on RTE and on other stations since then. I would not be surprised to turn on my television tonight and to see him on &ldquo;A Prayer at Bedtime&rdquo; or some other similar programme &mdash; he has turned up on almost every programme in the past two weeks. Of course, it is too early to make a final judgment on the confident prediction of a number of interviewers as to what they would do when they were finally able to cross-examine Adams and other Sinn Féin leaders. So far they have not, in boxing terms, laid a glove on Adams. I should say that there has been one exception to this rule. Two hours ago Myles Dungan managed to do that on his &ldquo;Today at Five&rdquo; programme. No other interviewer has done that &mdash; they do not know the nuances and do not recognise the code words. They have allowed Adams to draw around him the mantle of defender of the Catholic population, escaping from a &ldquo;war zone&rdquo; which he has helped to create in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Only last night on &ldquo;Tuesday File&rdquo; a Sinn Féin councillor was allowed to portray the IRA as the people's army. He was not asked to condemn IRA atrocities. He might express his regret or abhorrence but he will not condemn them. Of course, under instructions from the Ard Fheis and the IRA Army Council, they are not allowed to use the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;. We should always note that: they will use every word except &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;. However, journalists do not understand this. Neither he nor any other elected representative interviewed was asked why he was pledged to give unambivalent support to the IRA. Despite the great contribution it has made, I wonder what will happen when these people are being interviewed on local radio. As the Minister has acknowledged, that has already been a publicity stunt by one broadcaster. I am sure the same will happen again.</P>
    <P>Since the Downing Street Declaration Sinn Féin has achieved two of its long sought objectives &mdash; it has been allowed on the national airwaves and Gerry Adams has been admitted to the United States. There has been no cessation of <Col N="541" /> violence or even a ceasefire. There has been nothing in exchange; there has been no <i>quid pro quo.</i> In their media appearances members of Sinn Féin have attempted to project the image of a normal political party which is separate from the IRA, taking its own political decisions and dodging the central question with the response &ldquo;that is a matter for the IRA&rdquo;. Of course, the truth has been well documented over the years. The IRA is the dominant partner and Sinn Féin is subservient in every respect; it is tied into the IRA structures in terms of organisation and personnel and has no independent existence.</P>
    <P>In three weeks' time Sinn Féin will hold its Ard-Fheis in this jurisdiction. Will the Ard-Fheis receive a report from the IRA Army Council? Will it end the requirement that all candidates for public office must pledge unambivalent support for the IRA? Will it allow Sinn Féin representatives to condemn IRA atrocities of which they disapprove? The answers to these questions will give some indication of whether there is even the slightest effort on the part of Sinn Féin to create a separate identity and some basis upon which to make a judgment of its professed desire to bring about a cessation of violence. The Ard Fheis will allow a basis for judgment on whether the calls for consultation and clarification have been serious or whether they have been a cynical exploitation of the yearning for peace. I should also give an answer to those who, despite the continuation of the IRA campaign, have supported the lifting of the section 31 ban.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the lifting of the ban under section 31 following a permanent cessation of violence by the IRA would have been a powerful symbol of the entry of Sinn Féin into constitutional politics. Along with Sinn Féin participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation it would have ushered in a new era of hope and confidence. Unfortunately, as the violence continues and as Sinn Féin-IRA use the airwaves for propaganda, the symbol has been thrown away and unfortunately the hope is, day by day, diminishing.</P>

      <P>I would like to take issue with Deputy Currie on a number of points, in particular his reference to a Sinn Féin councillor being allowed to take over the airwaves on a programme last night. Having seen that programme it appears to me that the Deputy is saying he is of superior intellect to the people of this country, that they are not also able to make up their minds about the content of what was being transmitted over the airwaves last night. We are not of superior intellect and that is why we are removing the ban under this section.</P>
      <P>I regret that the time of this House has been taken up by a clearly negative motion from the Progressive Democrats when more positive thinking should be the order of the day. I would have welcomed a motion designed to encourage the Taoiseach and the Government in the great crusade for peace. The public is well aware that since the publication of th Downing Street Joint Declaration the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have been untiring in their efforts, on a daily basis, to turn the hopes of that document into reality. Instead of seeking to turn the clock back, the Progressive Democrats would have been better advised to afford Deputies an opportunity to add to the collective wisdom of the whole peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Government decided against the renewal of the ban under section 31, many alarm bells were sounded. We were led to believe that the airwaves would be bombarded by evil people who would use their devilish skills to convince us that terrorism was the answer to all their prayers. I represent a Border constituency that has been all too close to the murder and destruction of the past 25 years. Shortly after the dropping of the ban under section 31, Highland Radio in County Donegal broadcast a detailed and probing interview with Martin McGuinness and Pat <Col N="543" /> Doherty of Sinn Féin. The programme was repeated later that day, as have quite a number of programmes since, and I am happy to inform the House that there is no evidence of an immediate stampede of Donegal people into the ranks of the paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>I did not have the opportunity of watching Gerry Adams being interviewed by the redoubtable Brian Farrell on Sunday last. However, I am reliably informed that Mr. Adams gained very few friends by the manner in which he responded or failed to respond to some of the questions. Faced with a professional broadcaster he has shown himself to be just as vulnerable as most of us in this House &mdash; so much for the fears expressed in those quarters.</P>
    <P>I listened to the arguments in favour of this motion and have yet to be convinced that the Government's decision was wrong. I do not think I can be accused of jumping onto any popular bandwagon. On the night before the Taoiseach became leader of my party, I urged him strongly to seriously consider the removal of the ban under section 31. Later, in November 1993, with my colleague, Deputy Michael Kitt, I tabled a motion for discussion at a meeting of our Parliamentary Party. That discussion convinced me that it was proper to remove the ban under section 31. However, the Minister agrees with this&mdash; if it should be proved in future that my faith in the integrity of broadcasters and the good sense of the listening public has been misplaced, I trust that with my colleagues on this side of the House we would have the grace to acknowledge our mistake. In this regard I am reminded of the late Séan Lemass, a great believer in the maxim that a man who never made a mistake never made anything. Future events will prove that the removal of the ban under section 31 was no mistake. I ask the House to reject the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In my years in the Oireachtas, we have not had much debate on the broadcasting legislation of 1976 or, indeed, the order under section <Col N="544" /> 31. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It was always assumed that the order would be renewed each January, usually when the Dáil was in recess, and for that reason I congratulate the Minister on the action he has recommended to the Government and the action the Government has taken. I particularly compliment him on his belief that the potential abuse of freedom is no excuse for repression. I warmly applaud that view because we are all aware that freedom of expression and freedom of speech are easy to concede to those who hold uncontroversial views but the real test comes in the case of those who hold more contentious views. It is not simply a question of the Government allowing the section 31 order to lapse; the RTE Authority must abide by the provisions of sections 17 and 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 as amended by the 1976 Act. Section 9 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 also contains certain prohibitions on independent radio stations under the auspices of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
      <P>We need a proper balance between freedom of speech and the right to information on the one hand, and the need to prevent the airwaves from being abused for subversive purposes. I have confidence in our broadcasters to do this. I am confident they will do the job legitimately expected of radio and television in our democracy. For example, it is possible for broadcasters to ensure that certain types of material do not appear on radio or television. Interviews can be and very often are recorded, especially for news and current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>Journalists and broadcasters have spoken of how the section 31 order distorts day-to-day news coverage. In the normal course of events politicians from all sides could be brought together round a table for interview. However, under section 31, a listed organisation issues a press statement, the statement is read out but the listed organisation is not challenged or questioned. This results in publicity for the organisation and for the statement with no accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> The question of publicity also arises during election campaigns. Under section 31, for example, a Sinn Féin candidate cannot be interviewed but usually a photograph of the candidate is shown on television with information on the candidate and his or her policies. This is simply publicity and free advertising for candidates from proscribed organisations.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has allowed the order under this section to lapse. Much of the debate over the past two days has been principally about Sinn Féin, the Provisional IRA and Northern Ireland but it should be about much more because the decision not to renew the order under section 31 should open up the whole debate about the North and the future of the people on this island. The right to freedom of information far outweighs the urge to censor. In the words of Justice Louis Brandais: &ldquo;Only an emergency can justify repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 of the 1960 Act and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 are adequate safeguards and this is the legislation under which our broadcasters can work. If there are difficulties with that, as my colleague, Deputy McDaid said, the order can be renewed but I have sufficient faith in our broadcasters to allow them get on with their job and do it in a first class manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Higgins, on his bold decision not to renew the order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. The decision is in accordance with the long-standing policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Union of Journalists and, indeed, of the Labour Party. I welcome this oppoortunity, provided by the Progressive Democrats, to discuss the issue of section 31. I regret that no party in the course of the year tabled such a motion to permit Members in Private Members' time to discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, as it stands, is rather silly and, if agreed, would hand over the <Col N="546" /> initiative in relation to broadcasting to Sinn Féin. In those circumstances Government policy on section 31 would be determined largely by Sinn Féin policy, we would be a laughing stock, ineffective and responding mechanically to every whim of Sinn Féin and IRA activity. We would be like yo-yos, if this motion was agreed.</P>
    <P>Indeed Deputy Currie's remarks were in the same rather negative vein, an expression of irrational fears, depicting a bogey man scenario as though the people of this country were intellectual weaklings, children unable to make up their minds, without maturity, vision or rationality. I regret the attitude by the Opposition &mdash; one of &ldquo;out of sight out of mind; we do not want to hear about it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This decision follows a long period of review and consultation by the Minister. It is not a response to the Downing Street Joint Declaration on peace as suggested by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, was recognised universally as a blunt instrument, that it was the Minister exercising a diktat, telling RTE and the electronic media how they were supposed to behave; it was Big Brother political power, allowing no editorial flexibility or judgment by the broadcasting media while, at the same time, allowing ultimate judgment to the print media.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response in the House was not a response to the Downing Street Joint Declaration on peace, it was a response to the constitutional rights of our citizens to freely express their convictions and opinions. Indeed it is a constitutional right to freedom of information which must be guarded and strongly preserved by all citizens. It was a response to the Supreme Court decision in the Larry O'Toole case and primarily transfers the right of access to the airwaves based not so much on who people are as on what people say. Likewise, it was a response to the need to fulfil our international obligations under Article 19 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, <Col N="547" /> criticised so roundly last July and which has been the subject of review until this decision not to renew the order under section 31 was taken.</P>
    <P>Since the order was introduced more than 20 years ago there has been additional legislation, namely, the Prohibition on Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, which covers much of what the order under section 31 was intended to deal with, when introduced initially, in the area of promotion of sectarianism, crime or religious discrimination. Indeed further, under section 18 of the Broadcasting Act there is room for strong editorial control of what emanates from the airwaves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what is most important about the decision not to renew the order is that it takes us out of our 20 year old bunker. Sometimes we think that only the Unionists have adopted a position of no surrender, who have put their heads down, are not prepared to appear above the parapets, who shout &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;. We have our own bunker, which has been the order under section 31. We have banned what we do not want to hear in relation to Northern Ireland. Ours has been a principle of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind; hear no evil, see no evil&rdquo; hoping that problem will go away. That is no longer the position. By its decision the Government is now proactive, confident of the integrity and validity of its position on Northern Ireland. It is prepared to take on all comers; it is a sign of our political maturity, our certainty that our agenda in relation to Northern Ireland is correct, that the people will see it as such and that we can argue it with them. Already the resounding endorsement of the Downing Street Joint Declaration on peace by the people is evidence of the right direction we are pursuing in seeking a solution by wide-ranging dialogue, to resolve the impasse on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the right decision. I do not think we should be worried about the scaremongering because the existing powers will be properly and responsibly exercised by RTE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I commend the Government amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the decision to allow section 31 to lapse because I have consistently opposed it. It was ineffective in the context of the Northern Ireland conflict. Looking back over the period of its operation, the degree to which one ghettoises a community, or a particular segment thereof, means that the position becomes worse.</P>
      <P>In many ways the operation of section 31 helped Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA. Certainly it allowed Sinn Féin, over a period of time to develop in a cocoon-like fashion in that it fed on itself in its own community, very often talking to itself &mdash; talking to the converted. Indeed instruments like section 31 reduced the degree of exposure to alternative viewpoints, the capacity to respond instantaneously in the broadcasting media. For example, at times of major atrocities, Sinn Féin was always able to run away, to hide behind the written statement, which it could fax or send to the print media but did not have to answer for in any immediate sense on a broadcasting medium, radio or television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are exposed to alternative viewpoints over a period, their position and policies tend to change. Therefore, the ghettoisation of certain sections of the community in Northern Ireland has not made a contribution to the peace process or to the achievement of peace on this island. It is an insult to people's intelligence to suggest that they will be easily fooled by proponents of violence, or by those who advocate violence, as a means of achieving Irish unity or resolving the Northern Ireland problem. For a long time, many young people in particular have been restricted in terms of access to information, to a comprehensive, informed broadcasting coverage of affairs pertaining to Northern Ireland. The majority of broadcasters and journalists agree that it has been a restrictive feature in terms of being in a position to comprehensively report and investigate affairs in Northern <Col N="549" /> Ireland through the broadcasting media.</P>
    <P>We must not overestimate &mdash; or underestimate &mdash; the impact of section 31 on the overall position. Nobody in this House has a monopoly in terms of opposition to the campaign of violence of the IRA. Members who favour the abolition of section 31 are as committed to opposing the acts of violence by the IRA as those who favour its retention. However, in itself, it would not be a major determining factor is deciding whether the Provisional IRA cease its campaign of violence; there are other, fundamental issues at stake.</P>
    <P>I feel also &mdash; and this point was made by the Minister &mdash; that nobody can really argue that Sinn Féin's access to the print media over the past 20 years, in itself, prolonged or exacerbated the conflict or led to increased acts of violence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when one looks at developing technologies, one realises that most people, in multi-channel land at least, can turn on CNN or Sky News and see events worldwide. One never knows to whom journalists may be talking. There is, for example, almost spontaneous reporting of people committing violent acts, or being interviewed in areas of conflict throughout Europe and Africa, indeed worldwide. In that sense section 31 was fast becoming something of an anomaly, if not absurd. In many ways this is fundamentally an issue of freedom of information and expression versus censorship, of the capacity to get behind the story.</P>
    <P>During the time section 31 was in operation it was ludicrous that the broadcasting media could not interview or discuss with Sinn Féin personnel their response and reaction to the peace process and in that context alone the lifting of the section 31 ban will make a positive contribution. It will not be the only factor, but will make a positive contribution.</P>

      <P>When the Labour Party entered into a partnership Government it stated that one of its main priorities would be to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels by improving public accountability, transparency and trust. In counties and states where undemocratic and dictatorial regimes wish to maintain power one of the most important methods they use to copperfasten their position is to impose political censorship. Needless to say, they would never describe it as censorship; however, the <Col N="552" /> reality is that the basic right to receive and impart information is denied.</P>
      <P>The censorship imposed by the white apartheid regime in South Africa was a clear example of this, and indeed the growing concern about the imposition of political censorship in Yeltsin's Russia is another indication of how weak politicians who fear the electorate can clamp down on Opposition political parties and organisations.</P>
      <P>In my opinion orders made under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act were imposed by successive Irish Governments which did not have either the political will, capacity, or courage to take real political action to begin the process of resolving the Northern Ireland question. Rather than address the political issues, successive Governments chose to suppress political opinions which differed from theirs. They used the excuse that section 31 had to be imposed so as to curtail violence in Northern Ireland. However, the brief history of the Six Counties in the 21 years since section 31 was first imposed clearly indicates that political censorship has done nothing to reduce the level of violence there. In fact, there is a growing body of opinion that would say that political censorship has prolonged the violence.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the Opsahl report on Northern Ireland, published only a few short months ago, makes the point that the marginalisation of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland by means of the broadcasting ban &ldquo;only plays into the hands of those who prefer the use of violence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If ever evidence was required to expose the dangers of section 31 we need only look at RTE's failure to follow up the wrongful conviction of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven, British collusion with Loyalist death squads and indeed the bombings of Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, section 31 of the Broadcasting Act seriously inhibited RTE's ability to provide fair, impartial and objective coverage of events arising from the troubles in Northern Ireland. Throughout Europe today there is a growth in right wing parties and groups, <Col N="553" /> parties which would deny citizens' civil and human rights, free speech and, if given an opportunity, impose repressive legislation and political censorship.</P>
    <P>Those who support this philosophy have a long tradition going back to the Brown Shirts and the Blackshirts. Indeed, we in Ireland also had our share of those right wing elements, who attempted to undermine our democratic institutions, to impose political censorship and deny the Irish people the right to freedom and democracy.</P>

      <P>Before I proceed <Col N="555" /> with my main contribution to the debate tonight I wish to take up two points made by Deputy Bree. First, that views at odds with the establishment were banned by section 31 of the Broadcasting Act is not true. Not a day passed during the past 25 years that the views of Sinn Féin and the IRA were not carried on the airwaves of RTE radio and television. What was specifically banned was the interview, live or recorded, of spokespersons for organisations that supported the pursuit of their aims through violent means, irrespective of the democratic wish of the people of this State. That is what was banned, not views against the establishment.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is this. Deputy Bree stated that things have changed. Unfortunately, things have not changed enough. The IRA continues to murder and destroy in Northern Ireland despite the fact that more than 95 per cent of the people on this island are demanding that they stop and support the Joint Declaration which has been agreed by the democratic Government of this country and by that of Britain. The challenge which faces Sinn Féin and the IRA is to wake up and accept the democratic wishes of the people on this island and of Britain.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have to say that my party will not be supporting the Progressive Democrats' motion I propose to explain the reason. We have for some time called for a lifting of the order made by the Minister under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. We welcomed the decision of the Government not to renew the order in January of this year and believe that some time is needed to assess the impact of the new situation and particularly to consider how the guildelines introduced by RTE and the Independent Radio and Television Commission are operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns expressed by the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael about the dangers of allowing those who espouse violence access to the airwaves, but I think they are wrong to seek the <Col N="556" /> reimposition of the order without first seeing how the new situation works. I also welcome the fact that the Progressive Democrats have given their Private Members' time to have this matter debated in the House. We have not had a debate on this issue for 17 years, since the imposition of section 31 by a previous coalition Government. I draw attention to the fact that Democratic Left has tabled a Bill to amend the Broadcasting Authority Acts which would make it obligatory on the Minister to bring any order under section 31 before this House for debate before being implemented. It is not acceptable that for 17 years a Minister has, with the stroke of a pen, reimposed section 31 without a debate in this House and the various issues arising being addressed.</P>
    <P>It was also inevitable that immediately following the removal of the section 31 order there would be a series of high profile interviews which would have a high interest and novelty value. The fact that the lifting of the order came shortly after the Downing Street Joint Declaration and has been followed shortly afterwards by the high profile visit of Mr. Adams to the United States has resulted in a splurge of interviews with representatives of Sinn Féin and produced a period that could not be classified as typical. We will need a longer period of assessment before final judgment can be passed; however, some preliminary judgment can be made at this stage.</P>
    <P>I know that many journalists who strongly opposed the Provisional IRA and who also opposed section 31 were of the view that, if the order was lifted and Sinn Féin representatives were allowed to be interviewed, they would be taken apart and the hypocrisy of their position exposed. This certainly has not happened to any extent in regard to the interviews we have seen so far. This is not offered as a criticism of the journalists involved but a reflection perhaps on the new guidelines. It seems to me that the Provisional IRA have no difficulty in dealing with the formal, structured, one to one interviews, that by limiting them to this format the guidelines are actually doing them a <Col N="557" /> favour. A far greater test of the Provisional IRA would be participation in a panel format, as in &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. I hope the Minister, in consultation with RTE and the Independent Radio and Television Commission, will keep this situation under review and, if necessary, seek to have the guidelines amended so that the Provisional IRA do not, in effect, receive privileged treatment but are exposed to the cut and thrust of panel debate as are other democratic politicians.</P>
    <P>There have been two main strands to the anti-section 31 lobby. One consisted of Sinn Féin and the IRA and their sympathisers, who made cynical use of the free speech argument in order to secure access to the airwaves for IRA propagandists. The second consisted of people with a genuine commitment to free speech, who were concerned that section 31 had led to a serious distortion in the presentation of views and current affairs on radio and television. I have respect for the latter but only contempt for the former.</P>
    <P>In any consideration of the issues raised by section 31 of the Broadcasting Act we must never lose sight of the fact that those responsible for the worst abuses of human rights and democratic rights have been the paramilitary groups who have brought so much misery to the people of this island and, indeed, to our neighbouring island, Britain, for almost a quarter of a century. As George Bernard Shaw correctly remarked, &ldquo;Assassination is the extreme form of censorship&rdquo;. Any restriction on democratic rights that may have been involved in the use of section 31 pales into insignificance compared with the daily denials of the most basic human and civil rights for which the murder gangs &mdash; orange and green &mdash; have been responsible.</P>
    <P>The paramilitaries and their political proxies who complained most loudly about the injustice of section 31 have shown little inclination to recognise the basic rights of any of those who do not accept their dictates or who cross them in any way. Journalists working in Northern <Col N="558" /> Ireland have at different times been threatened by sectarian gangs on both sides. Jim Campbell, a respected Belfast journalist working in Belfast, was shot and seriously wounded by Loyalists.</P>
    <P>Countless people in Northern Ireland have been denied not only the right to free speech but even the right to live in their homes and their own areas. They have been driven out under the threat of death, largely by the Provisional IRA. Both sets of paramilitaries have murdered others, simply because of their political views or perceived religious affiliations. Unionist politicians like the Reverend Robert Bradford have been murdered by Nationalist terrorists, while the Loyalist gangs have murdered many Sinn Féin activists, including Donegal county councillor, Eddie Fullerton.</P>
    <P>We do not live in ordinary times. Our politics have been dominated for 25 years by a background of a campaign of murder and violence, by those who show no respect for the decision of the ballot box and who attempt to force their will on others by force of arms. It would be unreasonable to expect that we would have a national broadcasting policy that did not take this into account in some way, that we naively operated as if everyone was prepared to abide by the democratic rules.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not believe that the operation of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was satisfactory. I believe it had to be dropped and alternative ways found of ensuring that anti-democratic groups are challenged and exposed.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with an enormously complex area where there are few simple answers. It is not easy to balance the general right of free speech and freedom of information, and particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with the need to ensure that the airwaves are not used to promote or incite sectarian violence or hatred. We have seen some of the most ugly manifestations of terrorism in the past few months, and I do not believe that reasonable people would want those <Col N="559" /> responsible for the Shankill or Greysteel massacres to have unrestrained access to the airwaves to promote their doctrine of hatred.</P>
    <P>I was particularly concerned that since the order was imposed in 1976 it had been renewed each year by ministerial order and that the Dáil had never been given an opportunity to discuss it or vote on it. Whatever one's views on the need, or otherwise, for section 31, it is surely not acceptable that an order which has such significant implications for broadcasting policy in this country could be renewed each year at the stroke of a pen. Section 31 provides extraordinary powers for the Minister and there was a real danger that, by default, it was becoming almost a permanent part of broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>Last November I suggested lifting the order, for a trial period, to see how then broadcasters would deal with the situation. Public attitudes in the Republic to Northern Ireland have changed dramatically since the order was first activated in 1972. More than 20 years of the most extreme viciousness has removed in all but the most fanatical minority any notions of some romantic liberation struggle in Northern Ireland and the majority of people, including broadcasters, see the paramilitaries for the sordid sectarian gangs they are.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view that this change in public attitude would be reflected in the way in which broadcasters would report events in Northern Ireland, if the order under section 31 were to be lifted.</P>
    <P>In addition, it should also be remembered that since the order was introduced the Dáil has passed legislation to outlaw incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation, which would provide some degree of protection against abuse of the airwaves which was not there previously.</P>
    <P>It seems that perhaps journalists are being over cautious in their interviewing of Sinn Féin spokespersons. There seems to be a reluctance to put questions that might be subsequently interpreted as journalists urging Sinn Féin spokespersons to make statements which might <Col N="560" /> be seen as incitement to murder or hatred. I have not yet heard a question put to Mr. Adams, or to any of the other Sinn Féin spokespersons, on whether or not Sinn Féin still support the use of violence by the IRA. Mr. Adams has repeatedly said that he has a personal political commitment to peace, but Mr. Adams, when he speaks on RTE, is not speaking in his personal capacity. He is the representative of a political organisation publicly committed to support the IRA. So long as that is the case, he cannot be treated as normal democratic politicians are treated when he is being interviewed. The Minister should look closely at the way in which current guidelines are being implemented. Perhaps fear of the use in an adverse or perverse way of the Act which precludes incitement to hatred or murder is restraining journalists from asking the hard questions we all thought should be put to Mr. Adams and others of that ilk.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on the matter, and it will take some time to see whether or not my forecast turns out to be accurate. I have always believed that section 31 should be regarded basically as a broadcasting issue and should not be regarded as a concession to the Provisionals. However, there is no doubt that it is one of a series of developments since the Downing Street Joint Declaration which has been viewed by the public as conciliatory gestures to the Provisionals.</P>
    <P>The other current example of this is the decision by the US to give Mr. Adams a visa to visit the United States. A point I made a number of times before the visa was granted was that I hoped that the US would make it a condition for granting a visa to Mr. Adams that he would demand that the IRA lift the expulsion orders on many hundreds of people in Northern Ireland who have been driven out of their homes by the IRA, and the virtual execution orders on young people in Northern Ireland whom the IRA regard as being anti-social elements. It is a joke that the IRA should be in the business of knee-capping and destroying the lives of young people because they regard them <Col N="561" /> as being anti-social. This issue has not been given sufficient publicity.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Mr. Adams is presenting himself as a man of peace, that he claims that Sinn Féin is looking for peace, and despite the fact that the IRA claim they want peace, they continue to murder unarmed policemen, women soldiers and to bomb jobs out of existence in Northern Ireland. They also virtually on a daily basis, maim and destroy the lives of young people there who will not toe the line in the areas the IRA believes it has a right to control. It is unacceptable that these questions are not being put to Sinn Féin spokespersons when they appear on radio and television. I am not talking about historical incidents but about incidents which are happening on a daily basis. It is not good enough that Mr. Adams is not being confronted with the hypocrisy of his position.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is disgraceful that there has not been a similar conciliatory gesture from the Provisionals either in terms of a positive response to the Downing Street Joint Declaration, a ceasefire or even a de-escalation of violence. Mr. Adams should be made aware that the patience of the public and, I hope, of the two Governments is not unlimited. The time is now approaching when the fudging and foot-dragging has to stop. Mr. Adams has had his run on the media. He has had his 48 hours of glory in New York and he and his colleagues now have to make up their minds whether or not they wish to come on board the democratic process or remain in the wilderness of sectarian terrorism. For our part, as democratic politicians in this House, we must get on with the job of negotiating a settlement of the problems of Northern Ireland based on the democratic principles of the Joint Declaration, which will enable mature pluralist and democratic politics to evolve and develop North and South.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating this important motion tonight. We must acknowledge with gratitude the work of <Col N="562" /> the Progressive Democrats in tabling this motion. Speaker after speaker on the Government side tonight and last night spoke about openness, open Government and freedom of information. We must remember that this debate was prompted by the Opposition and not by the Government. It is to the eternal shame of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, a man who for many years in Opposition spoke about freedom of information, who was committed to the openness of Government, that he lifted the ban on interviews with terrorists without any reference to this House so as to hear the views of the lawfully elected representatives of the people. It is as a result of that that we are debating this in a vacuum tonight. In welcoming this debate Deputy Martin suggested that we were debating it retrospectively. That puts the debate of the past few days into perspective.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government not to renew the ban was ill-timed and badly judged. Whether or not the Government will admit it, it has presented an unprecedented bouquet to the Provisional IRA and its fellow travellers in Sinn Féin. Successive Governments of many hues since the days of de Valera have maintained the practice of absolute opposition to terrorists whose principal <i>modus operandi</i> was the overthrow of the State. Ordinary decent law-abiding citizens supported the ban over the past 20 years. It was supported by a huge majority in this House who believe that terrorists who wished to overthrow the State should not enjoy access to radio and television.</P>
    <P>In our free society law-abiding citizens, representing the overwhelming majority of people, have no truck with Sinn Féin and the IRA and its ideals or objectives. The ban imposed for many years was a legitimate weapon of a democratic State and should have remained until Sinn Féin showed good cause for its removal. This Government has reacted under pressure from within Republican sources. In essence, this Government has been duped by Provisional Sinn Féin and the IRA. Although officially denied by the Government on numerous occasions, the <Col N="563" /> lifting of the ban is being seen, and will always be seen, as an integral part of the peace process. It is outrageous that this generous concession was granted in advance of any indication by the Provisional IRA that they were prepared to comply with any aspect of the Downing Street Joint Declaration. A cessation of violence should have been a condition to the lifting of the ban.</P>
    <P>The celebrity status of Gerry Adams in recent times in this State is obscene. He is paraded as a special guest through the media rooms of the broadcasting stations in this country; he is fêted in New York like a Hollywood film star and, worst of all, was displayed in the national print media last weekend as an advertising vehicle of an independent radio station in this city. All this is widely removed from the bomb and the bullet, the murder and the mayhem which have literally taken the lives of thousands and ruined thousands of families in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Government is naive if it believes that terrorists can be exposed on the airwaves or, alternatively, that the peace process would be helped by lifting the ban. This shallow argument simply does not wash. The reality is that the medium is the message and all that matters is that Sinn Féin members appear; their appearance legitimises their activity.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the position in South Africa and on the international stage but it is worth reflecting on the two milestones towards peace on the international stage in the recent past. In South Africa Nelson Mandela renounced violence before he was brought on side while in the Middle East Yasser Arafat put his gun on the table before he was granted concessions. Yet, the Irish experience shows that Gerry Adams is being rewarded and invited on air at precisely the same time as the mindless campaign of terror and murder continues. This Government has already gone too far in the placation of Provisional Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The silencing of the IRA on the airwaves <Col N="564" /> was a recognition by the authorities, on behalf of the people, that Sinn Féin-IRA had no place on the political landscape. Sadly, this has not been the case since 19 January and it is a decision the Government will live to regret. I am proud to support the motion tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion and welcome the fact that it is being taken in the House. However, I reiterate the regret expressed that we did not have an opportunity to debate the matter before the Government made its decision. That is the exact antithesis of democracy in action. There is something sick within a democracy when greater freedom of speech is extended to those who support violence and who will not renounce it than to democratically elected Members.</P>
      <P>The events of the past two weeks confirmed that the Government made a fundamental mistake in repealing the section 31 ban in the Broadcasting Act prior to a renunication of violence by Sinn Féin and the IRA. The nightly celebrity television appearances on the 9 o'clock news of Gerry Adams present him as if he is the Kevin Costner of Irish politics. The Minister, Deputy Higgins, talks of the need for freedom of speech and of the maturity of the electorate. I have no doubt about the maturity of people watching these events and their ability to assess the validity of what is said but freedom of speech does not justify the nightly presentation of the comments of a person who is the public face of an armed conspiracy comprised of people who are prepared to continue to kill, bomb and maim to achieve their political objectives. What is needed on this island is a total end to the politics of the bomb and the bullet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Gerry Adams is involved in a serious attempt to bring about peace there is no reason those engaged in IRA violence should not terminate their activities while they complete whatever internal discussions in which they need to engage. It is not good enough that they are allowed access to our national television station <Col N="565" /> and talk of peace while they remain committed to and continue to use violence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's thesis is seriously intended we should grant freedom of the airwaves to all those engaged in criminality in this country to use the 9 o'clock news, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and other television and radio current affairs programmes to justify their actions. Perhaps we should be presented on our television screens on a regular basis with those who rob banks and post offices pleading for understanding and expressing the hope that such activities will eventually come to an end.</P>
    <P>The Government's actions are giving Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Féin a public stature and credibility they do not deserve. Gerry Adams is not an elected representative or member of any parliament. When he appears on our television screens he is standing there waving the Downing Street Declaration in one hand while the detonator is carefully concealed in the other. He is standing on the shoulders of the dead and maimed of Northern Ireland to secure and retain a political stature of relevance for himself. We all want to see peace.</P>
    <P>My concern is that the events of the past two weeks and the conferring of media celebrity status on Gerry Adams send the wrong signal to the men of violence. Rather than telling them they can join the political process when violence is renounced there is a danger they will be led to believe that if they continue their campaign, further, greater concessions will be made to them. There is a danger that, rather than bringing about peace, the Government's action and the repeal of the ban contained in section 31 of the Broadcasting Act will act as a catalyst to greater violence from extremists on both sides of the Northern divide and heighten the conflict.</P>
    <P>As someone who has always supported the ban imposed in section 31, who has listened to the broadcasters tell us how this interfered with freedom of speech and expression and that if only they were given the chance to tackle the purveyors of violence on the airwaves they would soon give them their come-uppance. I <Col N="566" /> can only say that my cynicism of their capacity to achieve that has been truly confirmed by the events of the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>The only thing I can say about the obscene helter-skelter scramble by both radio and television broadcasters and news media interviewers to secure the first interview with Gerry Adams and, indeed, the second and to see which one of them asked the trickier question is that Gerry Adams, like some of his fellow Sinn Féin members, is as smooth a performer on television and radio as any Member of this House or the Government, who has been through the Bunny Carr school of communications. Gerry Adams is not being caught by the hard question, he is simply there on our screens nightly presenting an image which makes it look as if it is acceptable to support violence while talking peace. That is not something of which any Government in this State should be proud.</P>
    <P>If within a week of the lifting of the section 31 ban the violence had ended, the IRA had announced a ceasefire and the Loyalist extremist groups had followed suit I would be standing in this House congratulating the Government. When I heard that it was going to lift the section 31 ban it was my hope that there had been some secret discussions that we were heading down the road of real peace, not just talking about it, and that this was part of a process to achieve it. It is now clear it is not and Sinn Féin is being allowed to exploit the national media with a view to presenting an acceptable face while the unacceptable face continues to be presented with the bombs and the bullets in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It should not go unnoticed that during the past few days the murderous intent of the IRA has been well exhibited and that they have not achieved their objectives because bombs have been dealt with, thus preventing the damage they were intended to cause. The Government made a grave error. It has done a grave injury to democracy and no favour to the concept of freedom of expression because the greatest freedom in any <Col N="567" /> democratic society is to protect that democracy from subversion from within. Section 31 performed that function. Let the Minister be under no illusion that he has struck a blow for freedom; he has not done so. What he has done is lend a degree of credibility to those who are prepared to bomb, kill and maim to achieve their political objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Tá mé tar éis éisteacht go cúramach lena raibh le rá ag Teachtaí sa díospóireacht seo. Is é an rud is suntasaí faoin seasamh atá glactha ag mórán Teachtaí a labhair ar son an Rúin ná go bhfuil diúltaithe acu cinneadh an Rialtais maidir leis an Ordú faoi alt 31 a thuiscint sa chiall ina ndearnadh é. The decision of the Government not to renew the section 31 order is an expression of confidence in the Irish people and in our broadcasters. It is a decision to put the broadcast media at the service of the people. It is a recognition of the right of the Irish people to have access to the fullest range of information within the limits of Article 40 of the Constitution without the Government deciding what they may or may not see or hear.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies spoke with revulsion about the atrocities perpetrated by the IRA and others in the name of the people of Ireland. I do not believe that any Member of this House would take issue with any of those comments. I must, however, take issue with the implication that in deciding not to renew the order, the Government or the Minister is somehow less opposed to the men of violence. The record speaks for itself. Is léir go bhfuil sé mar chéad-thosaíocht ag an Rialtas seo siochán a bhaint amach i dTuaisceart Éireann. Ní miste, ar ndóigh, suntas a thabhairt don tacaíocht fial atá tugtha ag an Teach seo do na tionscnaimh atá glactha ag an Rialtas chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the contributions of Deputies who spoke in favour of the motion, they can be boiled downed to a number of essential elements. These are <Col N="568" /> briefly: that Sinn Féin and the IRA are one and the same; their violent methods are totally unacceptable; they represent a threat to the State; by not renewing the section 31 order, the Government is allowing them a platform to justify and gain support for their methods, that by allowing them such access to the airwaves, the Government is encouraging them to continue to use violence and allowing the authority of the State to be undermined.</P>
    <P>Féachamís ar an Rún atá os comhair an Tí. We are asked to restore the order under section 31 on a two-monthly basis until Sinn Féin or the IRA undertake to behave in way that is acceptable to us. To my mind the effect of this would be far graver than any of the consequences which, according to the supporters of this motion, will follow from the decision not to renew the order. To accept the proposal in the motion, in effect, is to allow Sinn Féin and other men of violence dictate to the Government on the formulation of Government policy on the fundamental issue of principle of censorship and freedom of information. As the Minister indicated in his speech, it is totally unacceptable to allow the men of violence set the Government's agenda in this way.</P>
    <P>The contributions of the supporters of the motion have tended either to ignore or reject as unsatisfactory the legislative constraints which are in place regarding broadcasting of material which might incite to crime, undermine the authority of the State, to stir up hatred. Some Deputies seem to be of the view that because a number of interviews that would have been prohibited under the section 31 order have been transmitted since the order lapsed, the fabric of our democracy is already unravelling. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir glacadh leis sin in aon chor. This says little for their trust in the maturity, intelligence and humanity of the Irish people. It speaks volumes for their faith in their ability to provide political leadership to the people they represent and whose votes they sought.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell laid great stress in his contribution that the obligation <Col N="569" /> imposed on our broadcasters to be fair and impartial somehow ties their hands when it comes to asking difficult questions. Cuireann an seasamh sin ionadh an domhain orm. I would be surprised if broadcasters could interpret impartiality as implying an Olympian neutrality or detachment from basic moral and constitutional beliefs. One cannot remain neutral as between truth and untruth, justice and injustice, tolerance and intolerance or compassion and cruelty. The obligation of impartiality in no way inhibits a broadcaster's ability to search and probe until he or she is satisfied on behalf of the viewers and listeners with the way that any particular issue has been explored.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> It is outrageous to suggest that those in favour of lifting the ban are soft on terrorism are supporters of Sinn Féin or the IRA or, indeed, any other paramilitary organisation. I suggest that those who support this motion should familiarise themselves with the Broadcasting Act, 1960 and, in particular, sections 17 and 18 of that Act. The Minister's amendment indicates the decision not to renew the order under section 31 is a matter for the Government to decide, not for the men of violence. It is not a poker chip to be used in a bargaining process. There is a fundamental issue of censorship and freedom of information. The decision is an expression of confidence in our maturity, in our system of democracy, in our common sense and in our ability to produce broadcast journalists of talent and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister addressed the allegation that he or the Government acted in an undemocratic fashion. The Oireachtas has statutory power to extend the life-time of section 31. Despite being made fully aware of views on the section 31 order the Oireachtas chose not to exercise this.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the Downing Street Joint Declaration represents a reasonable balance between the rights and aspirations of both the nationalist and unionist communities which occupy this island. Moreover, we recognise and welcome the fact that the British Government in effect is leaving it up to the people of this island to resolve their differences by peaceful means, that the British Government will accept whatever the outcome of any such political dialogue would be, including some form of united Ireland.</P>
      <P>The sole but fundamental precondition which the British side have laid down in the context of the present quest for a peace process in Ireland is that there can be no change in the current status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority of the people there. It is becoming crystal clear that this very cornerstone of the Downing Street Joint Declaration is one which the so-called Republican movement of Sinn Féin and the IRA do not and will not accept. It is the very opposite of their undemocratic campaign over the past 20 years as they seek to bomb one million Unionists into some form of united Ireland against their will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the fundamental litmus test of the Downing Street Joint Declaration and the necessary response of all political parties and organisations to it. Instead of Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and <Col N="571" /> others pressing day in, day out for clarification from the British Government the vital clarification required by all the people of this island and of Britain too is awaited from Sinn Féin and the IRA, namely, do they accept that the present status of Northern Ireland cannot be altered without the freely given and coerced consent of a majority of the people there. It is the absence of that commitment and clarification by Sinn Féin and the IRA, and their failure to renounce violence as a means of pursuing political goals, that impels the Progressive Democrats to demand the restoration of the section 31 ban and condemn as foolish and misguided the decision of this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government to repeal the ban without such commitments having been given by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Government to the Progressive Democrats motion is a blatant attempt to mislead the public on the real issues which this House is debating. No one doubts the maturity or judgement of the electorate, nor has anyone queried the professionalism of the Irish broadcast media. Section 31 is not about protecting the people from themselves. The people understand fully the nature of the IRA and the falsity of its propaganda. Section 31 is not an issue of censorship, is not an issue concerning freedom of speech. Section 31 was supported by successive Governments as a clear statement to those who have sought to combine murder with politics and subversion with patriotism that they may not flout the authority of this State or the legitimacy of democratic politics.</P>
    <P>Article 40.6.1º of the Constitution upholds the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. That right cannot be taken away by any Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The State, however, is expressly obliged by the same provision of the Constitution to ensure that the media is not used to undermine public order or the authority of the State. Those are not our <Col N="572" /> words; those are the words of our fundamental law. The State's duty to uphold its authority and to uphold democracy against subversion is not a matter of political choice; it is a matter of solemn constitutional duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution yesterday chose to deal with section 31 as though it were an issue in which the rights of people to information and the rights of people to speak were in some sense at odds with the security interests of the State. The Minister, posing as a liberal, has asked this House to welcome to the airwaves members of a subversive revolutionary movement who, day in day out, use murder as part of its stock in trade.</P>

      <P>Genuine liberalism acknowledges that the law of the jungle does not apply under the guise of unfettered freedom. No liberal democracy can afford to imperil its core values in the pursuit of political appeasement of people dedicated to its overthrow.</P>
      <P>The very point the Minister tried to make in this House last evening was canvassed before the European Court of Human Rights by the Irish branch of the National Union of Journalists. That court rejected as unstatable and as not requiring a full court hearing the claim that the prohibition set out in the orders made under section 31 contravened the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that recent events demonstrated that the IRA is the controlling element of what is termed the Provisional movement, including Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin is the IRA in a suit and tie, the IRA is Sinn Féin in a combat jacket. Their propaganda suggests that there is some distance between Sinn Féin and the IRA but the truth is very different. Adams and McGuinness are central figures in <Col N="573" /> implementation of the armalite and ballot-box strategy. Despite their claims to the contrary they bear full factual and moral responsibility for all the actions of the IRA.</P>
    <P>As stated here last night, there is an irony in that we are prepared to allow on the airwaves in the South people who, if they perpetrated such acts south of the Border, would be ruthlessly suppressed. Does anyone in this House believe that if Members were under daily threat of assassination, if members of our security forces were regularly blown to pieces or if factories, shops and offices were burned down or blown up every day of the week we would permit the organisers of such atrocities on our broadcast media?</P>
    <P>Does this State's respect for human life and the rule of law end at the Border? Do we apply a different standard to actions and organisations in different parts of this island? Does anyone here believe that the Government decision to allow the orders under section 31 to lapse would have been made if the IRA's campaign was being waged on this side of the Border?</P>
    <P>All the arguments marshalled by Minister Higgins in his theoretical and abstract justification of his actions last night would apply equally to a situation in which all the IRA violence was taking place South of the Border. All this demonstrates that his argument is illogical, unprincipled and partitionist. Those who believe in a united Ireland, as we do, cannot apply one standard to the vindication of human rights North of the Border and a different standard South of it. If any Member of this House can say with his or her hand on heart that they would allow Gerry Adams the same access to this State's broadcasting media as he now enjoys if his Provisional organisation was bombing our security forces, killing our civilians and burning our towns with the ferocity which we have seen over the last 20 years, then let them vote for the Government amendment tonight. However, Members who know in their hearts that they would never have permitted section 31 to lapse in such circumstances must now explain how it can <Col N="574" /> be right to relax it when the murder and mayhem is taking place within 100 miles of here among our fellow countrymen.</P>
    <P>I call upon this House to restate our support for the authority of this State and the legitimacy of democratic principles. I call on this House to honestly admit that the effect of the relaxation of section 31 has been to give access to State licensed broadcast media to people who are using such access to further their subversive aims.</P>
    <P>The broadcast media here unlike the newspapers are licensed by the State and subject to a statutory regime requiring them to be impartial, apolitical and balanced. No such requirements are imposed on the print media, nor should they be. It is an irony that those loudest in their support for State control of the broadcast media are least prepared to accept the State's constitutional obligation to ensure that the broadcast media are not used to undermine the authority of the State. Any true liberal knows that freedom of speech has never included the freedom to advocate or to justify the destruction of others under the protection of the law. Any true liberal knows that the State's fundamental duty must be to uphold its own authority. Any true liberal acknowledges that the vindication of every right, including the right to life and the right to freedom of speech, depends in the last analysis on the will of society to uphold its authority and to face down murder and subversion.</P>
    <P>Try as he would to distort this debate into a theoretical discourse on the maturity of the people, the professionalism of journalists or a specious balance between non-existent censorship and freedom of information and expression, the Minister has ignored the heart of the issue which is the vindication of real tangible human rights upon this land. Nobody has the right to exclude any person from access to the broadcast media as long as that person is not using such access to propagate murder and to subvert the State. Every member of every organisation in the country, North and South, has an equal right of access to the <Col N="575" /> media and an equal right of freedom of expression subject only to their capacity to deny themselves those rights by misusing <Col N="576" /> them for the purposes of murder and subversion. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. More than 400 Romanian children have been adopted by Irish couples. Most of these adoptions took place in the 1990-91 period. In many cases children were rescued by Irish couples from absolutely appalling conditions. Many of those children would probably not be alive today if they had remained in Romania.</P>
      <P>It was a cause of great concern to read in our newspapers yesterday a report, which apparently received the imprimatur of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Willie O'Dea, that 18 children have been abandoned by their adoptive parents and placed in the care of health boards. I was pleased that last night the Minister for Health issued a statement to the effect that that is not the case. However, the confusion was compounded by a report in <i>The Irish Press</i> today in which unnamed social worker sources say that the Minister is wrong. Either the Minister of State or the Minister is wrong.</P>
      <P>It is most dangerous for any Minister to jump to precipitate conclusions on an issue such as this because it casts a shadow over what has happened in this area. It is my information that the vast majority of Romanian children adopted by Irish couples have settled in well and are receiving loving care within the families into which they have been adopted. It is true that a small number of such children have experienced difficulties which derive from the conditions under which they lived. The parents of these children have utilised the resources of their local health boards in dealing with those problems. I am not aware of a single case of a parent who adopted a child in Romania who subsequently abandoned that child to the permanent care of the health board. A whispering campaign, supported by the Minister of State, suggesting that that is the case not merely casts a shadow over the hundreds of Irish couples who successfully adopted in Romania but poses a major problem for other Irish couples who may seek to adopt in Romania or other foreign countries in the future because it will give rise to a suspicion in those countries that there is a danger that Irish couples who adopt children abroad may abandon them in Ireland. I emphasise that I do not know of any instance in which this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that this report has come from unnamed social worker sources. Social workers in each of the health boards throughout the country have done a vast amount of good work in carrying out assessments to assist couples who wish to adopt children abroad to comply with the Adoption Act, 1991. Since I published that measure as a Private Members' Bill it has been my experience that within the group of professional social workers a small number seem to have a personalised, ideological fixation with the idea that in no circumstances should a couple living in Ireland adopt outside Ireland, that this is to be seriously discouraged. While most <Col N="579" /> health boards have been helpful to couples who wish to adopt abroad in the future and have carried out assessments, the behaviour of one health board has left a number of questions to be answered. It seems that its approach more often has been to seek to discourage adoptions in these circumstances than to encourage them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will put to bed these reports once and for all and clarify the position. He must seek to remove the slur that has been cast on the hundreds of Irish couples who have adopted Romanian and other children abroad, who feel that their reputation is being impunged and that their care for these children is being questioned. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to set the record straight in relation to the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy which wrongly attributed to me statements regarding the alleged abandonment of Romanian children by their Irish adoptive parents. I wish to make it clear that I gave no interview to the newspaper in question on this subject. Indeed, I made no comment to the newspaper or the journalist.</P>
      <P>My Department has made inquiries from both the community care and special hospital programmes of the eight regional health boards and has been informed that no Romanian children have been taken into the care of the health boards at the request of their adoptive parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, a number of Romanian children were adopted directly from orphanages and other institutions. Some of the children have delayed development as a result of being institutionalised at a very early stage in their lives. These children and their adoptive parents are receiving appropriate day supports from the health boards. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the wonderful commitment and dedication of these adoptive parents <Col N="580" /> who, in the same way as any other parents, are actively involved in the upbringing of their children and in promoting their welfare.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the outcome of the inquiries made by my Department, I am at a loss to understand how anybody could claim that up to 18 Romanian children have been abandoned to the care of the health boards. I note that the Parents of Adopted Romanian Children group also expressed serious doubts about the veracity of this allegation. It is indeed significant that this support group, which offers guidance and advice to adopters of Romanian children, are not aware of any of the children being abandoned.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the unnecessary upset and distress that these unfounded allegations have caused adoptive parents. More than 400 Romanian children have been adopted by Irish parents, many of whom I know personally, who have given the children the opportunity to grow and develop within the love and security of a stable family environment. These parents are deserving of our gratitude, and it is a matter of immense personal disappointment to me that their commitment to their children has been the subject of groundless speculation.</P>
    <P>In relation to future arrangements for the adoption of Romanian children by Irish residents, I should like the House to know that the consultations between my Department and the Romanian adoption authorities are nearing a successful conclusion. I hope to be in a position to bring a draft bilateral adoption agreement before the Dáil for approval in the very near future. In the meantime, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will take all necessary steps to ensure that those concerned are made aware that there is no basis to the allegations made in yesterday's newspaper article.</P>

      <P>Since September 1992 children from the Castleisland area who received their primary education at Gaelscoil Aogáin, the all-Irish primary school in Castleisland, have been attending Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí in Tralee. This has enabled them to continue their education though the medium of Irish. These children have not been provided with what their parents regard as their right, an adequate transport service provided by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I understand that if seven children from the area were to attend Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí a complete transport service from Castleisland would be provided for them. Seven children attended this school in 1992-93 and this figure increased to ten in the current school year. Projections already forwarded to the Department of Education indicate that that number will continue to grow in the immediate future &mdash; a growth of four in 1994, seven in 1995, nine in 1996 and ten in 1997.</P>
      <P>The parents regard as unacceptable the Department's offer, which includes the following provisions: (1) in the morning at approximately 7.50 a.m. the students to link up in Castleisland with a bus which provides a service to Tralee schools from Ball Alley Cross, Ballymacelligott, and in the evening the students to travel on a scheduled service to Ball Alley Cross; and (2) a small daily grant towards the extra cost involved between Ball Alley Cross and Castleisland and between outlying areas and Castleisland. This proposed service is neither adequate nor safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of an adequate Department of Education-funded service, a service funded from the resources of Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí has been provided. This has been to the detriment of facilities in the school. The Department of Education has a duty to provide a complete transport service to enable the <Col N="582" /> children to avail of their right to an education through the medium of Irish at Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí. The provision of such a service would be in keeping with the Government's Green Paper on Education which refers to the dependence of second level all-Irish schools on an adequate number of feeder schools.</P>
    <P>In disallowing a special service in 1992 when seven children enrolled at Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí, the Department argued that the seven pupils were not from one area but from two, Castleisland and Meenganaire, Knocknagashel. The parents regard this argument as totally unreasonable. Of the ten pupils enrolled at present, six come from the Castleisland town area, four from Meenganaire and one from Cordal. The parents consider that the catchment area of Scoil Aogáin constitutes one area and, consequently, the pupils are entitled to transport facilities to Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí. It seems unreasonable for the Department to state that two distinct localities are involved in this issue. Three of the children live four miles from Castleisland but received their primary education with the other four children in Gaelscoil Aogáin in Castleisland. I do not know the criteria used by the Department in determining what constitutes a locality, but this seems to be a very narrow definition.</P>
    <P>In refusing to provide a special transport service in 1993, the Department stated: &ldquo;Given the high costs involved it was not considered reasonable or economic&rdquo;. At present the cost to Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí is £130 per week, less the usual transport charge paid by the pupils. I do not consider a cost of approximately £4,500 per annum unreasonable or uneconomic.</P>
    <P>It would make economic sense for the Department to foster and support transport to Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí from the outlying areas where primary Gaelscoileanna are located rather than be faced with demands for the provision of post-primary all-Irish schools in those areas. If the Government is committed to the concept of all-Irish schools then this is a classic case where they should <Col N="583" /> come up with the funding to provide the transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time with me and endorse the points made by him. Without being repetitive, I believe that the Department of Education has a duty to provide a complete transport service to enable these children to avail of their right to an education through the medium of Irish at Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí. The provision of such a service would be in keeping with the Government's Green Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>A further problem arises in regard to four children from the Meenganaire-Knocknagashel area. In 1992 the parents decided that their children, who had completed their national school education through Irish at Gaelscoil Aogáin in Castleisland, should continue their post-primary education at the nearest all-Irish secondary school, that is, Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí in Tralee. They enrolled their children in this school, in which four other children from Castleisland were enrolled. They anticipated that the students would be allowed to travel on the existing bus service to Castleisland, which passes their homes, to link up with the bus to Tralee. They got tickets to travel but, unfortunately, the Castleisland bus would not wait an extra three to five minutes in the evening to facilitate the link up. Therefore, they could not avail of the two way local service, plus their entitlement to tickets. The parents were most disappointed as they rightly believed they were entitled to have their children educated through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents find it hard to believe that no transport service will be provided. They are not seeking a new service. As their children would automatically receive tickets to travel on the local service to a school in Castleisland they believe they are being discriminated against by attending Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí. I appeal to the Minister to resolve this matter. The problem could be resolved if the scheduled service <Col N="584" /> waited an extra three to five minutes in the evening for these pupils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Deenihan and Foley for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>One of my areas of responsibility is to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 166,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country. I also have the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service on which, in the current year, approximately £39 million will be spent. This figure includes approximately £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in charges from those pupils who are liable for such charges. The main policy aim of the school transport scheme is to facilitate equality of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to enable children who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so, attend school regularly.</P>
      <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised, in the first instance, by the transport liaison officer, who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county, in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann. My Department does not make detailed arrangements. This is the responsibility of the transport liaison officers, in conjunction with Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>I should explain that, for the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its post-primary education centre. In order to be eligible for transport, pupils must live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they are based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table and distance from the route while, at the same time, ensuring that <Col N="585" /> all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools. This inevitably means that the time-table often requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and wait some time in the evenings. This is, and always has been, a feature of the transport schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When establishing post-primary services, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure as far as possible that no pupil will have more than three hours travelling and waiting time daily and live no more than three miles from the route of service.</P>
    <P>In order to establish and maintain a post-primary transport service a minimum of seven eligible pupils, living in a distinct locality, is required.</P>
    <P>Pupils who wish to receive their post-primary education entirely through the medium of Irish may be given transport to the nearest centre in which secondary, vocational, comprehensive or community education through Irish is offered. If they live at least three miles from that centre, that centre may be outside their catchment area.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Department received a request for transport for pupils from the Castleisland catchment to Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí, which is situated in Tralee. Four of the pupils live in Castleisland and three in the Knocknagoshel area, about five miles north of Castleisland. The Department was satisfied that these are two very distinct localities and could not be grouped for the purpose of establishing a service. To do so would have serious implications for the overall operation of both the primary and post-primary transport schemes. There are numerous parts of the country where, if areas were grouped together, it would become necessary to establish expensive services.</P>
    <P>Following a review of options, the Department offered a package to provide transport for all on a scheduled service from Castleisland to Tralee, available <Col N="586" /> morning only; provide transport back from Tralee to the catchment boundary, on an existing special service; put on a new service to bring them from the catchment boundary back to Castleisland &mdash; the cost of this new service was estimated at £1,440 a year and to pay a group grant of £2.50 a day for the three pupils from Knocknagoshel towards the cost of private transport to get them to and from Castleisland.</P>
    <P>That offer was rejected by the parents. They wanted an exclusive service which would run from Knocknagoshel to Castleisland to Tralee and back. The estimated cost of such a service was £8,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>In effect, the service requested would have involved a cost in excess of £5,000, over and above the total value of the offer made by the Department.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that only seven pupils were involved, many other equally deserving demands and constant pressure for economies in the service, the Department would have had great difficulty in justifying concession to this particular demand.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions that the number of children offering for transport to Tralee was likely to rise in coming years. The Department felt that it could respond to this increased demand if or when it happened. The Tralee transport liaison officer eventually accepted that the Department was constrained in what it could do. It became possible to increase the group grant of £2.50 a day to £3 per day. The Department also promised that, if there was a significant rise in the number of pupils from the Castleisland area offering for transport, it would be prepared to review the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the event, the transport liaison officer and the parents decided not to use the package for the remainder of the 1992-93 school year, but to put on their own minibus and claim the £3 daily grant. This was effective for the Easter and summer terms, based on the attendance of the seven pupils in question at the time the grant was paid.</P>
    <P>In the 1993-94 school year an application <Col N="587" /> was made for transport for 11 pupils in that school year. The geographic spread in respect of these students is Castleisland, 1992-93: 4, 1993-94: 6; Knocknagoshel, 1992-93: 3, 1993-94: 4; Cordol West, 1992-93: 0, 1993-94: 1.</P>
    <P>The distance, for example, between Knocknagoshel and Cordel West is approximately ten miles. The transport liaison officer was informed that the most that could be offered for 1993-94 was the package offered last year, as described. While a minimum number of seven from a distinct locality is required, there were only six from Castleisland offering for transport.</P>
    <P>The rules of the scheme state that no special school bus service may be established unless there is a minimum of seven eligible pupils within an area which can be reasonably and economically served by a bus route.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the cost of an exclusive service was estimated at £8,500. While the Department appreciates that the present arrangement is far from ideal, it is under severe financial constraint, and would be unable to justify conceding to the parents' demands. However, the situation will be kept under review and, if there is any possibility of an improvement in the service, I will be glad to do so.</P>

    <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to listen to my contribution. It relates to the means-testing of boarding grants for students who live outside the catchment area of a secondary school and who cannot be provided with day transport to that school. In the majority of these cases <Col N="588" /> people either live in very isolated areas or on islands. The cost of living for people in these areas is already very high but, if their means are over a certain limit, they effectively have to pay for second level education and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>At present somebody living on an island which does not have a secondary school, for example, Inis Meáin or Inishbofin, or students in fifth and sixth year in Inis Oírr, has to go to school on the mainland. They are eligible for a grant of £815 of the cost of boarding up to a limit of £1,600 per annum irrespective of means. However, the balance of the grant, which to a student attending a school which costs £1,650 would be £700, is subject to a means test limit of, I understand, £8,859 per annum with a small allowance of £291 per child.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the cost of living, school costs etc. for people living in remote rural areas, and more particularly for those living on islands, are above normal. The fact that they will be subject to a stringent means test in the provision of free education must be questioned. When one considers that the cost of transport to and from these schools for these students is very high, education becomes a very expensive commodity.</P>
    <P>For example, for a student living on Inis Meáin who goes home every three weeks, there is a round trip cost in excess of £20. That figure is per student because it involves plane flights. Furthermore, there is a difficulty for the people of Inishbofin where the students must board out. There are no local boarding schools and the students are normally required to live in digs.</P>
    <P>This matter warrants urgent consideration. I accept that the number of people affected is small because very few people in these areas have an income in excess of £8,859. However, that is all the more reason for this problem being solved &mdash; it would not have a huge knock-on effect.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State give urgent and serious consideration to this matter, ascertaining whether it would be possible to treat these students in the same way as those in the remainder of the country <Col N="589" /> and given the opportunity of free second-level education?</P>
    <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom. Tá fhios agam go dtuigeann sé tábhacht na gceantar tuaithe agus go speisialta tábhacht na n-oileán.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Ó Cuív's concern in this matter. Unfortunately, in replying, I can deal only with the provisions of the scheme as they obtain at present. Probably it is a matter for further debate.</P>
      <P>A remote area boarding grant was introduced in conjunction with the free education scheme in 1967. Grants are payable under this scheme in respect of pupils who attend a school providing suitable post-primary education and whose homes are outside the range of public transport services. In order to qualify for a boarding grant a student must be: (a) resident at least three miles from a recognised secondary, vocational or community and comprehensive school and from the pick-up point on a bus route to such a centre and (b) a recognised pupil in a secondary boarding school in which the boarding fee charged does not exceed the boarding fee limit as set down by the Department. This limit is £1,650 for the 1993-94 school year.</P>
      <P>Pupils deemed eligible under the scheme would have automatic entitlement to (8/15ths) of the total boarding fee charged to parents. The balance &mdash; 7/15ths &mdash; of the grant is means-tested. Eligibility for receipt of this additional allowance is conditional on the parental income limit not exceeding £8,859 per annum with a further £291 for each dependent child after the first child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income limit caters for people on low incomes and is increased each year in line with inflation. Means-testing is a <Col N="590" /> regular feature of grant schemes. I do not consider that people from remote areas are being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the contribution of parents who do not qualify for the full grant is in respect of maintenance costs only. It is not levied for tuition costs as these are covered by the grants paid by the Department to schools under the free education scheme. Regard must also be had to the household savings occasioned by the absence from home of the pupils in question.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the pattern of demand for boarding grants has been downwards. In the 1993-94 school year, 87 boarding or maintenance grants were awarded, of which 71 were to island pupils attending school on the mainland. Of these, 46 had full-cost grants.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I appreciate what Deputy Ó Cuív said. Perhaps it is a matter that should be discussed further at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very important local issue of Ballinagh national school. While thanking the Minister of State for coming into the House, I regret that the Minister did not see fit to come in to reply. Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister of State brings good tidings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saga of Ballinagh national school goes back to 1968 when Drumcor and Drumcrow schools were closed and amalgamated with that at Ballinagh without adequate provision. For example, two prefabs were built. There are at present 173 pupils attending Ballinagh national school for whom there are two toilets for 88 boys and four toilets for 85 girls, with seven staff sharing. Could anybody say that they comprise adequate hygienic <Col N="591" /> facilities for young boys and girls and their staff at that school?</P>
    <P>The school is grossly overcrowded, its classrooms being totally inadequate for the number of pupils attending. It is a danger, a fire and health hazard and is rat-infested. The pupils and their parents have tried to make provision, taking in portion of the hallways, converting them into utility rooms, where the children can store their schoolbags and coats. In addition, on wet days there are no facilities available outside the school for the children to play or even to shelter when taking lunch.</P>
    <P>Entrance to the school is by 28 steep steps from a national county road. Can anybody in this House state that constitutes a proper entrace given that we must have consideration to the rights of the handicapped? There is no provision for them. The 28 steep steps lead to a very busy road on which all traffic to the school &mdash; school buses and cars belonging to parents and staff &mdash; must park. it will be readily appreciated that this entrance is extremely dangerous, particularly since a proposal to provide a school warden there was turned down on the grounds that it would be too dangerous. If and when there is a fatality, something will be done but we are endeavouring to prevent such an occurrence.</P>
    <P>The proposal to renovate the school is not acceptable on any grounds, especially when we speak about getting best value for public moneys on economic grounds. The proposal to reconstruct the school at a cost of £150,000 in addition to a proposal to improve the entrace &mdash; about which I have just spoken &mdash; at a cost of £120,000 may seem a lot of money but it must be borne in mind that it will be necessary to purchase and gain rights-of-way from farmers and private householders which must first be negotiated. If we go along that road, reconstruct the old school and provide a new entrance, we will still not have a proper, modern school. The people of Ballinagh, to their credit, are asking the Department of Education to build a new school at a lesser cost than renovating the old one <Col N="592" />&mdash; which is common sense, a new school of modern design to adequately facilitate the children. A site for such a school is available in an ideal location, right beside the local community field to which the children would have access to play games and develop their various sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State listen to the children's parents, build a new school and give the House an undertaking to do so now since it is urgent? There is no point in saying that the Department will take another look at the matter because that would not be acceptable. The conditions at this school can only be described as third world and inadequate. Indeed the parents of pupils attending the school have put up with quite a lot. They are at present engaging, with their children, in a one day strike which they really did not want to do.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this decision and to build a new school deserving of the people of Ballinagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boylan for sharing his time with me and agree with the detailed case outlined by him.</P>
      <P>Ballinagh national school has six teachers for 173 pupils, the present accommodation there being totally inadequate and dangerous. For example, the location of the school along a busy road is of particular concern to parents, teachers and pupils. The four undersized classrooms were provided in 1934 and the two prefabs in 1968, the latter following the amalgamation of three schools in the Ballinagh area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a new school there has been under discussion since 1970 but, in reality, little or no progress has been made. The Department of Education has consistently modified proposals for the provision of proper facilities in this new school project. Approval to commence planning for a new school, on a new site, was given in 1985. However, the Department has endeavoured to rescind the decision to provide a new school and consider a major refurbishment of existing accommodation. Such a proposal is <Col N="593" /> not acceptable to the pupils, teachers or parents.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence with the Minister and senior departmental officials to commence immediately planning of this new school on the green field site which has been made available by the local community. Major refurbishment of the existing school will not be satisfactory. The population in the Ballinagh area is growing. We have a committed and dedicated teaching staff, board of management and parents' association and their realistic and sensible proposal should be approved.</P>
    <P>The continued delay by the Department is causing major anxiety to the people concerned and an early and positive response to the ongoing representations of Deputy Boylan and I and the parents and board of management is needed. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Boylan that we are glad the Minister of State is present to hear our concerns and those of the community in Ballinagh.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the united approach of Deputies Boylan and Smith on this matter. I acknowledge that this has been a long drawn out saga. I recall, at the request of Deputy Smith, meeting a deputation in the summer of 1992. Deputy Boylan also accompanied the deputation. If I am not mistaken I may have received another deputation since then. The motion refers to the request to the Minister to reconsider her decision to build a new school in Ballinagh this year. As Deputies will be aware, the entire capital allocation for national schools was announced by the Minister in the press.</P>
      <P>This is a six teacher school which had an enrolment of 167 in September 1993. The existing accommodation consists of four classrooms plus two prefabricated classrooms provided in 1968 to facilitate the amalgamation of Drumcor and Drumcrow schools into Ballinagh, County Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a major upgrading of the accommodation at Ballinagh national <Col N="594" /> school has been agreed in principle by the Department. Approval to commence planning for a new school on a new site was given in 1985. The approval was modified in 1989 in favour of a less expensive building on the new site. In the same year the Department modified the proposed project again in favour of a development on the old site &mdash; conversion and extension to provide three new classrooms. This was not proceeded with because of lack of priority and availability of funds.</P>
    <P>A deputation in July 1992 again requested a school on a new site. There was a considerable cost difference between the development of the old site and a new school at the then current cost levels. Preference for a school on a new site was reiterated at a meeting with the school authorities in November 1993. The delegation was in favour of this option because of the hazardous location of the old site &mdash; adjacent to a very busy road without a bus pull-in facility.</P>
    <P>The main problem on the part of the Department lay in the fact that the structure of the old school building is still very good. Thus the Department would have trouble in justifying the abandoning of a good school and spending a considerable extra sum of money building a new school on a different site.</P>
    <P>The question of providing another entrance to the school behind the church was discussed with the delegation. It would necessitate the acquisition of two separate areas of land to the rear of the existing school so that access could be available to the site. The delegation informed the Department that they were not in a position to purchase the two plots of land as it would be too costly. As a result of the meeting the Department's architect was asked to update the cost of a two classroom extension and a three classroom extension at the existing school, including the provision of a bus pull-in and a tarmac play area in each case. He was also asked to update the cost of a new four classroom and a five classroom school on the new site. He has confirmed that an alternative entrance to the existing school site, behind the church <Col N="595" /> is feasible. It would also be possible to provide a bus pull-in facility at the existing entrance to the school. A decision will be made on which option for development is to be selected as soon as further reports are available and following further discussions with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>The chairman has been informed that this project will be considered for inclusion in the 1995 capital programme. <Col N="596" /> I can assure the Deputies that a decision on which option for development is to be selected will be made in good time to allow for its inclusion in the 1995 capital programme for primary schools. In the meantime there is adequate time to consider the best option from the point of view of both the school and my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 February 1994.</P>

      <P>I introduced the Pensions Act in 1990 which set up the Pensions Board and provided for the safeguarding of the interests of members of occupational pension schemes by setting down minimum standards with which all schemes have to comply.</P>
      <P>Since then various amendments to the Pensions Act, many of a technical nature, have been introduced by means of the annual post-budget Social Welfare Act. This has caused some difficulty, not least for the parliamentary draftsman, in view of the tight deadline for preparation and passage of the Social Welfare Act. This year I, therefore, propose to introduce a separate Bill which will incorporate a number of mainly technical amendments to the Pensions Act which have been proposed by the Pensions Board. I hope to introduce this Bill at the earliest possible opportunity following the enactment of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>An occupational pension scheme is a voluntary arrangement, organised by the employer to provide pensions and/or other benefits to one or more employees on retirement or to surviving dependants on death. There is no legal requirement on employers to provide pension benefits for employees under an occupational pension scheme. With the exception of public sector schemes, the State plays no part in determining the rules and benefits of such schemes. They are solely a matter for those directly concerned and I have no function in determining such benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, which I introduced and which came into effect in January 1991, safeguards the interests of <Col N="387" /> members of occupational pension schemes by setting down minimum standards with which all schemes have to comply. It provides for a regulatory framework for the supervision of pension schemes. The provisions of the Act include the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members and clarification of the duties and responsibilities of scheme trustees. The Act also provided for the establishment of the Pensions Board to monitor and supervise the new statutory requirements. The disclosure of information requirements provide that full information must be made available to members of occupational pension schemes, including information regarding benefit accruing.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some people in receipt of certain social welfare payments such as supplementary welfare allowance are claiming compensation for personal injuries, are being compensated for loss of income by way of special damages claims, and that this expenditure is not recoverable by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing provision certain social insurance benefits are taken into account in assessing damages in personal injuries actions. Section 75 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, provides that injury benefit payable in the five year period from the date of accrual of the cause of the action be taken into account in assessing such damages.</P>
      <P>Section 237 of the 1993 Act contains a similar provision in respect of disability benefit, and invalidity pension. These arrangements are designed to ensure that people are not compensated twice for loss of earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are involved in accidents and who have no entitlement to social welfare benefits can claim supplementary welfare allowance while they are unfit for <Col N="388" /> work and pursuing compensation claims. There are no provisions in legislation which would allow supplementary welfare allowance paid in these circumstances to be taken into account in assessing compensation.</P>
    <P>The recovery of social welfare payments from compensation awards would have implications for insurance costs and a study on the question of reducing the costs of motor insurance in 1990 concluded that a change in the present arrangements to enable social welfare payments to be recovered from awards would be costly to administer and would increase insurance costs. I am, however, reviewing the existing arrangements in the light of more recent developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 are based on the widely-accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouses and their children. Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social welfare income maintenance, the person who is liable to maintain that family is required to contribute towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
      <P>Some 11,000 cases have been examined by my Department. Almost half relate to spouses who are themselves dependent on social welfare and are not in a position to make any contribution. It is not always possible to trace the current whereabouts of deserting spouses; some emigrate, almost all change address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initial examination indicated that 2,412 cases had a potential ability to contribute. Further detailed assessment established that of those 710 are unable <Col N="389" /> to make a contribution for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>The remaining, 1,702 cases, and new cases as they arise, are in various stages of investigation. Determinations of liability have already issued to 312 liable relatives. To date, 112 liable relatives have made payments towards the cost of lone parents (separated spouses) allowance, deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit. They pay either by way of regular direct contribution to my Department or through family law court orders which are transferred to my Department. Over £190,000 has been saved for the taxpayer through this initiative. Over £127,000 has been collected as described above.</P>
    <P>In addition, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions has yielded direct savings on scheme expenditure, amounting to £63,000 to date. For example, some spouses make direct arrangements to provide adequate support to their families once my Department intervenes. It is expected that the contributing group will grow significantly as my Department continues its investigations on the many other cases on hands.</P>
    <P>Changes to the liability to maintain provisions in 1992 strengthened powers of collection and enforcement. Legal proceedings are being considered in a number of cases where the liable relative has failed to comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in the computer systems in my Department currently underway will speed up the review of cases which could not be traced in the past on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I expect that these measures will increase the number of liable relatives making a contribution towards social welfare support for their deserted or separated spouses and their children.</P>

      <P>The problem of working and claiming is addressed by a number of initiatives. One method involves systematic review of claims.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The enforcement process includes site visits, joint investigations with tax officials and notifications of commencement of employments, including the hiring of sub-contractors, in various sectors. Employers evading their PRSI obligations are deemed to be passively assisting any working and claiming by their employers. Such employers are now liable to repay any amounts fraudulently claimed as well as PRSI arrears. They also risk criminal prosecution.</P>

      <P>The social welfare amnesty which I announced in June was designed to add impetus to the ongoing successful drive by my Department against fraud and abuse of the system. It offered people <Col N="392" /> who were defrauding the social welfare system a final opportunity to come clean and pay up what is due to the taxpaying public.</P>
      <P>The amnesty against prosecution applied to employers, the self-employed and social welfare recipients who cooperated with my Department and put their affairs in order.</P>
      <P>A total of 560 people made inquiries to my Department about the amnesty. A further 283 people, under investigation by my Department, were given the opportunity to avail of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>The amnesty ended on 14 January 1994. At that date 550 people claiming social welfare payments had applied for the benefits of the amnesty. As these cases are still being processed, exact savings figures are not available.</P>
      <P>The collection of PRSI arrears and the imposition of penalties in respect of those arrears is primarily a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The tax amnesty, which included an amnesty from penalties on arrears of PRSI for employers and the self-employed, provided for the payment of all arrears of tax and PRSI due by 14 January 1994.</P>
      <P>The majority of employers and self-employed who wished to avail of the amnesty in respect of their outstanding PRSI liabilities were required to contact their local tax office to have their applications considered. Accordingly my Department does not have statistics on people claiming the tax amnesty in respect of outstanding PRSI liabilities.</P>
      <P>The social welfare amnesty is part of a package of control measures introduced by me over the last few years. I am satisfied that the amnesty has contributed to the ongoing efforts by my Department to stamp out social welfare fraud.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for the purpose of determining entitlement to non-contributory payments account is taken of cash income, income from employment, property and investments or capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the criteria are broadly similar for all schemes there are variations in the treatment of certain categories of claimants. Some of those variations are designed to take account of the differing needs of claimants. For example in this year's budget I introduced significant improvements in the means test specifically for the carer's allowance. An earnings disregard of £100 in respect of <Col N="394" /> working spouses is being provided in addition to the general 3 per cent increase in the rate of payment. A carer whose spouse has earnings of £160 will now qualify for a £34.00 payment, whereas previously they would not have been entitled to any payment.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced improvements in the lone parents means test which are aimed at encouraging lone parents who wish to work. The current earnings disregard of £6 per week per child is being replaced by a flat-rate earnings disregard of £30, including the £6 income disregard. A 50 per cent taper is also being introduced so that earnings in excess of the new disregard will result in a £1 reduction for each £2 earned, instead of the £1 for £1 withdrawal arrangement which applies at present. These arrangements will apply from July 1994.</P>
    <P>I am giving consideration to the possibility of standardising other aspects of the existing means tests within the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Over a number of years I have progressively increased the age limit for payment of child dependant allowances to long term social welfare recipients where the child remains in full-time education. In the case of pensions and other long term payments, such allowances can now be paid up to the age of 21. In the case of short term payments such as disability benefit, child dependant allowances are paid up to the age of 18. Any extension of this age limit would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>The Irish social welfare system fully complies with the requirements of EC Directive 79/7 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in <Col N="396" /> matters of social security. The principal area not covered by this directive is the social protection of survivors. I was very pleased to announce, in this year's budget, the introduction of a new widower's contributory pension. Under the new arrangements, widows and widowers will be entitled to a contributory pension on a similar basis.</P>
      <P>There is no discrimination against social welfare clients on the basis of where they live or whom they choose to live with. The only payments for which entitlement is directly linked to living arrangements are the living alone allowance and the carer's allowance. The former is paid to those aged over 66 in response to the special needs which arises from living alone. The latter is paid to those caring for people who need full-time care and attention and thus require the carer to live with them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the assessment of &ldquo;Benefit and Privilege&rdquo;. The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants who have the benefit of living at home and those who do not. The method of assessment targets scarce resources to those most in need. In the 1991 budget a minimum payment of £5 was introduced where the claimant was entitled to a payment and where the only means were derived from benefit and privilege. I am pleased that I have been able to double that minimum payment to £10 from July next.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system does not discriminate between couples according to whether they have chosen to live as a married or cohabitating couple. Increases of benefits in respect of adult dependants are payable on the same basis, whether the couple are married or cohabitating. Personal entitlements to social insurance payments are not affected by marital status. Under the social assistance scheme which is based on need, the levels of payment are determined on the basis of the needs of the household, whether the couple are married or cohabitating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the application of social welfare legislation, care is taken to <Col N="397" /> ensure that administrative guidelines and practice do not involve discrimination in the treatment of women and men. An example of this is avoidance of sexist language in legislation which is proposed to this House. Attention is also given to the language and artwork used in the information leaflets issued by my Department and updated on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>In 1991 my Department began a project to collect information on occupation from new claimants for unemployment payments. At present the project is confined to computerised offices. However, as computerisation progresses, the coverage is gradually being extended.</P>
      <P>The occupational profile of people on the live register who are covered by the project is shown in a table which will be circulated in the Official Report.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's budget, I am providing for a 3 per cent increase in all weekly social welfare and health board payments with effect from July next. This increase applies to personal rates, adult dependant and child dependant allowances. Over 822,000 people and their 627,000 dependants will benefit, including pensioners, widows, lone parents and families who are out of work because of illness or unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the general 3 per cent increase, a further 3 per cent increase, i.e. 6 per cent in all, will be given to all short term weekly payments in order to bring them up to the Commission on <Col N="400" /> Social Welfare's priority rate. The short term payments in question are disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and unemployability supplement. One hundred and eighty-five thousand people will benefit from this increase.</P>
    <P>This year, the personal rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and injury benefit are being singled out for a further special increase of £2.10, bringing their rate to £61 per week, which is an overall 10 per cent or £5.40 a week increase. This substantial improvement in the basic personal rates arises from the decision of the Government to discontinue pay-related benefit payable with unemployment benefit for new claimants with effect from July next. The savings from that measure are being devoted in full towards this special increase.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing further significant improvements for child benefit in line with the overall approach of developing child benefit as the main element of child income support. This year the higher rate of £23 will be increased to £25 and, in addition, is being applied to the third and subsequent children. The new payments structure from next September will be £20 for each of the first two children and £25 for each child thereafter.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the social welfare measures announced in the budget, including the new widower's pension, improvements in family income supplement, measures for lone parents who take up work and improvements in the free schemes for pensioners, is £157 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>These improvements must now be provided for on a statutory basis in the annual Social Welfare Bill which I will bring forward shortly. Early enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas will allow for the administrative arrangements to pay the improvements in July.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legislative and administrative constraints which I have described above an earlier implementation date of March would give rise to additional costs of nearly £50 million in 1994.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the procedures operating within my Department for the setting up and recovery of overpayments should be set on a more formal basis. With this in mind, I took regulatory powers in the Social Welfare Act, 1993 to introduce a code of practice for dealing with overpayments. The relevant provision is now contained in section 282 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993. The code will copperfasten an equitable and consistent approach in relation to the recovery of overpayments which takes account of the factors which gave rise to the overpayment and of the circumstances of the individual client concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department is preparing the code of practice under which officers appointed to deal with overpayments will be able to defer, suspend, reduce or cancel an overpayment in any particular case. I expect to be in a position to introduce the new arrangements at an early date. Officials of my Department have been working on the proposals. The task of putting the measures in place is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>I will be introducing a contributory pension for widowers from October next.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this scheme is a major breakdthrough in the development of our social insurance system. Provision will be made for the detailed arrangements in the forthcoming social welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>The pension will be available to widowers on the same terms and subject to the same contribution conditions as for widows. Under the new arrangements, both widows and widowers will be entitled to a contributory pension for the first year after the death of their spouse after which a qualifying earnings limit will apply. However, this limit will not apply to those aged 66 or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The earnings limit proposed will be <Col N="403" /> tapered between £12,000 and £16,000 per annum, that is, £230 to £310 in weekly terms. A reduced rate of pension will be payable above the £230 weekly earnings level, while no pension will be payable where earnings are in excess of £16,000 per annum which is well in excess of the average industrial earnings. Where a reduced rate of pension is payable the full amount in respect of child dependant increases will be paid.</P>
    <P>I will also provide in the new scheme for transitional arrangements for men who became widowers within one year of the introduction of the new pension. They will also be entitled to the new pension for 12 months before the earnings requirement will apply. Those who are widowers for more than one year will be eligible to apply for the new pension subject to the earnings requirement.</P>
    <P>The additional cost of the scheme is estimated to be £16 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make it clear that existing recipients of widows pensions will not be affected in any way by these new arrangements. They will continue to receive their pensions irrespective of their level of earnings.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the number of new widows claiming under the new arrangements after October with earnings in excess of £16,000 a year will be fewer than 300.</P>

      <P>The rate of old age contributory pension payable to any person is related to the average of contributions at the full rate paid or credited over his insured lifetime. Where the average is 48 or more, full pension is paid. Reduced pensions are paid for averages below 48, down to a minimum of 20.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has an average of 5 contributions and does not qualify for pension. He spent most of this working life in employment insured at the modified rate which does not include cover for old age contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Act of 1991 special arrangements were made to enable people with a mixture of full rate <Col N="405" /> and modified rate insurance to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension for averages of less than 20 contributions. These new arrangements provide that, in cases of a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance record, a <i>pro rata</i> pension will be payable, which will be proportionate to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age contributory pension purposes.</P>
    <P>To ensure that people in this situation have a reasonable record of contributions at the appropriate rate the 1991 provisions required a claimant, <i>inter alia</i>, to have at least 260 contributions paid or credited at a rate reckonable for old age contributory-retirement pension.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the regulations, an alternative test to this provision was introduced whereby a claimant may qualify if he/she has a minimum of 208 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>Future developments in this area will be considered in the context of the report of the National Pensions Board.</P>

      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme which I introduced for the first time last year proved to be a major success. Some 2,100 sponsors joined the scheme offering over 9,000 job opportunities, the majority of which were in the voluntary and community development sectors. Almost 6,000 students were approved to participate in the scheme and approximately 4,600 students availed of the scheme. The scheme was a very positive development of benefit to both students and to local communities.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue the scheme again this year. A detailed evaluation of last year's scheme has just been completed in my Department. Based on the results of this ealuation, I will be making a number of important changes in this year's scheme.</P>
      <P>First, the scheme will operate from 1 June 1994 to 30 September 1994. This is a change from last year's scheme which ran from July until September.</P>
      <P>Second, the level of the weekly payments to students under the scheme will be increased broadly in line with inflation. Finally, I am extending the period in which the work can be completed from ten weeks to 12 weeks.</P>
      <P>I am also investigating the possibility of arranging a special rate of public liability insurance cover for sponsors. This was identified as a problem for many potential sponsors last year. These changes will enhance the scheme for students and sponsors. I expect that participation in the 1994 scheme will be substantially higher than last year. This will benefit the students and their local communities.</P>

      <P>All people over age 66 who are permanently resident in the State are entitled to a free travel pass. In addition, people under 66 who suffer from certain types of incapacity may also qualify for free travel. There are currently 450,000 people holding free travel passes. The scheme costs £29.7 million per annum.</P>
      <P>There is a number of reasons it is necessary to use addresses on free travel passes. A substantial number of people are entitled to free travel. Accordingly, there is some potential for misuse of passes which have been lost or stolen. While the scale of misuse of passes is small, the CIE group of companies &mdash; the main providers of free travel &mdash; find that address details on passes help them prevent abuse.</P>
      <P>From an administrative viewpoint, the printing of addresses on free travel passes ensures that new and replacement passes can be enveloped and issued by my Department to free travel customers with the minimum of delay. About 45,000 such passes are issued by my Department annually. While not directly relevant to free travel, the pass, with its address information, is recognised as identification for people voting in national and local elections.</P>

      <P>Section 69 of the Pensions Act permits the use of separate actuarial tables in conformity with current European Union directives and Protocols.

      <P>The states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro have a vital role to play in implementing UN sanctions. With the overall conflict situation in the region, the implementation of sanctions has had serious negative consequences for their economies. Traditional trade patterns, transport and communications links in the area have been severely disrupted, adding to the burden of many states which are in a critical period of political, economic and social transition to democracy and market economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 50 of the UN Charter provides <Col N="410" /> for states confronted with special economic difficulties arising from the implementation of Security Council decisions to consult the Council with regard to a solution of these problems. The relevant Security Council Committee has examined a number of requests from states, adversely affected by the UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, for assistance under Article 50. That Committee has appealed for assistance for the affected states and has invited the competent organs and specialised agencies of the UN system, including the international financial institutions, to consider how their assistance programmes might be used to alleviate these special economic problems.</P>
    <P>The broader issue of how best to respond to the special economic problems arising from the implementation of UN sanctions is currently being considered in the context of the Secretary General's &ldquo;Agenda for Peace&rdquo; initiative. In this context, the General Assembly recently invited the Security Council to consider measures within the UN system and involving the international financial institutions that can be put in place to address these special economic problems.</P>
    <P>The CSCE is playing an important role in addressing the needs of states adversely affected by the sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro. The CSCE ministerial meeting in Rome on 30 November-1 December decided that a special meeting should be held to identify priorities for international projects to assist affected states in the Yugoslave region to cope with the impact of these sanctions. That meeting, which was held in Vienna on 31 January-1 February, marked an important step in identifying priorities for future infrastructural support. It also represented a clear expression of support by the international community for the affected states. The projects which were presented by the affected states should now be examined urgently by the international financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The European Union and its member states are continuing to provide considerable assistance to the neighbouring <Col N="411" /> states to help them implement sanctions and also to assist them in tackling the effects of these measures on their economies. Over 900 MECU has been authorised by the European Union in support of the external trade of affected countries to alleviate the harmful economic consequences of sanctions. Through the PHARE regional programmes, many infrastructural projects are being financed. A comprehensive set of support measures for 1994-95, possibly totalling 100 MECU, is being developed by the European Union, reflecting our commitment to the provision of substantial and targeted aid for Serbia and Montenegro's neighbours.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the former Yugoslavia and is committed to providing relief for the emergency humanitarian needs of the victims of the conflict. The Government has so far allocated IR£1.7 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to the international relief operation there. We have admitted 259 Bosnian refugees and have allocated visas to a further 140 refugees to enable them to come to Ireland when the situation in the region permits. Our main priority at present is to reunite the relatives of Bosnian refugees with their families in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lead agency for the relief operation in the former Yugoslavia is the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The Government has supported the special medical evacuation programme for the former Yugoslavia <Col N="412" /> which was established by the UNHCR in July 1993, to facilitate the evacuation of serious medical cases for treatment in other countries. Ireland was one of the first countries to respond positively to the programme and in August we accepted 11 serious orthopaedic cases for treatment in Cappagh Hospital.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the European Union and the member states to bring humanitarian assistance of all kinds to the former Yugoslavia is not in doubt. The European Union has to date provided 690 million ECU to the international relief effort, 60-70 per cent of all the funding required for the international relief operations since the conflict began. The majority of persons evacuated to date under the Medevac programme are receiving treatment in European Union member states.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the appeal made by the Bosnian health minister to the Council of Europe for the evacuation process to be speeded up. There have been similar appeals from a number of other quarters. I understand that selection for medical evacuation is based on established UN evacuation criteria. However, in the case of Bosnia-Hercegovina, evacuations require the agreement of all of the factions involved in the conflict. The failure of the factions to co-operate to facilitate medical evacuations has led to serious disruption of the Medevac programme and its suspension on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The Government, as well as our European partners, would wish to see this operation carried out as effectively and speedily as possible. I will continue to urge this at meetings of the European Union and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1993 the Revenue Commissioners have been given statutory responsibility for maintaining a <Col N="414" /> register of all vehicles in the State and for collecting vehicle registration tax (VRT). The Finance Act, 1992, provides that the VRT charged in relation to a car shall be a percentage of its value and that the value shall be taken to be the open market selling price (OMSP) of the car at the time of the charging of the tax thereon.</P>
      <P>In the case of new cars the OMSP is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, declared to the Revenue Commissioners by the manufacturers or sole distributor. In the case of second hand cars, being registered in the State for the first time, the OMSP is determined so as to ensure that the VRT chargeable on the vehicle will be equivalent to that residing in an equivalent model of the same age and condition already registered in the State. In determining this value the age, condition, mileage etc., are taken into account as are any enhancements or extras that may be fitted.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners maintain a computer database or car models and prices based on the age and specification of the vehicle. To obtain the VRT payable specific details of the car are entered into the computer which will then calculate the OMSP and appropriate VRT payable. This computer database is used by all Vehicle Registration Offices thereby ensuring consistency in the calculation of VRT from office to office. The database is being constantly updated to take account of models not previously encountered, and to allow for the passage of time.</P>
      <P>The VRT database is not available in hardcopy. Because of the size of the database, and the frequency of updates, it would not be practicable to produce a printed version. It should be noted that prior to the introduction of VRT there was no centralised database of secondhand car prices and the Customs Tariffs never contained such a listing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Commissioners do not publish listings of car prices for VRT purposes they do operate a system whereby individuals can obtain an estimate of the VRT payable on a specific car in advance of registration. Persons availing of this <Col N="415" /> service are advised that the VRT quoted is an estimate only, and that a definitive quote will only be given on production of the car at a Vehicle Registration Office for inspection and registration. It can happen in such cases that the original estimate will differ from the final quotation. Inquiries are frequently made by telephone, and while staff will try to establish as much detail as possible, the level of specifications is sometimes understated by the individual making the inquiry, or the specific model is incorrect. This can result in a lower estimate being given than is appropriate. This will become apparent when the car is inspected by staff at the Vehicle Registration Office.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are satisfied that the VRT collection system works efficiently and fairly. There is an appeal system in place and an individual who is dissatisfied with the VRT calculated for his car may ask to have his case reviewed. If the appeal is upheld any excess VRT paid will be refunded.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to comment on the specific case mentioned by the Deputy as insufficient details are given to enable the case to be identified. If the Deputy wishes to give further details the Commissioners will be happy to make inquiries into the specific circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Civil Service is governed by very specific legislative provisions, as provided for by the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956. In general, recruitment is by way of open <Col N="416" /> competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
      <P>An exceptional arrangement was provided for in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973. Under these provisions women who left the Civil Service for the purposes of, on or following marriage, could in certain circumstances seek reinstatement to their former positions if they fulfilled specific criteria. I am not aware of any High Court decision affecting the practice of reinstatements but, in a recent case taken by the Employment Equality Agency under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Labour Court determined that this practice is discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment. It has recommended that the relevant statutory provisions be repealed. Having taken legal advice on the matter, I do not consider that I have any option but to terminate the practice of reinstatement.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on present legislation the estimated yield from residential property tax in 1994 is £9 million. However, as a consequence of the proposed changes announced in my Budget Statement of 26 January the estimated 1994 yield will be £14 million. This compares with the yield of £8.6 million in 1993.</P>

      <P>Under the new arrangements both widows and widowers will be entitled to a contributory pension for the first year after the death of their spouse after which an earnings requirement will apply for continuation of payment.

      <P>Death grant was first introduced as a social insurance benefit in 1970 to provide assistance on the death of an insured person or of a family member. At that time, a maximum grant was £25 payable on the death of an insured person or the husband, wife, widow or widower of an insured person, subject to satisfying the statutory contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>The amount of death grant was subsequently increased with effect from October 1972, April 1978, April 1980 and April 1982 when the maximum grant was increased to £100. There has been no change in the amount payable since that date. Any proposal to increase the amount of the death grant would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that to date I have successfully concluded Social Security Agreements with Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States of America and Quebec. These agreements have real and tangible benefits for Irish pensioners who have worked in these countries and also for Irish employers.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are currently under way in respect of agreements with Switzerland and the Channel Islands respectively. It is expected that these negotiations will be successfully concluded this year.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the bilateral Social Security Agreements which Ireland enters into is to protect the pension rights of Irish people who have worked and paid social security both in Ireland and abroad. The agreements also benefit Irish companies who send workers abroad on temporary assignments, in that social security is generally payable only in the sending country.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a Social Security Agreement with another country is a painstaking and slow process. Priority is given to countries where there has been a tradition of migration. I will shortly be drawing up a new list of priorities in this area and will keep the Deputy's interest in this matter in mind.</P>

      <P>A total of £4.73 million of national lottery money was made available to my Department in 1993. The <Col N="420" /> money has been used to fund a number of schemes of support for voluntary and community groups for which my Department is responsible, including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;grants announced in the context of the Budget;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a number of schemes of grants to support particular areas of voluntary and community work; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;Community Development and Moneylending/indebtedness Programmes.</P>
      <P>Information on how to access funding under the various headings is made widely available by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Schemes of Grants to Voluntary Organisations, Grants to Locally-Based Women's Groups, the Respite Care Fund and the Lone Parents Grants Scheme are advertised in the national press. Full details of the scope of these schemes and how to apply are made available in information leaflets by my Department shortly. the course of the year. The 1994 application forms for these schemes will be available from my Department shortly. In addition, this year I propose to update and consolidate the information leaflets on the individual grant schemes into a comprehensive information booklet and guide to applicants.</P>
      <P>Allocations under these schemes depend on the number and nature of the application received, with priority being given to areas and groups of greatest disadvantage. Applications are assessed having regard to the number of beneficiaries or participants involved in the project, the level of disadvantage experienced in the area or by the group, the funding available from other sources and the particular objectives and criteria attaching to the individual scheme in question.</P>
      <P>Local assessment of applications is undertaken by my Department's Regional Managers, who consult as required with the local Health Board and other relevant agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no formal application forms for the Community Development and Moneylending Programmes and neither is there a closing date for receipt of applications <Col N="421" /> Full information about these programmes is available from the Voluntary and Community Services Section of my Department.</P>
    <P>As there was a very large number of individual grants made to voluntary and community organisations by my Department in 1993, I propose to place the information required in the Oireachtas Library. The details in question will be available in the Library in the near future.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons but has not, so far, ratified it. Ratification will require legislation. Unless certain reservations are entered, however, at the time of ratification, serious difficulties for our prisons could be created given that the number of Irish nationals serving sentences abroad far exceeds the number of foreign nationals serving their sentences in this <Col N="424" /> country. While it is impossible to predict accurately the number of Irish nationals in prison abroad who would wish to return or would qualify for it, even low levels of transfer would pose a substantial problem for us because of existing pressures on prison accommodation.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give, in tabular form by county, the moneys provided for maintenance of non-national roads for the last ten years; the number of kilometres of non-national roads in each county; and the amount per kilometre each county received each year.</Quest>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 134 of 14 May 1991 which sets out details of the block grants allocated to county councils for the maintenance of regional and county roads and the amounts per kilometre which the grants represent in each case for the years 1989 to 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in that reply, grants were not allocated specifically for the maintenance of regional and county roads prior to 1989. The system of grants then in operation involved the allocation of a single block grant to each county council, which supplemented local authorities' own resources for the improvement and <Col N="427" /> maintenance of regional roads and for the improvement of county roads. The grants could not be applied to the maintenance of county roads.</P>
    <P>Information on block grants paid to local authorities before 1989 is contained in the reply to Question No. 173 of 12 February 1991.</P>
    <P>The system of grants operated in the <Col N="428" /> case of urban authorities involves the allocation of a single block grant to supplement the authorities' own resources for the improvement and maintenance of urban roads. It is a matter for each authority to determine the proportion of funds used for improvement and maintenance works.</P>

      <P>The position is that over 500,000 payments amounting to over £377 million were made to farmers under the various premium and headage schemes in the year ended 31 December 1993. This compares to total payments of £350 million in the year ended 31 December <Col N="433" /> 1992. The high payment levels in 1993 were achieved against the background of EU regulations which preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances.</P>

      <P>Under the 1992 and 1993 ewe premium schemes applicants were required to keep on the holdings as described on their application forms the number of ewes on which they applied for premium for the 100 day retention period. As the person named did not meet this requirement in 1992 and 1993 he was not entitled to payment of premium for those years. An advance of the 1992 ewe premium paid to him is being recovered from the 1992 suckler cow premium and the balance due under the suckler scheme will be paid shortly. The delay in processing the 1992 suckler cow application was due to it being incorrectly associated with the 1992 cattle headage application which is still under query pending a reply to letters that were sent to the applicant.</P>

      <P>The total allocation to my Department from national lottery funds as set out in the Revised Estimates for the Public Service for 1993 is at Appendix 1.</P>
      <P>The organisations etc. to which funds were allocated by my Department during 1993 are listed in Appendices 2 to 4 as follows:</P>

      <P>With regard to the national lottery funding available to my Department for Arts and Culture purposes, this funding is primarily earmarked for the maintenance and development of the national cultural institutions such as the National Museum, the National Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall. The funding requirements of those institutions are considered as part of the normal Estimates process and the need for application forms does not arise. With regard to grants for special projects, arrangements have been made for the use of standard application forms for such projects seeking funding in 1994 and subsequent years. Differing criteria apply for the allocation of grants depending on the nature of the application and annual closing dates are not enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Heritage Council funds heritage projects in the areas of Archaeology, Architecture, Natural Environment (including Parks, Gardens and Inland Waterways), Museums and Education. <Col N="439" /> The procedure through which applications are processed is a standard procedure and a standard application form is used. Each application is considered on its own merit by the relevant committee of the council and is then submitted to full council for consideration. There was no closing date for receipt of application forms in 1993.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an airgead a chuirtear ar fáil ó fháltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta le haghaidh Chiste na Gaeilge, íoctar suimeanna le Bord na Gaeilge, le raon leathan d'eagrais Ghaeilge dheonacha agus i leith tograí éagsúla Gaeilge. Scrúdaítear gach iarratas de réir fiúntas an cháis agus a thábhacht ó thaobh chur chun cinn na Gaeilge de. Ní bhíonn gá le foirm iarratais i gcás Bhord na Gaeilge ná na heagrais dheonacha Ghae7ilge. Bíonn foirm iarratais ar leith in úsáid i gcásanna eile (cé gur glacadh le corr-iarratas ar uairibh a rinnedh ar bhonn litreach). Ní raibh spriocdáta le haghaidh iarratas a ghlacadh i 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the Chief Executive Officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. The guidelines are higher for persons aged 66 to 79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Similarly, a medical card can be awarded to an individual member of the family, where the circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>The income guidelines therefore are not the sole determinant of whether a person receives a medical card and I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special medical needs. In view of this I do not consider it necessary for health boards to review the means test criteria applying to pensioners or to introduce modified income guidelines for any particular category.</P>

      <P>Statistics compiled by the Collaborative Study Group which is examining the area of medical manpower in acute hospitals indicate that there are 2,325 non-consultant hospital doctor posts in public hospitals in Ireland, 805 of which are filled by non-EC nationals. There are also approximately 200 other posts in public hospitals sponsored by medical schools etc. which are mainly concerned with teaching and research.</P>
      <P>The high dependency on the availability of non-EC nationals especially in some small to medium sized hospitals has been a cause for concern to my Department for some time. It was one of the reasons for the establishment for the Collaborative Study Group. The Group which consists of representatives of my Department, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board outlined a number of proposals for change and their implications in its discussion document which was circulated to all these with an interest in the subject. The Group is proceeding with the second part of its remit which includes, <i>inter alia,</i> consideration of the various responses to this document.</P>
      <P>I intend to await the outcome of the Group's deliberations before deciding what action, if any, is required.</P>

    <P>In 1993, almost 97 per cent of the Health allocation of national lottery funds went to support ongoing services administered by health boards or by bodies which have a close continuous relationship with my Department. This left, therefore, a small proportion of the overall funding available for discretionary type grants. The criteria and procedures used in relation to these discretionary type grants are briefly:</P>
    <P>(i) Each grant request is assessed by the relevant service division within my Department and, if favourably considered, given an order of priority among the competing requests.</P>
    <P>(ii) The Department may recommend the making of a grant to an organisation based on its ongoing relationship and knowledge of an organisation.</P>
    <P>(iii) The various requests and recommendations are then considered by me during the first half of the year and again towards the end of the year. Some requests have to be dealt with quickly from time to time, and these requests are assessed in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>(iv) Each organisation receiving a lottery grant is informed in writing that the grant may be used only for the approved purpose and that certification of expenditure must be submitted at the end of the financial year or on completion of the project, whichever is the earlier.</P>
    <P>(v) Unsuccessful applicants are also notified and advised that they may submit a new application for consideration <Col N="451" /> from the following year's allocation.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year a standard application form is in use for grant requests from the health allocation of national lottery funds. There is no closing date for receipt of applications, although as the year progresses less funding is available for distribution.</P>

      <P>Details of young people who have left school early are supplied twice yearly by second level schools to the FÁS local employment offices for compilation of a social guarantee register. In the time available, it is not possible to give the details requested. However, I will communicate with the Deputy separately on this matter.</P>
      <P>FÁS then contacts those involved with a view to placement on appropriate training or employment programmes, including Youthreach. Young people are also recruited to the programme as a result of direct contact, and referral from social workers, community workers, gardaí and the probation and youth services.</P>
      <P>The annual school leavers' survey indicates that some 5,200 young people left school early without any qualification. This represents approximately 7.8 per cent of all school leavers. A further 11,700 students left school with junior cycle qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youthreach is delivered jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment through the vocational education committees and FÁS. I am providing 1,000 additional Youthreach places in the education sector during 1994 to cater for unqualified early school leavers. Arrangements have been initiated between the Departments and between the vocational education committees and FÁS to identify where these places should best be located. This process will also take account of needs <Col N="453" /> indentified through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Area Based Partnerships.</P>

      <P>National lottery funding was allocated to my Department 1993 under the following headings:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Current Sport Programmes.</P>
      <P>£6 million.</P>
      <P>Sports Capital Programmes.</P>
      <P>£5.7 million.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Current Sport Programmes.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the sport's current programme grant aid was awarded to 71 National <Col N="454" /> Governing Bodies of Sport. A list of these bodies is attached at Appendix A.</P>
    <P>Grant aid was awarded through the following schemes:</P>
    <P>1. Under the Annual Grant Scheme grant aid is awarded to National Governing Bodies of Sport to assist in the areas of Administration, coaching, the purchase of specialised equipment, attendance at meetings of technical and executive committees of European and World bodies and Special Projects aimed at increasing participation and raising standards of performance.</P>
    <P>2. Under the International Grant Scheme grants are awarded towards the cost of hosting or attending International events generally of World or European Championships.</P>
    <P>3. Under the Elite Sportspersons Scheme grant aid is awarded to assist elite sportspeople undertake training and competition at the highest level.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid under these schemes an organisation must be recognised as a National Governing Body of Sport by Cospóir, the National Sports Council and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>(4) Grant-aid is given to the Olympic Council of Ireland to assist with the preparation and sending of the Irish team to the Olympic games and to meet the International commitments of its affiliated sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>5. Grants are provided to the Vocational Education Committees to meet the costs of:</P>
    <P>(a) Staffing and running of Outdoor Education Centres.</P>
    <P>(b) Assistance to Youth and Sports clubs at local level.</P>
    <P>(c) Special Projects in disadvantaged areas and the development of youth services in County Dublin. At the end of the year the vocational education committee supply a report to the Department detailing how the grant was allocated. Each vocational education <Col N="455" /> committee is responsible for having an application process.</P>
    <P>6. In order to implement my Department's &ldquo;Sport for all&rdquo; campaign aimed at increasing participation in Sport, funding is also provided to vocational education committees and to a limited number of organisations to promote sport for all.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for a copy of the Annual Grant application form, the Guidelines and Regulations governing the schemes, and the leaflet outlining the criteria for recognition as a National Governing Body of Sport to be forwarded to the Deputy. At present officials at the Sport Section of my Department are preparing the Sport Section's Annual Report for 1993. When this is available a copy will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sports Capital Programmes</i>
    </P>
    <P>A total of £5.7 million was allocated to my Department in 1993 for the sports capital programmes as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Major Sports Facilities, £5 million. Recreational Facilities Scheme, £0.7 Million.</P>
    <P>This allocation was provided to meet payments in respect of existing Projects under the multi-annual capital programme where grants were originally allocated in 1988. The level of construction activity on these projects determines the expenditure in any year. In 1993 a number of major projects did not proceed as anticipated. The resultant savings were allocated to some existing projects where the original grant was insufficient to complete the facilities. A number of new projects were also included for funding.</P>
    <P>Because the funding provided by Government in 1988 was fully committed to specific projects it was not possible, with a few exceptions, to allocate grants to additional projects. Consequently, a large volume of applications had accumulated from various organisations throughout the country seeking grant aid and these applications were used in determining <Col N="456" /> the new project allocations. The criteria used for selection of new projects included the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the nature of the worthwhile recreational facility being provided by the local community;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the progress made on the project to date by the various organisations, in particular the level of local funding already raised;</P>
    <P>&mdash;efforts to ensure an equitable geographical spread of funds;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the ability of the organisations to spend the grants in accordance with financial procedures;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the availability of similar competing facilities in the area.</P>
    <P>All organisations seeking grant aid must make an application for the proposed project providing information on site availability, local funds, estimated costs and other similar facilities in the area. This information forms the basis for the assessment of the application in relation to the provision of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Standard application forms are currently available from the Sports Section of my Department for organisations wishing to apply for grant aid from national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>In view of the extra funds of £3 million available to my Department for the Recreational Facilities Scheme applications for grant aid will shortly be invited by way of public advertisement. A closing date for receipt of applications will be set in the advertisement.</P>
    <P>The list of organisations which received funding in 1993 is attached at Appendix B which I propose to circulate with the official report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Youth Affairs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Youth Affairs Section of my Department received an allocation of £11.404 million for the operation of the Youth Service in 1993 which is funded by the proceeds of the national lottery. This allocation was expended on the <Col N="457" /> schemes and programmes outlined below:</P>
