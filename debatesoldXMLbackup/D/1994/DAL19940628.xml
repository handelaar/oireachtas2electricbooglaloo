      <asker>Mr. J. Higgins</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>in view of his commitment to Dáil Éireann on 11 May 1994 the composition of the Western Development Partnership Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with my statement on 11 May, the Government has agreed terms of reference for the Western Development Board and nominees have been obtained from county enterprise boards, Leader groups, area partnership companies and the forum group in Connemara.  The board membership will include representatives of the social partners and the State development agencies.  In total there will be 14 members, including the chairperson.</P>
      <P>The process of establishing the new board and appointing members is virtually completed.  It will be finalised later this week and the inaugural meeting of the board will take place in early July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic focus of the board will be to provide direction to the activities of the various public agencies and community <Col N="834" /> based organisations involved in economic development in the west and to do this through an action plan to be compiled and published within 12 months.  I am satisfied that the new board will be fully representative and play a key role in enhancing the development of the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  One of the authors and driving forces behind the report.  Archbishop Joseph Cassidy of Tuam, has announced his retirement, and I am sure we all agree he was an outstanding, humane and progressive Archbishop gifted with superb powers of communication and that he will be sorely missed.  I am happy, however, that he will continue to head the Developing the West Together crusade.</P>
      <P>Will the new partnership board have a chief executive officer?  Where will the board be based?  Also, in view of the fact that the focus for this came from the western bishops, will one of the western bishops be represented on the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the board will decide that a chief executive officer is necessary.  It is a matter for the board to decide and I am leaving it to them.  The question of where it will be located is also a matter for the board.  I believe that is what the people there would expect.  We all appreciate the magnificent contribution Archbishop Cassidy made to the development of the west and to encouraging every type of community activity, local development and voluntary organisations, throughout the west.  He has been a beacon of light in the development of the west and we are delighted that despite the fact he is retiring early, he will continue to be active in that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the western bishops, who have given much needed focus to the particular problems in the west and who understand the problems, should be represented on the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a judgement on whether they should be on <Col N="835" /> the board.  Nominations have been sent in and will be completed within a week or so to allow the board to start up early in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Higgins and the Taoiseach in wishing Archbishop Cassidy every good fortune and health in his retirement.  The Western Development Partnership Board is nothing but a toothless talking shop.  Will the Taoiseach outline the powers he expects the board will have and what it will be enabled to do?  Does he expect it to produce an interim report and will it be able to discuss the measures and action the board will be able to take when the report is produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government set up a task force to look at the report presented to us and we accepted all their recommendations.  Deputy Kenny's comments should be directed at the people who asked for what they are now getting. As I said already, it is a matter for the board to put together an action plan and we are not dictating what it should do. That is the way it wants to carry on its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>What funding, if any, has the board received?  We need funding for the west.  We know what has to be done. Has any funding been put in place for the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already put funding in place for the administration of the board.  The Deputy is also aware that funding will go to the western region, including Donegal, under the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>What caused the delay in the establishment of the board? Does the Taoiseach agree he will have to take the west a little more seriously after the recent events in west Mayo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not need to remind me; I come from the west and always take the west seriously.  No board was set up or report dealt with as <Col N="836" /> expeditiously as this one.  That should be clear to everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated previously that the problem is population stabilisation.  What areas does it propose to tackle in terms of job creation?  At the end of the day it is all about jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question deals with the composition of the board.  If the Deputy wishes to put down a series of other questions he should feel free to do so and I will be happy to answer them.</P>

      <P>Information on the number and value of bursaries awarded by An Chomhairle Ealaíon to individual artists in all disciplines is contained in their annual reports, which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  The most recent report available is that for 1992 which was laid before the House on 9 November 1993.</P>

      <P>If all the Minister's answers are as brief as that one Question Time will be over shortly.  The answer gives no information.  While reasonable provision is made for certain areas in the arts, particularly the visual arts and literature, other areas are sadly neglected so far as bursaries are concerned.  I am thinking of areas of the performing arts such as dance, music and drama.  Will the Minister acknowledge there is an overwhelming need for the provision of bursaries for individuals of exceptional talent in that area?  I have in mind individuals who, due to the nature of their talent, must go abroad to further their studies.  There are half a dozen prodigies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to provide the Deputy with as much information as possible.  There is an excellent booklet published by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, <i>Bursaries Awards and Scholarships 1994.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy it is important that she and I respect the distance the Minister responsible stands from the Arts Council.  It was part of my function to argue for an increase in funding for them from £10 million to £13.25 million, an increase of nearly 30 per cent.  That said, I want to answer the Deputy's question with as much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fact as I can.  In addition to the list of bursaries, which I am delighted the Deputy has, there are other bursaries which the Arts Council administers on which, from time to time, people have sought information.  The significant increase in their funding enabled the Arts Council to address some of the areas where enough has not been done, for example, the Deputy mentioned the area of dance.  There is always a wonderful opportunity for the private sector to become involved in funding bursaries. I would welcome this but it would not assist anyone if I interfered in the adjudicating <Col N="839" /> and refereeing process the Arts Council is entitled to enjoy under statute.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the Deputy regarding the burden on families and individuals.  It reminds me of the ground I had to take up which perhaps had not been seeded very well and the welcome explosion of interest in the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the role of the Minister <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Arts Council but, as a politician, he should consider it part of his role to bring to the Arts Council his experiences in his constituency.  If the Chair will be patient with me, being the day that is in it with few questions on the Order Paper, I will instance the experience of two very gifted people in my area, one a gifted violinist from Cork city in the fourth year of his study in the Juilliard Conservatory of Music in New York and who never received a bursary to enable him pursue his studies despite the fact that his talent is bordering on genius. He has had to make do with whatever bits and pieces of funding were made available through Cork Corporation or other sources, mainly private ones.  I ask the Minister to take that as an example of a small number of people who need bursaries.  Will he try to influence the Arts Council to consider such cases? Like me, he respects the discretion of the Arts Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the wrong impression is created, I want to make it clear that every year the Arts Council funds several bursaries for very worthy people, including those involved in music.  I am sure that all the people who have gained bursaries appreciate the way in which they have been treated by the Arts Council.  Applications outnumber the bursaries available.  It would be desirable if assistance could be given in every case, but that is not possible.  I fight for <Col N="840" /> increased funding for the Arts Council and I respect its integrity.  One cannot, therefore, try to influence its decision in certain cases.  I can, and must, draw attention to areas of neglect when making public statements and when I meet the Arts Council.  For example, I have said that there is a need for more funding for dance.  I will continue to make my views on the need for more funding for the arts known in public fora.</P>
      <P>A crucial decision was taken on the formation of the Government to appoint a Minister with responsibility for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This demand was not made by previous parties in Government and I am sure the results of this decision will be very worthwhile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon is the main source of funding for the arts in this country and enjoys statutory independence in the disbursal of its funds.  It is at present undertaking a significant amount of research on a number of projects in the arts sector and I understand that later in the year it will be publishing some results of this research.  In addition, An Chomhairle is at present examining the possibility of establishing with private sponsorship an ongoing research programme in a third level institution. <Col N="841" /> Should this project prove successful.  An Chomhairle believes that detailed information on the operation of the arts sector, its funding and new mechanisms for such funding &mdash; taking account of international, and especially European, models &mdash; will be researched and the results made available to interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply &mdash; obviously steps are being taken to achieve what is suggested in the questions. Will the Minister agree that the present method of financing the arts is unsatisfactory in so far as funding is coming from too many disparate sources and it is impossible to determine priorities and policy for the arts?  It is important that funding for the arts be put on a more firm basis if we are to form proper policy for the future.  The worst thing that could happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that first he must restore the amount of lottery funds initially envisaged for the arts when the national lottery was set up?  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have a good deal of discretion in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome increased funding for the arts from whatever quarter.  There is no problem with a proliferation of funding.  The funding from the private sector is very welcome and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Cothú which enables people to provide support for the arts in a professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the level of funding for the arts even <Col N="842" /> during my short time in office; the increase from the £10 million to £13.25 million is quite significant.  This amount is not sufficient to enable me to do many of the other things I would like to do in this general area.  I share the views of Deputies that increased funding should be made available.</P>
    <P>On the question of study and research, the publication of the studies on which the Arts Council is engaged will clearly and unequivocally make the case that expenditure on the arts makes not only cultural sense but also very good economic sense in terms of the way the money is spent and what is achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question about the restoration of the level of lottery funding for the arts to that envisaged when the national lottery was first set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that when the party was in Government it did not seek the establishment of a Ministry such as mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is useful information and is valuable in terms of providing a context in which to interpret my answer.  The Deputy's party in Government did not seek the establishment of a Ministry with responsibility for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; it was happy to let arts remain on the periphery. Neither did it seek, as part of its programme for Government, the restoration of lottery funding to the level envisaged when the national lottery was set up.</P>
      <P>In contrast, this Government made the arts a central focus and has increased funding.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be seeking more funding for the arts so as to ensure that the level of funding is nearer that envisaged in the national lottery legislation.</P>

      <P>The question asked the Minister if he thought it would be useful to carry out a national survey on <Col N="843" /> all sources of funding for the arts.  Is he satisfied that enough information is getting through to consumer groups about the various sources of funding available?  Many groups, including choral and drama groups, experience difficulties in getting basic information about funding and do not know where to go to get it at national and European level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's suggestions are positive and valuable and I will consider them.  In the past organisations such as CAFE, Creative Activity for Everybody, and others published valuable books which provided information on funding and gave the names and addresses of foundations.  I am willing to look at the possibility of similar information being provided by my Department. The publication of the studies undertaken by the Arts Council will be of assistance in this respect.  Even though all the studies may not be important, the study being carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on the economic impact of the cultural industries, which hopefully will be published in the autumn, will give us an opportunity to look again at this area.</P>

An bhféadfadh sé tuairim a thabhairt dúinn go díreach, freisin, cén uair a bheidh an tseirbhís úr á craoladh, an bhféadfadh sé insint an raibh aon chomhráití idir é féin agus na húdaráis i dTuaisceart na hÉireann?  Bhí cruinnithe againn le lucht craoltóireachta ansin, lucht teilifíse UTV, BBC agus tá suim acu i gcláir Ghaeilge.

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá an obair a bhaineann le Ceannaire a cheapadh ar siúl fós agus tá na hagallaimh críochnaithe ag an gComhairle.  Beidh siadsan ag cur tuarascála ar fáil do Raidió Teilifís Éireann, a bhfuil an cúram orthu an duine a cheapadh.  Níl a thuilleadh eolais agam thar an méid sin ag an bpointe seo.  Maidir leis an dara ceist a chuir tú orm, is é an spriocdháta ná go luath i 1996, nuair a bheidh an tseirbhís nua teilifíse ar fáil.  An tríú cuid, táim ar aon intinn leat féin.  Bhí cainteanna idir oifigigh mo Roinnse agus feidhmeannaigh ó na stáisiúin agus seirbhísí teilifíse eile, ar nós UTV agus Channel 4, in Albain agus sa Bhreatain Bheag.  Bhí a lán cainteanna againn, maidir lena dtaithí <Col N="847" /> féin ar chúrsaí teicneolaíochta, thraenáil, chláir a chur le chéile agus mar sin de Rinneadh a thuilleadh plé ag cruinniú foirmiúil agus ag an bpointe seo táimid ag dul ar aghaidh ar bhonn go mbeidh sé ar ár gcumas an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil ar fud an oileáin.  Tá mé dóchasach gur mar sin a bheidh sé ach caithfear, mar shampla, fanacht le cur le chéile na tuarascála, agus, chuige sin, tá coimriú á dhéanamh ag an taobh eile.  Ní chabhródh sé le héinne a thuilleadh a rá ag an bpointe seo, ach go bhfuil mé dóchasach go mbeidh sé ar fáil ar fud an oileáin.  Tuigfidh an Teachta go bhfuil sé sin nasctha le cúrsaí craolacháin eile agus caithfimid na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach chomh maith.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  a 6 agus Uimh.  a 9 le chéile.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to similar parliamentary questions on 7 July 1993 &mdash; columns 1453-1456 of the Official Report &mdash; the question of loaning State artifacts from the national collections is primarily one for the national cultural institutions themselves.  Before any such loan can be made the host institution must satisfy the highest standards of security, curation and environmental controls.  In the case of the National Museum of Ireland, a further stipulation is that loans can only be made available to a country, city or other museum operated by a local authority, as I indicated in my reply of 25 May 1994, columns 345-346 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon has a collection of contemporary art created over the past 30 years, numbering in excess of 700 works.  It is the policy of An Chomhairle to make these works available to publicly accessible buildings throughout the country and this policy is pursued with vigour to the extent that the greater part of An Chomhairle's collection at any given time is on loan to institutions throughout the State.  Public agencies may apply to An Chomhairle Ealaíon for works on loan, a condition of which is that the agency insures and otherwise properly maintains the works on loan.</P>
      <P>I fully support this policy of prudent management which is designed to ensure the widest possible access to our heritage consistent with the integrity and safety of the national collections for posterity.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to accept the caution that informs the policy implemented by officials of the National Museum and National Gallery.  Will the <Col N="849" /> Minister accept that there is a perception that works of art, particularly those in the ownership of the National Gallery or the National Museum, would not be properly displayed or cared for if they were given on loan to public galleries. libraries or other suitable public buildings in cities and towns throughout the country? Will the Minister accept that there is a cultural imperialism, from which I thought we had walked away, that to be housed properly such works of art must be put on view in the capital city?  Will the Minister agree that there is no justification for housing works of arts in the basement of the National Gallery when they could be displayed adequately and properly in galleries, public libraries or other public buildings in provincial towns and cities and that there is no justification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not believe anybody would argue against environmental controls and the functions of curation, in other words, the making safe of the object or painting involved.  Adequate display management must apply.  Under recent legislation which I introduced valuable heritage works were made the property of all the people of Ireland and I do not believe any of us would argue against the laying down of proper conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's view in regard to cultural imperialism.  However, before making such statements she should give precise examples of where criteria were met and works refused.  The matter could then be dealt with through the institution <Col N="850" /> or my Department.  If valuable artifacts which are part of our heritage are to be displayed in good locations and properly cared for, institutions should be brought up to the required standard.  In that way national collections could be national by being accessible to as many people as possible.  That would be the proper way to deal with the Deputy's concern.</P>

Those are important matters. There is no point in conducting a straw person to attack in this regard.  The more works that are displayed in public venues the better.

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the worthwhile criteria in regard to artifacts and works of art held outside the national institutions are applied in a non-restrictive manner? There is a tendency, although not necessarily in respect of the National Gallery, for institutions to establish criteria and use them as a blocking device to ensure that nothing leaves their control.  Is the Minister satisfied that is not the case in these circumstances?  Will he undertake to examine how criteria are implemented as distinct from being put in writing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the spirit of the Deputy's supplementary question which enables me to repeat what I said in reply to Deputy Quill.  When Deputies outline specific instances it enables me to investigate the day-to-day management of the criteria.  I would go further than that suggested by the Deputies.  Cultural institutions are what I would term independent autonomies with responsibility.  They are independent but have a responsibility to the cultural life of the nation.  I will investigate any cases where it is alleged the criteria are being abused and not interpreted in a proper manner.  Local and regional museums can take up matters of concern with the newly established museums authority.  When the Arts Council lends valuable works it insists that they are housed in buildings accessible to wheelchairs.  That complies with the perception in this House that people with a physical disability should not be excluded from access to collections of art.  I will consider the matters raised by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I share the Minister's concern about the protection of our artifacts and so on.  Will he accept that in order to protect such <Col N="852" /> works of art it is easier to have them in cellars and basements in the National Museum than lend them to museums throughout the country where they would be more meaningful for people?  For example, a stone axe head found in my home parish, Bennakerry, is probably buried in a museum here.  If it was on display in Carlow would it not mean much more to local people in creating a link with the past?  Are we not overplaying the safety aspect?  Who will run away with these objects from museums throughout the country where many valuable objects are on display? There is a need to strike a balance.  We could overplay the safety and protection aspects and never put anything on display.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for using the word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; because it is necessary to strike a balance. As he is aware, the national monuments legislation which is proceeding through this House will make the heritage of Ireland the property of its people based on the fundamental principle that from the moment the people declared themselves independent they declared their right to their heritage.  That being so we are under an obligation to conserve it. The more knowledge people have the more public support there will be for it and the greater the public outcry the more opprobrium there should be against those people who have gathered parts of our heritage from islands, monasteries and graveyards to put them on the market place.  I hope also that the legislation will bring to an end the mentality that there are parts of our heritage on which private gatherers can put the stamp of private property.  When people abuse any aspect of our heritage they are stealing from the people.  That matter will be dealt with in the legislation.  I will try to see how a balance can be struck because the more people are aware of their heritage the greater the public support for strong legislation and sanctions to protect it.</P>

      <P>During the summer holidays I will make it my business to find out what works of art and paintings are being stored.  Does the Minister accept that the Committee of Public Accounts was told less than two years ago that it was then costing more than £30,000 to store certain paintings out of view in the National Gallery?  Does he also accept that these paintings could be put on exhibition adequately in galleries throughout the country?</P>

      <P>My Department and An Chomhairle Ealaíon have very good relations with the Department of the Environment in relation to the arts, culture and heritage agenda and the role of local authorities in its promotion.  An example of this relationship is the engagement by local authorities throughout the country of specialist arts officers whose salaries are funded 50 per cent by An Chomhairle Ealaíon and 50 per cent by the relevant local authority.  In addition, An Chomhairle makes available programme grants to local authorities to supplement their own funds for the promotion of the arts.  At present 20 local authorities avail of this programme.</P>
      <P>I understand from An Chomhairle Ealaíon that it has requested three-year arts development plans from all local authorities and that when these plans have been received and assessed, it is hoped to enter into agreements with local authorities for arts promotion over the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon also has close <Col N="855" /> relations with Temple Bar Properties Limited, which is a public sector development operating under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and there is a number of cultural projects being developed by Temple Bar Properties Limited which have the support of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that, in addition to the foregoing, my colleague the Minister for the Environment has recently written to me suggesting the establishment of a small group comprising our two Departments, Temple Bar Properties Limited and An Chomhairle Ealaíon to look into the 1 per cent capital scheme for artistic features currently administered by him.  I welcome this approach from the Minister for the Environment and I propose to issue a favourable response in the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>It is also important to say I am pleased that many of the new public facilities funded by the Department of the Environment and operated by local authorities allow for exhibition areas for the showing of visual arts.  In particular, the growing role of county libraries in this regard is notable and acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister for the Environment wrote to the Minister recently in respect of an aspect of this matter.  Does the Minister accept that local authorities have a key role in promoting the arts within the regions? Does he also accept that there is a great disparity between the provision made for the arts in cities and in the regions, particularly the midlands, and that it would not be unreasonable to ascribe this to the fact that local authorities in the regions are not as active as they might be in promoting the arts?  I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment on 21 June 1994, midsummer's day, the response to which was as follows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that an arts officer in a local authority region is a focus point for progress and <Col N="857" /> development of the arts within that region and that local authorities which have not appointed arts officers are doing less well in terms of the promotion and development of arts and culture in their regions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill asked a very good question to which I think she knows the answer, which is that local authorities which have not appointed arts officers damage the arts infrastructure of their respective areas and should be encouraged to appoint such officers if they have not already done so.  In relation to the three-year plan to which the Deputy referred, whenever a local authority with an arts officer is committed to the arts and prepares a three-year plan, one can see the shape of the territory. There are local authorities without arts officers who may engage in a voluntary effort to overcome that omission, but it is still not satisfactory.  Furthermore, there are areas in which the people have cultural rights and deserve the provision of arts, but they may not have an arts officer or strong voluntary activity and, worst of all, no buildings.  Therefore, there are all these different combinations. When I investigate the expenditure of the Structural Funds I will look at the problem in terms of that complexity of different needs.  Again, in answer to Deputy Quill, it always was &mdash; and is now more than ever &mdash; in the interests of local authorities to appoint arts officers and have them working on development plans.</P>

      <P>In an earlier question the Minister referred to the problems of transferring works of art from national institutions to other, separate buildings. Specifically in relation to libraries, which as the Minister will know is one of my hobbyhorses, has he been in touch with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, about the need to ensure adequate funding of public libraries as they play a major role in the cultural life of local communities?  Has a programme been drawn up in this respect as most of the institutions to which national pieces <Col N="858" /> of art or artefacts could be transferred are likely to be owned or controlled by local authorities?  Will he negotiate or devise a scheme with the Minister for the Environment for upgrading these facilities to enable the transfer of pieces of art and artefacts on loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To save time, I shall be delighted to communicate further with the Minister for the Environment following Deputy De Rossa's suggestion, one which I support.  Since a library is a public cultural space, if it is possible for such space to be used beyond reading, its multi-purpose usage would be ideal.  I note the Deputy accepts it is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  I have indicated my views on the crucial importance of libraries to local communities and will have no difficulty in communicating further with my Ministerial colleague outlining the Deputy's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are on the eve of spending the largest amount of Structural Funds on infrastructural projects nationwide. In that respect will the Minister say whether he had any commitment from the Minister for the Environment that the scheme, enabling 1 per cent of the capital cost of a project to be expended on the provision of a work of art, will be deployed in the case of every project funded from Structural Funds?  Does he have the commitment of the Minister for the Environment to encourage local authorities to make maximum usage of that very good scheme enabling artists to work in their regions and local authorities to provide public works of art in their respective areas which they were unable to fund previously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The small working group will be beneficial and it is better to allow it to examine the scheme first because there have been different experiences. Positive initiatives have been taken by different local authorities which might well merit extension across the scheme.  For example, I am aware that some local authorities sought permission <Col N="859" /> to use the 1 per cent to obtain the services of an adviser on how to use it across a wider canvas.  I believe the working group will approach it like that.  In addition, I will be endeavouring to ensure that as we spend this exciting amount of money wisely in relation to the arts we endeavour to observe this 1 per cent criterion. I am very anxious that the working group meets &mdash; certainly I am cooperating with it &mdash; and that it will review the scheme as quickly as possible so that, if improvements prove necessary, they can become the subject of further talks between the Minister for the Environment and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced my agreement in principle to the proposal to relocate the Chester Beatty Library to the Clock Tower Building, Dublin Castle, under the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> and work on the scheme has already commenced by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>This undertaking will entail the restoration and extension of the existing Clock Tower Building in Dublin Castle for the eventual use of the Chester Beatty Library.  Prior to the library being relocated to the Clock Tower, the refurbished building will be used during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, which will occur during the second half of 1996.  Accordingly, the building will not become available for use by the library until 1997.  It will be a matter for the trustees and staff of the library to make the necessary arrangements for the transfer and to determine the date of opening to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in the <Col N="860" /> meantime, relocation of the Library from its current premises in Shrewsbury Road, Ballsbridge, will involve the resolution of legal matters pertaining to the Chester Beatty Board of Trustees itself and the negotiation of a new relationship between the board of trustees and the State to reflect this major investment by the State in the library.</P>
    <P>I should say that the transfer of the library to the Clock Tower will significantly increase its exposure to the public and in the process maximise the cultural, educational and tourism potential of this priceless collection of manuscripts, paintings and other works of art.</P>

Furthermore will he indicate whether the Chester Beatty Trust will incur any of the cost of restoration?  Is there any indication of what manner the costs of maintaining what will clearly be a more expensive location &mdash; in terms of maintaining the building, securing it and so on &mdash; will be met?  Will the Minister state whether the substantial Exchequer investment, will emanate from direct Exchequer funding, national lottery funds or another source?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to give Deputy De Rossa as much information as possible.  Indeed Members have been very positive about the value of the Chester Beatty collection, which is of international significance, and all have agreed that the move would allow greater access to a great national treasure.  The capital cost involved in the move is approximately £5.5 million, £3 million of which will come from Structural Funds and £2.5 milion from the Exchequer, which is the answer to that part of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to funding, Deputy De Rossa will appreciate that in my reply I stated there are matters to be resolved. For example, the Bord of Trustees always indicated in their meetings with me that they need to take legal steps to deal with the issue of the Board of Trustees and the disposal of the building.  I speak from <Col N="861" /> having read the file some time ago &mdash; the figure of £5.5 million does not include display costs which would arise.  I am endeavouring to answer the Deputy's question by imparting as much information as possible.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the will of the late Alfred Chester Beatty there is a number of trustees.  They include a nominee of the Taoiseach and a nominee of the President. The Director of the national lottery is an ex-officio member and the remaining trustees were named in the will.  I do not wish to go into the area of what measures trustees need to take as they go to court to address the issue of the trust and the question of the disposal of the building.  What I meant by public investment is the £3 million from Structural Funds and the £2.5 million from the Exchequer which is being invested in the project, a significant public investment. Those matters must be dealt with in the manner I outlined.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to undervalue the importance of the Chester Beatty Library and its cultural importance to this city and the country &mdash; it is important that it should have a better location &mdash; but I am concerned to ensure that where public money is invested there is a concomitant responsibility on the trust to acknowledge that and ensure that the public interest would not be ignored at a future date.  However, I am sure that in any legal arrangement between the trust and the State the public interest will be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>It is the policy of An Chomhairle Ealaíon to encourage artists to live and work in their communities throughout the country, a policy I totally support. The measures applied by An Chomhairle to achieve these policy objectives include support for arts centres, exhibitions for locally resident artists and, more particularly, support for studio spaces in which artists can work locally.</P>
      <P>I understand from An Chomhairle Ealaíon that it currently supports 12 artists' studios throughout the country offering up to 100 places and hopes to improve on the number of studios in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish the concept of the artist as a worker in the community who has needs similar to other workers.  While I accept and appreciate what has been done to date by the Arts Council, will the Minister accept there is a wider need to provide workshop space for young graduates <Col N="863" /> from art colleges who sometimes seek to work on a co-operative basis from home rather than having to emigrate?  Will the Minister acknowledge that young artists need more start-up assistance than is available at present?  Will he give an assurance that there will be an intensified effort to enable both young and not so young artists work at home and become part of our cultural economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that many graduates coming out of art colleges and art institutes find it difficult to rent premises and that is a real problem.  The Arts Council has been of assistance in providing revenue grants to 11 studios &mdash; six in Dublin, three in Cork, one each in Galway and Wexford.  These were set up by artists to provide space for the kind of people the Deputy refers to.  Some of those studios have become the permanent home of some artists because it is expensive to rent in our economic climate.  In addition to these studios, the council offered set-up grants for 15 studios in 1993.  I do not believe a study is needed but every significant place where the arts are likely to flourish there should be co-operation between the different authorities to see if the number of studio places can be increased.  I view this favourably.  I believe it can be achieved with co-operation between the private sector, the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  Surely there is great capacity, too, under the new urban renewal scheme to consider where this desirable cultural and artistic need could and should be met.  This could be taken into account in local authority submissions. My Department will co-operate with other Departments in promoting the expansion of such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer is encouraging.  Does he envisage a role for the county enterprise boards in this respect, particularly for areas that are not well served currently?  There is disparity between areas.  Areas in which the city or county manager is interested in the arts and an arts officer is on the local <Col N="864" /> authority are doing reasonably well, but not as well as circumstances would demand.  However, I am conscious of other areas where the emphasis is not as great on the promotion of the arts.  Will the Minister consider the county enterprise boards having a role to play in providing for this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a foolish Minister who would stray into the territory of another Minister.  Nevertheless I cannot ignore the Deputy's supplementary. My reference to different bodies that might co-operate in this area was illustrative rather than exclusive.  The county enterprise development boards are appropriate in this regard.  I am aware that some have accepted applications and grant-aided studio space. What could be more at the base of enterprise than creative activity, craft on an art base to a high standard turned into a product aimed at excellence.  It makes immense sense to take account of that also.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Since neither man nor woman can live on art alone, I favour the concept of supporting artists.  Yesterday I visited my local school and saw there the work of a visiting artist under whose guidance the sixth class at the school had done superb work.  Will the Minister encourage such activity on a wider scale so that many schools will benefit from such direction and support?  Despite many primary teachers being jacks and &ldquo;Jacquelines&rdquo; of all trades, some are not artists &mdash; I was not one either.  Art work is of great value to artists and the future of our younger people.</P>

      <P>I must reflect on the Deputy's question.  I have seen the artist-at-school scheme at work.  I visited a school in north Dublin a few months ago for the finish of the period of the artist in residence.  In that school there was co-operation betwen the school, the local community and the Arts Council.  While it is a matter for the Arts Council, the artist-and-school project should be <Col N="865" /> encouraged by co-operative ventures from which we all benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The RTE Authority has a unique role as custodian on behalf of the people of the national broadcasting services.  It has been a long-standing practice that the Government appointed a member of RTE staff to the Authority although serving in a personal capacity.  I will consider in the light of the discussions which will follow the publication of the Green Paper the case for continuing the existing arrangements and any alternatives suggested.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I understand from RTE that a committee, composed of elected employee representatives and nominated management personnel, has recently come into operation within RTE, following the recommendations of an internal joint management union working group that had been established last year, under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.  I am confident this new forum will provide a vehicle to help ensure greater employee participation in the organisation.</P>

      <P>The point of the question is to seek to treat all State agencies <Col N="866" /> equally.  My understanding is that about 35 State agencies, companies of various kinds, currently have staff elected to their boards.  As RTE is an important part of our life, it seems that the fairly large workforce there would have a particular creative input to what is produced by RTE and should have some say on the authority.  On that basis I propose that an elected representative of staff should be appointed to the board.  I am not too worried as to what device the Minister applies to achieve that, provided the person appointed is representative of the staff as distinct from being plucked out, so to speak, and placed on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance there is one constraint on the new authority, that since I changed the broadcasting legislation last year, it is the first to have equality legislated for it.  If the number of people on the authority is seven, three must be men and three must be women and, if there are nine, there should be four men and four women.</P>
      <P>That having been taken into account, I repeat the point I made in my reply.  I know what the Deputy is suggesting and I am sympathetic to it.  I must also take into account that RTE is not a separate entity or simply an industry; it carries a public broadcasting requirement.  For that reason the Government felt it necessary to nominate directly to that authority and then to have a nominee of the staff included.  I said I will look at that practice to see what case has been made for it in the past and how it has worked. I will look at the alternatives, including the Deputy's suggestion, when the discussion on the Green Paper turns to the question of structures for RTE.  I am always giving dates for which I am hanged afterwards, but I am aiming for publication of the Green Paper &mdash; which will become part of the discussion &mdash; in September.  I will try to see what is the best mechanism.</P>

Bhí laghdú 23 faoin gcéad ar líon na ndaltaí a diúltaíodh.  Is léir mar sin go raibh an laghdú ar an líon a thuill an deontas ag baint leis an líon ar na rollaí.  Mar adúirt mé, tá athbhreithniú déanta ag mo Roinn ar an scéim labhairt na Gaeilge agus tá scéim nua curtha i bhfeidhm sna limistéir Ghaeltachta ón scoilbhliain 1993-94.

Tá suim ag na Teachtaí atá i láthair sa cheist seo agus labhraíonn siad Gaeilge agus dá bhrí sin ba chóir go mbeadh an méid eolais agus is féidir acu.

Ach maidir leis na daoine óga, isé a dúirt siad ná, &ldquo;tá Béarla agamsa&rdquo;.  Cheap siad go mba chóir go mbéidh Bearla á labhairt ag gach éinne san áit, cé go raibh deontas, déarfainn, á fháil acu agus faighte acu leis na blianta.

One has only to recall the &ldquo;Emperor's Warriors&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Kremlin Gold&rdquo; Exhibitions to appreciate the quality of the material we have been attracting. While I am satisfied that we have some suitable facilities and premises to accommodate major international exhibitions, I am anxious to ensure the continual upgrading and improvement of our arts infrastructure so that we can attract more major exhibitions of international significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> In this regard, the new Operational Programme for Tourism, which is currently with the European Commission and should be finalised shortly, will outline the broad plans which I have to upgrade and improve this infrastructure.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to answer that question.  If the Deputy gives me details of what he has in mind I will have the matter investigated.  We have been well served by international exhibitions.  I acknowledge that facilities are inadequate in some respects and in the context of Structural Funds expenditure I will see how I can upgrade facilities to ensure we meet the requirements of significant international exhibitions. As will be seen from the list circulated with my reply, a number of significant international exhibitions are being held here this year and a number were held in the past, but there is still work to be done in attracting major exhibitions.  This will require funding and I intend to put forward proposals under the operational programme for Structural Funds for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Has the Cultural Relations Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs a role in initiating touring exhibitions and, if so, is it sufficiently resourced to do so?  To be candid, this is an area about which I know little, I am merely looking for information.  As we speak, a group exhibition of Polish artists is being unveiled in the Crawford Gallery in Cork.  That is due entirely to the initiative of one woman living in the area who saw the opportunity and organised an exchange of paintings between artists in Ireland and artists in Poland.  That kind of exchange is beginning to take place and we should take encouragement from it.</P>

What is done by way of voluntary effort is of great value and credit is due to the people involved.</P>
      <P>To answer the question on the Cultural Relations Committee, that body is the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is a very important committee which enables the movement of people from and to this country.  I agree with the Deputy it is a committee that deserves good funding as it is a very fine ambassador for this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Deputy to my reply of 23 February last to questions relating to the production of a Green Paper on broadcasting &mdash; columns 482 to 487 of the <Col N="874" /> Official Report &mdash; in which I outlined the consultation procedures involved in its preparation and the general areas which it will examine.  Work is ongoing on the completion of the paper and, as I indicated to the Select Committee on Social Affairs of this House recently, I hope to be in a position to publish the document in September.</P>

      <P>I already welcomed the Minister's proposal to publish a Green Paper.  What method of consultation will he put in place to ensure there will be wide public discussion of the published document?  Clearly the consultation in the preparation of the Green Paper is likely to have been confined to specialists in the area.  I suggest he takes a leaf from his colleague who established the very innovative Convention on Education &mdash; perhaps such a forum might be a useful way of having a wider public input to the Green Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the publication of the Green Paper will be widely welcomed and at least will be the occasion for a good and thorough discussion on broadcasting.  Its purpose is to stimulate a wide-ranging and fundamental discussion which will lead to legislation that will bring us to the end of this century and well into the next &mdash; broadcasting legislation tends to last a long time.  After publication and the usual forms of consultation I will give consideration to other measures, including the one suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister might consider one of the Oireachtas joint committees as a vehicle for such consultation.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued by a press report which indicated that an issue to be dealt with in the Green Paper is the possible establishment of a quota system for Irish music.  Has the Minister done the impossible and discovered a way of defining Irish music?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last part of the Deputy's question first.  I do not regard it as an unachievable aim to define <Col N="875" /> Irish music.  I will come to this issue when I deal with the proposals for the music industry next year and I will not be guided by the press.  In reply to several parliamentary questions I said that the issues in broadcasting that must be looked at include what public service broadcasting is in the 1990s; how it has changed from when public service broadcasting was discussed as a central form of broadcasting in easily regulated systems and to take these set of concepts in an area that has been totally changed by technological development, international developments that cross borders, the availability of services and the arrival of commercial services.  I have to examine all of these as well as the issue of structures and institutions.  In the preparation of the Green Paper I have tried to direct my attention to the lineaments of the field that will be necessary to have a thorough discussion rather than to the detail only. The detailed question the Deputy asked is one to which I can return.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Office of Public Works that they received such a report from an archaeologist in accordance with the requirements of an excavation licence granted under the National Monuments Acts.  It would be reasonable to expect such a report to accompany any future planning applications covering the area in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is a difficulty with sites where there is clear evidence that local people are concerned about protecting and conserving them?  It would be of immense value to local authorities to have the <Col N="877" /> information that now rests with the Office of Public Works at an early stage?  Wicklow County Council is the planning authority for the area and is responsible for making decisions on the conservation of heritage sites.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what is in this report?  I understand there is evidence of a major ringfort on the site as well as the medieval remains already identified by local groups.  In the interests of protecting our heritage and facilitating openness at this stage will the Minister make this report available to the local authority?</P>

      <P>In responding to the question I explicitly said it would be reasonable for the local authority to seek and receive a copy of the report with any planning application for the site that the local authority might have to consider.  As the Deputy said, Wicklow County Council is the planning authority so one would expect the officials of Wicklow County Council to seek a copy of the report accompanying any planning application.</P>

It is quite normal for a report such as this to be lodged with the Office of Public Works.  Will the Minister outline the legal status of this report, the subject of copyright?  Will he agree also that there are circumstances other than those which pertain to lodging a planning application where a planning authority would have no interest in knowing precisely what was on the land?  Considerable work is being carried out on land adjoining that site and it would be of immense help to the planning authority to have the information.</P>

The question that then arises is whether officials of Wicklow County Council have sought a copy of the report.  That needs to be established.</P>
      <P>What I said on legal matters is that I did not want to infringe on any legal matter.  On the question of copywriting a report of this nature, I have said that I thought it unusual.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, is deliberately designed to be short. It is largely confined, at this stage, to making two major changes to the existing competition law.  I would like to make it very clear that we are taking the opportunity to make these widely supported changes without changing the fundamental basis of the Competition Act, 1991.  The two main amendments are improvements and will enhance the operation and applicability of the law within the State.</P>
      <P>I fully accept there is a great need for debate in this House and in the public arena on the principles and priorities in the whole commercial law field.  Deputies will be aware that I recently established a company law review group to look at a number of questions in this area.  There is a clear need for critical analysis at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group has broad based <Col N="972" /> terms of reference.  It can make recommendations in the area of our overall commercial law regime and I have asked it to report regularly to me with its recommendations and findings.  I look forward to discussing these recommendations in the relevant Oireachtas committees.  I assure Deputies that their views and contributions will be valued in our efforts to enhance the application of policy in this area.  This Bill is a first step and should be seen as such.  There will be continuing opportunities to input to the policy process in relation to company and business law.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill provides for public independent enforcement of the competition rules.  The existing system, whereby the principal means of enforcement was through private actions by individuals in the civil courts, has proved, in the period of operation, to be less than fully effective.</P>
    <P>We have seen very few actions in the courts and there has, to date, been no award of damages to an aggrieved party. To strengthen the application of the law I propose to introduce public enforcement of the competition rules.  The power to make investigations and to take actions will be given to the Competition Authority. To underpin this new function I propose to appoint a member of the Authority with specific responsibility for enforcement matters.  The new member of the Authority will be known as the director of competition enforcement.</P>
    <P>The second major change to the law proposes to remove all mergers from the scope of section 4 of the Competition Act which prohibits agreements between undertakings which prevent, restrict or distort competition.  Merger or takeover agreements could, therefore, fall under section 4.  It was not satisfactory that merger agreements were subject to two sets of regulatory instruments.  Large mergers are already reviewable by me under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts.  The dual jeopardy difficulty created by section 4 of the 1991 Act had to be removed.  In this legislation I am also removing small mergers, or mergers which fall beneath <Col N="973" /> the thresholds in the mergers legislation, from section 4 of the Competition Act. Section 4 is not an appropriate instrument to control structural changes in firms.  Under section 4 of the Act a merger agreement could be licensed for a finite period of time.  This clearly does not fit easily with the legal certainty required in mergers and acquisitions. While it is clearly desirable that mergers be removed from section 4 of the Competition Act it is also recognised that, in the interest of safeguarding competition, a system of checks and balances should be retained in this area.  Our system has three components.</P>
    <P>First, under the separate mergers legislation, I retain the power to approve large scale mergers, that is, mergers where, for each of the parties involved &mdash; the purchaser and the target firm or firms &mdash; turnover exceeds £20 million and assets exceed £10 million.  Second, while merger agreements are to be excluded from section 4, ancillary ongoing agreements which are not indispensable to the merger or takeover will still be subject to section 4 of the Act.  The Competition Authority has, in its recent decisions given indicators as to what is considered, on balance, to be acceptable or necessary for the transfer of goodwill to take place in terms of non-compete agreements. Third, mergers or takeovers will not be immune from section 5 of the Competition Act, 1991.  Section 5 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>The removal of mergers from section 4 of the Act is also intended to facilitate co-operation between Irish firms and permit them to grow and take advantage of economies of scale.  This should also enhance competition by creating new products and accessing new markets. This is in line with our overall industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Before elaborating on the detail of the Bill it is important to explain the background and context in which the decision to amend the Competition Act in these respects was taken.  The NESC, the Culliton-Moriarty Group, the OECD and others agree that for a small open economy like Ireland, growth and <Col N="974" /> employment are dependent upon competitiveness and that sustainable employment growth can only be achieved by increasing the competitiveness of Irish firms.  This view was further endorsed by the social partners in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which said:</P>
    <P>Sustainable employment expansion is dependent on increased competitiveness which:</P>
    <P>&mdash; reflects the full range of operating costs for the whole economy, private and public.</P>
    <P>&mdash; requires that inefficiency and rigidity should not be allowed to threaten the long-run viability of Irish employment,</P>
    <P>&mdash; fundamentally depends on the capacity of Irish firms to innovate, to meet the needs of changing markets and to respond flexibly to the changing circumstances of customers at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Many factors influence the level of competitiveness in the economy and increasing competitiveness requires appropriate policy and action, on the part of Government and individual firms and industries.</P>
    <P>Competition policy is a key area where Government can make a positive contribution to achieving the goal of increased competitiveness.  The Government recognises that an effective competition policy is vital if we are to rid the economy of inefficiencies and anti-competitive practices, particularly in the non-traded sectors of the economy.  I stress the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; because that is the kernel of this Bill: its primary aim is the more effective enforcement of competition law in this country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing provisions for enforcement are inadequate and have not worked in practice.  I am convinced that it is necessary now to strengthen the enforcement of competition policy in the manner proposed. This view is fully supported by the OECD and by the NESC in its report on a Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and <Col N="975" /> Employment, which concluded on the following point:</P>
    <P>It is not clear that the Act provides sufficient powers to police effectively anti-competitive behaviour, with the reliance on private legal actions appearing to be a particular weakness. What is really required is that the present Competition Authority be given additional powers to initiate investigations and pursue actions through the courts if necessary.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Government gave a commitment in the PCW to give urgent consideration to, and bring forward, such changes to the 1991 Act to address difficulties in the area of competition policy and to promote further the operation of competitive markets. The objective of the Bill is to deliver on that commitment.  It will bring about the structural reform necessary to enhance competitiveness by protecting and promoting the effective functioning of the market system while at the same time affording help to the weak against those in more dominant positions.</P>
    <P>Methods of enforcement vary but most countries have seen the value of strict and effective enforcement of competition rules which includes a public enforcement element.  One of the principal beneficiaries of the Bill should be the consumer and small or medium sized enterprises, and it has to be remembered that the public sector is one of the biggest consumers of goods and services.  We want to be sure that we too are getting good value for money.</P>
    <P>This can be guaranteed only where there is open and free competition and where anti-competitive practices such as bid rigging, price fixing or market sharing are outlawed.  Cosy anti-competitive arrangements in effect are a tax on the consumer, be it the State, firms or individuals and in aggregate constitute an unacceptable burden on the economy and a barrier to innovation and enterprise and future employment.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the limited number of amendments proposed to existing legislation. <Col N="976" /> I would like to stress again that the Government proposals are confined to two main points&mdash;public enforcement and mergers as they interact with the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill has the effect of removing all mergers from the scope of section 4 of the Competition Act.  The section does not preclude the application of section 4 to anti-competitive agreements or arrangements engaged in which are not part of the merger agreement <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>Subsection 2 provides that mergers to which the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts apply, that is, mergers above the £20 million turnover and £10 million assets threshold, are protected from section 4 actions retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the competition Authority can now issue category certificates. Certificates are issued in cases where, in the opinion of the competition Authority, an agreement or arrangement does not offend against section 4 of the Competition Act.  Up to now the Authority has had to issue individual decisions in each case.  The new powers to issue a category or block certificate will assist in reducing the workload of the Authority and will cut down on the necessity for firms to make an individual notification if they are already covered by the terms of general category certificates.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a technical amendment. The effect of the section will mean that old agreements or agreements that were in existence before the 1991 Act came into force which have been notified to the Authority and which have been licensed or certified will be protected from third party actions for damages during the notification period.  An anomaly which existed in the 1991 Act which protected new agreements from action during the notification period but not old agreements has come to light and therefore is being rectified.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the competition Authority the right to take an action for breaches of sections 4 and 5 of the competition Act.  In this section I am providing <Col N="977" /> for public enforcement of competition by an independent body.</P>
    <P>Section 6 permits the competition Authority to carry out studies and analyses on its own initiative.  Under the 1991 Act the Authority had to wait for a matter to be referred to them by the Minister. This new power will give the Authority scope to target its investigation or studies as they see appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 7 permits the Minister to appoint a member of the Authority with specific responsibility for enforcement matters.  The member will be known as the Director of Competition Enforcement and will have principal day-to-day responsibility for enforcement within the competition Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a technical amendment. This section is intended to clarify in law an anomaly which, in practice, has been applied by my Department in relation to the mergers legislation.  Section 8 specifies that the monetary thresholds set out in the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978&mdash;as amended&mdash;must be exceeded by each of the enterprises intended to come under common control.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes provision for the prescription of a fee to accompany merger notifications from large scale undertakings&mdash;over £20 million turnover or £10 million gross assets in each case.  This is a measure which is in line with the general trend to make such services more self-financing.  I would like to make it clear that the fee will not be onerous nor will it constitute a burden on business; it will not apply to small-scale businesses who are not in any event required to notify me under mergers legislation.  On a technical point this section also provides penalties where false or misleading information is given in the context of a merger notification.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a standard section of the disapplication of the Public Offices Fees Act, 1879.  Section 11 removes the definition of monopoly from the 1978 Act.  This definition is no longer useful as it has been replaced by the concept of a dominant position.  Section 12 is a standard <Col N="978" /> section containing the short title of the Bill and the collective citation.</P>
    <P>Competition policy is an instrument of economic policy and must be applied within an overall reference framework required to achieve our economic goals. Competition policy is a vital part of our industrial policy and therefore must be sentitive to the needs of our economy.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in this short Bill reflects and underpins the twin objectives to support growth companies while at the same time protecting smaller firms and consumers from the damaging excess of cartels and abuses by dominant firms. Markets must remain open and competitive and must be seen to be so.  Otherwise, the spirit of enterprise and innovation will be quashed and growth and employment which we require consequently will suffer.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the positive reception the Bill has received from various representative bodies and from those involved in the operation of the legislation.  I consider we have achieved a well balanced approach and improved on the existing legislation both in terms of policy direction and in terms of the practical operation of the law.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding, subject to agreement between the Whips, that following completion of Second Stage today, the Bill will be referred to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and will be dealt with in due course.</P>

      <P>Effective competition policy is an extraordinarily important instrument in the hands of any Government in ensuring the economic well-being of consumers and people at work here, its benefits being all too often ignored. For example, there was a recent study undertaken of the potential benefits of an effective competition policy here, the result of which was to place a figure of £265 million as the benefits that could be achieved therefrom.  When one notes that this Government effectively is putting approximately £1 million into the existing competition Authority to secure that <Col N="979" /> objective and has been working on the basis of a Bill that is seriously flawed, one readily appreciates that there has not been an effective commitment on the part of Government to achieve a proper competition policy.</P>
      <P>I must also point out that the Minister gave a very firm commitment, when he responded to the Moriarty report, that there would be a programme of proposals to increase the efficiency and operation of market forces&mdash;as was said in the Moriarty report&mdash;through the relaxation of controls, restrictions, licences and other limitations whether official or private that operate to restrict entry to suitably qualified people or firms into trades, professions and services.  Sadly, we have not seen any such programme published by the Government.  No amount of jinking and weaving by the Minister will conceal that this area has not received the attention it deserves</P>
      <P>The Bill shows some indication of commitment on the part of the Minister but sadly, at the end of the day, a very halfhearted one.  Indeed at the end of these proceedings, we shall not have successfully put in place a competition policy with which we could be satisfied or of which we could be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major changes the Minister proposes today is to remove all mergers and take-overs from the law that protects against unfair competition.  This is a sweeping change.  The Minister passes it up by saying it was never intended but there is an onus on him to prove that the change he proposes is in the public interest.  In his introductory remarks he failed singularly to prove any such item to be in the public interest.  For example, he made no reference to the would be benefits that could accrue from the changes he is proposing.  That is a serious flaw.  I have serious misgivings about this. First, how can it be in the public interest to exempt an anti-competitive agreement if it is brought about by a merger or take-over but vigorously to prosecute that agreement if undertaken by a cartel? That is hard to understand and the Minister should explain why.  Why should the <Col N="980" /> fact that this agreement came about suddenly by way of a merger or take-over give it a charmed existence?  Of course, the Minister will say that he vets these proposals.  Again, that begs the question: how can it be in the public interest that decisions on mergers that contain anti-competitive elements be made by a Minister and not by an independent, arms-length authority such as the competition Authority which we have appointed? That question must be answered.  The Minister did not advert to that.  How can it be in the public interest that a takeover of a company with less than £10 million in assets or £20 million in turnover be exempt from scrutiny of its anti-competitive aspects, irrespective of how dominant the company making the acquisition may be?  Many people saw the recent attempted takeover of Cooley by Irish Distillers as an anti-competitive move.  If the company to be acquired had less than £10 million in assets or £20 million in turnover it would not come in for scrutiny under any code.  The Minister did not indicate his view on this although he indicated some time ago that he took a contrary view.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister originally announced that acquisitions below the threshold in the Act would still fall for review by the competition Authority but he changed his mind in recent weeks.  The Minister did not advert to the arguments that persuaded him to change his mind.  The House has a right to know what those arguments were, if they were cogent and coherent and if they justify the decision reached at the end of the day.  How can it be in the public interest that applications to merge will now be kept secret, giving no opportunity for objectors to air their views?  That is one of the hidden effects of this transfer of the remit to the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act which contains a provision for notification to the Minister but does not become public knowledge.  His decision would only become public knowledge where he refused them.  There is no opportunity for the voice of the <Col N="981" /> public to be heard.  If consumers or anyone else have a legitimate case to make they should have an opportunity to make those views known.  It is strange that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> does not list proposed mergers due for scrutiny.  The contrary is the case with the Competition Act where notifications become public knowledge. It is explicitly provided for in the Act that outside interests can make their views known.  A significant change in policy is being introduced and the Minister's contribution was silent on what justifies it.</P>
    <P>How can it be in the public interest that there will only be independent assessment of the merits of a merger where the Minister withholds his permission to the proposed merger but none where he gives the green light to a proposal? As I understand it, one of the major benefits of the activity of the competition Authority is that it has built up a pattern of information as to why it makes its decisions, the reasons it advanced in favour of certain decisions.  If the Minister decides to give the green light there is no public assessment, no one knows the reason some were successful while others were not.  This may be putting it strongly, the system proposed by the Minister lacks transparency as a result of the change introduced.  It lacks consistency because he suggests that one activity would be treated differently if it is done as a result of a merger than as a result of a cartel.  It lacks accountability in that the Minister does not give justification for approving certain mergers.  Admittedly, if he blocks mergers it comes into the public arena and we can see the reasons for decisions taken.  Nevertheless, people will worry if there is a suspicion of political patronage although I am not suggesting that the Minister would be involved in that.  If we have a system whereby if Ministers give a green light they are not accountable to anyone&mdash;they do not offer any reasons &mdash;I could well see people arguing that this is a recipe for political patronage, for lobbyists trying to advance their case, that there would be a golden circle of people who would have preferential access to decisions under such a system. <Col N="982" /> It is dangerous to move from a system, under the competition Authority, where we had clear transparency, public knowledge about decisions and accountability for reasons being given to one which does not have such merits.  I am worried we are not establishing the due process we should have in the area of competition.</P>
    <P>I recognise, and the case has been put by the Minister, that the present system for dealing with mergers has serious flaws.  Mergers now have to run the gauntlet of scrutiny under two separate Acts&mdash;the Competition Act and the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act&mdash;which apply separate criteria.  Business has rightly made the case that this exposes them to extra legal costs and to what they call &ldquo;double jeopardy&rdquo;. There is clearly a case for a one-stop-shop but the Minister's approach is not securing the proper way to do that. The European Union operates such a system with two separate systems: one for controlling acquisitions and mergers and the other for controlling competitive behaviour of business.  The Minister has arrived at an unsatisfactory compromise which will satisfy neither the consumer nor business.  The consumer will, rightly, be offended by the lack of transparency and accountability in the new system for dealing with mergers.  Businesses will discover that they still face the dangers of double jeopardy.  A merger would be open to challenge years later that its creation constituted an abuse of dominant position under section 5.</P>
    <P>The case has been advanced to me that there will still be uncertainty about mergers.  A person seeking to merge or to acquire a company will still wonder whether the whole edifice could be brought down years later following a challenge from a third party on grounds that it was a dominant position.  The aggrieved party challenging it could be a person who has been hurt because the merger was successful in bringing cometition to the industry and introducing lower costs or whatever.  We have to examine that issue.  I favour a one-stop-shop but competition law should be enforced evenly and fearlessly by an independent <Col N="983" /> authority.  In the case of mergers this means that their control should be exercised by an independent body, openly and fairly, and that the mergers should be exercised by the competition Authority, not by the Minister as envisaged.</P>
    <P>It would be sensible to give the present ministerial powers under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act to the competition Authority so that everyone can see what is going on; require that mergers be publicly notified and that other persons who wish to comment have an opportunity to do so. Decisions on proposed mergers should be made public so that a body of knowledge can be built up as to what constitutes an acceptable merger and not at the discretion of the Minister without clear criteria being known to the public at large.  It should be a stand alone one-stop-shop so that mergers and takeovers are approved on the basis of one application and not open to subsequent challenge. The Minister did not indicate why he saw merit in removing the potential for challenge under section 4 but not under section 5.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that section 5 deals with dominant position.  The concern about a merger is that it will behave in a way that abuses its dominant position, not the fact that the whole merger should be unpicked years later.  There should be one opportunity to vet the merger.  If the merger is acceptable it is vetted and approved.  If the merger then abuses its authority the full force of the law, undersection 5, should be used to deal with the abuse.  I fail to see why one should say the merger could be challenged years later as an abuse; in other words, one would force the unravelling of the company which was formed many years before.  I did not understand the Minister's argument about seeing a need to exempt in one case and not in the other.  If one wants to adopt the one-stop-shop approach that the Minister sees as necessary one needs a vigorous mergers Act which I do not think we have and as soon as a decision is made it should be final and not open <Col N="984" /> to challenge years later.  I am happy with the Minister's explanation.</P>
    <P>On the issue of a blanket exemption for takeovers of companies with a turnover exceeding £20 million and assets exceeding £10 million, this provision should be replaced by a more discerning provision. This is a &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; way of deciding who would be vetted.  The Minister suggested already that he had other thoughts about this matter but it is not beyond the capacity of this House to include a more discerning provision which would take into account the size of the merged group relative to its market. It is a surprising conclusion that a huge giant taking over a succession of small players to build itself up should not be subject to control.  If a big player is successfully swallowing up the minnows this may be contrary to the public interest and should, in certain instances, be open to control.</P>
    <P>We should have a discerning provision which would take into account the size of the group formed relative to its market and the degree to which the sector is sheltered from external competition.  In the exposed sector of the economy we need to build up strong and large companies. It would be desirable in exposed sectors to see companies merge and to build up Irish giants but the same argument could not be made in the case of sheltered sectors where it is believed there is controlled and anti-competitive behaviour.  If we provide exemptions we need to be more discerning rather than just say that there will be a threshold.</P>
    <P>In dealing with mergers effectively the final ingredient is that any anti-competitive action by a company following its formation must be vigorously pursued. That leads me to the issue of enforcement. We all welcome the changes in the rules of enforcement because, to my knowledge, although the Minister had this power under the Act he took no action.  Perhaps he will contradict me if I am wrong.  It beggars belief to hear him say that his Department will have a great programme of proposals to deal with anti-competitive activities in the market-place when neither he nor his predecessors <Col N="985" /> took any action.  One wonders if this is rhetoric and if there is anything behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also failed to take action under section 14 under which he has the right to investigate monopolistic behaviour. He is not now proposing to give this power to the Authority which strikes me as strange.  If one had listened to what the Labour Party said in Opposition one would believe it was a party which was convinced that there is much anti-competitive behaviour in the economy, that people are colluding and not giving a fair deal and that this was the party which would take them on.  However, it seems this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The key weakness in the Bill is that there is no proposal to impose fines on companies which engage in anti-competitive behaviour.  These fines have proven a real deterrent in other countries. In Europe a company can be fined up to 10 per cent of its turnover if found guilty and such penalties concentrate the mind.  It was always unrealistic to expect aggrieved customers&mdash;or even aggrieved competitors&mdash;to go to court against market giants when there was an abuse of power.  It is equally foolish to believe, as the Minister seems to believe, that without fines we can have proper enforcement.</P>
    <P>When the Competition Act, 1991, was debated the Minister's colleague, Deputy Taylor, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, said at column 1532 of the Official Report of 30 April 1991:</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves: is it adequate to, as the Minister is doing in this Bill, simply provide for damages and exemplary damages?  Is that what is done in other countries in similar circumstances?  Certainly it is not.  In fact, it is far from it.  What is done? How is the matter tackled?  How do the EC laws cover penalties for a breach of anti-competition regulations?  The procedure is quite different, more effective.  The EC Commission, under regulation 17/62 may impose fines for a breach of up to 10 per cent of the turnover of the company in the country <Col N="986" /> in which they have committed the violation. . . .  That is a very different kind of picture to the one envisaged in this Bill.  What is envisaged in this Bill, by way of sanction on a multinational, is small beer, would have very little meaning and, by no stretch of the imagination, would it operate as a sanction to make them think twice before breaching the competition regulations. . . . What is being done here is to deal with what, in effect, is a criminal matter, making it an offence but leaving it to a civil remedy to enforce: those two do not mix.</P>
    <P>I am more impressed by the case made by Deputy Taylor than by the silence of the Minister today on the same issue. The only power the Minister is giving the courts is the power to wag its long finger at the offenders and tell them to stop. This is not satisfactory and there must be a change in that area if we are to have an effective competition Authority.</P>
    <P>On the question of enforcement, one of the critical issues is resources.  I am amazed that the Minister is silent on this issue.  If we are to have effective enforcement by the Authority it will need resources.  It will be expensive to take legal suits against companies which behave in an anti-competitive way; it would be taking on substantial interests who have much money to lose.  We have to be willing to provide resources.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the report of the competition Authority issued in 1992 in which it is stated in paragraph 1.8 that the staff consisted of one principal officer, one assistant principal officer, two higher executive officers, two executive officers, two clerical officers and two clerical assistants a total of ten. I have now been told that there are 11 staff.  The reality was that there were three officers at assistant principal officer level or higher who were capable of carrying out the investigations envisaged under this legislation.  By contrast the Ombudsman has 16 staff at that level and his investigations do not involve the detailed work the competition Authority will have to take on.  The Minister must <Col N="987" /> gear up the Authority if it is to do its job. The cellars of Dáil Éirann are knee deep in legislation passed but never properly enforced.  The same could happen with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.9 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The Authority feels that it is incumbent to point out that authorities dealing with competition matters in other countries, including countries of a size comparable to that of Ireland, have available a large number of staff, many of whom have professional qualifications in law or economics.  The Authority is at a disadvantage, in dealing with its large volume of work, by virtue of having only a small staff and of not having available legal and economic advisers.</P>
    <P>It was not suggested that the Authority should get involved in enforcement matters. Perhaps the Minister should wipe the dust off that report and reread it because of the cry from the Authority's heart ever before taking on these powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also clarify the relationship between the Director of Competition Enforcement and the other members of the competition Authority. Questions have been raised as to whether it is correct to have a judge and policeman, as it were, on the one board.  Should the Director of Competition Enforcement be acting as a policeman while making decisions on licences?  There is an argument for giving the Director of Competition Enforcement a role similar to that of the DPP, whose sole role relates to enforcement.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill is vague on the procedure for a consumer or another third party to make complaints about anti-competitive behaviour.  A strong case could be made for spelling out a procedure so that a consumer will know where his or her rights lie and how a complaint will be dealt with.  At the very least there is a case for giving the competition Authority an explicit role in informing the public about duties and obligations under the <Col N="988" /> competition Acts.  It is interesting to note that the Director of Consumer Affairs has the power to inform the public about duties and obligations under consumer Acts.  As this Bill involves similar powers of enforcement in regard to misleading information, that provision should be inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the issue of studies. I welcome the fact that the Authority will have power to initiate studies on unfair competition.  It is ridiculous that until now such a study could not be conducted without the Minister requesting it, and I am not sure if the Minister was particularly active in requesting such studies. He appears to want to retain the power of deciding whether there should be studies on the use of monopoly positions. There is no explanation for that.  If we are giving the Authority power to carry out studies, it should be given power in that regard unless the Minister is content that there is no abuse of market power here, something about which I would not be very convinced.</P>
    <P>The legislation fails to deal with the Groceries Order, defects in which recently prevented a supermarket chain from absorbing a price increase and passing it on to the consumer, even though the supermarket chain, Dunnes Stores, proposed to do so at its own expense and with no damage to the manufacturer.  As a result of the Groceries Order it was alleged that such activity would involve below cost selling by Dunnes Stores, obviously a flaw in the definition of below cost selling.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not introduce a proper provision for below cost selling in the grocery trade, one which would protect manufacturers from unfair treatment but at the same time not penalise the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to the qualifications, aptitudes or skills necessary for the appointment of a Director of Competition Enforcement.  It is important that person appointed who will be involved in a very technical area, is the correct one for the job.  I am not suggesting this would be a party hack chosen by the Minister, but the person chosen <Col N="989" /> should have suitable skills and experience.</P>
    <P>There is confusion about a provision in the Bill which deals with retrospective exemption and how that will operate in companies below a certain threshold. That and other matters can be deal with on Committee Stage.  I outlined a number of concerns about the Minister's approach in this area and I hope when replying he will be more fulsome about the merits of the changes he proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is barely two weeks since this complicated Bill was published. It may be short, but its ramifications are considerable and its provisions require to be teased out line by line.  I am glad, therefore, that there is no question of Committee Stage being taken today.  I hope when it is taken in the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy that ample time will be allowed to consider what is a difficult Bill.  From my experience that committee is not necessarily the best place for examining matters, especially if time limits apply.</P>
      <P>As the person who introduced the 1978 and the 1981 Bills and guided them through both Houses, I am more aware than most of the need for careful consideration of this legislation.  Its concepts are new and different and are not fully understood here where, unlike the United States and continental Europe, we do not have a long tradition of dealing with anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant positions and monopolies. Indeed, it could be said that restrictive practices are part and parcel of at least one aspect of our culture and many people would not see anything wrong with restrictive practices that are of benefit to them and their colleagues, but cost the economy and consumer dearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to be said about the Competition Act, 1991 is that, contrary to the popular perception that is occasionally cultivated by some commentators in journals, the Act has worked well and has already had quite an influence on commercial behaviour here.  The fact that the number of cases taken civily and decided under the Act <Col N="990" /> is relatively small so far should not be construed as meaning the Act is not having an influence.  Many things would have happened but for the existence of the Act.</P>
    <P>It should also be stated that the standard of the decisions of the competition Authority is very high.  It is snowed under with many trivial cases but its decisions on important ones are excellent and well reasoned.  I hope it will shortly be able to clear the once-off and non-recurring raft of notifications of pre-existing agreements it received in September 1992 and then concentrate on important cases of more general application and interest.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty with the 1991 Act &mdash;as I saw at the time&mdash;was that for public expenditure reasons we had to confine its enforcement to private civil actions.  The number of actions has been small and is likely to continue to be so because the marketplace here is small and often dominated by one or two very large suppliers or retailers, and rarely will a small retailer or a small supplier take on a major supplier or a major retailer. Accordingly, clear breaches of the 1991 Act are taking place without redress.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the obvious and ongoing need control the cost and numbers of the public service there is no option at this juncture but to agree to the Minister's proposal that an additional member be appointed to the competition Authority for public enforcement purposes. If he and the Authority are to act effectively there will have to be adequate staff which will be costly, but I cannot see an alternative.  It is a measure of my and my party's anxiety to keep down and reduce public expenditure that we tried in the 1991 Act to have private civil enforcement alone.  I acknowledge that the 1991 Act is less than satisfactory without public enforcement and, therefore, I support the proposal in section 7 to amend the Schedule to that Act.  The value of that Act will become rapidly more apparent when that appointment is made after this Bill is passed.  However, nothing will be lost by a delay of a couple of months in the passage of this recently published Bill in order to ensure it is <Col N="991" /> right.  While there are unfortunate public expenditure implications in section 7, which I presume we will have to live with however reluctantly, serious difficulties of substance arise from some of the other proposed changes to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum and the briefing material provided by the Minister give the impression that the other changes are relatively minor and technical and he said so in his contribution. That is far from being the case. Some substantial changes in the law are proposed in the Bill which will not do anything to help the Irish economy by advancing the concept of competition. The opposite will be the case and small firms especially are made particularly vulnerable to the acquisitive instincts of large companies, whether Irish or foreign, if the provisions in the Bill go through.</P>
    <P>While section 8 is portrayed as a minor technical amendment by the Minister, its significance is considerable.  The thresholds are too high at assets of £10 million or a turnover of £20 million for a target company.  In many sectors of business here a large number of the companies involved would have assets or turnover below this figuure.  The result is that one large and dominant firm can gobble up virtually all its competitors.  This would be true, for example, in the beef sector, which is especially sensitive.  The combined effects of sections 2 and 8 would have the undesirable result in practice of allowing one dominant firm to absorb most of its competitors, if not all of them. That runs counter to the theory and objective of competition policy and is foolish and dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report, which is cited as gospel by all sorts of people to attain their objectives, makes no recommendation on the lines of what is contained in the Bill.  Even though the Minister referred to Culliton and a long list of others as talking about the need to improve competitiveness, which they did, the only quotation is from a document that is at two removes from Culliton, namely, the Government's <Col N="992" /> commentary on Moriarty's commentary on Culliton.  Contrary to what the Minister suggests, Culliton says on page 28 of his report that, the active use of Community competition policy to limit the emergence of monopoly positions that could damage smaller Irish producers should be promoted.  I thoroughly agree with what Culliton said on this point.  The Bill proposes the direct opposite to what Culliton suggests.  That was also the case under the industrial development Bill introduced last year.  The provisions of this Bill will lead to less competition. Instead of protecting the position of smaller Irish producers or promoting their position as recommended by Culliton, they will disappear and there will be a more non-competitive or anti-competitive position than exists at present.</P>
    <P>It seems that a few practical examples of how this Bill will work, based on specific cases that have arisen recently, would be useful in demonstrating the dangers in the Bill and why my party and I feel so unhappy about it.  Towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, a proposal by Irish Distillers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pernod Ricard of France, to acquire the share capital of the Cooley Distillery company was examined by the competition Authority. The transaction did not exceed the thresholds introduced in May 1993 and reproduced in section 8 of the Bill for the purposes of section 2 of the 1978 Act. Accordingly, ministerial approval for that takeover did not have to be obtained.  However, happily under the 1991 Act the competition Authority was able to consider the transaction and quite properly it turned it down in a well reasoned decision.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, it will be possible for Irish Distillers to make an almost identical offer to Cooley for all its assets. Neither the 1978 Act nor the 1991 Act will then apply and neither the Minister nor the competition Authority could prohibit what is obviously a totally unacceptable scenario, namely the takeover of Cooley by Pernod Ricard, when Cooley is its only competitor or potential competitor, for the purpose of closing Cooley <Col N="993" /> with a loss of 50 jobs and for the explicit purpose of preventing competition in the Irish whiskey market either here or worldwide.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that such a thing could happen, but it will happen if this Bill is passed.  Applying section 5 of the 1991 Act, the fallback position to which the Minister referred on the disappearance of section 4 for these purposes, could take years in an individual case.  While the Continental Can doctrine which it represents is valuable and is retained under section 5 it seems foolish not to pre-empt something as obviously undnesirable as the Irish Distillers-Cooley scenario I painted, and which can now happen.  It is inappropriate not to stop something undesirable happening if it can be stopped.  It seems undesirable to let such a thing happen and spend years and much public and private money unravelling it.  Such money would not have to be spent if such a thing had been stopped in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I have given one specific example but there are plenty of other predators in other sectors of business who are just as greedy as Irish Distillers and Pernod Ricard and who will want to put small competitors or potential competitors out of the marketplace.  This Bill is a charter for such anti-competitive, monopolistic forces to do as they wish.  It is entirely wrong to bring such a Bill before the Dáil to allow such things to happen.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector, which is especially sensitive here, there were a series of refusals of mergers or of agreements, subject to conditions which were never met, on proposals for takeovers by one large dominant company of smaller ones. If this Bill is passed it would no longer be possible to refuse or to impose conditions in cases such as those in the beef sector. Is it desirable that in the sensitive beef sector one company should be allowed to buy up almost all its competitors?  Rather than facilitate such mergers in such a sensitive sector, it seems it would be appropriate in the beef processing industry that the Minister should make an order under section 2 (5) (a) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) <Col N="994" /> Act, 1978 covering that sector so that all take-overs of beef processing companies, irrespective of amount, would have to be notified as is the case presently with newspapers and magazines in respect of which I made such an order in 1978 and which has worked satisfactorily since then in the common interest.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that I consider the threshold in section 8 too high.  I mentioned a number of specific cases that should have been subject to ministerial control in the public interest but which would escape scrutiny and decision by virtue of being under the new restated thresholds which re-enact the May 1993 figures.</P>
    <P>There is something of a dilemma here because if the thresholds are pitched too low it increases the bureaucratic requirements on businesses.  If, on the other hand, they are pitched too high as proposed in section 8, it allows clearly undesirable transactions to escape scrutiny. It seems, therefore, that the better way to approach this problem is not by setting monetary limits for assets or turnover but by setting the limits at a percentage of the market in Ireland.  This is the approach taken in countries like France, Italy and Spain and it is more satisfactory than having monetary limits. Even under the pre-1993 limits I can recall at least one transaction escaping scrutiny here about which I was doubtful but powerless.  This was the proposal to acquire the Wilkinson Sword subsidiary of Stora by Gillette.  Wilkinson Sword operated here through a further wholly owned subsidiary of theirs, Maguire and Paterson.  When I found that I could not prohibit the transaction here, I drew the attention of authorities elsewhere to the undesirability of the proposal and I was glad that the European Commission and the authorities in a number of other countries all turned it down.  It is curious that, although it was turned down in several other places, it was not possible to look at the proposal here, let alone to turn it down.</P>
    <P>As a result of these experiences, the Minister and the Department should give <Col N="995" /> some thought to substituting the concept of a percentage of the relevant market for monetary thresholds.  An appropriate percentage might be 30 per cent of market share after the transaction.</P>
    <P>A great many submissions in regard to the provisions of this Bill have come to hand in the last two days, many from lawyers who are seeking, naturally enough, in the interests of their clients, to further simplify the mergers and monopolies position here.  They and the Minister portray merger and competition legislation as being in some way bureaucratic, unnecessary and damaging to business and to the economy and take the view that the more of it that can be swept away the better.  That is, of course, a false way of looking at the situation.  The reason for the 1978 and 1991 Acts was to improve the economy by making it more competitive and by reducing the chances of higher prices and other economic damage by monopolies and by the abuse of dominant positions.</P>
    <P>Within reason, we must continue to maintain and indeed to strengthen our relatively weak law on these topics because our economy is suffering greatly as a result of anti-competitive and restrictive practices, particularly in the domestic or non-traded and non-export areas. This is especially true of State monopolies which are, perhaps, the greatest abusers of all.  The objective of this or any other amending legislation should, therefore, not be solely to simplify the existing law but rather to make it more effective in the public interest.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 do achieve that objective but I am very doubtful if any of the other sections achieve it and, in fact, they may bring about the contrary result.</P>
    <P>Although it is proposed to give enforcement powers to the Authority, with which I agree, they will be confined to actions for a declaration, an injunction or damages.  That action is of a civil nature.  Ireland must be one of the few advanced countries that does not have a criminal jurisdiction for anti-competitive activities of a serious nature such as operating cartels against the public <Col N="996" /> interest or price fixing.  In the great majority of countries, there is such a criminal jurisdiction.  In the United States, which is supposed to be the most free enterprise of all economies, that criminal jurisdiction has existed since the 19th century, over a hundred years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken the opportunity in this Bill to introduce a criminal jurisdiction.  Anti-competitive activities go on all the time in this country, carried out with impunity and quite cheekily, which would put their perpetrators in jail if they were done in the United States or in some of the continental member states of the European Union.  As part of that criminal jurisdiction which I suggest, there should be some provision analogous to that in the Consumer Information Act which would allow fines to be imposed on people guilty of certain anti-competitive practices, part or all of which could be paid over to those who gave evidence in the cases and who showed that they had suffered loss.  This would obviate the necessity for them to start separate civil proceedings of their own.</P>
    <P>The ideal would be if the competition Authority had power to impose fines as the Commission has in Brussels, but that, of course, could not happen under our Constitution.  The kind of fines that could be imposed here by the courts if the necessary legislation was in place would be substantial because the profits won from concerted anti-competitive practices are themselves invariably substantial. It should be borne in mind that the Commission has fined some individual companies scores of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>My conviction of the need for a criminal jurisdiction here in anti-competitive matters is based on my experiences of the operation of the existing legislation.  It is a matter of regret that in some cases of which I am aware, where a certain party became effectively the owner of certain companies without clearance under the 1978 Act, he took the view that, since no sanction could be imposed on him, he would continue as owner and operate, manufacture and trade as there was <Col N="997" /> nothing the Minister or anyone else could do about it.  This was a major weakness in the 1978 Act until it was at least partially cured in 1991.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill may, if anything, make the position of the 1991 Act worse, with the sole exception that the competition Authority, through its new member, may be able to initiate some form of investigation.  However, even if it does in the absence of a criminal jurisdiction, it seems unlikely that it will be able to bring about any worthwhile remedy.  I have noted with some concern newspaper reports over the past month or two which indicate that a large proportion of the beef processing sector may shortly be returned to the direct ownership and control of one individual who lost that control, nominally at least, in 1990 when all his companies went into examinership.  The nominal legal ownership of some of those companies in the past may have been different from the effective exercise of control of the companies and that is a matter which the legislation should take account of.  This is one of several important issues that would need to be fully considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that the explanatory memorandum issued with this Bill should contain a misleading sentence. This is the last sentence of paragraph 3, on page 1, when, referring to the removal of all merger and take-over agreements from the scope of section 4 of the 1991 Act, if goes on to say &ldquo;this amendment will furthermore facilitate growth and co-operation between smaller firms since merger or take-over agreements between the smaller firms will be excluded from Section 4 of the Competition Act&rdquo;.  Merger or take-over agreements between small firms were always excluded from examination under the 1978 Act.  What does require scrutiny and control in the interests of small firms is the take-over of such small firms by larger ones for the purpose of killing competition, and that is what is being excluded by this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is stated in this regard in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum is <Col N="998" /> entirely at variance with what the Minister stated as recently as 19 April last in a speech at an IBI seminar when he said &ldquo;under the new arrangement, small scale mergers may still be notified to the competition Authority&rdquo;.  I reiterate that, because there are mergers below the very high thresholds mentioned in this Bill which will have a distorting or cartel&mdash; creating effect.  There should be some way to look at them, although I agree there should not be a double procedure. My suggestion of a percentage of market share as opposed to monetary threshold would appear to be the most useful.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister can explain why subsection (2) of section 2 of this Bill makes the new section 19 (A) retrospective to October 1991.  Why should it be retrospective at all?  If it has to be retrospective, why is the retrospection confined to mergers or takeovers to which the 1978 Act applies by virtue of section 2 of that Act?  Why is it not retrospective in respect of those to whom section 2 did not apply, but to whom section 4 applied following the Woodchester decision?  Is there some sinister reason for subsection (2) to facilitate particular cases or people?</P>
    <P>There are numerous other points of this kind that can be made about detailed aspects of this Bill.  I do not propose to make them now but rather on Committee Stage when they can more usefully be made and hopefully responded to if the Minister is so minded and wishes to improve the legislation in a field which is tricky but enormously important.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed primarily to improve enforcement of the existing Acts By implication, this involves increasing the level of deterrence of breaches of the 1978 and 1991 Acts.  Yet the Bill proposes a level of deterrence which falls well short of what it could be.  Even the High Court will have no power to impose fines for violation of the law.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, a cartel which has enriched its members by millions of pounds and seriously damaged its competitors and consumers for many years. The competition Authority exposes the cartel and obtains a High Court injunction <Col N="999" /> to stop it.  No fines can be imposed however.  Other than ending the cartel, no penalties will be suffered by its members.  The illegally obtained benefits may be retained.  It is not sufficient answer to say that victims may then sue the cartel members for damages.  This may not happen for many reasons.  For one thing, the victims may have long since been put out of business.  This issue needs to be looked at again if real deterrence is the aim.  Serious breaches of competition law should not be cost free.</P>

      <P>First, I should say that whereas competition is on the minds of the majority of Irish people today, it is not necessarily focused on the detail of this legislation.  For that reason alone I am glad the Minister has provided the opportunity for us to look at the Bill in considerably more detail on Committee Stage because notwithstanding my wish to facilitate the early implementation of section 7, there are aspects of the Bill which concern me and which cannot be dealt with in sufficient detail today.</P>
      <P>In his speech and in other comments on this matter the Minister depicted the Bill as a reforming measure to facilitate and encourage growth and co-operation between firms.  Business supporters of the Bill and some commentators in a series of media articles have welcomed the legislation, describing it as a measure to reduce red tape and to make the Competition Act, 1991, more user friendly. At the end of his contribution the Minister went out of his way to express similar sentiments and to welcome &ldquo;the positive reception the Bill has received from various representative bodies&rdquo;.  Having regard to the very brief time that has elapsed between publication of the Bill and today's debate, I would be very interested to hear who these representative bodies are who have expressed this welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think it is not a disinterested body but is probably part of the lobby behind some of the thinking in the Bill.  Even that body regrets that it has been obliged to prepare a submission at such short notice.  If memory serves me right&mdash;I do not have the document with me&mdash;it specifies that it dealt with the matter only the day before the submission was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another argument and I may have no difference with the Minister on that point, but if the Incorporated Law Society has been caught on the wrong foot in making a considered response to the Bill, it is much more probable that bodies with an interest in the economic and public interest implications of the Bill have a great deal more to be concerned about. My initial response to the submission from the Incorporated Law Society was that it is not entirely the viewpoint of a body, as the Minister suggested, that does not have a vested interest in the matter.  It is primarily preoccupied with the bureaucratic implications, cutting through the red tape and so on.  I do not wish to cut across both Ministers as they discuss who is going to take the TEAM debate tonight.  I suggest that the best way out of the impasse is to share it between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to comment in the media, but that has been inspired by him and his officials in briefing the media to take a particular view of the legislation. He in turn completed the circle by welcoming the media's comments which have been along prescribed lines.  The Incorporated Law Society seems very <Col N="1001" /> little concerned with the public interest or economic implications of the Bill but is more preoccupied with bureaucracy and the ease with which it can do business for its clients without being subjected to double jeopardy, as has been suggested.</P>
    <P>There are welcome reforms in the Bill, most notably the granting of additional powers to the competition Authority to prosecute breaches under the Competition Act.  The core of the Bill is section 2, which seeks to remove all mergers from the scope of section 4 of the Competition Act, 1991.  This is a regressive measure which will facilitate the gobbing up of small enterprises by large companies and which is not in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Public Competition Authority, Mr. Paddy Lyons, has expressed concern about the removal of large mergers from the Authority's immediate jurisdiction.  One prominent business journalist, Martin Fitzpatrick, in yesterday's <i>Sunday Independent,</i> warned that the result of the legislation would be that &ldquo;any big Irish or European firm with predatory instincts will be able to swoop on a small company with no questions asked&rdquo;.  I will put on the record Paddy Lyons' quote in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 February last.  Mr. Lyons is worried about the removal of large mergers from the Authority's immediate jurisdiction. He said:</P>
    <P>It's a bit unfortunate that we will be doing one particular type of analysis on small mergers and publishing a report, whereas the vast majority of large mergers, which present more competition worries, might not get the same treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not get the small mergers now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has reminded me that they will not get the small mergers.  It is clear that is about as frank a statement as one is likely to get from somebody in Mr. Lyons' position. The effect of this legislation will be to remove any public vetting, scrutiny or <Col N="1002" /> examination of the take-over of any company by another company, with the exception that a large company's take-over of another large company may be subject to review under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  If this Bill is passed in its present form such reviews will apply only where the two companies each have assets of over £10 million or where each has turnover of over £20 million.</P>
      <P>The proposals seem to have been drafted without any regard to the need to protect small innovative companies from take-over by large competitors.  Under this Bill home grown companies such as Cement Roadstone Limited and Smurfits, not to mention their foreign equivalents, will be able to gobble up as many of their competitors as they can buy, provided the smaller enterprises have assets of less than £10 million or turnover of less than £20 million.  During his contribution Deputy O'Malley spent some time dealing with the implications of that for the beef sector.  I think that events that have not yet come to finality are fresh enough in all our minds for us to appreciate the significance of that for the beef sector.</P>
      <P>I agree that the thresholds are pitched too high, given the make-up of most companies in this economy.  I do not have a view on Deputy O'Malley's suggestion that the yardstick might be set as a percentage of market share rather than the level of assets and turnover.  I have no doubt, however, that the levels set by the Minister in this Bill are entirely too high, given that the requirement is on each company to have assets in excess of £10 million or turnover in excess of £20 million. That means that small innovative companies are entirely vulnerable to being gobbled up, with no questions asked.  That is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the terms of the 1978 Act applied to mergers and take-overs where each of the enterprises had gross assets of not less than £1.25 million or turnover of not less than £2.5 million and section 2 (2) states that the 1978 Act applies to a monopoly where in the most recent financial year the monopoly's sales or purchases of the goods or services <Col N="1003" /> concerned exceeds £1.5 million.  I understand that was changed by the then Minister, Deputy John Bruton, on 8 July and assets were increased to £5 million and turnover to £10 million.  The present Minister modified the asset and turnover requirement in May of last year and increased assets to £10 million and turnover to £20 million.  The proposal in this Bill seems to be a recipe to concentrate power and control of substantial sectors of Irish business and industry into the hands of an even smaller elite than is now the case.  It will certainly reduce the level of protection available to the public from mergers and take-overs and will lead to a monopoly or contribute to a level of concentration in an industry which could stifle innovation and competition.</P>
    <P>If the Bill were passed in its present form the situation in regard to take-overs could be summarised as follows.  Mergers or take-overs involving two firms, each with less than £10 million in assets, will not be subject to review under any legislation; mergers or take-overs involving two firms, one with assets of £150 million and the other with assets of less than £10 million, will not be subject to review under any legislation; mergers or take-overs involving two firms, each with assets of over £10 million will be subject to review only under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>The only arguments I have seen put forward to justify such a fundamental change in the approach to mergers and take-overs have been that the present requirements are too bureaucratic, too expensive or that there is a need to reduce red tape.  I believe, however, that the need to protect the public interest is of far greater importance than the need to reduce red tape.  In addition, most of the arguments advocating this particular approach seem to be unconcerned about its wider economic implications.  They are the views of commentators who are practitioners on the professional side of this business.  Presumably for their own legitimate reasons they see it as being desirable but I do not think they are greatly <Col N="1004" /> concerned about its wider economic implications.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary aspects of this Bill is the provision in section 2 (2) which effectively backdates the operation of the Bill in so far as it applies to mergers and take-overs to October 1991, the date on which the 1991 Competition Act came into operation.  My memory is that we enacted the legislation prior to that date but that it did not take effect until October 1991.  It is extraordinary that under this provision it is proposed that effectively it will never have applied.  It will be as if it never applied.  In other words, what the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is asking is that the legislation passed by the Dáil in 1991 and brought into operation by Order of the then Minister on 1 October of that year has never had effect.  We are being asked to rewrite legislative history.</P>
    <P>The intention by the Minister, if not unprecedented, is certainly extraordinary. At the best of times I am wary of legislation which seeks to give backdated effect to changes in the law.  It is a bad principle, one which I believe should be avoided.  When we are asked to deal with this in the final week of a session with provision only for a very limited debate, the alarm bells should start ringing.  In the context of mergers and take-overs, backdated legislation is quite simply unacceptable.  What this means, of course, is that mergers or take-overs which have been blocked already by the competition Authority can now be reopened. I wonder about the motivation behind this Bill and the reason for the desire on the part of the Minister and the Government to have it pushed through before the Houses rise for the summer recess.  I query the Minister on the purpose of this exercise and whether it is to allow the re-opening of any such take-over or attempted takeover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.  I am <Col N="1005" /> very glad that is the case and I am also glad that we will have more opportunity to tease it out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Competition Authority has refused sanction in only three cases.  The most recent of these was the controversial case referred to by Deputy O'Malley, Irish Distillers Limited and Cooley Distillers.  The Minister must deal with that particular question. Is it the case, as Deputy O'Malley has said, that Irish Distillers, or Pernod Ricard, may now re-open that particular case by changing the consideration in some nominal way and that it will sail through uninhibited?  The Minister must answer if the primary purpose of this legislation is to allow Irish Distillers to make another attempt for the purchase or take-over of Cooley.  I would be surprised if the Minister cannot reassure the House on that point because I understood the purpose of his party's participation in Government was to break the operation of the golden circle and that this kind of inside track access would be discontinued.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how it would now be in the public interest to have a repeat of the Cooley type case.  In the event of this Bill being enacted, the take-over would sail through without obstacle irrespective of the economic or other implications.  If the Minister says that it is not intended to facilitate Irish Distillers Limited in re-opening its attempt to take over Cooley, will he answer two further questions? Notwithstanding the fact that he says that is not the intention, will it be feasible when the new legislation is enacted, if it is enacted as it is proposed in the Bill, for Irish Distillers Limited to do that irrespective of what the Minister intended?  If my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and one cannot always rely on what one is told&mdash;the Minister was the subject of direct approach by the directors of Cooley prior to him raising the thresholds last April or May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequently they went ahead, obviously forgot about the 1991 <Col N="1006" /> Competition Act and came unstuck at that point.  Whatever the Minister's intention in the matter, is it feasible for IDL to re-open its takeover bid and be successful on this occasion?  I cannot recll anything as blatant as the Cooley case which involved the willingness to shut down a perfectly good plant and to make the workers redundant when there was a market for the product.  The fact that that should be allowed to happen is unconscionable. If we had a similar case under the new legislation&mdash;if it were enacted as the Minister proposes&mdash;then as I understand it there is nothing that would prevent it on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The enforcement officer would take action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it if that is the case.  That raises questions, however, that presumably we will have an opportunity to tease out on Committee Stage, including whether the enforcement officer will be resourced to deal with this kind of situation and so on, which is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised an interesting question about the absence of criminal jurisdiction.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to that issue because, without mentioning any names in the Chamber, I have been struck on occasion by the defence that is raised in respect of certain controversial matters that have happened in Irish industry in the recent past to the effect that nothing illegal was done.  That is always the cry of the defenders&mdash;was there anything illegal involved or will the report when it is published show that there was anything illegal involved and so on.?  The fact that it is unacceptable, that it is anti-competitive or that it is conducive to swallowing up smaller companies is all acceptable as long as it is not illegal. When there are no sanctions commensurate with what one would have in a criminal jurisdiction, it seems to me that certain people can say &ldquo;To hell with the law, we will plough on as before&rdquo;. Having regard to the complete absence of a provision for the imposition of any <Col N="1007" /> fines to which a company of this magnitude would pay attention, the fees involved here are similar to a fine for not having a light on one's bicycle.  That issue must be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of companies having to comply with the demands of a parallel system.  Having listened to him at some length on the subject, I feel he has made a good case that this matter should be examined.  I would be extremely concerned that it would be examined in the manner proposed in the Bill where certain companies, as I outlined earlier, are entirely exempt from any review and, even where such power exists, it rests with the Minister. I would have thought that the present Minister would not want that power.  In the reality of the marketplace, a Minister is vulnerable to all kinds of approaches being made to him once he has that power, which I believe should be exercised at arm's length.  Deputy Bruton's proposal that the ministerial powers as they presently operate be transferred to the competition Authority is the obvious one.  I do not see why a Minister of any party should be open to the kind of approaches and arm twisting that will take place, given the reality dictated by the marketplace.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the Dáil, I do not propose to avail of the full-time allocated to me and trust that the House will understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this Bill.  Competition is the life blood of true enterprise and it is important that a fair and balanced competitive atmosphere prevails at all times. In the Irish context this means a competition Authority with clout and effectiveness. I welcome the Bill as a strong contribution in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the various improvements to our laws dealing with competition which are proposed in the Bill.  In line <Col N="1008" /> with a wide range of recent legislative changes, the Bill is part of a comprehensive and exciting programme of law reform undertaken by this Government. A number of the Bill's provisions are aimed at clarifying and, most importantly, strengthening current elements of competition law.</P>
    <P>There are four elements of the Bill which I consider to be of particular interest.  First, section 5 provides for an important addition to current legislation since it confers a right of action on the competition Authority in the case of breaches of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act.  In addition to allowing the Authority respond to third party complaints, it also enables the Authority to initiate action at its own discretion.  This should greatly increase the Authority's ability to react swiftly to worrying developments.  In today's increasingly complex business world it is vital that the competition Authority can respond quickly and effectively to changing developments.  A more pro-active competition Authority is in all our interests to ensure a proper system of checks and balances in our business and commercial life.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of these new powers the Authority is certain to benefit both in terms of self-confidence and public esteem.  I am equally in favour of section 6 which allows the Authority to carry out research on its own initiative.  While contributing on a number of issues this session, I lost no opportunity to stress the vital importance of research in each sector of society.  For too long we have been complacent in this area and we have seen research as largely the preserve of educational establishments.  In contrast, the role of such activities in the industrial sector or the various institutions of the State has been grossly understated.  As a result, many unnecessary mistakes have been made and the potential for improved performance has not been exploited to the fullest possible extent. Major decisions have often been made which have not been based on the availability of all the relevant information.</P>
    <P>Research and development is the <Col N="1009" /> engine of innovation and enterprise growth.  We cannot ignore it.  It is only correct that the competition Authority be enabled to take every step to ensure that its information services are adequate.</P>
    <P>It is also prudent that section 7 provides a facility which allows the Minister to appoint a director of enforcement to the Authority.  This will give the Authority the ability to carry out investigations on its own initiative or at the Minister's request.  As the role and scope of the Authority develops it is likely that such an appointment will be considered necessary. However, if this individual is to be truly effective he or she must be well resourced.  I am glad to note the Minister has stated he will seek sufficient resources to underpin effective enforcement.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is equally reasonable.  It caters for the possible imposition of a fee in the case of notifications of merger. Similarly, guidelines are provided to facilitate the imposition of penalties where false or misleading information has been forwarded as part of the documentation of a proposed merger.  This is important if the competition Authority is to have enhanced clout.  It must be enabled to enforce penalties which will act as a real deterrent.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to stress the trading considerations which must be kept in mind as we draft legislation to ensure competitiveness in our economy.  The rights of the consumer must be protected and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, had proved to be a reforming and pioneering Minister in this regard. Every effort must be made to ensure that cartel arrangements do not develop. They are anti-competition and anti-enterprise. Individual or group enterprises must be prevented from adopting a so-called dominant position in the marketplace. A second consideration which is equally valid is that we must allow our businesses to grow to a much larger scale than is the case.  Without a substantial increase in the size of our native companies we are unlikely to penetrate foreign markets further.  Competition laws must allow for a fine balance between <Col N="1010" /> these two conflicting objectives.  The extra provisions introduced by the Bill are positive and I welcome them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of competition law which deserves attention relates to the level of awareness among both the public and companies regarding the implications of existing legislation.  Much needs to be done in the area of education to ensure that important and positive laws are used to the greatest possible degree.  While the increased scope offered by this Bill to the competition Authority will undoubtedly result in a significant improvement in the area of implementation, without parallel educational programmes it is unlikely the full benefits will accrue.  Such programmes should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  We must educate for enterprise if it is to become an inherent part of our national culture.</P>
    <P>As well as assessing the various ways in which the consumer might be better educated about competition laws, it would be useful if comprehensive statistics were compiled on the level of abuse of these laws proven each year.  Information on the extent and nature of such abuse would be an extremely valuable asset to us as legislators as we assess the potential for improvement of these laws and allow for the ongoing introduction of effective legislation.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the broad thrust of the Bill I have one major reservation. The Government has made great efforts to promote small indegenous enterprise. It produced a task force report on small business and has started to act on its recommendations.  It is cutting the red tape and bureaucracy which hinders enterprise and putting new measures in place to facilitate the granting of seed capital for enterprise.  This is an enterprise-friendly Government.  However, I do not believe that the legislation contains sufficient safeguards to protect small companies from the predatory behaviour of larger companies.  If a large company chooses to gobble up small companies there is no need for such behaviour to be referred to the competition Authority.  This is a flaw in the <Col N="1011" /> Bill which I hope the Minister will address.  We have made great strides in promoting small businesses and we should ensure that nothing happens to hamper this.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for his initiative in bringing forward legislation in many areas and for his foresight and thinking about what needs to be done. Bearing in mind my note of caution I am glad to commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputies did not have much time to prepare for this debate.  The Incorporated Law Society saw the text of the Bill in the last fortnight.  It is appropriate that on Committee Stage in the Select Committee we will be able to tease out in considerable detail many points made.  I will give a signal response to some of the points made.</P>
      <P>One would get the impression from listening to the debate that people are obliged to sell to someone who makes an offer to purchase their firm and no one is free to refuse to sell.  One would also get the impression that the spirit of enterprise, which we are all trying to foster, is motivated among other things by a desire to enhance one's own personal wealth and that such a spirit cannot reward itself by selling out at some stage in the future. We are frequently told there are impediments to enterprise in Irish culture, for example, the tax system.  People cannot earn enough and, therefore, cannot take the risk of forming an enterprise.  On top of that we are now told they are subject to predatory purchasing.  This is mushy, confused thinking which should be clarified. It is contradictory.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to clarify it at some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Bruton's point, I have consistently set out five policy points which I have espoused as Minister for Enterprise and Employment in the area of economics and in an attempt to create a framework within which we can strengthen the economy in a manner which will result in employment.  I have listed these <Col N="1012" /> points previously and I will do so again. At a macro-economic level we have to manage the finances of the economy in such a way that the external criteria, including interest rates, inflation, etc.&mdash; the Maastricht criteria&mdash;are brought to an optimum level.  Nobody, least of all our detractors on the other side of the House, would have thought that a Coalition of Labour and Fianna Fáil would, within 18 months, have brought the Irish economy to the second position, after Luxembourg, in the league of best performing and best managed economies in the European Union in terms of those five criteria.</P>
    <P>We have to maintain, because of our critical dependence on it, inward investment as promoted by IDA Ireland.  We have to make this country an attractive place for such investment for a variety of reasons, not just for the capital it brings but also for the new markets which it opens up, the innovation it brings and the products, primarily electronics, health care and pharmaceutical, it produces.  This year IDA Ireland will exceed its target of 6,000 new jobs by a factor of approximately 50 per cent.  I am reliably informed that, six months into the year, it is confident of achieving approximately 9,000 new jobs, using the normal standard method and criteria of measurement which has been in place for some time.  One can, therefore, reasonably say that we are continuing to enhance that policy area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and others might say that there is nothing particularly new in all of this, previous Governments attempted to do the same.  I would concur with those views.  My Department is committed to a specific policy of strengthening Irish-owned indigenous companies so that they can become larger and aspire to becoming multinationals.  It is a characteristic of our economy that, relative to other small European economies such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Austria, we do not have the same number of indigenous multinationals, if I can use that phrase.  To put it in a more vernacular way, we do not have enough CRH's or Smurfits.  If the <Col N="1013" /> competition Authority and Act had been in operation during the sixties and seventies it is possible that we would not have them today because of the way in which they operated.</P>
    <P>This perhaps is where I genuinely diverge from the position held by Deputy O'Malley.  We have to encourage indigenous Irish companies to become dominant players and, from that position in a domestic market, to move abroad and gain a substantial amount of international market share in the same way, to give one specific example, as Electrolux from Sweden has done.  The characteristic of all indigenous multinationals is that they have a very dominant share of their national market.  However, the term &ldquo;national market&rdquo; is now a misnomer following the completion of the Single European Act and the Internal Market. There is, therefore, a certain course which has to be very carefully steered in allowing companies, through acquisition and merger, to get a critical mass of scale and operation in place which will enable them to consolidate their domestic position and, hopefully, move on from that and be constructive in developing new markets, thereby enhancing employment at home and possibly generating employment and wealth abroad.  This is the third component of a five leg strategy which I believe is absolutely essential and different from those pursued by previous Administrations.</P>
    <P>For reference, one of the other two strategies is a specific focus on small business in a way no previous Administration has done.  I referred to the Small Business Task Force and the recommendations it generated from practitioners, not lobbyists, and the substantial array of measures in this year's budget which reflected the concerns expressed to us.</P>
    <P>If we were to do these four things the long term unemployed would not be affected in the short term or probably the long term, by which I mean five to six years, by an upturn in economic activity on the one hand and an improvement in the management of the economy by the Government on the other.  It is for that reason &mdash; the ESRI concurred with this <Col N="1014" /> view &mdash; that it was deemed necessary to take additional measures to enable the long term unemployed to return to full employment.  We have developed a series of measures from community employment, the local area development partnerships, etc., to address this problem.</P>
    <P>In this context &mdash; I set it in this context because I was invited to do so &mdash; the measures in the Bill will go a long way towards addressing this problem.  I would like to see an increasing number of Irish companies growing.  If they do this through acquisition or merger in the Irish market, in a manner they consider to be in their best interest, then so be it.  I do not want bureaucratic second-guessing or require them to declare their interests in public, which is now much wider than the national state of the Irish market: the market and the public who operate in it is now effectively the entire European market.</P>
    <P>This is one of the difficulties any Minister would have in terms of managing competition policy at present.  While the laws of this land will obviously extend to the territory over which we have jurisdiction, the reality of the market place is that anybody can come into our market. We have probably one of the most open markets of the 12 member states of the European Union.  The thresholds to which reference was made in the first instance or, as Deputy O'Malley said, the percentage of market share, will in many cases include suppliers to companies outside the Irish national market, who become critical in terms of the effect on the development of mergers and monopolies here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce for approximately eight years and I do not think it was ever intended that there would be dual reference in the Competition Act in respect of companies contemplating mergers or acquisitions.  Under the 1978 Act, there was always a threshold below which companies could, under market forces, decide either to acquire or merge, or in some other way get a bigger slice of the market action.  When the competition Authority began to take on a life <Col N="1015" /> of its own it took upon itself the task of evaluating mergers independent and separate from the Department with responsibility in this area.  It became a very bureaucratic and hazardous journey for people to travel and it was repeatedly reported to me by a number of companies that the exposure and demands associated with the compliance requirements &mdash; this matter can be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage &mdash; were a deterrent and because of the amount of documentation and information required some companies felt they were exposing themselves to a risk from competitors not necessarily resident in Ireland or producing or fabricating a product here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to secrecy in relation to mergers.  There is another side to the secrecy, that is, the need for confidentiality which the Authority has to ensure when it is looking at the way in which businesses are operating so that competitors are not given access to confidential commercially sensitive information.</P>

      <P>The Bill is very simple and straightforward and we can deal with certain aspects in considerable detail on Committee Stage.  Properly speaking, the Bill will benefit more from a Committee Stage debate than a Second Stage debate. The immunity I proposed in this section is more than safeguarded by the countervailing power in section 5 where the pro-active enforcement role is given to the competition Authority.  To take a specific example &mdash; Cooley &mdash; to which Deputy O'Malley referred, his interpretation is correct that, if this Bill was in force and Irish Distillers group applied <Col N="1016" /> to purchase Cooley, they would not have to apply in their documentation. However, if, as stated, its intention was to close Cooley, as I understand it &mdash; and this will be the subject of detailed discussion on Committee Stage &mdash; there would be nothing to prevent me as Minister exercising other powers under the provisions of the Competition Act to take the view that this was an abuse of a dominant position and contrary to the best interest of the Irish whiskey industry.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, there would be nothing to prevent the workers of Cooley, or indeed the Ardee Chamber of Commerce &mdash; to which there was a reference &mdash; knocking on the door of a member of the enforcement Authority saying they consider this abuse of a dominant position, clearly signalling in advance abuse of a dominant position or, in this instance, a monopoly, not just a dominant one, when the member of the enforcement authority, in his or her wisdom, could decide to seek an injunction and prevent the take-over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the specific case &mdash; I am speaking now from memory &mdash; when the indication was that it was doing it for competitive reasons, that it did not want to have another Irish whiskey competitor in the market.  It went on to state &mdash; again this is subject to memory and I am conscious that I am speaking under privilege &mdash; that the Irish whiskey market was not a closed market in which they had a 100 per cent share, that there were other competitors in the whiskey market, albeit not Irish whiskey but a wider whiskey market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Members do not observe the balance in the Bill then they distort the potential effect of its provisions.  I want to see as much freedom as possible for market forces to come into play.  It is ironic that I make this case while Opposition Members are attempting to refute it.  I want freedom for those market forces coming into play at local level among Irish firms accountable to our law for <Col N="1017" /> which I have responsibility to administer. I want those companies to consolidate, grow, merge and acquire without let or hindrance, without being second-quessed by well-intentioned civil servants or members of a competition Authority.  I want to do it for the unashamed reason that I want to see more large, indigenous, multi-nationals but I do not want existing companies to exploit cartels or abuse a dominant position.  First, the power to act in relation to the abuse of a dominant position is clear in law and has not been altered and second, the powers of the enforcement Authority will enable it to take a pro-active role, which was not previously the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about resources.  I acknowledge that, within the context of the introduction of the Bill for which he was responsible there was a constraint on resources &mdash; I am glad he is now in Opposition and not objecting to increased expenditure in this area.  I am not sure how much sanction will be entailed to enable us to obtain extra resources for the competition Authority. No doubt, when we come to the budget and Estimates, Deputy O'Malley will extend his sympathy to them.  However, there will be extra resources and we have made some available.  I hope that, by charging realistic but not onerous fees &mdash; nothing like accountants and lawyers charge for such mergers and acquisitions &mdash; we will be able to generate appropriation-in-aid that would persuade the Department of Finance to allocate extra resources.  For example, we have been very successful in this regard in relation to the Companies Registration Office.  I hope that, as with our success in the case of the Patents Office, where legislation is pending, we will be able to do something similar.  That would comprise part of the route we would travel in relation to achieving a balance between obtaining the necessary extra resources and having due regard to the management of public funds in respect of which this Government has been particularly successful relative to our performance within the European Monetary Union criteria.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall question of <Col N="1018" /> criminal sanctions.  I do not regard this Bill as endeavouring to do everything; it is not so intended.  The experience of this House, at administrative level among civil servants and among former officeholders, attempting to load one Bill with the responsibility of curing all perceived ills at any given time has proved not the most effective route to travel.  Nobody, not even somebody with eight years' experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, sought to introduce criminal sanctions in respect of the operation of company law.  It is a complex area.  I am not sure criminal sanctions can be introduced within the context of the provisions of this Bill; indeed I am convinced that they cannot.  Nonetheless it is an area which the company law review group will examine.  A number of issues associated with it require a balanced and considered response by people who will have to make the law work.  That is why the company law review group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Séamus Gallagher, a former practising chartered accountant and, if my memory serves me correctly, a former President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland, will bring to bear on these issues the response of people practising in the field in the various professions who will have the responsibility of implementing this law.  I was not aware that criminal sanctions existed for over 100 years in the United States of America but, if that group recommends criminal sanctions in a form yet to be decided, I will certainly look at such a recommendation.  It is my intention to make reports of the company law review group available as they come to hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the whole question of criminal sanctions in respect of such matters, including competition policy, is part of its remit and I will examine its view within that context.  We will be able to tease that matter out on Committee <Col N="1019" /> Stage if the Deputy wishes. However, in the absence of action to introduce criminal sanctions, I agree with Deputy O'Malley that a heavy sanction is not a deterrent to some people.  If we introduced criminal sanctions in a manner that had not been thought out, or without having consulted a wide range of practitioners in commerce and business, I predict that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, would be in here screeching and roaring &mdash; in the manner to which we have now become accustomed &mdash; to the effect that the deputy leader of the Labour Party was about to penalise enterprise and criminalise business activity here.  Therefore, I will not legislate for that type of circumstance until we have had a proper, considered and measured response from the people who will have a direct role to play in all this.</P>
      <P>I want to use the legislation, including specifically competition legislation, to ensure that indigenous firms can grow speedily with the minimum red tape and provide a pro-active enforcement role for the new member of the Authority, who can ensure that there is not an abuse of a dominant position, which is what Members have not taken into account.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton referred to the groceries order, the subject of a major review within my Department which we hope to conclude very soon, which comes up for review towards the end of this year.  Deputy Bruton also raised the question of skills and suitability of the new member of the Authority who would be responsible for enforcement.  I share the Deputy's view that that person will have to be properly qualified, an independent-minded person with the necessary economic and business skills to ensure he is capable of doing the job. When we come to make that decision we will bear that in mind.  I dealt with the Cooley situation to my own satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised some questions about the timetable in respect of the retrospection period.  I repeat my interjection that there was nothing I was aware of what would give rise to concern. <Col N="1020" /> The matter can be teased out in detail on Committee Stage.  I am aware of legislation being made retrospective in the past so as to ensure there was no possibility of a consequent action.  It was not to interfere with actions initiated in the courts but to close a gap in the event of an action being initiated in the future claiming that for a period something which was illegal at the time, was no longer illegal and therefore could reach into the new changed legal structure.  As I understand it, that is the reason for this legislation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I inquired informally as to whether they would be agreeable to taking all Stages, largely because I was anxious to have the enforcement provisions put in place as soon as possible for reasons which are self-evident.  Most people with whom I have spoken welcome the proactive enforcement provisions.  However, I listend to and I heard from a number of responsible Deputies that they had concerns regarding the implications and the details of other sections.  Therefore, I am happy to accept a reference to the relevant select committee for the taking of Committee Stage, when the Whips so decide.  I have dealt with most of the points raised.  It would be easier to take them <i>seriatim</i> on Committee Stage and to get clarification on the points raised by Deputies.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>As pointed out on Committee Stage and during the currency of a proposed amendment by the Opposition, in particular Deputy Sheehan, I undertook, if allowed, to revisit his proposal on Report Stage.  I said I would have a serious look at it in the context of what was proposed. I indicated that section 15, as proposed on Committee Stage, was flawed by reason of the fact that the use of foreign ships and the conjunction of an &ldquo;and&rdquo; and one or two other areas clearly indicated that the proposed amendment, from the point of view of the draftsman and the <i>locus standi</i> of the amendment, would not fit into the context of the Bill. In those circumstances I was prepared to examine the figure of £250,000 in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to meet the proposal releating to capacity plans and under-sized nets with a fine not exceeding £200,000, together with a fine not exceeding £50,000 for the latter, which would give us what might be described as the &ldquo;Sheehan amendment&rdquo;.  At no stage did I have a problem with it.  All I wanted to <Col N="1022" /> do at the time was to examine it in a legal context on its own.  I have no difficulty whatever about accepting the proposal.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that either Deputy Sheehan or Deputy Bradford did it, but othere who were not privy to the debate on Committee Stage went immediately to the front line and misrepresented me on the proposed amendment.  The House will recall that on Committee Stage I indicated that I would review the level of fines for secret holds and undersized nets with the intention of accommodating the expressed will of the House.  The House took the view that the prposal by Deputy Sheehan was what they wanted.  I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I have always taken note of what Deputies from whatever side intend.

      <P>Reluctantly Fine Gael has been forced to move this motion in Dáil Éireann this evening because of the failure of the Government to broker an agreement between management and unions at TEAM Aer Lingus.  I use the <Col N="1023" /> word &ldquo;reluctantly&rdquo; because Fine Gael took the opportunity last Friday to table a motion on this important issue for inclusion on the Order Paper and to be debated in Private Members' time.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for using his good offices in ensuring that this matter, which is of importance to many families in north Dublin and surrounding areas, would be raised in the Dáil before it goes into recess at the end of this week.</P>
      <P>The problems of TEAM Aer Lingus are inexplicably linked with the financial difficulties of its parent company, Aer Lingus, since 1991.  No one has to tell the Fine Gael Party that there is a need for financial accountability; no other party has done more to seek greater accountability and the elimination of waste in terms of public expenditure.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that there would be some movement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the unions and genuine goodwill on both sides, Fine Gael decided to table this motion to give all parties to this long and protracted dispute ample opportunity to broker an agreement or to begin the process of reaching agreement.</P>
      <P>Various Fianna Fáil Ministers, particularly Deputies Brennan and Geoghegan-Quinn, failed to take the necessary decisive action to resolve the major problems which threaten the survival of our national airline.  In other words, Fianna Fáil led Governments have failed to manage the affairs of this State company. It was only when the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, was forced to do so by the banks that he took up the cudgels on behalf of the Government to ensure that the necessary action would be taken to ensure the survival of the national airline. The Minister had a difficult job because this company was in grave financial difficulty due to the inactivity of previous Fianna Fáil Ministers who held that portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil led Government brought all sides to their senses through the Cahill plan which highlighted the <Col N="1024" /> decisions which were necessary to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus.  Although they have had to endure pain and suffering due to the gross dereliction of duty on the part of Fianna Fáil led Governments, the workforce has accepted the financial medicine which I hope will ensure the viability of this State company. I urge the Minister to seek renegotiation of certain aspects of that agreement and the agreement reached with the European Union in respect of the conditions attached to the investment of State equity in the company regarding quotas for the number of seats on various European routes and the number of aircraft in the fleet to ensure its viability.</P>
    <P>From the beginning Fine Gael has advocated that the various issues should be resolved by negotiation.  Workers should not be singled out for criticism, especially when one considers the gross mismanagement of the company since it was established.  We were all delighted on 2 March 1994 when we learned that agreement had been reached between management and unions on a £14 million cost cutting package to put the company on a sound financial footing.  What has gone wrong since?  What has changed in respect of the projections made by management?</P>
    <P>Although in January 1994 the figures showed a loss of £8 million, the company recorded losses of £32 million to 31 March 1994.  Management forecast that the redundancy package would cost £12.5 million, but it is now estimated that it will cost £28 million.  Given these miscalculations how could any company expect to survive?  I put it to the Minister that he cannot justify the management at TEAM Aer Lingus and allow them to remain in their respective positions when such serious errors have been made on behalf of the Government and the taxpayer. Any private business who behaved in this manner would have been put into liquidation long ago.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister been aware of the financial problems at TEAM Aer Lingus for a considerable period of time?  Was the Minister aware that the position was getting worse, not better, as management <Col N="1025" /> was telling us?  Will he indicate why no decisive action was taken before 1994? While I accept that the survival of our national airline was a priority, given that TEAM Aer Lingus had debts of up to £65 million and was losing a substantial amount each month, management had a responsibility to bring these matters to the notice of the Minister and to seek a resolution at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that management and unions have not come to a meaningful agreement to ensure the viability of this company long before now.  I am aware that they have been negotiating for the past 12 months and trying to reach a deal.  As the Minister is aware, difficulties were encountered by the company in 1993 in terms of seasonality.  One would have thought that management and unions would have tried to resolve these matters to ensure that the same problems would not re-emerge this year. This is a clear indication that there is mistrust between management and unions and this will make it more difficult to resolve this issue.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has been forced to move this motion in the House &mdash; the Government is being stubborn &mdash; to ensure that meaningful negotiations can take place over a finite period; we have suggested three days.  The report of the Labour Relations Commission is not seen as providing an agreed formula to resolve the dispute. One of the Minister's advisers, Graham Howett of AMA, said that the LRC plan was not necessarily the only plan to ensure the survival and revitalisation of TEAM Aer Lingus.  It was always anticipated that the LRC report would be a step along the road towards a negotiated settlement.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, intervened to ask the LRC to become involved in the dispute and he established an inquiry to find out why management and unions had not reached an agreement.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to spell out the positive benefits of acceptance of the report and to indicate with his hand on his heart if the report of the LRC will ensure the viability of TEAM Aer Lingus.  I want <Col N="1026" /> the Minister to openly indicate if this report will help resolve the company's problems and save the maximum number of jobs.  Furthermore, I want him to tell the House if he has carried out a professional assessment of the unions' plan. On many occasions we have heard ministerial and Government statements rubbishing the unions' plan as an aspiration rather than a basis for the viability of the company.  On what basis did the Government make those statements?  Has a professional assessment been carried out by the Minister's advisers?  I would be concerned if the Minister was taking the word of the management of TEAM Aer Lingus in regard to a professional assessment of this plan in view of its history to date on the financial dealings of the company.</P>
    <P>There is no use the Government insisting on a resolution of the matter by adopting a dictatorial approach if the taxpayer is again expected in the next few years to inject additional equity into the company to resolve its financial difficulties in the short term.  PAYE workers and taxpayers in general will not tolerate a continuous policy of high spending and taxation and lack of accountability by Government. This Government was given that message on the doorstep in the run up to the recent European elections.  The public does not want a continuation of this wasting of money, the hallmark of Fianna Fáil-led Governments in regard to this airline and company for the past number of years, compounded by inaction and a lack of understanding of the problems inherent in companies such as TEAM Aer Lingus.  We cannot allow a highly skilled workforce to go on the scrapheap of unemployment while the Government stands idly by without making an attempt to contact the unions and negotiate a resolution to this dispute.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by statements from the Minister last week and believed there was room for manoeuvre in regard to this dispute.  On Thursday last in particular, the Minister made an effort to move some way towards bringing together both sides to resolve the dispute.  The Minister, his officials or his colleague, Deputy Quinn, <Col N="1027" /> should have followed through on those statements by contacting the unions to clarify the messages he gave in this House.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has acted disgracefully in this matter.  From the day its leader and his candidates for the last general election went to the Aer Lingus hangar to promise the sun, the moon and the stars to the workers of the airline group there has been an unfortunate sequence of events resulting in hundreds of airline jobs being lost and hundreds more will be lost in the near future.  There has also been a huge capital injection of taxpayers' money into the company.  The Labour Party displayed the politics of irresponsibility and promise in an unprecedented fashion, but unfortunately it is the workers of TEAM Aer Lingus not the Labour Party who made the promises, who are paying the price for that irresponsibility.  We have the spectacle of the Labour Party parliamentary party calling for the unions' plan and the report of the LRC to be jointly discussed to reach agreement, while Labour Ministers within minutes of that statement being made, distance themselves from it.  Furthermore, we have the chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, wrestling with his conscience and, once more, failing. How much do the people have to put up with when they know exactly what must be done to resolve the matter?</P>
    <P>I call on the Labour Party Members of Dáil Éireann to either put up or shut up about their anxiety to see an agreed resolution of this problem by voting for the Fine Gael motion tomorrow night. It is time those working in TEAM Aer Lingus and the businesses that depend on the economic viability of a successful national airline group were shown the irresponsible and hyprocritical attitude of Government members in north county Dublin and surrounding counties.  The least the Minister could do is agree to the Fine Gael motion to sit down with management and unions and his officials and make a final attempt to agree a viable future for TEAM Aer Lingus because <Col N="1028" /> many workers and their families depend on the survival of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Hogan, I thank the Chair for allowing Fine Gael at short notice to change its motion for Private Members' time tonight.  I suspect the Government will try, as the Taoiseach did today, to imply that this involved incompetence on the part of Fine Gael.  We did not table the motion last Friday, when we should have tabled a motion for Private Members' time today, because we had reason to believe that the Ministers, Deputies Cowen and Quinn, were as concerned as we were about the future viability and survival of TEAM Aer Lingus.  We did not wish to play party politics with the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus or the company.  We allowed the weekend to pass without making a move because we had reason to believe the Minister, Deputy Cowen, following many exhortations in this House and elsewhere, would meet the unions over the weekend.  I know the unions were standing by in the hope that he would meet with them and that some solution, or at least the mechanism to find one, might be put in place.  We appreciate that the Chair changed the rules of the House to allow us take this debate this evening, at a time of impending catastrophe for the thousands of people depending on jobs in TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The opening of the TEAM Aer Lingus building on 6 May 1991 &mdash; which I had the honour to attend &mdash; by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, was warmly welcomed and was a matter of great celebration, particularly by the people of north county Dublin, I am not referring only to the constituency of north county Dublin but to people from areas north of the Liffey into counties Meath and Louth where many skilled people knew they would get good and permanent jobs in the company.  At the time the opening was referred to in the newspapers as the jewel in the crown of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, congratulated all involved in the project, but singled out <Col N="1029" /> the workforce.  He congratulated Aer Lingus, its board and management &ldquo;but particularly the workforce who have shown that they recognised the opportunity that existed and who backed that up by making the changes in work organisation and inter-trade flexibility which were necessary to enable this exciting project to get under way and succeed&rdquo;. That praise for the workforce was followed in 1992 by a speech in the Seanad by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, when she stated:</P>
    <P>We also have the magnificent TEAM facilities at Dublin Airport.  I have had the privilege of examining these personally in depth and comparing them with similar enterprises abroad.  In my view the TEAM facilities and workforce are the best I have seen.</P>
    <P>Where has that confidence in the workforce gone?  Today the jewel has turned to paste and the crown is severely tarnished. It is now claimed by the workers' representatives that the company was seriously under-capitalised from the start and that the £65 million debt was either inherited from the parent company or resulted from bad management forecasts of values of stocks and equipment and interest charges of £12.5 million on borrowing which could not have been foreseen. Whatever the reason for the crisis &mdash; obviously there are claims and counter-claims from management about workers and from workers about management &mdash; 620 people are out of work and the spouses and children who depend on their salaries are facing a bleak future if those workers go on the dole.  A further 120, bringing the figure up to 850, will lose their jobs at the end of the week unless the Government recognises that this motion is the most reasonable we, as an Opposition Party, can table without causing further distrust and lack of confidence workers have in management and management appear to have in the chief shareholder.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not tell us, which he may do, that the LRC report is the only answer to the problems in TEAM <Col N="1030" /> Aer Lingus.  We know from the meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies today that at least one management consultant said that the LRC report is not the be all and the end all.  It is a formula for a solution, it is not the formula.  The Minister has an opportunity to save face and accept this motion and not to proceed with the amendment he tabled.  If he proceeds with that amendment and the LRC's proposal as the only one on the table, I believe the 1,900 jobs in TEAM Aer Lingus will go by the board and the company will go out of business.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to replace those jobs and that company? There is work in the international market for its expert staff.  The Minister should not tell us, and expect us to believe, that he is prepared to go down the road of allowing the company to close with no chance of reopening and allow its business to flitter away from this country as it has begun to do.  As the Government's representative and chief shareholder on behalf of the taxpayer &mdash; the taxpayers and not the Minister's or my money keeps such companies viable and allows them to work in the marketplace &mdash; the Minister has the responsibility to restore the company to viability and profitability.</P>
    <P>To date the actions by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Quinn, have been totally unsatisfactory and unsuccessful.  I do not believe they set out to be unsuccessful, but their proposals and actions have not worked and the Minister must be prepared to stand up and say &mdash; and it takes courage &mdash; that the LRC report was an honest effort to try to get the sides together again, that it has not worked and that we are prepared to sit down to talk again.  I am under the impression that the Minister and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Quinn, hope that because the Dáil will go into recess on Friday the problem will die &mdash; there will be nobody sitting in the media gallery and nobody will be watching what is happening in TEAM Aer Lingus.  As a representative of many of the people who <Col N="1031" /> have been laid off, I am not prepared to see that happen and to see this dêbêcle pushed to one side while we get caught up in the usual silly season issues.  This is not a silly season issue, it is about people's livelihoods and the disruption of their lives.  A representative of 300 wives of the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus told me that many people have already had to consider the possibility of selling their houses as they do not think they will be able to pay their mortgages while on the dole.  The Minister should not give us the answers he has given us for the past week and a half that the LRC report is the only answer.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies today which I attended, although I was not entitled to speak, I was concerned about the submission made by the craft unions in which they reiterated that their aims were the same as those of the Minister, of myself, of Fine Gael and other Opposition parties: that they want the company to remain viable and return to profitability.  They said that even if they accept the LRC management terms, based on the company's figures, that would result in the saving of 2.6 per cent on total cost.  Those savings, when applied to the hourly cost of aircraft overall, result in a reduction from £41.74 to £38.56.  We know from the Minister and elsewhere the problem is that the cost per hour of work TEAM can offer to companies looking for their work is too high compared to other companies throughout the world.  There is a big difference. Deputies on this side have not managed to get the message through to the Minister that by dealing with the matter as an industrial relations problem only, we are not tackling the root cause of the company losing £1 million per week, with debts of £65 million.  Whatever the truth of where that debt came from, it is clear that by dealing only with an industrial relations element of a viability plan, this company may last for only another six months.  If the company can reach some agreement on the industrial relations level, that may give the Minister <Col N="1032" /> and the Opposition a breathing space; but that will not be the end of the problem. Unfortunately, in October or November we will face the same problems we raised tonight.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister inherited many of these problems from the then Ministers. Deputies Brennan and Geoghegan-Quinn, but he should recognise that the constructive attitude of the unions is one on which he should work.  Why in 1991 did the then Taoiseach talk about the workforce recognising the opportunity and being prepared to allow this exciting project to proceed?  Why did the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, say that in her view the workforce were the best she had seen?</P>
    <P>The unions have put forward constructive plans in the report they presented at the joint committee today. They listed a number of measures they consider they can offer.  If the Minister accepts the motion we have tabled those measures can be on the table for the three day meeting we propose and can be discussed to establish if they will have the same effect as the provisions in the LRC report.  We are all in agreement that there are serious problems in TEAM Aer Lingus.  If the LRC has come up with one formula, surely it is possible to come up with another with the same net effect acceptable to the unions.  I will list the constructive negotiation points which the union put forward.  It will offer 100 additional voluntary redundancies over and above the 200 requested to the Cahill Plan.  It agrees to total functional flexibility across both engineering groupings, avionic and mechanical.  It agrees to numerical flexibility to alleviate the high overtime costs, an issue that has got much publicity.  Many of the workers receive high wages because of overtime.  It will agree to the hiring of temporary workers, but not exploited Third World cheap labour.  It agrees to variable shifts, including night shifts.  It will enter discussions with Mr. Donnacha Hurley with a view to agreeing new, enhanced cost-saving arrangements to attract new business and further cost savings totalling an additional £15 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> I find it impossible to understand, when there is such an open agenda by the workforce, a clear convergence of expectations and needs by the workforce and management, and having regard to the unions' five point plan, that the Minister cannot agree to this motion.  I do not know what will happen tomorrow night when this motion is put.  I know what the Labour and Fianna Fáil Deputies said when they canvassed the workers of TEAM and its parent company, Aer Lingus, in north Dublin, because I canvassed those people also.  They said they would not allow any involuntary redundancies and would ensure that the Government would protect TEAM and their jobs.  They cannot continue to put their money on the LRC report when clearly it will not be accepted.  There is no divergence among Deputies; we all agree the company must be saved.</P>
    <P>The Minister must use his ministerial skills and accept our motion and not push Labour and Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies into voting against it.  If they vote against our motion they will have no further credibility with the workforce that they tried to meet over the weekend and about which Deputy Kemmy, Chairman of the Labour Party, once again cried crocodile tears on television saying that the Government must give them another chance.  That is what we are offering the Minister and his backbenchers &mdash; another chance to talk to the unions.  If the Minister puts his Deputies to the point of having to vote against the motion some of the Deputies will jump ship and destabilise the Government; alternatively, they will not jump ship, showing the cynical nature of their commitments to the workforce.  The Minister will be responsible for putting his backbenchers in that predicament and, having been a Government backbencher for a long time, I know the difficulty backbenchers face when they are not personally involved in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>There are 1,500 staff who transferred from Aer Lingus to TEAM and it is important to remember how that came about.  If the people now working in <Col N="1034" /> TEAM had stayed with the parent company where they were, perhaps, cosseted, they would not be facing this crisis.  There is a perception that by switching to TEAM they left themselves the butt of all the tidying up that needed to be done when the problem in Aer Lingus was sorted out.  There is the perception that problems which should have been handled when the parent company was being dealt with were left until it came to handling TEAM.</P>
    <P>A sum of £25 million was promised to TEAM Aer Lingus; £12.5 million was to be for redundancies.  On 3 March we listened with great relief to an announcement on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that agreement had been reached, that the number of redundancies would be 250 which would cost a certain amount of money and that the remaining £12.5 million would go into the company to assist in opening up the market and making the company more viable.  What happened? Hardly had those discussions concluded when we discovered that for some reason somebody, who has not yet been named, made a mistake and the redundancies would cost £28 million.  Not only is there not £12.5 million for equity after the redundancies are paid, there is a shortfall of £3 million to pay the redundancies. Somebody's head must roll for such a mistake.</P>
    <P>When I heard &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 3 March, I heaved a sigh of relief and I remember saying to my husband that I was thankful that an agreement had been reached, that although 250 people would lose their jobs they would, hopefully, be people whose families were reared and who might manage on the redundancy package.  I thought an agreement had been reached under which not only would the parent company be solvent but so too would TEAM Aer Lingus.  Within days that collapsed.  Is it any wonder that there is no trust in the unions and that there is worry about the management in TEAM?</P>
    <P>I do not believe all the problems are the fault of management but that, perhaps, the shareholder representatives on the board of TEAM have not been doing their job as effectively as they should. <Col N="1035" /> The annual report of 1991 states that the transfer of about 1,500 staff from Aer Lingus to TEAM Aer Lingus was agreed following assurances that their status as Aer Lingus employees would not be diminished by the move and that that agreement, together with the preceding ones on trade integration and productivity, marked a new high in industrial relations and pointed to much greater co-operation between staff and management in meeting the business challenges ahead. There was a firm commitment in the annual report that the workers moving to TEAM had some security of tenure in their jobs.</P>
    <P>The report also stated that the TEAM Aer Lingus strategic plan aimed at revenues of IR£144 million and pre-tax profits of £13 million by 1995-96.  If in 1991 somebody was making predictions of profits of £13 million by 1995-96, how are we debating losses of £1 million and debts of £65 million?  I cannot get to the bottom of what has gone wrong and where the blame lies.  It is not fair to blame the workers and to ask them to make all the sacrifices.</P>
    <P>If the Minister genuinely wants to see this company survive, his only option is to accept this motion, withdraw his amendment and allow Deputies from both Fianna Fáil and Labour to support this motion.  Then there is a chance that by the weekend this company will be moving towards a viability plan that will work and bring the company back to profitability.  I wish to share my remaining time with Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>

      <P>As a north Dublin Deputy I am very depressed about the developments of recent weeks.  There are 1,900 jobs on the line.  We have all tried to adopt a constructive approach and this motion is part of that.  We see it as a way of trying to break a serious deadlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made the proposals of the Labour Relations Commission a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; package on which there can be no discussion or negotiation.  Initially there was not even to be sight of the substance on which the <Col N="1036" /> Labour Relations Commission recommendations were based.  The Government cannot continue to maintain that position.  The Government never signalled that the findings of the Labour Relations Commission inquiry was to become a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; package. Those whe entered in good faith into discussions with the Labour Relations Commission did so on the basis that they were putting forward their sincerely worked out strategy for the future of TEAM.  For the Government to allow no further talk on the Labour Relations Commission proposals is not playing the cards fairly.</P>
    <P>Everyone, unions included, recognises that TEAM Aer Lingus has a serious problem of competitiveness.  No one claims that there is a painless solution to the problems facing TEAM.  However, the Minister must recognise that workers in TEAM Aer Lingus have in the past seen management plans unravel rapidly. They need the conviction that this time there is a strategy that offers a chance of success.  They do not see that in the Labour Relations Commission proposals. No one would suggest that the Commission, skilled as it is in industrial relations, has the capacity to design a strategy for the future of this company. The only ones who can design the strategy are management, the Government as representative of the taxpayer and shareholder, and the workers and their representatives. All we are asking is an opportunity over the next three days for those three parties to speak directly to each other.  We are asking that those parties sort out their differences and any misunderstandings that may have arisen.</P>
    <P>The workers demand and deserve to have explained to them the Minister's strategy to create a successful enterprise in TEAM.  All they are seeing is a series of cuts.  It is important, even from the taxpayer's point of view, that we see the strategy that can convert a company with £65 million accumulated losses and, if we are to believe the Minister, no markets. How do the Minister and management propose to remedy that?  I want to know, that as a representative of the people in <Col N="1037" /> north Dublin who are making their living directly from TEAM.  Almost every business on the north side of the city will be affected if TEAM closes.  The Government has built its reputation on the concept of partnership and all we are asking is that it honours that commitment to partnership by sitting down with the three parties involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth time in the past two weeks I have spoken in the House on the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus. On each occasion I placed firmly on the record the financial unsustainability of the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; unsustainability may be too weak a word, the calamitous financial position are probably more appropriate words.  It would be a calamity not only for workers in TEAM Aer Lingus and their families if this company is forced to close; it would be a calamity for the whole economy of north County Dublin and the surrounding regions if common sense <Col N="1038" /> does not prevail and if people refuse to adapt to changes in the market place.</P>
      <P>Aviation and all its constituent sectors are fiercely competitive international businesses in which there is one fundamental principle: the need to adapt to survive.  None of us likes change, however, even less do we like the alternative which is sometimes extinction. There is one acid test of any company's standing in the market place and that is the balance sheet.  By that yardstick, TEAM has failed, particularly in the last two years.  TEAM Aer Lingus has a financial crisis of absolutely enormous magnitude. On normal commercial criteria. TEAM would be insolvent.  With continuing losses, huge debts and increasingly more competitive trading conditions the company would be in receivership were it not for the support of the Aer Lingus Group.</P>
      <P>There has been an investment of £110 million in TEAM to date, but it has failed to earn a return on this investment.  With cumulative negative reserves of £55 million, a negative net worth of £15 million, debts of £69 million and increasingly more competitive difficult trading prospects, its current trading position is unsustainable.  Cash resources to fund losses are no longer available.  No more debt is available from the banks and the parent company has no spare capital to invest other than the £25 million agreed as part of last year's £175 million rescue package.  This is the last opportunity to tackle the core problems of the company which are controllable.  Even the £25 million is strictly conditional on agreement within the company on measures which would ensure the long term competitiveness of the company and also on proving this conclusively to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worse still, the company has an immediate cash crisis &mdash; it ran out of cash this month &mdash; and it is only suviving because its wages and other bills are being paid by the airline to the extent of £500,000 per week.  Let us be clear where that money is coming from.  It is coming from cash generated by the airline, due in large measure to the sacrifices of airline <Col N="1039" /> staff who have adapted to changes in their market-place.  These staff are paid, on average, one-third less than their counterparts in TEAM.</P>
    <P>Why is there a crisis in TEAM?  It is due, among other things, to changes in conditions in the market.  Its competitors have adapted to these changes but unfortunately TEAM has not &mdash; it is as unpalatable as that.  TEAM has had a captive market in Aer Lingus maintenance. However, as the Aer Lingus fleet has been modernised the quantity of Aer Lingus maintenance has declined.  For the first time the airline is only paying open market rates for the maintenance it requires from TEAM.  These rates are set by TEAM's competitors who have adapted their work schedules and cost bases to the requirements of the market-place.</P>
    <P>The third element of TEAM's revenue is business outside the Aer Lingus Group.  This is the litmus test of its ability to survive, not only in the short term but also in the medium to long term and, unfortunately, it currently fails this test. TEAM's outside revenue has fallen by £10 million or 18 per cent, from £57 million in 1992-93 to £47 million in 1993-94. That is a chilling statistic which we cannot wish away.  TEAM's market is dwindling.</P>
    <P>The crisis at TEAM has been evident for some time.  There have been talks for the past 18 months and negotiations for the past nine months.  Meanwhile TEAM's competitors have grabbed TEAM's market share as TEAM headed for the financial rocks.  It was to keep the company off the rocks that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, invoked for the first time section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  This is a clause that is used only in exceptional circumstances and it was invoked when it was clear that a last ditch effort was needed to bring the parties together to discuss common problems.</P>
    <P>The crisis in TEAM is not only exceptional; it is immediately critical.  We are dealing with the survival of the company, with 2,000 highly skilled, well paid jobs, <Col N="1040" /> with the families of these employees who rely on continued employment to pay mortgages and other bills and with the life-blood of the communities in which they live.  I understand the problems faced by communities such as this where rationalisation or restructuring of a semi-State company takes place and I empathise with backbench Deputies who receive representations in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was a backbench Deputy a few years ago when Bord na Móna had to be restructured and 1,200 jobs were lost in my county where there is little alternative employment.  In that case there was no equity injection and trading conditions were even worse than for TEAM.  If Bord na Móna had not adapted to survive it would not exist today.  It has restructured and gained strength again, not employing as many as it did but employing significant numbers in my home county.  If change had not taken place, we would not have Bord na Móna, despite the huge contribution it had made in the last 60 years.</P>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus has made a great contribution since 1980.  However, the commercial facts must be confronted if we are to save companies such as TEAM Aer Lingus.  There are no easy or half-way-house solutions.  The Labour Relations Commission was brought into play because there was no common agenda.  There was a stand-off position, with no possibility of a resolution to the problems and different analyses were taken by the two sides in the company. The Labour Relations Commission put forward compromise proposals to deal with the immediate problem.  There is much to be done and many decisions to be taken for the medium and long term viablity of TEAM, with the spirit of partnership and co-operation, if the company survives in the short term.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the gravity of such a financial crisis and there is no easy fix solution to the problems.  What seem intractable problems can be resolved only on the basis of a co-operative, common sense approach.  The LRC were invoked because they were the <Col N="1041" /> experts in this area in terms of bringing the two sides together.  Unfortunately, no common agenda could be established even at this late stage.  The responsibility then is to make decisions that will help us get over the short term problem.  The problem will not go away and if we do not resolve it, the situation will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The motivation of Government from day one has not been to precipitate a crisis but to avert it.  For the crisis to be averted we require decisions to be taken. There is a prospect, once we avert the short term crisis, of getting into meaningful discussion on the medium and long term strategies to which the workforce can make a real input and in which their proposals can be properly assessed and evaluated.  I have made that commitment clear at all times.  That is real participation, that is where people are staking out their future, but we must have a corporate entity in existence in order to chart the future.</P>
    <P>The financial problems are of such magnitude that, unless we deal with the core issues now, it will be very difficult to see how we can develop medium to long term strategies.  We need to deal with the issue very quickly.  I have emphasised from day one, for the purpose of everybody understanding the gravity and seriousness of the problem, the need to take on board the LRCs settlement terms as a short term measure, a first step in many that will have to be taken to resolve the problem.  The problem is complex and difficult and involves difficult decisions for people on all sides.  The problem will not go away and we cannot wish it away.</P>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus has been involved in this crisis &mdash; whether in the parent group or in the company itself &mdash; for many months and experts in the area were brought in to try to resolve it.  The LRC has seen at first hand the immediacy and extent of the financial crisis facing the company.  After 18 months the parties cannot agree a common agenda for talks, let alone a common approach to the resolution of the problem.  As I said already, the LRC proposals are compromise terms and represent neither a victory nor <Col N="1042" /> a defeat for anyone.  They are and must be the basis for settling this dispute.  The LRC is critical of both management and unions.  However, there is no time for recriminations if we are to prevent the company from closing.  There is no point in getting involved in what at this stage would not be a very successful pursuit of an historical grievance, even though the grievance may be justified.</P>
    <P>The change in management structures has begun and that process will continue. That is one of the ways in which trust can be re-established to a level that one would expect in a company as modern and as sophisticated as this.  That will and must continue, and I have never shied away from it.  In the meantime while we are awaiting that to be done, we have a crisis of such urgency and gravity that we must take decisions, accept the framework that is available, build on it and use it as an evolving process by which we can look to other issues that are just as important as the core issues that the LRC proposals throw up.</P>
    <P>I contend that we should accept the LRC proposals as the first step in ensuring the short term survival of the company. This is necessary but not sufficient to ensure its medium to long term survival and not its development.  The trade unions have made that point and I accept it.  Let me reiterate my firm and unequivocal commitment to them that immediately they accept the reduction in the company's cost base, as provided for in the LRC terms, I will have their formal proposals professionally assessed and implemented if they can be shown to contribute to the company's development. I will go even further, I will guarantee that this assessment will be completely independent with, if necessary, an independent chairman and assessors of national and international repute.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment that the equity injection for capital development will be made in full once the LRC proposals are accepted and implemented.  Lest there be <Col N="1043" /> any doubt about our bona fides in this regard, I give a commitment that this investment can be made within one day of my obtaining European Commission approval for it.  To get back to the point, however, I cannot get European Commission approval for it until I can establish core viability, and that is what is involved in the LRC proposals.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of common ground between all the parties in this dispute.  Everybody accepts that the company is losing money and market share at an accelerating rate.  Everybody accepts that this cannot continue and that its unit costs must match those of its competitors. Everybody accepts that unit costs comprise earnings and output.  However, what everybody does not accept is whether we tackle earnings or output first.  Why not tackle both?  The Government is not only willing to do so but will also provide the necessary structures to this end.  I urge the trade unions, having reflected on the Government's clarifications and very specific undertakings, to do likewise.  It is the only way in which we can approach the resolution of this problem.  I believe it is a common sense way in which this matter can be resolved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus on a day when unions and management put their respective viewpoints to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus, once the jewel in the crown, a flagship company in the aviation sector now stands on the precipice. Worldwide, we have a sinking market and competition is dictating the future of aircraft maintenance.  Excess capacity is the order of the day.  TEAM Aer Lingus is swimming in shark infested <Col N="1044" /> waters.  Negotiations on this dispute have been long, protracted and stalemate and stand off have been the outcome. During all that time the trading position of TEAM Aer Lingus has been deteriorating rapidly.  Sanity has to prevail.  At stake are skilled and highly valued jobs. The industry is part of the economic engine of north County Dublin and further afield.  The management were prepared to accept the LRC report but the unions said no to it.  I take this opportunity to appeal to them to reconsider their position.  There is simply too much at stake; well paid, highly skilled jobs could simply disappear overnight, jobs which it may not be possible to replace if they were to disappear at this time.  I believe the future of TEAM Aer Lingus can be re-established.  What is needed is common sense to solve an increasingly desperate dilemma.  There is need for decisive leadership from the union representatives.</P>
    <P>The aviation industry worldwide has gone through convulsions in recent years. There is the question of excess capacity and deregulation.  The reality is that the industry here can neither be isolated nor insulated from the changes worldwide. In recent months we have seen the impact of those changes on the parent company, Aer Lingus.  There is a great danger that if the problem in TEAM Aer Lingus is not resolved quickly, it will seriously impact on the parent company.  There is simply too much at stake for those employed both in TEAM Aer Lingus, the parent company and, indeed, for the country as a whole.  We cannot do without our aviation industry.</P>
    <P>It may well be that employees of TEAM Aer Lingus find great difficulty in accepting the present position.  The reality, however, is that we are in a changing situation and unless common sense prevails there will be a demoralised, desperate and unemployed workforce in north County Dublin and further afield.  There is sufficient goodwill and common sense on all sides to come up with a resolution to this problem.  The Labour Relations Commission is a credible <Col N="1045" /> agency and when it examined the various aspects involved in the TEAM Aer Lingus crisis, its recommendations were not made lightly.  Those recommendations, which have been accepted by management, will form the basis of saving the company.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the unions tonight to reconsider their position and their attitude towards the LRC report.  If they do the jobs in the company can be secured for many years.  Against the background of excess capacity and with competition becoming even more cut-throat, if we are not in a position to compete in the marketplace, job losses will inevitably become the order of the day.  That must not happen, there is simply too much at stake, particularly for the employees of the company.</P>
    <P>Representatives of both unions and management attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies today and put their respective points of view.  Those views are strongly held but one must clinically analyse what is best for the company.  As a humble backbencher I have not had access to the LRC's recommendations but I am prepared to accept the word of Minister Cowen in the matter.  He believes it will save TEAM Aer Lingus and will form the basis of its future prosperity. While there continues to be a real danger that the company's future could be in serious jeopardy, we must all resolve, particularly the union leadership, to talk to the workers and convince them that it is in their best interests to accept the recommendations of the LRC. In the years ahead they will be grateful that they took that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Looking at the issue from a distance we can all be objective to some degree.  We are all well aware of the critical sitution in TEAM Aer Lingus. This has not occurred overnight.  The aviation industry has changed due to the Gulf War and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.  The projections when TEAM Aer Lingus was established were <Col N="1046" /> based on estimates which, due to the changes that have taken place in recent years, have altered.  As a result, TEAM has suffered a loss of its market share and its revenue has fallen.  In addition, there have been changes within the company. New aircraft were bought which do not require the same amount of maintenance work as the older aircraft.</P>
      <P>It is accepted by all sides that the reason for the current crisis is the unit costs and that problem must be faced by management and the workforce.  The two sides are looking at the problem from different perspectives.  The aim is to get costs under control.  Should income be increased or should the expenditure be reduced?  That is the problem facing TEAM.</P>
      <P>From what I heard today at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies the management proposals are being condemned because of past bad management.  The new management in TEAM Aer Lingus should be given an opportunity to prove its plans.  The unions should be heard also and the Minister made it clear tonight, as he did on other occasions, that he is willing to discuss the unions' viewpoint but that the LRC report should be accepted before those views would be taken into account.  Those views have been taken into account but, in order to get to the discussion table, they should accept the LRC report and progress further with management and the Minister to get TEAM Aer Lingus back to its previous position.</P>
      <P>There are two critical elements regarding TEAM Aer Lingus.  The company must be maintained and developed.  If the unions do not agree to the Minister's proposals, accept the LRC recommendations and return to the negotiating table, the future of TEAM Aer Lingus is dark.</P>

      <P>The serious crisis facing TEAM Aer Lingus has dominated the media for some time.  We are now at the eleventh hour and the problem is almost regarded as a time bomb which is ticking away.  This constructive motion was tabled in an effort to seek a solution and get us out of the current impasse.  None of us would wish to see anything happen to this company particularly when one considers the skills of its workforce.</P>
      <P>Members of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies were firmly focused on the issue today when we met representatives from the trade unions and the management of TEAM.  The deep, innate hostility that exists between the craft unions and the management was obvious.  That is regrettable to a certain degree but both are entitled to their viewpoint.  When Mr. Bernie Cahill met the joint committee on 9 July 1993 most attention focused on Aer Lingus.  Mr. Cahill, referring to TEAM Aer Lingus, complained about some past investment decisions made by the company. He complained also about inefficiencies there when compared with similar work carried out on the world market.  We all agree it is a competitive industry.  The Government stated firmly that the unions must accept the report of the Labour Relations Commission.  I do not think they know how the unions feel about the report.  They anticipated that there would be an inquiry and they regard the document as an industrial relations one.  They feel bitter about the Labour Relations Commission.  They say the proposals are &ldquo;grossly stupid, incompetent and irresponsible&rdquo;.  Having used that kind of language can anyone see the unions accepting the document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was envisaged that the hourly rate would be reduced from £41.74 to £38.56 if the proposals were accepted, yet, on 9 July, 1993 Bernie Cahill said a charge of £33 an hour was needed to be viable and competitive.  Management dismissed the proposals put forward by the trade unions.  In its document it set out many areas where management could achieve extra man hours.  However, management <Col N="1048" /> dismissed them and said they were in most of the areas already.</P>
    <P>There is great bitterness and hostility and it is obvious, given the problems that exist between management and the unions, that outside intervention is needed.  A spokesperson said today that there had been many hours of negotiations but, listening to some of the representatives, I cannot help but feel they were fruitless and unproductive.  I was surprised when, in reply to a question about whether the trade union document had been discussed with any Minister or analysed by the Government, a senior trade union offical pointed out that when he tried to contact the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, he ended up speaking to a programme manager, Mr. Roche.  It is easy to understand why there is so much frustration.  It is almost like trying to make an influential decision by remote control.</P>
    <P>I shudder to think of what is likely to happen if there is no outside intervention or if the formula Fine Gael put forward to resolve the problem is not used.  In fairness to the unions, they put forward proposals and went some way to try to achieve cost economies in their document. Management are always quick to look for a reduction in workers' labour rates but will they take a 20 per cent or similar reduction themselves and lead by example?  Many of the problems were created by management in the past.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to accept this motion in the spirit in which it was tabled. We are all frustrated and if we prevaricate on the issue the sword of Damocles will continue to hang over the company.  Unless there is outside intervention it is difficult to see how any discussions could be entered into between the management and the craft union.  I hope the Minister will take that initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion. Many constituents expressed their concern to me about the future of TEAM Aer Lingus.  What amuses me, if amusement <Col N="1049" /> is not out of place, is the concern which has suddenly erupted from the concerned six and Fianna Fáil backbenchers who seem to have realised only in the last few weeks the seriousness of the problems affecting TEAM Aer Lingus.  The callousness with which the workers were ignored up to this is reflected in the way Government backbenchers now want to be seen to be doing something about an issue they knew of at least a year ago.</P>
      <P>We went to the ALSAA building in 1993 when the Cahill rescue plan was discussed.  While that was the main issue at the time, the TEAM Aer Lingus workforce approached us and told us the problems that were likely to arise.  They expressed concern about the future of TEAM Aer Lingus, its work practices and expressed worries about their families, mortgages and the future. Despite the concern expressed by the Government it had no intention of dealing with the TEAM Aer Lingus problem at that time.</P>
      <P>No doubt everyone is impressed by the Government's concern, some of it legitimate, but essentially it has turned into union bashing.  Far be it from me to say the unions are always right but, instead of bashing them, perhaps the Government should have listened to what they said six months ago.  If it had perhaps we would not be in this position now.  Was it their intention to resolve the problems in Aer Lingus piecemeal and isolate the main parent body, get the maximum number of redundancies there and then turn to the subsidiaries?  That is what it looks like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions were conned and outwitted by the Government.  Stark proposals have been laid before the workforce and they have been told to take them or leave them.  If they do not accept the proposals of the Labour Relations Commission, the company will be in jeopardy.  Surely that was obvious to the Government a year ago?  If the workforce in TEAM Aer Lingus were told, surely the people in the seat of power were told?  It is shedding crocodile tears at this stage for Government backbenchers to express concern, <Col N="1050" /> sympathy and pity for the people involved.</P>
    <P>The Government parties knew about the problems a year ago yet they did nothing to alleviate them.  The difficulties were clearly identified by the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus at that time.  A year ago my constituents who work in TEAM Aer Lingus pointed out the difficulties to me.  Everybody now wants to back the unions.  I am not attempting to suggest that all the faults are on one side but at least the workforce was prepared to identify the problems at that time.  Why did the Government not identify the problems and come forward with solutions? Why did concerned Government backbenchers not come forward six or eight months ago and identify with the workers?</P>

      <P>Why has this matter suddenly become the responsibility of the unions?  If a firm is not operating properly and efficiently it is the fault in the first instance of management.</P>
      <P>Like me, other Deputies can go back as far as they want in labour relations, and whenever management say that the union has taken over &mdash; it blames the union for everything that happened afterwards &mdash; it is a sure sign that it failed in its duty to identify the problems at an early stage.  The TEAM Aer Lingus workers have been told they must accept redundancies and pay cuts and change their work practices.  Why have these proposals suddenly been put on the table? Why were they not thrashed out previously? Did anyone on the Government benches identify the problems?  If the workers and unions could identify the problems, why could the Government not do so?</P>

      <P>The Government cleverly pretended to resolve the parent body's problems while at the same time isolating TEAM Aer Lingus and, unfortunately, its workforce have become the whipping boys and girls for the two Government parties.</P>
      <P>When we visited the very well attended meeting in the ALSAA building in 1993 only one representative of each political party was allowed to speak.  I was sorry I and others did not have the opportunity to speak because if we had the issues now being discussed would have been aired to a much greater extent.  I want to give a few examples of the difficulties identified by the workforce at that time.  They told us that, given the work practices, they did not see how TEAM Aer Lingus could survive in future, contracts were not being fulfilled and the resources of the company were not being utilised in the interests of ensuring the viability of the company in the future.  It seemed that somebody somewhere had a proposal that these matters should be dealt with at a later stage.  That is exactly what happened; these matters are now being dealt with at the eleventh hour.</P>
      <P>No long term plan has been put forward for the company.  The Government parties supported the rescue package for Aer Lingus, the ultimate resolution to the problems.  As we now see it did not solve all the problems.  Some of us expressed concern and dissatisfaction about the rescue package because of the information we were getting from our constituents, who apparently do not seem to rate very highly with the Government and its backbenchers.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Meeting Between Taoiseach and British Prime Minister: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council in Corfu on Friday and Saturday last, 24 and 25 June, accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Kitt.</P>
      <P>Prior to the commencement of the European Council, there were signing ceremonies in respect of the Treaty on Accession with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway and the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Russia.  As indicated in the Presidency Conclusions, copies of which I have had laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, the heads of state or of government of the accession countries participated in the work of the European Council.  Describing this development as an important new landmark in the history of European integration, the European Council expressed the hope that the successful outcome in the referendum on accession in Austria would be reflected in the other three accession states.  The agreement with Russia marks a further important step in bringing about closer ties between that country and the European Union, and was marked by the attendance of President Yeltsin.</P>
      <P>The major items discussed at the European Council proper were the designation of a new President of the European Commission and the unemployment and employment situation in the Union.  We also had discussions on matters in the fields of common foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs, and on preparation for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it was not possible to reach agreement on the designation <Col N="1057" /> of the next President of the Commission.  I regret this outcome.  In my view, this internal dispute can only distract from what should be the key current objective of the Union, which is to improve the economic performance of the Union and create more jobs.  There is a danger that the outcome will rekindle the perception of a divided Union, at a time when it seemed to have put behind it the difficulties associated with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  I am also conscious that referenda have yet to take place later this year in Finland, Norway and Sweden on their accession to the EU.  Finally, the European Parliament has an important role to play in this process.  The timetable for the designation of a President by the member states must take account of this.</P>
    <P>The position that emerged in Corfu was that 11 countries, including Ireland, were agreeable to the designation of the Belgian Prime Minister Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, as the next President of the Commission.  The British Government could not, however, accept this position and therefore the requirement of unanimity was not met.  The upcoming German Presidency is now to have bilateral contacts with delegations to prepare the way for a decision on the designation of the future President of the Commission at a special European Council to be held in Brussels on 15 July next.  Deputies may wish to note that the German Foreign Minister, Herr Kinkel, plans to visit Ireland and will have discussions with myself and the Tánaiste very soon, but we are already in contact with the German Foreign Ministry.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to speculate at this stage as to the likely outcome of the consultation process.  Mr. Dehaene has indicated that he is still available.  He had the effective support of 11 out of 12 countries at Corfu, a support which was reconfirmed in the Council Chamber after the use of the British veto.  There has also been speculation as to other candidates, including possible Irish candidates, for the position.</P>
    <P>There was no evidence whatever that any candidate that we could have promoted <Col N="1058" /> up until now would have been able to command the necessary unanimous support.  In relation to the appointment of a successor to President Jacques Delors, some people, including Opposition leaders, have the luxury of living in a world of pretence and presumption, but the Government must live and act in the world of reality.  Some Opposition leaders are engaged in a deceitful and deliberate exercise in political hypocrisy in trying to portray to the Irish people that the Presidency of the European Union is available to Ireland, if only the Irish Government would put forward a particular person's name.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that every member state has a veto and it is futile to put forward any name, known to be unacceptable to other member states, if a replacement arises. We will not do it and the people asking us to do it know full well what the reality is and should be honest enough to say so.</P>
    <P>All I will say at this juncture is that the Irish Government will play its full part in trying to resolve the current <i>impasse.</i> We will be prepared to put forward the name or names of suitable and acceptable candidates, if that opportunity arises and is likely to make a genuine contribution to resolving the problem.  However, the fact is that no reference was made inside the Council Chamber to any possible Irish candidate, or to any other replacement candidate for that matter.  The only people who mentioned any particular names to me were journalists in the environs of the meeting itself.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties are doing no service to anyone by trying to politicise the issue, or by wilfully ignoring the political realities in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would never do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the main Opposition belongs to the network of Christian Democrat leaders, within which he has tried, without any visible success, to promote the name of a particular Irish <Col N="1059" /> person.  Therefore, he can be under no illusions as to the realities of the situation where the atmosphere at the moment is very sensitive and delicate.</P>
      <P>We have been served very well by all our recent European Commissioners.  All of them have made outstanding contributions to European development: Mr. Peter Sutherland in the area of competition policy and air transport liberalisation, Mr. Ray MacSharry in pushing through CAP reform, achieving a breakthrough on agricultural aspects of GATT and promoting policies for rural development, and our present Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, who is in charge of implementing the White Paper on the central issue of employment and has been one of the great successes in the present Commission.  I would not draw any invidious distinction between them or try to suggest that any of them has performed better than any other &mdash; either for Europe or for Ireland.  We are proud of their efforts and ability to fill any role required of them.  The present Government fully supported and worked assiduously for the candidature of Mr. Peter Sutherland for the prestigious post of Director-General of the GATT, which will become the World Trade Organisation next year, but he has decided to relinquish that post for personal reasons.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the jobs issue, we had a wide-ranging debate at the European Council on implementation of the Commission White Paper and on the associated plan of action adopted at the December 1993 European Council in Brussels.  We noted that the European economic situation was improving with the return of non-inflationary economic growth.  Stressing the importance of a stable macro-economic climate for employment growth, we endorsed the economic policy guidelines submitted by the Finance Ministers Council.  From an Irish viewpoint, these guidelines simply reflect what has been the cornerstone of Government economic policy since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On specific policies, we reviewed progress on the implementation of the national elements of the action plan <Col N="1060" /> adopted in Brussels, and concluded that, while some progress had been made in the Union as a whole, much more needed to be done.  Particular stress was laid on the need to further develop education and training programmes, reduce non-labour costs of employment, open up new areas of employment opportunities, tackle long term unemployment for both men and women, and target the employment needs of young people.  The Council directed the relevant Ministerial Councils and the Commission to keep progress in these areas under constant review.  This review will focus on the experience of successful policies in different member states and assess their appropriateness for application elsewhere.  This ongoing review will be distilled into a report for the Essen Summit in December, which is expected to encompass appropriate policy recommendations.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the opportunity to brief my European colleagues on the economic situation in Ireland, which will see economic and employment growth this year well in excess of the European average. I was able to inform the Council that we have put in place policies which are fully consistent with the prescriptions set out in the White Paper and Brussels action plan.  I referred to measures to reduce the cost of employment through cuts in income tax, PRSI and levies, the expansion of places on training and employment schemes and our emphasis on the generation of employment through local development initiatives.  Many complimentary remarks were made about Ireland's recent economic performance.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that the Presidency Conclusions explicitly acknowledged the initiatives taken by Ireland in the areas of social partnership and local development, and pointed in particular to the job creation potential of local development initiatives.  I am arranging to have a paper prepared from Ireland for the Essen Council in December on the Irish experience, the lessons to be learned from it and the scope for further European-level action to complement national action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> The Presidency Conclusions also stressed the key importance of the smooth operation of the Single Market for the competitiveness of the European economy. The potential of small and medium-sized enterprises to tap the benefits of the Single Market was also emphasised.  The Council emphasised the need to eliminate unnecessary legal and administrative burdens on business &mdash; a feature of the report on small business which was recently produced in this country.  The Council welcomed the intention of the Commission to establish a group of independent persons to help it in assessing the impact of Community and national legislation on employment and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Council reviewed the interim report of the Christophersen Group on Trans-European Networks (TENs) for the transport and energy sectors and the report of the Bangemann group on the information society.  We agreed the first priority list of 11 major transport projects in the Christophersen report.  This list includes the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne rail link.  The Christophersen Group are to continue their work and prepare a final report for the Essen European Council in December.  This work will include further consideration of the funding requirements of the TENs programme.  From an Irish viewpoint the TENs programme is important, especially in the transport area, not only because of the projects which directly affect us but also because, as an exporting country, improvements in Europe's transport infrastructure can only be of benefit to us.</P>
    <P>The Council noted the findings of the Bangemann group on the information society.  The importance attached by the Council to this whole area was underlined by our decision to establish a permanent co-ordination instrument to ensure a consistent approach at both national and European Union levels to the challenges and requirements of the new information society.  To ensure the implementation of this new co-ordinated approach, the Council also decided that each member state should appoint a person responsible for all aspects of the task at ministerial <Col N="1062" /> level.  The Government is anxious that Ireland should be to the fore in the information revolution, both because our position on the periphery of Europe demands it and because of the direct employment potential involved in it.</P>
    <P>The overall conclusion of our discussions on employment issues can be summed up as one where progress was reported, but much more remains to be done, in particular to implement the White Paper for creating employment. Employment and unemployment will remain at the top of the Union's agenda, and the European Council will review the position at its meeting in Essen in December.</P>
    <P>Looking forward to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the European Council established a Reflection Group to prepare for the conference.  This group will not commence its work until June 1995, by which time reports on the functioning of the Maastricht Treaty by the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament will be available to provide an input into the work of the group. The Council agreed that two European Parliament representatives will participate in the work of the Reflection Group.</P>
    <P>One of the key areas which this group will examine will be institutional questions for decision at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  These include weighting of votes, the threshold for qualified majority decisions, and the number of members of the Commission. I need hardly stress to Deputies the importance of these issues, especially for a small member state like Ireland.  While the final decision on these matters will rest with the 1996 conference, the findings of the Reflection Group established at Corfu will undoubtedly provide a significant input.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East, the Council warmly welcomed the Cairo Agreement between Israel and the PLO of 4 May last, and reiterated the Union's willingness to provide further assistance to move the peace process towards a successful conclusion.  The Council praised the transition to democracy in South <Col N="1063" /> Africa, and confirmed the intention to promote closer economic and trade links and political dialogue between that country and the European Union.  The situation in Rwanda has particularly touched the hearts of the Irish people. The European Council expressed its horror at the genocide taking place there and asserted that those responsible should be brought to justice.  We also welcomed the United Nation's authorisation of a temporary operation in Rwanda pending the arrival of a reinforced UN mission and we confirmed our willingness to increase the Union's level of humanitarian aid to the country.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the situation in the Ukraine, with particular reference to the issue of nuclear safety.  We agreed that as part of a comprehensive plan under the aegis of the G7, the Union should provide financial assistance to deal with the problem of nuclear safety in the Ukraine.  My approach to the discussions under this heading took full account of Ireland's long-standing opposition to nuclear power in general, and of the need to ensure that any EU assistance being provided for the Ukraine in this area should be part of an overall strategy involving obligations as well as assistance. There is a recognised absolute need for action to prevent a possible catastrophe with Europe-wide implications, arising from the combined operation of unsafe nuclear installations in the Ukraine.</P>
    <P>In its conclusions, the Council recommended that the Chernobyl nuclear plant should be closed definitively and as early as possible.  The adoption of a strategy by the Ukraine, which is a condition for EU assistance, requires structural reform of the energy sector in the Ukraine, and the development of sources of energy which are alternatives to nuclear power. A further key requirement is that construction and operating standards in the nuclear sector should be upgraded to European Union standards, and that this should be monitored by independent inspectors.  This latter element is particularly welcome from an Irish viewpoint, <Col N="1064" /> given our long-standing advocacy of an independent inspectorate to monitor the operation of the nuclear industry within the European Union.</P>
    <P>On a related issue, the Council reaffirmed the full commitment of the Union to the objective of nuclear non-proliferation which is in line with Government policy in this area and agreed to adopt a joint action of preparation for the Fourth Conference in 1995 of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the justice and home affairs area, the Council welcomed the joint Franco-German initiative on racism and xenophobia and agreed on a work plan and timetable for its implementation. The Council underlined the importance of joint action against organised crimes and drugs and also asked the Justice and Home Affairs Council to reach agreement on tackling the criminal aspects of fraud and to report back on this topic to its meeting at Essen in December.</P>
    <P>Finally in the margins of the European Council I held an hour-long meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, the third such meeting so far this year, outside of the regular twice yearly bilateral Summits.  We reviewed political developments in the North and the state of discussions on the framework document. We made further progress at the meeting and put arrangements in hand to help us complete the work in a number of complex areas.  The two Governments have shared objectives and a common understanding of the goal we are trying to achieve.  What we are talking about is putting forward an outline for a peace settlement as a framework for negotiations between the two Governments and the Northern parties.</P>
    <P>In view of some thoroughly misleading press reports last week, I must emphasise we are not contemplating imposing a settlement without the involvement of the Northern communities, any more than we are contemplating an abandonment of our responsibilities to them. Each community, each tradition and each Government will have to make a genuine <Col N="1065" /> and sustained effort to find a balanced accommodation that takes account of the legitimate interests and ideals of the other, so that mutual consent is won.  The next few weeks will continue to test who wants peace and who is afraid of it.</P>
    <P>The European Council will reconvene in a little over two weeks' time to choose a new President of the EU Commission. What is important is that the person chosen, regardless of nationality or political background, should have the dynamic and visionary leadership qualities that characterised the Presidency of Jacques Delors, from which Ireland and Europe have benefited so much over the past ten years.</P>

After all the undermining of Peter Sutherland by the Government over recent weeks anything less than an enthusiastic endorsement of his candidacy for the presidency at this stage will be interpreted as s cynical ploy designed to put forward his name publicly while continuing to work behind the scenes to undermine it and to ensure that it never becomes a reality.  For the Government to say now, which it has not even done, that it would respond if someone else proposed Peter Sutherland would be such a cynical ploy.  Peter Sutherland will get support from others only if the Government first says it will support him.  Nor is it any addition for the Government to give support to Peter <Col N="1067" /> Sutherland at a late stage when events have reached the point at which his candidacy has already been fatally undermined by the Government's previous foot dragging and background briefing.</P>

      <P>I support the potential candidacy of Peter Sutherland but I regard the pre-summit character assassination of the Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, by the yellow press in Britain as a demonstration that that country <Col N="1068" /> is rapidly becoming the most narrowly nationalistic of European countries.</P>
      <P>The successful German torpedoing of the candidacy of the Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, was equally narrow-minded. Chancellor Kohl is one of the greatest statesmen of this century but I do not believe that a record &ldquo;of never having disagreed with Helmut&rdquo; is a prerequisite to the CV of any potential EU Commission President.  That seems to be the only reason that disqualified Ruud Lubbers.</P>

      <P>By an accident of history and geography Ireland has a vital national interest on either side of any gulf that divides Britain from Europe.  Britain is now diverging from the rest of Europe on the Social Charter, the single currency, the structure of a democratic constitution for Europe and the question of whether Europe should have an Atlantic or European-based security policy.  British <Col N="1070" /> public opinion still sees Europe as foreign.  It tends to regard people speaking on British television with a foreign accent as suspect, no matter what they are saying.  Unlike its predecessors the British political leadership is unable or unwilling to overcome these innate prejudices.</P>

      <P>This has dire consequences for Ireland because Ireland's economy will be the biggest loser from a British decision to stay out of the Social Charter or the single currency.  We are caught in the middle whether we like it or not.  Of all the potential candidates, as president of the European Commission Peter Sutherland alone has, in this television age, the ability to speak directly to the British people about Europe, over the heads of its national politicians, if necessary.  As one trained in a legal system similar to that of Britain he is uniquely qualified to overcome the legal and administrative misunderstandings that frequently compound and exaggerate political differences which inevitably occur from time to time between Britain and Europe.  No Continental European can do this job for Ireland, Europe and the wider world as well as can Peter Sutherland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why this potential candidacy is so valuable for Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view, his availability for the Presidency of the European Commission is unique. If we do not get the Presidency of the Commission this time, an Irish candidate will not even be considered for at least ten years because, five years from now, it will be the turn of a large member state.  Ten years from now the European Union will consist of about 21 members, its centre of gravity will have moved east and Ireland's chances, even if we have a candidate <Col N="1071" /> as suitable as Peter Sutherland, will be greatly reduced because of the increased number of countries contesting the post.</P>
    <P>In any event, ten years from now the rules for selecting the President will have changed.  The low poll in the recent European elections shows that European citizens will vote only if their votes give them a direct voice on really important decisions.  European citizens will not be fobbed off by being offered a vote for a parliament that does not select the Government of Europe.  Voters are used to voting at home for parliaments that select Governments and it will not be long before they become impatient with voting for parliaments in Europe that do not have a say in the selection of the European government.  Ten years from now, therefore, the Commission President will be selected by the European Parliament, or by direct election by the people of Europe, on the American model.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, is probably the last Taoiseach who will have an opportunity in a small group to influence the possibility of another Irishman becoming President of the European Commission.  He should be judged on the way he exercises his responsibility in that respect in the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appears to put the internal interests of his party, a minority party in this Dáil and State, before the interests of the Irish people and Europe.</P>

      <P>Our players all wore the Irish jersey proudly, unlike the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in Corfu last week. Their performance at the Summit in Corfu was a shameful high point in their ongoing shoddy handling of the impending vacancy for the presidency of the Commission.  This is a sad saga of politicians who cannot rise above mere internal Fianna Fáil-Labour considerations to see the great opportunity that beckons for this country in securing the most powerful post in the European Union.  Over the past few months when the name of Peter Sutherland, the GATT Director-General, was raised the Taoiseach indulged in bluff, bluster and putdown in the Dáil.  In response to questions on 27 April, he claimed Mr. Sutherland was not interested in the post and that excuse was also invoked by the Tánaiste.  When this led to Mr. Sutherland publicly expressing interest in the post, the response of both the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach was to leave him swinging in the breeze.  Clearly their hope, amplified by the behaviour of both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in Corfu, was that this embarrassing chalice would be removed from them by other Governments at the Summit unanimously supporting a different nominee for the <Col N="1079" /> Delors vacancy.  As far as the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were concerned, any nominee would do so long as it was not the only Irish person who was seriously at the races.</P>

      <P>Overnight there were further indications of the Government's refusal to put the national interest ahead of its petty partnership considerations.  It is now trying to pretend that the matter is exclusively for the incoming German Presidency and that it has no possible role in the affair.  When an <i>Irish Press</i> journalist asked a Government spokesman what the Taoiseach would do if the incoming German Presidency asked if Ireland was prepared to nominate Peter Sutherland his extraordinary comment was: &ldquo;That is purely hypothetical, but the Government will continue to do what is in the best interest of the country&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The sheer audacity of such a comment is breathtaking.  I presume the Minister for Finance will respond to the debate.  He is a reasonable person and I would like him to state what the attitude of the Government will be if the German Foreign Minister asks the Government to nominate Peter Sutherland for Presidency of the Commission. The national interest is the last thing influencing the behaviour of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in this saga.  They have not acted in the national interest. They are guilty of petty, vindictive and unpatriotic behaviour.  The only reason they are blocking Mr. Sutherland is that his background is not Fianna Fáil or Labour.  They are hell-bent on wilfully throwing away Ireland's opportunity of securing the most powerful post in the European Union.  What they are doing amounts to begrudgery of the highest order.  Whatever the Taoiseach may say about Deputy Bruton's party and the fact that Mr. Sutherland is a former member of it, he is not a member, nor is he associated with my party.  However, I still think that if he became President of the Commission he has the capacity to do an outstanding job for this country and the European Union at a very difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste how they will respond and if they will remove their effective veto <Col N="1082" /> over Mr. Sutherland's possible appointment. Perhaps the Minister for Finance will respond, but I would like the Taoiseach to take the opportunity to respond also.  The national interest allows only one answer and the people are entitled to a clear indication of what response the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will make on this central question.  Such a departure would, however, pose difficulties for the Taoiseach in accommodating Commissioner Flynn, and such an outturn would also be tough on our sitting Commissioner. What, however, are the difficulties for the Tánaiste, the man with the self-styled mandate to put trust back into politics, who promised openness and transparency in Government and proclaimed at the launch of the Ethics in Public Office Bill, that &ldquo;the public have a right to know&rdquo;?  They have a right to know what the Tánaiste has been up to. However, the Tánaiste in particular has decided to remove himself from the debate.  When he did comment, he tried to flush out Mr. Sutherland by putting it up to him in the hope that he would not respond, but what was the eventual response from the Tánaiste?  Is the Government prepared to avail of the current stalemate in the European Union on choosing a successor to Jacques Delors and seize the opportunity it presents for securing the most prestigious and powerful post in the European Union for an Irish nominee, an opportunity that will not again come our way for some considerable time?</P>
    <P>To turn to the other issues raised at the Corfu Summit, the Presidency Conclusions rightly highlighted the historic importance of the signing there of the Treaty of Accession for the four new EFTA members &mdash; Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria &mdash; which are due to join next January, and the signing of a partnership and co-operation agreement with Russia.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly obvious that the planned Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for 1996 to review the Treaties of the European Union will be a momentous departure in the history of Europe. Its central challenge will be how the <Col N="1083" /> European Union can institutionally respond to the challenge of new membership from the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe which are queuing up to join or, at least, have association agreements with the European Union.  Cyprus, Malta, Hungary, Poland and Turkey are among the countries that have sought to join the European Union, and there are ongoing talks with other Central European countries and the Baltic States.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the potential enlargement could not be accommodated within the existing creaking institutional framework of the Union.  The 1996 Intergovernmental Conference faces a momentous task in rising to the challenge of the realignment of the post-Cold War European Continent.  The scale of the challenge is awesome.  One is constantly struck by the sheer gulf that exists between these extraordinary developments and the perceptions of the average citizen of the European Union which was amply demonstrated in the recent European elections and markedly in Ireland. That election campaign brought home to us the lack of awareness and understanding surrounding European events. Not only were the public unaware and largely uninterested, it was plain that the media had no appetite for forcing European issues on their daily agenda.</P>
    <P>The central challenge is not only the potential enlargement of the Community but the fact that even as a 12-state entity the European Union is perceived as irrelevant and remote by the average citizen. How much greater will that problem become next January when it becomes a 16-State Union with the imminent prospect of becoming a 20 or 24-State Union?</P>
    <P>Devising an effective common foreign security policy will be another major task for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, while the continuing crisis in the former Yugoslavia is a vivid daily reminder of the extent of the challenges and the potential price of failure.  Often Europe seems powerless to stand up to aggression within its own continent or make its voice heard effectively.</P>
    <P>The Corfu Summit conclusions also <Col N="1084" /> highlight the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  However, the conclusions are largely aspirational, non-contentious and hardly inspire confidence for dealing with the unemployment challenge facing the Union and, not least, our own country.  The Community has an unemployment problem almost equivalent to the populations of three member states.</P>
    <P>On giving fuller effect to the Single Market the Summit's approval for 11 major transport projects as part of the development of comprehensive trans-European networks, including the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne rail link, is welcome and further evidence of the capacity of the Single Market to break down borders and barriers between the Union members states.  Europe is drifting in the face of rising unemployment and the reemergence of nationalism.  It is time the European Community had strong and decisive leadership by someone committed to the Union and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>In regard to what the Taoiseach calls his meetings on the margins with the British Prime Minister, I intend to deal more fully with Northern Ireland in the Adjournment Debate later this week. However, the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, spent far too much time trying to bring the extremes on board.  I do not say that lightly.  Unless the Government expedites the production of the framework document, gets the moderates in the North on board and sets up a power sharing executive within Northern Ireland where constitutional politicians of different persuasions can share power with each other, unless we have strong North-South links and show that politics works, the vacuum will be filled by violence from one side or the other.</P>
    <P>The Chair ruled out a question I asked the Taoiseach about his comments in Boston on the grounds that he answered it on 8 March.  I do not know how the Taoiseach could have referred on 8 March to comments he did not make until 8 June.  I have been generally supportive <Col N="1085" /> of the Government's approach, in so far as one can be, to the problems in Northern Ireland, like all the Opposition parties. However, when the Taoiseach goes abroad he sometimes makes comments that are not consistent with what he says in this House.  The Taoiseach is reported to have said in Boston that he was prepared to trade a change in Articles 2 and 3 for an executive role in the North and for institutional links within Northern Ireland between North and South.  Those comments caused much disquiet, particularly among the Unionist community in the North.  The Taoiseach has distanced himself somewhat from those comments but he has not explained what he meant.</P>

      <P>On that point, a Cheann Comhairle, perhaps you will check the letter you sent me on the same issue because I received precisely the same reply.</P>
      <P>The selection of a nominee for the Presidency of the European Union Commission was billed as the centrepiece of last weekend's Euro-drama which turned out to be something of a damp squib. Faced with a choice of three conservative candidates, the assembled leaders divided along expected lines: the Franco-German entry, Jean-Luc Dehaene, received the support of eight member states, including Ireland, while three backed Mr. Lubbers, whose neo-liberal credentials are impeccable.  John Major donned the ill-fitting mantle of Eurorebel and fought a lonely rearguard action on behalf of his party colleague, Leon Brittan, before supporting Mr. Lubbers' candidacy and stoically vetoing M. Dehaene with one eye firmly fixed on the Euro-sceptics back home.  Mr. Major's position at least has the virtue of consistency and transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who generally assumes the role of Puck on the European stage, is said to have informed the assembled media that he is playing his cards close to his chest.  This comes as no surprise to those who recall his singularly inept <Col N="1087" /> handling of such Euro-sagas as the GATT and the Structural Funds.  On both occasions the Taoiseach mistook serious negotiations for a game of stud poker and on both occasions Ireland lost.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should now inform the House whom he intends to back for the Commission Presidency, given the new cast of characters likely to be presented at the extraordinary summit.  He should also inform us of the political basis for his decision.  In his statement tonight he said that &ldquo;the person chosen, regardless of nationality or political background, should have the dynamic and visionary leadership qualities that characterised the Presidency of Jacques Delors, from which Ireland and Europe have benefited so much over the past ten years&rdquo;.  Surely the Taoiseach realises that it was precisely because of Jacques Delors' capacities and political background that Ireland benefited so much from his Presidency.</P>
    <P>If the only criterion is visionary leadership qualities and dynamism, as stated by the Taoiseach, it is difficult to see why he is standing so firmly against Peter Sutherland. Whoever is chosen to succeed Jacques Delors will have a major role in deciding the direction of Europe at a critical point in its development.  The new President of the Commission will preside over the preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and Maastricht revision and he &mdash; so far there are no female candidates &mdash; will be responsible for the implementation of what remains of Jacques Delors' White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Delors has had a distinguished tenure as Commission President: his commitment to the ideal of a social Europe has been matched only by the zeal with which certain member states have attempted to thwart that objective. It is regrettable that Mr. Delors is likely to reject the Greek request that he stay on another year.</P>
    <P>The weekend deadlock has been met with a measure of glee in certain quarters. Those who view European issues through <Col N="1088" /> the lens of parochial politics argue that now is the time to put forward our own candidate, someone who, or so the subtext goes, will fight Ireland's corner in Europe.  I am all for fighting Ireland's corner.  Indeed, I wish the Government was rather more adept in that regard and had a more comprehensive view of those interests.  However, I do not believe that Ireland's, or Europe's, interests would be served by appointing a conservative Commission President who will place the demands of the market above the rights and needs of citizens.</P>
    <P>Two names have so far emerged from the Irish hat.  Peter Sutherland's undeclared candidacy has been running for over a year, while Ray MacSharry made a fleeting appearance in the headlines over the weekend.  Bearing in mind the far-reaching implications for Europe's future &mdash; at the risk of being labelled &ldquo;unpatriotic&rdquo; by certain Members of this House &mdash; I cannot share the general enthusiasm for Peter Sutherland's candidacy. While Mr. Sutherland's intellect and ability are undoubted, so is his enthusiasm for deregulation and unrestrained markets.  Those in this House who support Mr. Sutherland's candidacy should explain their stance to the Aer Lingus workers who are bearing the brunt of the decisions taken by Mr. Sutherland while Competition Commissioner, and to Telecom workers who may well reap the harvest of the deregulation seeds sown by Mr. Sutherland in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sutherland's missionary zeal on behalf of the unrestrained market, carried out with the blunt instruments of deregulation and privatisation, would pose a grave threat to the European Union.  It would lengthen Europe's growing dole queues still further and would adversely affect those 52 million Europeans already living below the poverty line.  Ray MacSharry's shadow-candidacy represents the triumph of optimism over realism among Fianna Fáil stalwarts who would dearly love to see a green jersey at the Commission table but who baulk at the thought of being outflanked by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> Unless common sense prevails &mdash; it rarely does when politicians look to their electoral fortunes back home &mdash; the forthcoming extraordinary summit to be called by Chancellor Kohl may well end in disarray yet again.  If that is the case, it could provoke an unprecedented constitutional crisis.  Indeed, the President of the European Parliament, Dr. Egon Klepsch, has warned that any delay could prevent the new Commission from taking up its duties in 1995 as envisaged.  Dr. Klepsch also reminded leaders that the Parliament expects the Presidential nominee to appear before the Parliament's July session, and to arrange for the new nominee Commissioners to appear before the appropriate parliamentary committees.  I am delighted the Parliament is flexing its newly acquired Maastricht muscles.  I hope its efforts will not be thwarted by Council bungling of the kind displayed over the weekend.</P>
    <P>I find it unacceptable that the Commission Presidency should be decided by the heads of government meeting in secret conclave until white smoke emerges and a successor to Mr. Delors is appointed.  Once again, Europe's citizens are being asked to stand aside as transparency and accountability are sacrificed to national posturing.  This matter may not be very interesting but the Taoiseach should at least have the courtesy to pretend he is listening.</P>
    <P>The Presidency of the European Commission should not be determined solely by national preoccupations, but primarily by the issues facing Europe as a whole.  I believe that trust in Europe's institutions and procedures could be restored by allowing the European Parliament to decide on Mr. Delors' successor when it reconvenes in July, and in this regard I welcome the suggestion made yesterday by Commissioner Van der Broek.  I would urge the Taoiseach also to take this approach.</P>
    <P>The weekend's events have spawned a diplomatic flurry of activity, which will see German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, making a whistle-stop tour of European capitals while member states <Col N="1090" /> form <i>ad-hoc</i> coalitions.  In particular, there is now the potential for the four Cohesion countries &mdash; Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal &mdash; to come together on the basis of shared social concerns. Democratic Left has long argued that Ireland's best interests would be served by forming closer ties with these countries, countries which share not only funding priorities but which also have common social and infrastructural problems. Unfortunately, this Government's institutionalised myopia is likely to prevent Ireland seizing the diplomatic initiative in this regard.  Each summit has to have a storyline, whether real or imagined.  Ostensibly the Corfu storyline was the appointment of a new Commission President.</P>
    <P>The President of the Commission, we were told in editorials preceding the summit, has awesome powers.  However, as shown by the fate of the truncated White Paper on Competitiveness, Growth and Employment, the role of the Commission President is being increasingly reduced to that of a cipher, while the real decisions &mdash; such as they are &mdash; are made by the Council.  Whoever emerges from the extraordinary Summit &mdash; or, more desirably, from the European Parliament &mdash; will have to safeguard the powers of the Commission against an increasingly voracious Council.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that it is the Council which ensured that progressive Directives put forward by the Commission &mdash; the parental leave Directive, the Directive on worker consultation, and so on &mdash; remain unenacted or half-enacted, awaiting further surgery.  Is this the measure of an all-powerful Commission?</P>
    <P>The Corfu Summit marked the end of a distinctly lacklustre Presidency.  It sealed the EU's new status as an <i>ad hoc</i> coalition of increasingly disparate states gathered together under the umbrella of free trade.  Within a few years the Union may have over double today's number of members &mdash; around 25 &mdash; and will include countries with vastly differing economic, political and social objectives.  Four of those countries &mdash; Austria, Finland, <Col N="1091" /> Sweden and Norway &mdash; were present at the weekend.</P>
    <P>Yet, while the summit addressed some of the practicalities of enlargement, it failed utterly to address the wider-ranging effects of enlargement.  In particular, it failed to address some of the wider implications of the EU's drive to the east, and what this will mean not merely for the Union, but for the stability of the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have previously expressed to this House my concern that hasty enlargement will transform the Union into one of &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; to the detriment of the latter.  In addition, I am concerned at the potential security consequences of enlargement.  It is disturbing that the EU-Russia pack, signed in Corfu, was concluded in tandem with Moscow's Partnership for Peace ageeement with NATO, signed two days earlier.  The European Union is increasingly operating in conjunction with the North Atlantic Alliance and its &ldquo;European pillar&rdquo;, the Western European Union.  This double act poses an especial danger to regional security in central and eastern Europe and can be counterbalanced only by a strengthening of the CSCE as a regional security organisation in the context of the UN Charter.  Hopefully, these issues will be addressed at the 1996 Inter-governmental Conference &mdash; yet I fear that the preparations for that conference will, in the words of Egon Klepsch, take place in a politically sterile room behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>The EU's expansion to include countries at different stages of social, political and economic development will pose a serious challenge to the current member states as well as to the Union's standing institutions.  The inevitable result &mdash; and one for which the signals were set last weekend &mdash; will be a rolling back of the Union's social dimension.</P>
    <P>That social dimension found its main expression in outgoing President Jacques Delors' White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  This document, which started life as an ambitious social and economic programme <Col N="1092" /> which would equip member states to deal with the rising tide of unemployment, has been watered down by successive Council meetings and Summits to the point at which it is now no more than a &ldquo;pick'n'mix&rdquo; series of loosely linked aspirations from which member states can choose.  Nevertheless, I welcome the Summit's conclusion that the trans-European networks &mdash; part of the White Paper &mdash; should go ahead, and in particular the upgrading of the Larne-Belfast-Dublin-Cork railway, following the recommendations of the Christopherson group.  It is unacceptable that Britain and Germany were not prepared to give a commitment that resources for these networks would be made available from the EU's budget.</P>
    <P>Britain's reluctance can be attributed to the Euro-scepticism which is increasingly gaining sway.  Germany's reluctance is far more disturbing, in that it is a further sign of the donor fatigue which led to a blocking of the poverty programme and which is increasing as Germany looks to its old sphere of influence in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enhanced commitment to education and training and I look forward in this regard to the report of the Social Affairs Council.  However, I regret that the demand in the original draft of the White Paper for eco taxes &mdash; put on hold at the recent ECOFIN meeting &mdash; appears now to have been indefinitely shelved.  My party has long argued that a fundamental re-balancing of the burden of taxation from labour to scarce energy and natural resources is crucial to a policy of sustainable development and to tackling Europe's unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>While leaders went through the motions of discussing macro-economic guidelines, it is increasingly apparent that the European Monetary Union &mdash; and its twin, the European Political Union &mdash; have receded into the middle distance.</P>
    <P>As European governments drift ever further rightwards, Democratic Left has argued that more powers should be given both to the European Commission and the European Parliament in order to ensure that the will of the people, rather <Col N="1093" /> than that of powerful financial interests, prevails.  While the Maastricht Treaty contained a welcome increase in the powers of the European Parliament, it is apparent that the Commission is still regarded by governments of member states with some suspicion: the Mé Féin school of thought has become entrenched in far too many European capitals &mdash; indeed, it was this attitude on the part of his backbenchers which guided Mr. Major's actions over the weekend.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon was especially evident in Ireland during the recent Structural Funds saga &mdash; a saga punctuated by insults hurled in the direction of Brussels as it became increasingly apparent that the funds had shrunk and that no amount of public debate was going to restore them to their Edinburgh glory.  The European Union has been touted as a force for political stability and democratic reinforcement and, indeed, my party believes that these aims should be at the top of the EU's agenda.</P>
    <P>At a time of relative internal political homogeneity it was easy for the European Union to play this role, but times have changed.  Instability, intolerance and totalitarianism continue to mark central and eastern Europe &mdash; with the difference that many of these countries are aspirant members of the EU while Hungary and Poland were endorsed in Corfu as applicants.  Within the Union, fascists are in the political driving seat in at least one member state for the first time in over 50 years &mdash; yet Mr. Berlusconi was accorded an honoured place at the conference table.</P>
    <P>While lip service was paid to the Franco-German proposal to combat racism and xenophobia, member states throughout the Union are adopting anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner legislation with no more than a whimper of protest from the EU and its institutions.  The Franco-German proposal carefully stopped short of any initiatives which give foreigners inalienable rights in the EU: the prospect of voting rights for non-EU citizens seems as far away as ever, as does the prospect of a Commissioner with responsibility for minorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I welcome the Summit's proposal on a Mediterranean Conference.  There is an obvious case to be made for increased trade and development links with the Mediterranean countries and this would provide also a welcome counterbalance to the current drive to the east.  However, I caution against any arrangements which leave certain disadvantaged states out in the cold, both economically and politically. In particular, I am concerned that European Union assistance to underdeveloped countries &mdash; as in the case of Algeria which was discussed at the Council &mdash; is inextricably linked to stringent IMF criteria, criteria which are rapidly pauperising the developing world.</P>
    <P>By the same token, I would have welcomed a more comprehensive statement from the Council regarding the mid-term view of Lomé IV and the definition of the next financial Protocol.  While leaders haggle on the basis of real or imagined national interest, they forget that all our interests are bound up with the North-South divide.  That divide will be bridged only by the kind of integrated development aid which has been so conspicuously lacking in the EU's policies, despite the imperatives of Maastricht.  In this regard I would welcome a statement from the Government that it will use its influence to ensure a phased elimination of beef export subsidies to Sub-Saharan Africa &mdash; subsidies which are stripping an estimated four million people of their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>Just as the North-South divide affects us all so, too, does the issue of nuclear safety.  In this regard I welcome the Council's stated preoccupation with the threat to global safety from the Ukraine nuclear plants, in particular, their recommendation that the Chernobyl nuclear plant be closed down.  This recommendation is especially telling in the light of the current visit to Ireland by young victims of the Chernobyl disaster &mdash; children who have been condemned to a lingering death by the greed and foolishness of man.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a similar commitment on the part of EU leaders to the closure of Sellafield and THORP.  This <Col N="1095" /> nuclear folly, a mere 70 miles from this House, threatens us all.  Nuclear fall-out knows no borders: THORP is a European issue, and I would welcome a commitment from this Government that it will be placed on the European agenda.</P>
    <P>By the end of the decade the squabble over the Commission Presidency will have been long forgotten, smoothed over by diplomatic niceties.  The other issues &mdash; poverty inside and outside the EU, regional security, nuclear safety and environmental degradation &mdash; will have become even more pressing.  The Corfu Summit provided plenty of drama, but few indications that Europe's leaders are any closer to tackling the real issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Northern Ireland.  It was not just in regard to the failure to agree a new President for the Commission that the Corfu Summit was a great disappointment.  The meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister appears to have been equally unfruitful.  Given the shocking level of continuing violence, the apparent inertia of the two Governments is hard to comprehend and it is a great disappointment that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister did not use the opportunity presented by their meeting to relaunch the search for a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland based on the principles of the Downing Street Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to go into any further detail on this issue but I believe the failure of the two Governments to follow up on the unique momentum for political progress created by the Downing Street Joint Declaration has brought further uncertainty and instability to Northern Ireland.  The sectarian murder gangs have been only too willing to exploit this atmosphere as we saw in the past two weeks on the Shankill Road and in Loughinisland.  I hope the error which the Taoiseach made in New York in referring to what is essentially a pursuit of joint authority will be overcome and that he and the Tánaiste will urgently come to a conclusion on the framework document which they promised us <Col N="1096" /> because people in Northern Ireland can wait no longer while Sinn Féin and the Loyalists decide whether they will give us peace.  We have to take peace, it will not be achieved otherwise.</P>

      <P>In the brief time available to me I first want to congratulate Deputy De Rossa for at least talking about what happened at the Summit which I was honoured to attend.  I wish to refer to some of the points made by the Deputy.  I was asked three questions by the other two spokespersons but I wish to say to Deputy John Bruton that as far as the meetings of the Finance Ministers are concerned, which were held last Thursday night, all day Friday and into Friday night, the conclusions were not written before we arrived in Corfu.  They never are written beforehand when we participate in such meetings.  Perhaps some of the drafts come from Council meetings but to say that the entire exercise is a waste of time is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is not like that.  Deputy De Rossa made two points on economic policies.  The reason for the presence of the Finance Ministers of the European Council was the agenda item concerning the broad guidelines. Drawing up these guidelines is part of the increased co-ordination of member states' economies provided for in the Treaty on European Union as part of the process of movement towards economic and monetary union.  The first guidelines were adopted in December last and outline <Col N="1097" /> the medium term strategy to bring the European Union back to stronger, durable and more employment creating growth.  The new guidelines discussed last weekend in Corfu confirm the strategy. They reaffirm the goal of substantially increasing employment over the coming years and reducing the high levels of unemployment.  The fact that those guidelines were on the agenda in Corfu and on the agendas of future summits will help to focus on unemployment, which was not the case in the past.</P>
      <P>The draft guidelines before the Council last week dealt with the need for price and exchange rate stability, to which Deputy Bruton referred, sound public finances and a more dynamic Community economy in addition to structural measures to deal with creating more employment.  We have been favourably mentioned in those conclusions because of our performance and I believe it is our duty to continue to remain within those guidelines.</P>
      <P>Other areas on which the guidelines lay stress is the need for member states to intensify their efforts to improve the function or economies along the lines of the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Work.  In reply to Deputy De Rossa, much of the Commission's work will be completed and the work started by President Delors in this area will proceed.  The structures he put in place in preparation for the future will not change and I cannot see any Commissioners or leaders of Governments moving from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the structural measures for creating more employment, the recommendation is that member states' structural policy shall be directed towards ensuring that growth delivers more jobs.  The recommendations include reducing the costs of labour <i>vis-à-vis</i> capital, reducing nonwage costs, particularly in respect of the low paid, consistent with the objective of budgetary consolidation, and for stronger investment and increased employment.  I agreed with the emphasis on policies aimed at bringing the Community's economy along a stronger, durable and more employment creating <Col N="1098" /> path.  The issues regarding competitiveness, of course, are equally supported by us.</P>
    <P>In regard to my presence in Corfu, I wish to make some brief points.  First, the most important result of the White Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister get a chance to swim?  The Taoiseach was upset about not getting a swim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has been to change the European agenda and the White Paper on Unemployment will remain to the forefront.  Second, the White Paper has placed a stronger emphasis on options which perhaps have not received sufficient attention at European level, that is, restructuring the tax system to reduce the burden on the lower paid and to promote more investment in education and training.  Deputies will be aware of how much emphasis is put on education and training in the national plan and future summits will continue to follow those policies which are in line with our budgetary policies.</P>
      <P>Work is continuing at European level on the many areas covered by the White Paper, including information technology, trans-European networks and exploiting the potential for small and medium sized enterprises.  Deputy De Rossa referred at length to the trans-European networks and the 11 projects scheduled to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An area likely to be of particular interest is that the Commission intends to draw up a detailed inventory of the various actions at Community level to foster local development and employment initiatives, particularly those concerning micro enterprises and handcraft industries.  The inventory will be accompanied by the proposals deemed necessary to enhance the consistency and effectiveness of these actions.  The White Paper has changed the European landscape in regard to unemployment and given it the necessary drive to take effective action.  Last weekend, the European Council worked to intensify this process. I recall Social Affairs Council meetings <Col N="1099" /> where it was impossible to get the item on the agenda at one stage.  This was the longest session in the summit and was the main debating item but the media pick up on other items, which is the usual story.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to some of the questions put by Deputies.  At the outset of the debate, the Taoiseach stated there was no evidence that any candidate we could have promoted until now would have commanded the necessary unanimous support.  Everybody has the use of the veto and in any sounding process one does not have to be an expert to see that. It is a pointless exercise for people here to try to portray the Presidency of the European Union as being available to this country if only the Irish Government would put forward a certain name. Nothing could be further from the truth. In any of the meetings held last week, nobody in formal session made any point remotely near that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I indicated too, that the £250,000 standing alone might be acceptable but that the <Col N="1102" /> amendment as framed was clearly flawed. My subsequent advice is that the amendment is flawed and the reasons are clearly delineated.  I asked Deputy Sheehan if he would allow me take the proposed amendment to Report Stage but he decided in his wisdom or otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was wisdom.  The numbers were right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted that.  I have no problems about the efficacy of his entitlement to call a vote which he won fair and square.  I thought I would have been allowed to go from Committee Stage to Report Stage on the basis of having a serious look at the proposed fine.  I am prepared to reflect that amount in my amendment.</P>
      <P>I made it clear that the formula proposed by Deputy Sheehan was seriously flawed and that the deletion of section 15 was essential.  In section 15, at the bottom of page 9, line 50 it states &ldquo;where the owner of a foreign sea-fishing ship has a concealed or hidden hold&rdquo;.  The offence applies solely to foreign boats which includes boats of other European member states.  The provision would be in breach of Article 7 of the Treaty which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality and would be struck down by the European Court.  It also creates a combined offence of having on board a fishing vessel a hidden hold and under-sized nets.  It does not state &ldquo;or under-sized nets&rdquo;.  If the State failed to convince the court on either count no penalty could be imposed in respect of the other offence.</P>
      <P>The amendment as proposed envisages confiscation of vessel on conviction for a second offence.  Since the provisions of section 14 permit the State to seek confiscation of a first offence, this would be stronger in fact and in law.  Deputy Sheehan's amendment provides for the confiscation of the vessel, all things being equal, on the second offence.  If it is considered sufficiently grevious the Deputy's amendment would weaken the sanctions which may be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment refers to the owner <Col N="1103" /> of the vessel, without any qualification whatever thus reopening a loophole regarding the transfer of ownership which section 14 goes to great lengths to close.  In proposing the amendment I fully sympathise with the spirit of the Deputy's proposals and have tried to honour the objective they seem to achieve.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 increases the maximum fine for secret holds from the original figure to a figure of £200,000 while the fine for having undersized nets goes up to £50,000.  An owner convicted of both offences would face a combined fine of £250,000.  In those circumstances the Deputy will appreciate I am readily accepting the spirit and intention of his original amendment, as it was my intention to do on being allowed to take it from Committee Stage to Report Stage. The intention is to provide the courts with good workable law and avoid the inclusion of provisions that serve, albeit unintentionally, to undermine the legislation they seek to enforce.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 meet fully the requirements of Deputy Sheehan's Committee Stage amendment.  Amendment No. 3 proposes that in the case of orders under the section relating to capacity plans the fine shall not exceed £200,000 while in the case of orders under the section relating to undersized nets the fine shall not exceed £15,000.  In addition, forefeiture will be a statutory consequence of conviction of an offence under the section dealing with undersized nets.</P>
    <P>The original intention was to inflict damage on Spanish fleets, whose fishing practices I have continued to highlight since becoming Minister.  The fine will apply to vessels from all member states and will not be directed solely at Spanish vessels.  However, having regard to their fishing practices I have no doubt that Spanish vessels will suffer most.  It is important to remember that many member states do not have vessels to the value of the fine.  This is why I sought to keep the fine at a reasonable level; in other words, to ensure a balance.  As <Col N="1104" /> Deputy Byrne, whom I welcome back to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;pointed out, the amendment was agreed by a majority of one, 11 to ten.  This reflected the will of the House and it is not my intention to do anything contrary to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have responsibilities. The present system is rather loose and was proved so on that occasion. I have no doubt that the Government and future Governments will operate in a tighter fashion.  Having regard to the way in which I met the requirements of Deputy Sheehan's amendment, I hope the Fine Gael Deputies will accept my amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's acceptance of my Committee Stage amendment in a mixed fashion.  My amendment proposed that:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or of any other enactment, where the owner of a foreign sea-fishing ship has a concealed or hidden hold and undersized fishing nets on board that ship that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable in the case of a first offence to a fine of £100,000 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to forfeiture of the sea-fishing ship.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to alter my amendment slightly by proposing that ships with a hidden hold should be liable to a fine not exceeding £200,000 while ships using undersized nets should be liable to a fine not exceeding £50,000.  As this meets the proposal in my amendment of a fine of £250,000 I will support these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the efforts by the Minister to ensure the conservation of our fishing stocks.  Marauding trawlers understand only one language, fines and confiscation <Col N="1105" /> of their vessels.  I am sorry that the Minister has not made these penalties mandatory because, regardless of our best intentions, this fine will not have the effect it should have if it is not mandatory.</P>
    <P>During the past 30 years I witnessed the rape of our fishing grounds through indiscriminate fishing by foreign trawlers. Before our accession to the European Union those trawlers would have been described as foreign, today they are regarded as European trawlers.  I welcome the deletion of the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; by the Minister on the grounds that it would probably inhibit a prosecution against a vessel from another EU country. While I admire his courage in doing this, he has failed to deliver the killer punch.  The only language the owner of these vessels understand is confiscation of the vessels used to carry out these offences.  Nobody should be fooled into thinking that an offence of this type is an isolated case.  Our fishery protection boats have arrested a number of these trawlers and brought them into my home port of Castletownbere.  The fines imposed on the owners of these trawlers could be described as peanuts.  While it is all right to believe that everything will be in order if we introduce this fine, will the Minister inform the House whether the judges will impose it and implement forfeiture of the vessels of offenders when it is not mandatory?</P>
    <P>We will fail in our efforts and the accusing finger will be pointed at us by generations to come if we do not cement the law ensuring that it is illegal for such people to operate fishing vessels with secret holds, ravaging and plundering the fishing stocks off our coasts, so badly needed for our economy.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Taoiseach state he was 100 per cent behind the preservation of whales but is he 100 per cent behind the preservation of such a valuable industry to the future of all our coastal areas?  We must remember we are now the only island nation in Europe, Great Britain having been joined to the Continent by the Channel tunnel.  It cannot be over-emphasised that the fishing <Col N="1106" /> industry is of paramount importance for the future benefit of the people of our coastal hinterland.  We have one of the richest fish breeding grounds worldwide, in the north atlantic ocean, in the waters off our coastline.  Alas, there is no point in endeavouring to develop that fishing industry or in maintaining it has a future unless we ensure its preservation to the nth degree.  I know that for years under-sized fish have been scooped up in illegal nets by marauding trawlers off our western and south western seaboards.  How can we ensure the preservation of decent black sole, plaice, pollock, hake, mackerel, crayfish, or any species of fish that have inhabited our waters in such numbers unless we ensure total compliance with the law?</P>
    <P>The Minister has fallen short of delivering the killer blow.  He should accept that forfeiture of offending vessels should be mandatory when they contain a hidden or concealed hold.  No Minister for Fisheries or the Marine in any other European Union member state today is so gullible as to believe that such fishing vessels are being passed by their senior Departmental officials before being issued with a licence.  I cannot understand why the Minister stopped short of rendering the forfeiture of offending vessels mandatory, thereby ensuring the preservation of our fishing stocks for future generations.</P>
    <P>I admire the Minister's courage and tact and do not doubt his ability within the Council of Fisheries Ministers.  I know he upholds his bailiwick there but he should go the whole hog and agree that forfeiture of such vessels be mandatory. Sympathy has been expressed for fishing skippers when apprehended and brought to justice within our jurisdiction but there should be no sympathy for people who set out indiscriminately to destroy an industry so vital to our economy.  That is why forfeiture, as a statutory consequence of conviction should be mandatory and stipulated in the Minister's amendment No. 3.  If the Minister does so, there will be no more hidden holds in foreign vessels.  In turn, this will lead to a new fishing fleet for our young skippers <Col N="1107" /> from confiscated vessels.  In addition, under-sized fishing nets will not be deployed scooping up baby fish which are sold at lucrative prices on Continental markets for paella and other dishes.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that we are so native in adopting every European directive enacted by the European Parliament while observing different member states flouting the same laws.  How can any country stand over the sale of illegal fish in public markets on the Continent whereas, when our fishery officers catch a fish dealer selling under-sized fish here, he is apprehended and immediately subjected to our laws?  How can people in Spain, Portugal, France and Germany get away with this type of behaviour while we continue to be good Europeans?</P>
    <P>With the passage of this Bill, as amended, the Minister's name will be enshrined for ever in the hearts of fishermen throughout the length and breadth of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Coughlan will row in with me this evening even though she differed from me on the last occasion.  In his wisdom, the Minister will see fit to introduce the mandatory forfeiture of such offending fishing vessels.  There is no point in beating about the bush unless one roots out the rabbit.  The Minister has an opportunity and should remember that it only knocks once.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the Irish fishing industry and the beleaguered fishermen who are getting the rough end of the stick from other European fishermen they encounter off our coasts the Minister must insert the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; in amendment No. 3.  I am sure his officials will be only too pleased to do so to put an end to the piracy and stop the plunder of our fish stock and secure the future prosperity of that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I arrived on the scene just in time to join in that key decision to defeat the Government for the first time on a Bill.  I am pleased to see Deputy Coughlan on the back benches.  I am sure she is heading for promotion.  The person responsible for the mess, Deputy Lawlor, is not present.  Perhaps he will come into the House when the division bells ring.</P>
      <P>We should not play down what is involved in concealment and the use of hidden holds on ships.  In this case we are trying to get a penalty to fit the crime. We must view sea pirates in a different light.  We are dealing with international fraudsters &mdash; either ship owners or skippers &mdash; who conceal fish in secret holds. The Minister should be realistic about this difficulty.  It is reprehensible that any skipper or ship owner could presumably bring his ship into shipyards and have huge sections of the underbelly or the hull of the ship sealed off to conceal the fraud of circumventing the quotas system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The Cook Report&rdquo; on television supported the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see &ldquo;The Cook Report&rdquo;.  I am trying to visualise the amount of time, effort and money ship owners must go to to weld in huge holds to hide large quantities of fish.  The profits from such an operation must be enormous. We should not underplay or be romantic about this on the basis that they happen to be fishermen operating in deep waters.  There are international laws and international quotas and ship owners and <Col N="1109" /> skippers, like everybody else, are obliged to live within the law.  If people go to such incredible lengths to conceal holds in ships a severe penalty should be imposed.  That was the reason I was happy to support Deputy Sheehan's amendment and the reason I am happy to support him again tonight.</P>
      <P>I am an urban dweller who is not familiar with the fishing industry but there appears to be a systematic planned campaign by wealthy ship owners or skippers to spend large sums of money with a view to reaping huge rewards.  As an island nation with an undeveloped fishing industry a responsible move by us would be to make the penalties severe.  Any international trawler or trawlers of any member state, coming into our waters and behaving like modern pirates should be liable to a severe fine and possible confiscation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for me to repeat what was said in <i>tour de force</i> fashion by Deputy Sheehan but I would like to be associated with his comments. The basis of his argument is that regardless of what is laid down in law a difficulty will always remain, as we have seen heretofore, that the law as applied in the court may be watered down to such an extent that it does not reflect the wishes of the legislature.  Deputy Sheehan highlighted the fact that in many cases the sympathy extended by the court to the offending party or parties resulted in them escaping any severe penalties.</P>
      <P>There will always be the possibility through the Minister's amendment No. 3, which the Minister has so generously called &ldquo;the Sheehan amendment&rdquo;&mdash; we have the Donnelly visas, the Morrisson visas and now we have the Sheehan amendment &mdash; that next month or next year the level of fine we suggest will not be imposed on the offending parties. That will mean that Irish waters will be good for illegal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution, Deputy Sheehan expressed the views of people living in coastal communities that the strongest possible measures will have to be taken to bring to an end the illegal fishing which <Col N="1110" /> is almost closing our Irish fishing industry. Desperate problems require desperate remedies.  While Deputy Sheehan's amendment would have a profound effect so far as the Judiciary is concerned it may well be the only way of making an impact on those who have designs on continuing to fish illegally in our waters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan asked if there was any prospect of introducing an amendment to amendment No. 3.  In the event of the Minister's amendment being accepted is there any possibility of examining in six or 12 months time the effect of it, the number of cases which came before the courts, the results of those cases, the number of people who, on conviction, were fined £200,000 and the extra £50,000?  I fear that while fines of £200,000 and £50,000 can be imposed, offenders may end up paying fines as low as £20,000 or £30,000 which would not be a sufficient penalty.  How severe must the penalty be to ensure that illegal fishing, which has damaged our fishing industry so profoundly, will be brought to an end?</P>
    <P>While I fully accept that the Minister's amendment will strengthen the Bill as originally drafted, the removal of the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; will leave an opening. Perhaps the horse will bolt through the stable door and we will be back to square one where people will see that there is an advantage to be gained in fishing illegally in our waters and continue on their merry way.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response to Deputies Sheehan and Byrne because before we could contemplate a watering down of the amendment passed at the Select Committee we need to be reassured that the Minister's amendment will work and that we will not read that people were fined £2,000 to £10,000 because of extenuating circumstances. Without making provision of mandatory sentencing this remains a possibility, unfortunately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Sheehan's amendment was well intentioned we were, unfortunately, unable to accept <Col N="1111" /> it.  We did however, accept the ethos behind it.  While I do not want to detract from his fame &mdash; perhaps he will not want to be as famous when he gets the blame for the fines that will be imposed &mdash; the Minister's amendment meets his concerns. The Deputy is seeking mandatory forfeiture.  We have had many debates in this House on the question of mandatory sentencing but we have not been able to provide for it.  This begs the question as to whether we are being fair and making good law?</P>
      <P>If a division is called on this amendment we would send the wrong signal. We are at one in terms of our disgust about illegal fishing, My views are not at variance with those of any Member of the Opposition because I, as a representative of Donegal South West, have to deal with this matter on a daily basis. The Minister's amendment is acceptable and the cumulative effect will be a fine of £250,000.  This will tie the hands of those who fish illegally.  For many a day we have encountered cases where the owners of Spanish boats relinquished ownership once they were arrested.  As a consequence they could not be charged with a second offence which would have resulted in forfeiture.  That matter is being addressed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We should accept the amendment because if we are not happy that the Judiciary are not adhering to our intentions we can return to the House and tighten the legislation.  I am very happy with what has been proposed tonight.  We can all play politics with the amendment but this matter is far too important to call a division.  We should send a strong signal that we are united on this issue.  If Deputy Sheehan or any other Deputy is unhappy that the Judiciary are not adhering to the Bill it will be up to us, as legislators, to impress upon the Minister, whoever that may be, the need to provide for mandatory sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will allay our fears by indicating that this fine will make life difficult for those who plunder our waters.  As we are all aware, secret holds are not provided for decorative purposes <Col N="1112" /> but for another reason.  The Minister has done tremendous work at European level in addressing the problems of illegal fishing. I ask Deputy Sheehan to consider the possibility that the wrong signal may be sent if this amendment is not accepted. I am sure that if the Minister could introduce a further amendment to provide for mandatory sentencing he would do so as he is as committed as the rest of us to resolving this problem.  What signal will we be sending if this amendment is not accepted even though we all agree with the ethos behind it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has generated considerable interest particularly in fishing areas.  The feedback is that there would be widespread acceptance of an amendment the purpose of which was to impose a more meaningful fine for such offences.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with two specific offences, the first of which is the provision of a secret hold in a fishing vessel.  As Deputy Coughlan said, a secret hold is not constructed for decorative purposes.  It is provided for the specific purpose of illegal fishing and the violation of regulations.  Unless we are prepared to tolerate piracy on the ocean waves this practice has to be wiped out. One method of doing that is by introducing substantial and adequate fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment Deputy Sheehan proposed a figure of £250,000 for a first offence.  I understand that the Minister is now proposing a figure of £200,000.  At least it can be said in his favour that he has gone a long way towards meeting the figure suggested by Deputy Sheehan and that he has responded positively.  I would go further and suggest that there should be a minimum fine of £200,000 or £250,000.  The word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; should be incorporated in an amendment.  We would not then be at the mercy of the Judiciary who would not be able to impose whatever fine they liked up to £200,000 or £250,000.  Why can we not have a minimum fine of £200,000 or £250,000?  As we are all aware, the owners of foreign registered fishing vessels which are towed into our ports either <Col N="1113" /> get off or are fined in court.  I would be in favour of confiscation if a captain of a fishing vessel is caught a second time because the current rates of fines do not seem to have any effect, offences are repeated on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The second specific offence relates to undersized fishing nets.  I am sure my view reflects that of fishing communities right along our coast in that owners of vessels who go to the trouble of getting undersized fishing net meshes propose to take what they lawfully can within their quota as well as the young fish which ensure the continuation of the species. Some of those people come to our shores having fished out their waters and unless we put a stop to it our rich fishing grounds will end up the same as the coastlines along the countries from which those fishermen come.  The Minister has gone some way to alleviate the problem, but the fine should be at a minimum of at least £200,000.  In this way we would do a great service to our fishing community. Deputy Coughlan and I met a deputation of fishing interests from Donegal this evening and they outlined their concerns about the crisis facing the industry.  This is an opportunity for us to show them that we understand their difficulties.  I support the amendment and I hope it will be possible to incorporate the word &ldquo;minimum.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the original amendment by positively responding to the amount of the fine proposed, but unfortunately, I am now called on to alter my amendment by either inserting the amount of the fine as a minimum or mandatory figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Coughlan stated, the question of mandatory sentencing and fines is complex, and, in the circumstances, I would appreciate if the Opposition would withdraw its request to insert the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; in the legislation because it would create difficulties to which I cannot respond this evening.  The Deputies are asking the courts to adopt an inflexible attitude to the application of justice, which is not a proper course of action in the circumstances.  I would be pleased <Col N="1114" /> to respond within a specified time to a parliamentary question or a review, as requested by Deputy Bradford, on the manner in which the fines of £200,000 and £50,000 are working.  A report in that regard could be placed in the Library for the benefit of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Mandatory fines have a poor record in terms of conviction levels.  In circumstances where a court believes an injustice would be done by imposing a mandatory sentence, it might be unwilling to convict the person involved.  Courts are uneasy about imposing mandatory sentences as a matter of practice and, as a matter of ascertainable fact, the discretion and independence entrusted to the courts would be undermined by mandatory sentencing.  This is a complex area.  The amendment does not seek mandatory sentencing.  It proposes a fine of £250,000 to which I am responding positively.  However, I have been requested this evening to introduce a mandatory sentence in this regard.  That complex area might be more properly addressed on another occasion.</P>
    <P>On taking up office I undertook to examine the question of undersized nets, secret holds, the abuse of quotas and so on, and to take draconian measures in that regard.  This legislation has done that, particularly section 14, which requires that the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case before it, should order the forfeiture of a vessel on the first offence if necessary.</P>
    <P>I discharged my promises to the fishing industry in relation to forfeiture of vessels and fines as requested by a Committee of the House and proposed by Deputy Sheehan.  Having regard to the question of proportionality, the balance of justice and the need to be seen to be evenhanded in the application of the law, this penalty might be deemed on judicial review to be excessive.  Furthermore, this amendment will not only apply to the predators to which Deputy Byrne referred, but to all members of the Euopean Union.  The significance of that must not escape the House's attention.  This provision would apply not only to the <Col N="1115" /> Spaniards, but to all other member states.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Deputy would meet me in the spirit in which I met his original amendment, withdraw this amendment and accept mine.  I will undertake in due course to respond to a parliamentary question on the operability of the fines proposed.  The question of a mandatory sentence is too complex to address on this occasion, but it could be addressed by way of amending legislation based on a review of the operability of the present legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 12, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister made an effort to improve the position of the fishing industry.  My point is similar to that made by Deputy Sheehan. The proposal to increase the fine to £2,500 is sensible as we all know money is made from illegal fishing.  The only possible way to control illegal fishing is by imposing increased fines.  The old fine was in the region of £500, but it was not imposed and age-old poaching continues. Recently some people were imprisoned for three months for killing a rabbit. Poaching of our inland and coastal fish is disgraceful.  I have heard and read of threats to public representatives who highlighted illegal fishing.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the proposed fine of £2,500.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Clohessy's amendment.  In my locality we have seen an increase in the number of attacks on fishery protection officers and officers trying to enforce fishery regulations. We should move towards imposing a substantial fine.  The amendment to increase the fine from £1,000 to £2,500 is worthwhile and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>Section 16 provides penalties for assaulting a fisheries officer. The purpose of Deputy Clohessy's amendment proposed by the Opposition is to increase the fine on summary conviction from £1,000 to £2,500.  The proposed penalty of £1,000 is the maximum fine that can be imposed by the District Court.  I pointed that out to Deputy Molloy who tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  After I explained to him why it was not possible to accept his amendment, he withdrew it.  I cannot accept this amendment.  Section 16 provides the following penalties for assaulting or obstructing a fishery officer: for an assault on summary conviction a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both, which is quite considerable; on indictment, such a fine as the court may impose or up to five years imprisonment or both, and for obstruction, on summary conviction a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both.  Section 16 provides penalties for assaulting or obstructing a fisheries officer.  The penalty proposed for a summary conviction for assault is £1,000.  The reason for proposing this amount is that it is the maximum fine that can be imposed by the District Court.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the work carried out by fishery officers and the need to provide them with adequate protection, in so far as the law can protect them in the course of their duties.  In many instances they have been subjected to the most appalling physical violence.  That is not acceptable to this Government nor will it be to any future Government.  The penalties offer the fullest protection the law can provide but I do not want to under-estimate the role these officers play in the protection of our fisheries.  They do an exceptional job in a courageous fashion and the Deputy's amendment was put forward in that spirit.  I cannot accept it because of the rules of the District Court as distinct from those I might wish to apply.  My hands are bound.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 33, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962 makes it an offence to purchase salmon and trout without a dealer's licence.  The amendment proposes to extend the provision to include eels and molluscan shellfish which would include oysters, mussels, clams and abalone.  The amendment will also consolidate Part X of the 1959 Act &mdash; the Principal Act is defined as the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 &mdash; which deals with salmon, trout, eels and molluscan shellfish. Consequently, section 28 of the 1962 Act can be repealed as proposed.  The penalties specified for an offence in the original section are also being revised upwards.  Again this is being done in the spirit of the views expressed by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962 introduced restrictions on the sale of salmon and trout.  It made unlawful the purchase of salmon and trout by any person who was not a holder, or the authorised agent of a holder, of a Part X licence which relates of salmon, trout, eels and mulluscan shellfish.  Certain exceptions were made where salmon and trout were bought for specified bona fide purposes.  Authorised agents needed to produce documentary evidence of authorisation when requested by an inspector.  Penalties were also imposed for giving false and misleading information. These provisions are ancillary and supplement the provisions of section 154 to 163, inclusive, of the 1954 Act. It was considered that it would be better placed in the 1959 Act so that all provisions on licensing can be found side by side.  The intention is to consolidate all <Col N="1121" /> licensing matters in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this amendment and welcome the inclusion of eels as one of the types of fish for which one must have a Part X licence.  It is a welcome amendment to the original Act of 1959 which will make life much easier for many fishery enforcement officers particularly in the midlands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting adjustment required on foot of changes to section 159 in Committee to require a licence for each premises from which salmon, trout, eels or molluscan shellfish are sold.  At present multiple outlets are required to have only one Part X licence and to keep only one register while owners of single outlets have to pay the same fee for their one outlet.  The administrative costs for the fishery boards of checking the outlets of the multiples are substantially greater than for checking one shop.  In the <Col N="1123" /> interest of justice it is appropriate that the fee should be extended unit by unit in the context of multiple outlets.  The change will make the implementation of the Part X licence provision more equitable and just.  The licence costs £60 which, given the profits from the sale of the product, is not large.  I have no doubt this amendment will find favour with the body of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for allowing us to debate this amendment which proposes to make it an offence to be in possession of an eel fishing net.  I tabled this amendment following discussions with fishery officers, rank and file gardaí and Garda officers in my locality.  They feel it would strengthen their hand considerably if they were in a position to prosecute people found in possession of eel fishing nets without being able to justify having them. I am aware that the 1959 Act provides that possession of nets in the vicinity of a waterway can lead to a prosecution.  I want to broaden that provision to include possession of eel nets in any location, bearing in mind that if I am suspected of being involved in house breaking and am found in possession of house breaking implements, it is possible to prosecute me.  I am referring here to people who have eel nets, many of whom are known to be involved in illegal eel fishing and some of whom would have been prosecuted already.  I am aware of one person who has a shed full of eel nets, many of them probably stolen, and under the law as it stands, he is entitled to keep them. This has led to people passing nets to others who fish for them and are paid a few pounds for the eels taken.  In my area some young people were given eel nets to fish and sold their catch, with tragic consequences.  We need to deal with people, many of whom use the money they make from their illegal eel fishing for subversive purposes.  Recently in my area a considerable cache of arms was seized and I have no doubt that many of the people involved take part in illegal eel fishing.  They are involved with subversives and perhaps facilitate others in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the amendment may not be perfect in its drafting and I can see difficulties with it &mdash; for example, a fishery <Col N="1127" /> officer who has eel nets would be liable for prosecution under it.  The wording may need to be tightened up but I would ask the Minister to accept it in principle because the practitioners on the ground believe their hands would be considerably strengthened by such a regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as drafted deals with this point.  While the spirit and intention of the proposed amendment is understandable, nevertheless it lacks perfection and legal purity.  In the circumstances it would be neither practical nor appropriate for me to accept it.  The reason for the amendment is understandable as it has proved difficult to obtain convictions against known eel poachers some of whom store eel fishing gear, ready for use.  There are restrictions in sections 95 and 96 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, on the possession or control of nets in the vicinity of a lake or a river but the onus of proof is on the defendant to show he did not intend to use the net illegally.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the tragedies referred to by the Deputy.  As he pointed out, there are many difficulties in imposing a blanket ban on the possession of eel fishing nets.  For example, as eel fishing expires on 31 December each year and these licences are generally renewed in March, April and May, the proposed amendment would make illegal the possession of nets by fishermen in the intervening period.  It would also cause difficulties to those who repair or transport eel fishing nets in that possession of eel fishing nets would be illegal unless they happened to be licensed to fish. Most eel fishing nets used here are imported and therefore transport companies carrying such nets could be breaking the law.  I am sure it was not the Deputy's intention to introduce such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the new provisions in the Bill will lead to a severe curtailment of activities of eel poachers by making it very difficult for them to move illegally caught eels.  The Deputy's firm purpose of intention is laudable and praiseworthy, particularly having regard to his experience, <Col N="1128" /> but, as he said, his amendment is effectively flawed and for that reason as well as the other reasons I have enumerated, I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind words.  At drafting stage I realised the difficulties I would encounter in having such an amendment accepted. Perhaps the Minister and his officials would consider another way to deal with this matter &mdash; for example, people who have been convicted for fishing illegally could be prevented from holding nets again, although that may impinge on a person's freedom to hold a licence again. People with a large quantity of nets, many of them stolen, do not mind if they lose five or ten nets.  They are immune from prosecution.  I understand the Minister's argument but perhaps he would ask his experts to consider the matter with a view to introducing a regulation or including in this legislation in the Seanad a provision that would strengthen the hand of the Garda and the fishery officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not undertake to amend the measure in the Seanad but I will consider the operation of the new legislation to see how it is working and if after a period it proves to be defective I will reconsider the matter.  I cannot give the Deputy any undertaking on the type of amendment he requires.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;22.&mdash;Legitimate possession of eels by eel licence holders shall be restricted to an area within a radius of 5 miles from the waterway to which the licence applies.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from discussions with fishery officers, rank and file gardaí and senior Garda officers.  I mentioned in the House that fishery officers and gardaí, after painstaking work, brought <Col N="1129" /> to court a number of people for illegal possession of eels and in the course of evidence being taken the people involved presented a person from County Cavan who had a legitimate licence and claimed that the eels which were seen being taken from a lake in County Westmeath, were merely eels in transit.  He stated that they were his eels and they were put into Lough Ennell to give them a drink of water while in transit.  Thankfully, the learned judge disregarded the evidence.</P>
    <P>Cases arise on occasion whereby people in possession of eels are accompanied by a licence holder who may have a licence in County Mayo, Clare or elsewhere and are in possession of eels in County Westmeath.  This is a difficulty.  I can see difficulties also with my amendment.  For example, if the part-time licence holder dealer is not within five miles of the fisherman's premises or the lake, how does one get the eels to him?  Perhaps a distance of five miles is too narrow a radius.  What we need to stamp out is the kind of practice whereby somebody with a licence in counties Clare or Mayo may claim that the eels found in his possession in County Westmeath are a legitimate catch held by him.  My amendment is probably flawed but the Minister will appreciate the spirit of what I am saying on the need to strengthen the hand of fisheries officers and the Garda to enable them to track down the offenders bearing in mind their associations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being extremely reasonable in the sense that he recognises the difficulties in meeting his proposals.  There is a very serious difficulty with the proposed amendment which would cause considerable problems for licensed fishermen.  There are many licensed fishermen who live more than five miles from where they fish. There is also the question of the sale of the catch of eels which, under the proposed amendment, would require dealers to go to the fishermen and buy the eels as they are caught.  This would be impractical and would impede unnecessarily the development of the eel fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should it be decided &mdash; and this may console the Deputy &mdash; that a restriction <Col N="1130" /> on the movement of eels by licensed fishermen would be necessary, it is possible at any stage to include that as a condition of the authorisation, the breach of which would attract a fine of up to £1,000 plus the forfeiture of any fish and gear.  As the Deputy has said the difficulty is in the drafting of the amendment.  The intention is well meaning but in the circumstances I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated that the Minister realises the difficulties involved but I ask him again to look at the issue and perhaps at some stage the movement of eels caught illegally will be curtailed.</P>
      <P>This could be an extremely lucrative industry.  It is estimated that £4 million worth of eels are exported live annually. If we were to process the eels in some way we could increase their value manifold. We should also bear in mind that this would create much needed employment. It is very important then that we protect what is a growing industry, a very lucrative industry with even more potential. Any regulations that can be brought forward to make it easier for legitimate eel fishermen to make their living and thereby bring prosperity to the country would be welcome.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment in the names of Deputies Gay Mitchell and Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> is to postpone the coming into operation of the Bill for three months after the date of its passing.  Under section 1, all the provisions of the Bill, save section 68 and the various sections dealing with the new disciplinary tribunal come into effect immediately on the date of its passing.  The matter of commencement was dealt with in some detail on Committee Stage.  The main problem with the amendment in the names of Deputies Mitchell and Browne is that it delays all the provisions of the Bill for three months and I do not believe that is necessary.  The reason that the provisions referred to in subsection (4) will not come into operation until such day as may be fixed by order of the Minister is simply to allow the new disciplinary tribunal to be established.  The new disciplinary tribunal is a new body to replace the existing disciplinary committee.  It will comprise solicitors and for the first time lay persons.  My intention is to establish the disciplinary tribunal as soon as possible and I am aware that the Law Society, too, is most anxious that it be established with the least possible delay. I indicated on Committee Stage that I hoped to have this tribunal established <Col N="1132" /> within three months but I do not wish to be tied to a strict time limit in this regard. There is no good reason why all the other provisions of the Bill, bar section 68, should not come into operation immediately on the passage of the Bill.  The reason for putting a three month time limit on section 68 is because it places new obligations on solicitors to inform clients about charges and so on and I want to give the Law Society an opportunity to inform solicitors of their obligations in this regard and to allow them a limited period to get acclimatised to the changes.</P>
      <P>Apart from those provisions, there is no reason the rest of the Bill should not come into effect immediately on its passage as it has been awaited for a very long time.  I understand the reasoning behind the amendments of Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Browne but I cannot accept them because they have the effect &mdash; unintended perhaps &mdash; of delaying much needed sections of the Bill for three months.</P>

I am satisfied that the amendment I now propose will facilitate the administration of the business of the society and allow it to deal with the increased business and correspondence likely to arise under the numerous provisions of the Bill when it comes into <Col N="1134" /> effect.  The amendment will enable a committee of the council to delegate functions to a specific senior officer of the society subject to the prior approval of the council which will also be empowered to revoke any such delegation of authority. I am satisfied that the provision will allow for the speedier transaction of business and enable the society to deal with complaints from the public more effectively and speedily.  Acceptance of this amendment will require a drafting change to subsection (2) of section 7 which I also propose.  I assume Deputies will have no quibble with that amendment as, in substance, it is the same as Deputy Mitchell's amendment but drafted differently.

      <P>There was discussion on Committee Stage on the question of the time limit for making complaints under the provisions of this section.  Views ranged from having a time limit of three, five or seven years to abolishing the limit.  The view of the majority of Deputies who contributed to the debate was that there should be some time limit although it did not prove possible to reach consensus on how long it should be.  I have considered the matter in the light of the debate on Committee Stage and on balance five years is a reasonable time limit for making complaints under this section.  There must be some certainty in this area.  We are talking about a business relationship between a solicitor and his or her client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a client is unhappy or dissatisfied with the bill of costs, one would expect that he or she would raise the matter quickly with the solicitor.  From the solicitor's point of view, he or she is unlikely to allow a long period of time to elapse if a bill of costs has not been paid.  In fact, if the time limit that has been allowed to elapse is too long, the solicitor could find himself or herself statute barred in <Col N="1136" /> relation to legally pursuing the client. The more likely position is that the solicitor will pursue his client for the amount of the bill.  Five years is a reasonable period and in fact it is arguable that in the majority of cases a much shorter period is likely to prove adequate.  However, I am trying to ensure justice for the client and the solicitor and I do not want to rule out a legitimate complaint about a bill of costs because the Bill provided for too short a period.</P>
    <P>Time limits apply in respect of all causes of action.  That is desirable so that there is certainty in the law and in business relationships.  In relation to the amendment in the names of Deputies Mitchell and Browne, I am not inclined to accept a time limit of seven years, it is too long.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment, which has not been moved, will allow a client to complain about a bill of costs regardless of how long it was issued. There is a need for certainty and fairness here.  The provision in the section allows for a retrospective period of five years which, in my amendment, refers to when a complaint was made.  It is fair to all concerned, the client, the solicitor and the Law Society, which will be required to investigate a complaint of overcharging.</P>
    <P>The technical change I made in the amendment relates to a problem we discussed which was brought to my attention on Committee Stage.  If somebody had made a complaint within a period of five years before the section came into operation, they could require that to be investigated 30 years or 100 years into the future.  That had to be changed to ensure that one can only go back five years in relation to any complaint.  As I said, it was not possible to reach consensus on a period of three, five or seven years but everybody, with the exception of one person, felt there should be some time limit to bring certainty to the area. Deputy Browne and Deputy Mitchell wanted a time limit of seven years.  The period in relation to a personal injuries action is only three years and, therefore, the five year period originally proposed is fair and reasonable.</P>

I have been advised that this can be safely increased to £1,500 and I, therefore, propose to amend the relevant provisions of the Bill by increasing the maximum fine from £1,000 to £1,500.  This represents a significant adjustment and increases the maximum fine by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The fine in section 11 is backed up by the potentially heavier sanctions which may be imposed on a solicitor for misconduct which, pursuant to section 24 of the Bill, includes any contravention of the solicitors' Acts or any order or regulation made thereunder.  For example, solicitors who fail to comply with any provision of the solicitors Acts may have practising certificates suspended under section 58.  In addition, they could be brought before the disciplinary tribunal and ultimately struck off the roll of solicitors.</P>
      <P>The Society also has the power under section 61 to refuse to issue a practising certificate to a solicitor who fails to comply with sections 8, 9, or 10.  Taken together these provisions represent a strong deterrent and I doubt if any solicitor would wish to face having a criminal record and his or her career suspended or terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards section 18, Deputies Mitchell <Col N="1138" /> and Browne propose to create an indictable offence in a case where a person acts as an agent of a solicitor to render nugatory an order of the High Court made under that section.  This raises the question of proportionality and consistency throughout the Bill.  I do not believe that the offence in question should be indictable.  I have been advised &mdash; I undertook on Committee Stage to consider this &mdash; that a person who interferes with a court order under this section would leave himself or herself open to being cited for contempt of court.  That would be a matter for the High Court which has unlimited powers in relation to sanctions in cases of contempt.</P>
    <P>The question of proportionality also arises in the case of the amendment proposed by Deputies Mitchell and Browne to create an indictable offence under section 21.  This section deals with a solicitor who has been struck off or suspended and seeks employment in connection with the provision of legal services without informing his employer that he or she is unqualified by reason of having been struck off or suspended or who engages in legal work, for example, as a clerk in a solicitor's office without first obtaining the permission of the Incorporated Law Society.  We should look at this provision in the light of other offences in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 63 increases the penalties where an unqualified person acts as a solicitor.  That is a most serious matter and under that section a person convicted of an offence on indictment will be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine of £10,000, or both.  I refer Deputies to section 77 of the Bill which provides for a fine of £10,000 on conviction and indictment where an unqualified person carries out any of the reserved functions provided for in section 58 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 21 offences are not as serious and a summary offence is appropriate in these cases.  I am confident that I have the correct balance in the Bill with respect to these various offences.  I do not believe it is necessary to provide for an indictable offence in sections 18 and 21 and for these reasons I urge my amendment on the <Col N="1139" /> House and ask that the alternative amendments be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when he says there is need for balance in the fines to be imposed.  Will he clarify how he was able to increase the fines as they are for summary offences?  On Committee Stage there was much debate about the stringency of penalties.  There are other sections dealing with misconduct and internal sanctions other than fines and penalties which are adequate and can be imposed.  The implications are enormous for a solicitor found guilty of misconduct.  To go through that process is penalty enough for many solicitors.  It is worth putting on record that there is not a host of corrupt solicitors but many incompetent solicitors.  Sometimes incompetence leads to negligence.  In an effort to hide negligence solicitors can fall foul of the law and be guilty of serious misconduct.  This was clearly identified in several cases in the recent past.</P>
      <P>We have achieved the correct balance. There was an increase in the fines for summary offences and that is welcome. The procedures we have put in place in the legislation were needed in the interests of the public.  For the first time this Bill tips the solicitor-client relationship in favour of the client.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  We must maintain a balance and there must be a presumption that solicitors are acting in the best interests of their clients.  The majority of them are honest people doing a good day's work.  I welcome the increase in the fines to £1,500 where applicable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that concern was expressed about the level of fines on Committee Stage.  It was felt we might have to confine it to a maximum of £1,000 because it is a summary offence. The Attorney General carried out a review of the position and has advised me that it can be safely increased from £1,000 to £1,500.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to require the society to adjourn the investigation of a complaint under sections 8 or 9 when the substance of the complaint is likely to be determined by a court in separate proceedings. In the majority of such cases the only reasonable course for the society to take would be to suspend investigation of complaints received under sections 8 or 9, depending on the outcome of the court proceedings.  There is a good argument for allowing the society to proceed in certain circumstances notwithstanding the fact that the substance of such complaint may come before the courts.  For example, where proceedings are likely to be protracted, suspension of the society's investigation may well cut off a complainant's access to redress under sections 8 and 9.  I stressed on Committee Stage that would negate the client orientated thrust of these provisions.  Basically what Deputies Browne and Mitchell seek to achieve will apply in 99.9 per cent of cases.  There may be the odd case where proceedings will be protracted and it might be in the interests of the client and of justice that the matter proceed.  From that point of view I would prefer to leave the Bill as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been a number of agreements between the social partners, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> All sides, the unions, employers and the Government, have benefited from these agreements. Under the <i>Programme for National <Col N="1141" /> Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> local authorities could arrange social employment schemes, CEDP schemes and other part-time work schemes subject to the agreement of the trade unions involved.  Many local authorities made great use of those schemes which provided work for hundreds and enabled many useful projects to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Despite the efforts of Dublin Corporation, the trade unions refused to allow community employment schemes to be established under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The members of Dublin Corporation were very happy with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and were informed that the ICTU had given approval to the establishment of these schemes on a nationwide basis and that instructions would be issued to all its unions acquainting it accordingly &mdash; the finer details were to be decided at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite several weeks of negotiations Dublin Corporation officials and unions representing its workers have not reached agreement on the community employment schemes.  I am disappointed at the failure of the unions to agree to these schemes.  I have been a trade union member for many years and I do not believe in bashing unions but I am very disappointed that they have refused to allow the setting up of community employment schemes under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> They talk about their concern for unemployed people but they are not doing anything about them in this case.  I hope the Minister will take a personal interest in this matter and talk to Bill Attley, Philip Flynn or other top officials of the ICTU which I understand gave an undertaking that the schemes would be approved.  Much work could be carried out in Dublin under these schemes &mdash; the corporation has a long list of suitable projects &mdash; and 500 to 600 jobs could be created.  I am very disappointed at the refusal of the trade unions to agree to these schemes and would like to know if <Col N="1142" /> the Minister can do anything to get the show back on the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about this matter.  In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the social partners committed themselves to full co-operation and flexibility both at national and local levels in the operation of employment programmes, including programmes within all parts of the public sector, so as to ensure the successful operation of employment initiatives.  Despite this commitment, I am aware that there are ongoing difficulties in Dublin Corporation in securing approval from the trade unions in the corporation for sponsorship by the corporation of projects under the community employment programme.</P>
      <P>I understand from FÁS, which has been in regular contact with management in Dublin Corporation, that discussions are continuing between management and the trade unions and I would urge all concerned to try to resolve the existing difficulties with a view to allowing the provision of much needed opportunities for persons who are long term unemployed in the Dublin Corporation area. There is a high level of long term unemployment in the area and people there who are long term unemployed would obviously be very interested in participating in locally based projects under community employment.  The programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to the long term unemployed and to its acceptance that despite the pick up in economic activity and the downward trend in unemployment in recent months direct Government intervention will continue to be required for the foreseable future in order to assist people who are long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, the Government has committed resources of £183 million for the community employment programme in 1994 and further resources will be made available should they become necessary so as to ensure that the end year target of 40,000 is reached.  There were 29,325 people on the programme on 24 June involved in projects spread throughout the country, but tragically <Col N="1143" /> none were in the Dublin Corporation area.</P>
    <P>Community employment provides part-time work together with personal and skills development opportunities averaging 19½ hours per week for the unemployed for at least one year and for up to three years in the case of the older long term unemployed.  The programme is operated as a key resource in areas covered by the local development programme where special additional efforts will be made to improve the progression chances of participants through co-ordinated area action.  Projects operated under the programme are for community and public benefit and may be sponsored by public bodies and voluntary organisations. Commercial State or private companies are eligible to sponsor special projects to be carried out under the local development programme.  In a special effort to assist the most disadvantaged of the unemployed &mdash; the older very long term unemployed &mdash; 25 per cent of all available places have been set aside for those over 45 years of age who have been unemployed for three years or more.</P>
    <P>All participants retain those secondary and other social welfare benefits to which they had been entitled prior to participation. They include entitlements such as the Christmas bonus, fuel vouchers, butter vouchers, beef vouchers, medical card, variable local authority rent and supplementary welfare payments such as the back to school footwear and clothing allowance, mortgage relief etc.  Obviously the retention of these entitlements, coupled with the fact that the basic allowances are significantly higher than unemployment compensation payments represent a significant financial incentive to prospective participants.</P>
    <P>FÁS estimates that at least 5,000 additional places could be made available in local authorities if industrial relations problems in a number of such bodies were resolved.  At present, a total of 11,000 opportunities are available or have been approved in local authorities. I have been advised that there is scope for approximately 600 opportunities in the Dublin Corporation area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I am satisfied that community employment, with its mixture of work-based opportunities and training and development modules, represents a decisive shift towards a participant centred approach, emphasising the need to provide useful work and skills for participants.  The programme is providing worthwhile opportunities for the long term unemployed and for this reason I share the concern of Deputy Ahern and other Deputies who are also members of Dublin City Council that the trade unions in Dublin Corporation continue to prevent and resist the introduction of the programme by the corporation.  I appeal to the local shop stewards to seriously consider that by their actions opportunities are being denied to persons who, unlike them, are not employed.  I also appeal to the unions involved at national level to become involved with a view to achieving a resolution of this matter.</P>
    <P>I have taken a personal interest in this matter and have had direct contacts with representatives of ICTU and, as recently as today, with senior management of Dublin Corporation.  I assure Deputy Ahern, whose bona fides and commitment to this matter are known to me, and the other members of the Dublin City Council that I am determined to ensure that the opportunities under the community employment programme will be fully availed of by the citizens of Dublin through Dublin Corporation, with the full co-operation of the trade union movement which has given a solemn and binding undertaking to do so in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>Deputy Crowley gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the possibility of holding forthcoming elections on a Sunday in view of the fact that eight out of 12 EU countries vote on a Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this <Col N="1145" /> important issue.  With the agreement of the House I should like to share my time with Deputies Bradford and Sheehan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue for a number of reasons, especially because of the low poll in the recent European elections.  While the public may be cynical of politicians we contribute to such cynicism by not having voting on a Sunday.  Anybody on the quays in Dublin on a Friday evening will have noticed the enormous number of buses leaving for Cork, Kerry, or wherever, taking people home for the weekend.  Those people would vote if they had an opportunity to do so but, because voting here is on a Wednesday or Thursday, they are deprived of exercising their franchise.</P>
      <P>On the same issue, in the Minister's constituency, indeed in each of our constituencies, primary schools are closed on polling day whereas, if voting was permitted on a Sunday, that too could be eliminated.  In addition the abuse &mdash; and I suggest it is an abuse &mdash; of having county council engineers, primary teachers and so on preside at polling booths on a Wednesday or Thursday when there are in excess of 300,000 people unemployed could also be eliminated.</P>
      <P>We must take another look at holding elections on a Wednesday or Thursday as against Sunday because it is my strong belief we could do much more to encourage the public to vote on a Sunday, giving a clear indication of our concern about the unemployed.  I am glad the Minister is present because he knows what it is like to suffer the interval of 24 hours from the end of voting until the count commences.  When one takes into account that some candidates in the last European elections had to wait from Thursday until Monday and others until Tuesday, one realises they must have sweated blood.  I am not making a political point in saying so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we voted on a Sunday, on the same day as the vast majority of other EU member states, we would conform to the <Col N="1146" /> pattern virtually throughout Europe, it would be the right thing to do, encourage people to vote on that day and alleviate a problem for candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crowley for allowing me some time to support his request for holding elections on a Sunday.  I assure the Minister and the House that the fact that three Cork Deputies speak on the same issue is no indication of a Cork conspiracy but an indication that all public representatives, all people interested in politics, recognise that our normal election day, Wednesday or Thursday, causes difficulty for too many people and should be changed.</P>
      <P>People have a democratic right to vote and we should facilitate that right as much as we can, thereby ensuring that people avail of their entitlement.  While the low poll in the recent European elections may not have arisen because of people being required to vote on a certain day but because many people who wanted to vote were unable to do so because of work commitments or being far from home.  Sunday voting would certainly help in that respect.  For that reason and many others we do not have time to go into, I strongly support Deputy Crowley's request that the Minister prepare a review or study on changing polling day, thereby stepping into line with most of our EU counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the two previous speakers on this matter.  The Minister should concede that it is necessary to introduce Sunday voting here. Fishermen, who may leave home on a Sunday evening to travel to fishing grounds and may not return until the following Saturday morning, are debarred from voting, as they are 250 to 400 miles off the coastline on voting day.  The same applies to the long-distance lorry driver and students who may leave home early on a Monday morning, perhaps not returning until Friday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister to immediately introduce Sunday voting since it is also polling day in most other European countries.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1147" /> to accede to Deputy Crowley's request ensuring that all future elections are held on Sunday.  In addition, it should be remembered that there will be a polling booth adjacent to churches nationwide so that, when people attend services, they can vote afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure my colleagues from Cork that I would never dream of viewing in conspiratorial terms any contribution they might make.</P>
      <P>There is no longer any statutory barrier to taking the poll at elections and referenda on Sunday.  The appointment of a polling day is a matter for the Minister for the Environment subject to the constraints laid down in the individual electoral codes.  It is, therefore, a matter for decision on each occasion which day should be chosen.</P>
      <P>While it is interesting to note that the majority of the countries of the European Union hold their elections on Sunday, in itself this is not persuasive.  We must look at our individual situation and do what is most appropriate in our circumstances. It is worth noting that weekday voting is the rule in the three EU countries with whom we probably have most in common, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The arguments in favour of Sunday voting have been well expressed.  Probably the most cogent practical argument in favour of weekend voting &mdash; referred to this evening &mdash; is that it would eliminate the necessity for any closure of schools or for any interruption of school work in connection with elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there would also be a downside to Sunday voting.  Far from increasing voter turn-out, there would be a distinct possibility that it could have an adverse effect on the size of the poll.  It is true that many people would be free from the normal duties at the weekend and, therefore, have a better opportunity of turning out to vote, but this would not be true of everybody.  For many people, particularly workers in the transport and tourism industry, the weekend is probably their busiest time and they might very <Col N="1148" /> well have particular difficulty in getting to their polling stations.</P>
    <P>Sunday is the occasion for many of our major sporting events.  When it comes to a choice between the civic duty of voting and devotion to the favourite sport or pastime, voting may lose out.  If, for example, polling day were to clash with the Munster finals, I have a feeling that polling staff in parts of the Deputy's constituency as well as my own &mdash; although this year is an exception, particularly in hurling &mdash; might well have an easy day, that is, if it were possible to find polling staff.</P>
    <P>Similarly, many families wish to spend summer Sundays at the seaside or countryside with their families and it might not always be practical to fit in a visit to the polling station.  Thus what we might gain on the swings could well be lost on the roundabout.</P>
    <P>By far the most serious consideration to be faced in relation to Sunday voting is the question of objection on religious grounds.  One of my predecessors sought the views of the different religions on the matter.  In general, the minority Christian religions indicated that they would have serious difficulty with the proposal.  Being based principally on grounds of conscience, it is unlikely that their reservations would change over the years.</P>
    <P>Obviously these reservations would have to be taken into account.  If we were to decide to go for Sunday voting in the knowledge that a substantial number of electors would have real difficulty, on conscience grounds, in voting on that day, then serious consideration would have to be given to providing alternative voting arrangements for the electors in question.  It might be necessary, for example, to consider having polling stations open on Saturday or Monday, as well as Sunday, to give everybody a reasonable opportunity of voting.</P>
    <P>While there are, quite clearly, many advantages in Sunday voting, there are also disadvantages of which the most serious is the question of objection on religious grounds.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Minister of the day to appoint Sunday as the polling day but full consideration must be given to the likely <Col N="1149" /> implications.  It is not a matter to be decided lightly but it does remain an option.</P>
    <P>In relation to more people on the live register being given an opportunity to act as presiding officers and polling clerks in the European elections, I availed of the opportunity to write to all returning officers to make the best effort possible to ensure that that happens.  I realise it has not happened in all cases and will continue that endeavour.</P>
    <P>I shall also introduce an amendment in the next electoral Bill to provide facilities for voting for the people mentioned by Deputy Sheehan.  The categories are well known.  I want to facilitate categories of workers who have a real difficulty.  That aspect will be covered in the new electoral Bill.  There is no legal prohibition on Sunday voting; it is a matter to be decided in the light of prevailing circumstances and of getting overall agreement.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that the Adjournment Debate would be at 8.30 p.m. and not at 12 o'clock.  I am sorry for bringing in the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, at this late hour.  Nevertheless this is a very important matter which I am sure she will realise I had to raise on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I appeal tonight on behalf of the teachers, parents and pupils of the Nano Nagle school for the handicapped, Listowel. It is a special school for moderately mentally handicapped people, catering for 61 children within a 30 miles radius of Listowel.  It services parishes such as Glin, Tarbert, Abbeyfeale, Ballybunion, Brosna, Castleisland, Tralee, Ballylongford and Listowel.  The pupils range in age from four to 18 years.  Some have physical, auditory, visual and emotional problems as well as being mentally handicapped.  Recently it began to cater for severely handicapped children who, ideally, need individual attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child care assistant has worked in the school for the past 13 years and has been granted a career break next year from September 1994 to 1995.  She is the <Col N="1150" /> only child care assistant paid by the Department of Education and will not be replaced while on career break, which affects both staff and pupils.</P>
    <P>Her daily routine includes taking children to and from school buses, accompanying them to classrooms and toileting them which is vital because seven of these children are in nappies. She plays an essential role in day to day classroom activities, thus facilitating teachers to do group work.  She is involved in social training, teaching, washing, dressing, toileting and eating skills.  She helps the teachers in carrying out programmes with the weaker children. In addition, she assists two children confined to wheelchairs and transports children to shops, church and on school outings.  In general, she is indispensable to this very successful school.  She has assisted teachers in all areas of work during the past 13 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister may or may not be aware that the school is one of the most successful for the moderately handicapped in the country.  It is doing a very good job and is embarking on a successful programme of integration with the primary school adjoining it.  This began as a pilot scheme a few years ago when the convent primary school, Listowel, and the Nano Nagle school were put on the same site.  This encouraged and facilitated the type of integration now taking place in both schools and they could be a model for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>This child care assistant was granted permission to take a career break.  I understand that unless an exception is made she will not be replaced.  If so, this will have major consequences for the work programme and the school curriculum. I would be grateful if the Minister could ensure that the Nano Nagle school has a child care assistant next September.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being present. I am sure she could have passed on the responsibility to one of her colleagues.</P>

      <P>Under a special scheme introduced in 1979, my Department funds the allocation of child care assistants to selected special schools.  A range of schools, <Col N="1151" /> including those catering for pupils with physical, sensory and intellecutal disabilities, were allocated posts.  A total of 86 posts were provided on a permanent and full time basis.  These assistants are employed by the boards of management of the schools and grants are paid by my Department to the boards to cover salaries and employer's PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The principal duties attached to the posts are: to give general assistance to the class teacher, under the direction of the principal; preparation and tidying of the classroom; assisting children to board and alight from the school bus, and where necessary travel as an escort on school buses; to give special assistance to children with particular difficulties and to help with children on school outings. Child care assistants may not act either as substitute teachers or temporary teachers.  In no circumstances are they left in sole charge of a class.</P>
      <P>At present there are 79 child care assistant posts serving 73 schools.  Nano Nagle special school, Listowel, County Kerry has the services of a child care assistant since the inception of the scheme.  The assistant has applied to the board of management of the school for a career break and it is a matter for the management authorities of the school to decide if they will grant the request.  My Department has informed the school authorities that it has no objection to the board granting the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the embargo on public sector recruitment in place since 1987 <Col N="1152" /> has meant that no further appointments could be made, vacancies filled or replacements provided for assistants going on career break.  The school authorities have been advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Education Budget announcement for 1994, I intend to allocate an additional 50 child care assistants to the special education area in the current year.  These new appointments, which will be in place from September next, form part of an initial response to the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee and will be of significant benefit in assisting teachers in dealing with special needs children.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently assessing levels of need for child-care support in the special education area in order to ensure that the additional posts now available are used to best effect.  The needs of Nano Nagle special school will be considered as part of that assessment.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for bringing this matter to my attention.  We both realise its importance and that is why we are all here at this hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the legislative regime currently in place plus the enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1994 will constitute sufficient deterrent to the unlawful removal of such items from the State.</P>
      <P>Under the National Monuments Acts the sale of archaeological objects in private ownership within the State is permitted but the provisions now being enacted will require such transactions to be notified to the Director of the National Museum.  The provisions in the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which was passed by the Dáil on 22 June 1994 will establish comprehensive controls relating to the possession and disposal of archaeological objects.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, the State will be expressly established as the owner of all objects found after the Bill's enactment and there are heavy penalties prescribed for failure to report properly such finds to the Director of the Museum.  As an encouragement to people to report such finds, the Director is empowered to give rewards, on a discretionary basis, where, in his/her opinion, the finder has acted in a responsible fashion.  I am satisfied that these provisions strike the correct balance between deterrence and encouragement in the protection of our heritage as manifested in archaeological objects.</P>
      <P>Last week I signed the European Communities (Return of Cultural Objects) Regulations, 1994 in implementation of Council Directive (93/7/EC) of 15 March 1993 establishing procedures to facilitate the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this directive permit this State to call on the active assistance of authorities in other member states in the recovery of cultural objects removed from this State in contravention of national law.  This is an important additional legal protection providing, for <Col N="880" /> the first time, a trans-national legal structure allowing effective enforcement action for the purposes of protecting the moveable heritage of all the member states.</P>
    <P>As regards documents and pictures, the Documents and Pictures (Regulations of Export) Act, 1945 makes it unlawful for any person to export any article to which the Act applies unless that person is the holder of a licence authorising the export of the article.  The Act is concerned not with maintaining in Ireland objects of national historical or literary interest, but rather with preserving copies of those objects here and was designed to regulate rather than prevent the export of documents and pictures.  However, I am on record as stating that I am in favour of the introduction of a scheme to encourage people to donate such objects to the State and which would facilitate the State in acquiring such items but it will be some time before I am in a position to report further on these issues.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the necessity for voluntary heritage groups to obtain appropriate professional advice and supervision when undertaking projects at sites of historical importance.  I am not aware that there is a dearth of such advice available although I do accept that the cost involved may add appreciably to the cost of the projects. However, the Deputy will appreciate that <Col N="881" /> due to the competing demands on its scarce resources the role of the State in this regard must be limited.</P>

      <P>The murder of six persons by the UVF at Loughinisland, County Down, on 18 June was a shocking deed.  I take this opportunity to reiterate my deepest sympathy to the families of those who died and my hope that those who were injured will make a full and speedy recovery.  I pay tribute to the people of Loughinisland, whose dignity and restraint in the face of this appalling attack is an example to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed all aspects of the security <Col N="882" /> situation with the Secretary of State at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 17 June. We were joined in these discussions by the Minister for Justice, the Minister of State with responsibility for security at the Northern Ireland Office, and by senior representatives of the two police forces.  While it would not be appropriate to go into the substance of our discussions, the meeting provided an opportunity to review in detail the continuing threat posed by paramilitaries from both sides.  The Conference focused in particular on the importance of preventing paramilitary attacks and of bringing those responsible to justice.  The House can be assured that through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement we will continue to co-operate closely in countering the violent activities of the paramilitaries and in ensuring that our co-operation on security remains as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>I have said before in this House, and I repeat now, that everyone in Northern Ireland is entitled to lead his or her life in peace, free from the threat of murder or maiming by paramilitaries.  I condemn totally the activities of groups which seek to achieve their ends by violence, from whatever side they come.  Just as I have condemned Republican paramilitaries, whose campaign of violence has made a mockery of their declared objectives, so I condemn the murderous activities of the Loyalist paramilitaries, who have been responsible for more deaths than any other group over the last three years. There can be no justification, no excuse, no special pleading for these acts of violence. I can assure the House that the Government will continue to do all in its power to see violence brought to an end and to expedite a political way forward in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there is an anomaly regarding the concession for disabled car drivers and disabled car passengers who are physically disabled whereby a passenger has to spend 20 per cent of the base price on alterations to a vehicle to qualify for rebate of tax, in view of the fact that alteration may sometimes not be necessary and that this is not a requirement for a physically disabled driver; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current disabled drivers scheme, established under and governed by the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, provides significant tax concessions to qualifying disabled drivers and passengers with severe mobility problems.  The reliefs available under the scheme include repayment of VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax on the acquisition of a new vehicle, excise duty refunds on up to 600 gallons of petrol or diesel annually and exemption from road tax.</P>
      <P>While all vehicles must be specially constructed or adapted under the scheme, in the case of qualifying disabled passengers, the regulations require that the VAT-free cost of the vehicle adaptations must amount to at least 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of the vehicle. This requirement stems from the fact that, generally speaking, where qualifying passengers are concerned, the nature of any adaptation which would be required to the vehicle would be quite different from those required by qualifying drivers.  It must also be borne in mind that the vehicles involved are not likely to be used exclusively, or at all times, for the transport of the disabled passenger but will also be used by others e.g. family members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background, the adaptation requirement is a fundamental control mechanism of the scheme which is designed to ensure that, within scarce budgetary resources, those most in need of help benefit.  The matter of, <i>inter alia,</i> the adaptation requirement was considered in the course of the recent review of the disabled drivers scheme; the <Col N="886" /> review recommendation is that no change should be made in this regard.  In order to protect the wider interest, I must reiterate that complete abolition of a minimum adaption requirement, however desirable it may seem and even in limited circumstances, could open the scheme to abuse.  Further more, it could, in the long term, be excessively costly to the Exchequer.  I have no plans, therefore, at this time to change the law in this regard.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to derive reliably comparable <Col N="887" /> figures in respect of numbers of staff or average remuneration and the administrative costs of national debt management operations during the five years prior to the establishment of the agency for three reasons.

    <P>The budget estimate in each year included a target for debt service savings to be achieved by the National Treasury Management Agency.  These targets were: 1991, £40 million; 1992, £50 million; 1993, £100.  The debt service estimate for 1994 is £2,229 million and includes a savings target of £100 million.</P>
    <P>The performance of the agency is measured by JP Morgan, the US Investment Bank, against an independent benchmark portfolio.  This performance measurement is based on the &ldquo;Net Present Value&rdquo;, NPV, of all future liabilities undertaken by the agency and in effect measures the impact of the agency's actions not only in the year under review but also their projected impact over the life of the debt.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it appropriate to publish details of the benchmark portfolio as this is market sensitive information.  The NPV savings achieved by the National Treasury Management Agency against the benchmark have been as follows: 1991, £69 million; 1992, £78 million.  The 1993 figure will be published in the agency's 1993 annual report which will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 12 (2) of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>Our VAT rate on newspapers is 12.5 per cent.  This is higher than the corresponding rate in the other European Union countries.  I should explain that the 12.5 per cent rate is the reduced rate of VAT in this country.  Under the EU VAT rates directive, member states have the option of applying a reduced rate of VAT, of at least 5 per cent, to newspapers and those member states which applied the zero rate to newspapers on 1 January 1991 can continue to do so on a transitional basis, but it is not open to member states to introduce new zero rates.</P>
      <P>Any change in the VAT treatment of newspapers could not take place in isolation; inevitably other goods and services which are currently at the 12.5 per cent rate would seek a similar reduction. Accordingly, in view of the considerable Exchequer cost of such a move, I have no plans at the moment to reduce the rate of VAT on newspapers.  I should add that, in the normal course of events, the scope and level of the reduced rate would fall for review in the context of the annual budgetary process.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the report of an interdepartmental working group on employer's PRSI contributions which reported to me before this year's budget. The group was made up of civil servants from the Departments of Social Welfare, <Col N="890" /> Finance, Enterprise and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The original impetus behind the establishment of the interdepartmental working group arose out of a general concern that the employer's PRSI contribution system should facilitate job creation and maintenance in the labour intensive sectors of manufacturing industry.  The group also considered low-paid employment generally and included the services sector.</P>
      <P>The group was established so as to provide the Government with a consistent and well-balanced consideration of the issues involved.  In line with normal practice for such groups, the report was not published at the time.</P>
      <P>I announced a number of measures in the 1994 budget designed to improve the employment-support aspects of the PRSI system in respect of all lower-paid employment.  Those measures include the introduction of a new lower rate of employer's PRSI contribution for lower-paid employees, continuation of the PRSI exemption scheme and an ending of the employer's liability to pay levies on behalf of employees who are medical card holders.  The combined impact of the new lower rate employers PRSI and levies exemptions amounts to a major cash boost &mdash; to the tune of about £89 million in a full year in support of jobs in labour intensive sectors of the economy. These initiatives have targeted significant relief at those sectors which contain large numbers of lower-paid workers, whether they are employed in industry or services.</P>
      <P>In introducing these measures, I have undertaken to keep the possibility of further concessions on PRSI under review.  I would hope having regard to the primary objective of the Social Insurance Fund, which is to provide pensions and benefits for workers, to continue down the road of shaping the PRSI system so as to encourage employment.  In this context the needs of particular sectors such as the services sector will be kept under review.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons, who take early retirement will have all of their non-statutory lump sum assessed against them when they come to apply for unemployment assistance, and will lose their entitlement to treatment benefit before they reach retirement age and for the rest of their lives; his views on whether changes should be made in these provisions in order to make early retirement an acceptable option.</Quest>

      <P>Applicants for social assistance payments who have capital are assessed with a notional income from the capital. In the case of unemployment assistance, the first £400 of capital is assessed at 5 per cent and the remainder is assessed at 10 per cent.  The resulting figure is then divided by 52 to give the weekly means which is deducted from the appropriate maximum rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, a married couple may have in excess of £50,000 and still qualify for unemployment assistance at a reduced rate while a married couple with two children can have £64,000 capital and still qualify for a reduced payment.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contains a commitment to streamline and standardise application and assessment procedures, including provisions for the assessment of means, for social assistance payments.  The existing provisions for the assessment of capital are being reviewed in my Department in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards treatment, dental and optical, benefits, one of the statutory contribution conditions for receipt of those benefits requires an applicant aged between 21 and 66 years to have at least 39 reckonable PRSI contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year of which at least 13 must be paid contributions.  Alternatively, this condition can be satisfied if the applicant has at least 13 contributions paid in either of the two contribution years preceding the governing contribution year, or a subsequent <Col N="892" /> contribution year, including the year in which employment ceases due, for example, to early retirement.  People in receipt of long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, disability benefit for more than 12 months, invalidity pension, or retirement pension are exempt from the condition requiring at least 13 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>In practice, therefore, a person who leaves the workforce can retain entitlement to treatment benefit for up to five years after employment ceases.  Where entitlement runs out after that period, it can be restored on receipt of retirement pension at age 65 years.  Furthermore, once qualified at 66 years of age, a person remains qualified for treatment benefit for the rest of his or her life.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing entitlement to invalidity pension from my Department provide that a recipient shall not engage in work whether on his or her own account or on behalf of another person.  However, an exemption from that provision may be granted for any period during which the recipient is engaged in light work for which no remuneration is or would ordinarily be payable; is engaged in work in the nature of rehabilitation or occupational therapy; or, having become permanently incapable of following their usual occupation, is undergoing a course of training with a view to taking up some other occupation.</P>
      <P>The remuneration limit of £24 a week referred to by the Deputy applies to certain work permitted in the case of recipients of disability benefit and injury benefit.  There is no similar earnings limit applying in the case of invalidity pensioners.</P>
      <P>As regards disabled person's maintenance allowance, the Government decided in June 1990, arising from representations from the National Rehabilitation Board, to allow people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards earn up to £30 per week without affecting the rate of allowance.  This initiative was designed to encourage people with disabilities to return to the workforce.  The limit of £30 has been increased each year in line with social welfare rates and currently stands at £32.30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The disabled person's maintenance allowance is a means-tested payment administered by the health boards.  It is not strictly comparable with invalidity pension which is an insurance based payment. The invalidity pension was introduced to provide better payment arrangements for those who are permanently incapable of work.  In line with my pro-active approach to enable unemployed people and those suffering from disability to gain a foothold in the work-place I am having the &ldquo;rules of behaviour&rdquo; reviewed to ensure that they reflect developments in rehabilitative and therapeutic practice.</P>

      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme, which I introduced for the first time last year proved to be a major success. The scheme was a very positive development, of benefit to both students and to the local communities.</P>
      <P>The 1994 scheme is proving to be even more successful.  At the week ending 24 June 1994, over 10,000 jobs have been offered by about 1,900 sponsors who are directly involved in community and voluntary work and over 8,000 claims have already been received from third-level college students.  This represents a considerable increase on the number of student claims which had been received at the same point last year and I am confident that additional applications will continue to be submitted in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Third-level students are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during their summer holidays.  This scheme was introduced for students as an alternative to unemployment assistance and allows them to gain valuable work experience while at the same time making a worthwhile contribution to their local communities. Participation in the scheme is subject to the same means test as applies to those claiming unemployment assistance. The extension of the scheme to all third level students, irrespective of their financial circumstances is not envisaged since it would require significant additional exchequer resources.</P>
      <P>Of the first 5,200 students who have so far qualified to participate in the scheme 75 per cent are from families who are working and who are not getting a social welfare payment themselves.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of deserted wife's benefit at a rate of £79.10 per week for herself and one dependent child.  This is the maximum rate of payment under this scheme for a person with one dependent child.</P>
      <P>She was also awarded £15 per week maintenance under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 17 February 1992.  This payment is comprised of £10 for herself and £5 for her son.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions contained in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, specify the obligation on people to maintain their spouse and children. Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social welfare income maintenance, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to the Department towards the cost of the family's income support.  This liability may be offset by the transfer to the Department of any maintenance payments which they are making to their spouse in compliance with an order of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the person concerned was awarded deserted wife's benefit her husband became liable to contribute to the Department towards that benefit. Because he was paying maintenance on <Col N="897" /> foot of a court order the legislation required that the moneys payable to the court must be transferred to the Department to offset his liability.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was asked to consent in writing to this transfer arrangement on 23 August 1993.  Her consent to the transfer of the payments was signed on 25 August 1993.  However, no payments under this transferred maintenance order have been received to date by the Department.  It is understood that the person concerned has not received any payments under the maintenance order since September 1993.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not provide for the offsetting of mortgage repayments or any other repayments against the transferable maintenance order.  However, the Department has taken the view that in cases where it is stated in the court order that the amount which the maintenance debtor is to pay the maintenance creditor is in respect of a mortgage, or part of it is in respect of a mortgage, the amount in respect of the mortgage would not normally be transferable to the Department.  The maintenance order in this case did not specify that any portion of the payment was being made in respect of mortgage payments.</P>
    <P>There are very specific provisions in social welfare legislation relating to the transfer, to the Department, of payments made in compliance with an order of the courts.  Because these legal obligations are based on specific facts, there is no perceived requirements for an appeals procedure in these cases.  In general, social welfare appeals relate to circumstances where a degree of interpretation may be required.  The question of interpretation does not arise in cases of transferred maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions were first introduced in the 1989 Social Welfare Act and came into effect in November 1990.</P>
    <P>This scheme, like all schemes, is kept under review.  The issues raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of such a review of the scheme and the relevent legislation.</P>
    <P>A full review of the circumstances of <Col N="898" /> this particular case will now be undertaken in the light of the fact that payments under a court order are not being made to either the Department or, as it appears, to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>Where a redundancy, as defined in the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-1991 has taken place, an eligible employee must be given notice in writing of the proposed dismissal.  Form RP1 must be used for this purpose.  A duplicate copy of the notice, fully completed, must be sent to my Department at the same time as it is given to the employee.  These are legal requirements.</P>
      <P>My Department has no record of such notice having been received in respect of the person on whose behalf the Deputy inquires or indeed, in respect of any other persons employed by the company in question.  Furthermore, my Department does not have any record of an application by the person concerned for payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund on the basis that his employer refused to pay a statutory redundancy entitlement.</P>
      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Act, responsibility for the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement rests in the first instance with the employer.  Accordingly, if the person concerned considers that he is entitled to a statutory redundancy payment which he has not received, he should approach his former employer with a view to obtaining this entitlement.  If the former employer refuses or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, the employee can then apply to my Department for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  Such an application must be supported by evidence of entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a redundancy certificate &mdash; Form RP2 &mdash; issued by the former employer or, where entitlement is contested by the former employer, a decision from the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council's discretionary grants for the improvement and maintenance of regional and county roads in 1994 amount to £4.112 million, including the additional discretionary grant of £358,000 notified to the council on 12 May 1994.  The council has wide discretion in spending these grants, subject to general guidelines issued by my Department.  It is a matter for the council to select the individual roads on which maintenance and improvement works will be carried out and to determine the geographical distribution of road grants. My Department has, however, asked each county council to submit detailed returns indicating how the discretionary grants are spent in 1994 and I will be reviewing these before making road grant allocations for 1995.</P>

    <P>Under the new scheme of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement works on non-national roads, a grant of £1.610 million for selected projects was allocated to Galway County Council in 1994.  No application for a grant for the improvement of the road in question was submitted by Galway County Council under this scheme and no commitment has been made to make such a grant available.  It will, however, be open to the council to consider whether to apply <Col N="913" /> in 1995 for a grant for the improvement of this road, taking into account the conditions governing the specific improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <P>It was a condition of the 1993 scheme that only beef-type breeds could be applied on unless the producer was an applicant under the scheme in 1990 or 1991.  The person in question included three non-beef breeds on his 1993 application and as he has not made application for the scheme in 1990 or 1991, he is eligible for payment on only 25 cows.

      <P>In relation to whether the existing electricity prices will remain, as I have stated on a number of occasions, no decisions will be taken on a price adjustment to electricity costs until the cost and competitiveness review of the ESB is completed later this year.</P>
      <P>The following are average industrial and domestic electricity prices for EU member states based on a survey compiled by the Union of Producers and Distributors of Electrical Energy in January, 1994.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus' Strategy for the Future included a recommendation that the restriction on <Col N="937" /> direct flights from Dublin to the USA be lifted and the necessary bilateral changes put in place to facilitate this change.</P>
      <P>Following Government approval of the Strategy, bilateral talks were held in Washington in September and October, 1993 to bring about these changes and an amendment to the Ireland/US Air Transport Agreement was agreed on 27 October, 1993.  Under the revised agreement, Irish and US carries who operate direct services to Dublin must operate a corresponding number of services to Shannon, i.e. each US and Irish airline may operate one non-stop flight to/from Dublin for each non-stop flight that airline operates to/from Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> The amendment to the Ireland/US Air Transport Agreement and the Government approval of the new A330 fleet has enabled Aer Lingus to commence a daily, year round direct service from Shannon to New York from June, 1994.  Aer Lingus has informed me that the numbers of crews based in Shannon since 15 June, 1944 are 15 pilots (including the Fleet Captain) and 62 cabin crew.  Due to the heavy training programme of B747/A330 crew conversion and the significant amount of extra flying associated with the World Cup airlift, it will be some time before the full complement of the Shannon crew base is in place.</P>

      <P>The funding of primary schools is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> There is no provision under current legislation for exemption from the requirement to hold a television licence. The Deputy will understand that primary schools are just one of the many institutions and categories of persons that would consider themselves worthy of exemption.  The exemption of primary schools from the requirement to hold a licence would have to be compensated for by an increase in the general licence fee or from another source, for example the Vote for First-Level Education.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy would agree that, as one colour licence at a cost of £62 covers all television sets at a particular premises, the amount involved should be able to be met from primary schools' budgets.  I do not understand the Deputy's reasoning that there is discrimination caused by schools who provided television sets through fund-raising at the local level.  All schools are obliged to have the correct television licence if they are in possession of a television set.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Education operates a scheme whereby the cost of television licences is reimbursed to primary schools which are designated as being disadvantaged by that Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I decided to appoint an officer of my Department as an observer to An Chomhairle Ealaíon with effect from 1 January last for an experimental period of 12 months.  I saw the appointment of an observer as facilitating communications between my Department and An Chomhairle.  The fact that I have an observer at the meetings of An Chomhairle does not of course substitute for the normal relationship between An Chomhairle and myself.  Moreover, when I made the appointment I was pleased to learn from An Chomhairle that, on balance, they believed that the attendance of an observer would be to our mutual advantage.</P>
      <P>My observer to An Chomhairle, who has no voting powers, has participated fully in the deliberations of its monthly meeting since his appointment and I am satisfied that he has facilitated clarification of my policy for An Chomhairle on any issue addressed to him at their meetings.  I propose to review the role of the observer fully with the Chairperson of An Chomhairle when the one year experimental period has expired.</P>

      <Quest>if he will respond to allegations that children in respect of whom Health Board social workers have obtained a fit person order under section 58 of the Childrens Act, 1908, on the grounds of ill-treatment or neglect are, instead of being taken into care, being returned to the family home because of the lack of residential places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A fit person order is sought by a health board following a detailed risk assessment process which considers whether the child's safety can be protected while remaining at home, or whether removal of the child from home is necessary in the particular circumstances of the case.  The great majority of children who are the subjects of fit person orders are placed with foster parents rather than in residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, even where it is considered necessary to remove a child from his/her home, that is not the end of the matter. It is an important objective to try to minimise the disruption to the child's life and where possible to reunite the child with <Col N="950" /> the family if this is consistent with his/her best interests.  Health boards devote considerable efforts to trying to re-unite the child with his/her family when this can be safely achieved. Examples would be where the abuser leaves the family home, either voluntarily or as a result of a barring order or prison sentence.  Even where it is not possible for a child to be returned home on a full time basis, efforts are made to maintain contact with the family and this can involve short periods of stay in the family home.  If the Deputy is aware of any case in which a child has been returned home to a situation in which he or she is in danger, I would be most anxious to have the details so that the matter can be investigated.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a phased programme of financial assistance by way of a supplementary capitation grant for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in schools was introduced from 1 September 1992.  In the case of a school like the one referred to by the Deputy, the current terms of the scheme provide for assistance at a rate of £15 per pupil to a maximum of 500 pupils &mdash; i.e. £7,500. The programme is under review at present and I expect that any refinements to the scheme will take effect from September 1994.  My Department will notify the schools concerned of any changes in the amount of grant assistance arising from this review.</P>

      <P>Grant assistance for sports facilities is provided by my Department under the major facilities scheme and under the recreational facilities scheme.  The major facilities scheme, which was introduced by Government in 1988, funds the provision of major sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide an integrated network of modern sports and leisure facilities throughout the country. The total grant aid provided under this scheme since its introduction amounts to £25 million of which £7 million approximately has been provided to projects in Dublin.  The 1994 allocation for this scheme amounts to £5 million and future funding will be decided in the context of the annual Estimates for Public Services.</P>
      <P>A large number of applications seeking assistance for funding under this programme are under consideration by my Department and I can assure the Deputy that all applications for funding regardless of their location will be given every consideration.

      <P>The Charter of the National University of Ireland as amended by a Statute <Col N="955" /> of January 1951 provides that the Government may appoint a board of visitors to the college from time to time as it sees fit.  The appointment of a board of visitors is only obligatory where the removal from office of a president, a professor or a lecturer is involved.</P>
      <P>In 1969 a petition to appoint a board of visitors to University College Dublin was received regarding the termination of employment of two members of the staff of the college.  The petition was refused on the basis that it did not involve removal from office.  A further petition regarding University College Galway was received in May 1993 and is currently under consideration.  No requests, therefore, have been granted since 1968.</P>

      <P>Fax and modem facilities have been installed for testing in one school.  It is planned to complete the programme of installation in all the schools concerned during September and October next.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced the establishment of pilot pre-school projects in eight designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions on the selection of locations for inclusion in these projects were taken <Col N="960" /> after detailed consideration of needs across disadvantaged areas.  As part of this process, it was decided that the pilot phase would concentrate on large urban areas of greatest disadvantage.  In the case of each area selected, the intention is that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment area of the school to which the project is being attached.  Thus, in the case of the pre-school project being located in Padre Pio national school, Churchfield, Cork, the intention would be that the pre-school service would focus primarily on meeting the needs of pre-school children from the catchment area of that school.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the operation of the initial pilot projects will be monitored very closely over the coming year to ensure that this valuable new initiative delivers maximum benefit to the children concerned.  Based on experience gained under the pilot project, I will be considering the question of further expansion of the scheme and I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the areas he mentions will be considered in the context of any such development.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Killian's senior national school there were 463 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus 14 assistants for the 1994-95 school year.  The school will also have the services of a fulltime remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.</P>
    <P>The maximum class size guidelines which will apply in September, 1994, are: 37 (in the case of a single-grade class-group); 36 (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades); 33 (in the case of a multi-grade class-group).</P>
    <P>The school authorities are projecting an enrolment of 489 for September 1994. However it would appear that the school will not be in breach of the guidelines referred to previously.  If the school authorities feel that the school may qualify on the basis of maximum class sizes in September 1994, my Department will be happy to examine the position on receipt of enrolment details at that time.</P>
