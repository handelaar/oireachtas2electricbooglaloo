      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business proper, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I now call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give you notice of my request to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate a matter of urgent public importance, namely, a motion to seek an explanation from the Minister for Justice as to why she told the Dáil yesterday that the request for the extradition of a wanted paedophile offender to Northern Ireland was not examined or seen by the Attorney General, despite being with his office for seven months, if, as she stated, the case was vital to the operation of the extradition code following the amendment of the 1987 extradition legislation and why she considers it was vital since the amending legislation dealt with political not sexual offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the <Col N="834" /> Standing Order and, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 9, 10, 2, 1 and 3.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 shall be decided without debate. 2. Private Members' Business shall be No. 16 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 be decided without debate satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal that Private Members' Business shall terminate at 8.30 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions regarding the business that may be taken today.  Does he expect that the Minister for Transport. Energy and Communications will be in a position to make a statement in regard to the EIS for the Galmoy Mines today, or will we have to wait for some time for a statement on the issue?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Minister for Justice will make a statement about the apparent holding within this jurisdiction of a young man who was abducted from his home by men wearing masks in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Those matters are not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter matter surely is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Minister for Justice would want to make a statement on that matter because it could have serious implications for business we hope to transact later this week in regard to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I would like the Minister to make a statement clarifying what <Col N="835" /> the Garda know about the holding within this jurisdiction of a man who was apparently taken from his home by people wearing masks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy, this matter is clearly not one for the Order of Business and I am sure you will pursue it in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be awkward but the timing is very important and we should know what we are dealing with as quickly as possible. I hope the Government will make a statement because it is alleged that the young man is being held in this State, an area for which the Minister for Justice is responsible.  We would like to be informed of what the Garda know about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Garda Síochána and we are not going to enter the area of security operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another jurisdiction's problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's other question, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is willing at any time to give the information and show how hypocritical the approach of Fine Gael has been in this matter.  There is not a scintilla of truth in what the Deputy sought to allege in the House yesterday.  That approach is bringing politics to the lowest level we have seen here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about the report from the Attorney General.  I thank him for informing my office that it is under preparation and will be published by the end of December.  I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss it here because it is not satisfactory that a dangerous person should be free for up to seven months before the Attorney General acts.  I compliment the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication for advocating a Progressive Democrats policy yesterday, one for which the Tánaiste derided me in the House last June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that you, Sir, will not allow us to raise on the Order of Business the matter of the abduction of a man from Northern Ireland who has been brought into this jurisdiction, is it possible that some way could be found to raise this matter today as it is important that we clarify if the people involved are related to those who want to sit down at the forum?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation to provide for the mandatory reporting of allegations of sexual abuse was promised in the House on foot of the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest report and a report of the Law Reform Commission. Does the Taoiseach not believe it is ironic that the office charged with drafting such legislation is the office of the Attorney General, which sat on valid warrants for the extradition of a paedophile to Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can assist Deputy Harte.  Since the people of Letterkenny are asking Deputy Harte who <Col N="841" /> is responsible for the IDA and what relationship exists between the IDA and the Minister.  I am sure, Deputy Harte, as one of the longest serving Deputies in the House, knows the answer.  I thought Deputy Harte rose to congratulate Deputy Michael Smith, Minister for the Environment, on the opening of the Kilcullen by-pass.  Great progress has been made on the roads of Ireland and in every other facet of economic life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last night I mentioned that a number of speakers had indicated a different policy was being followed in tackling the drugs problem in certain countries in Europe where radical <Col N="843" /> measures have been taken.  In Switzerland, for example, the Government is trying to purchase heroin for resale on the market to bring the price down and to undermine those selling it.  That is an extremely radical measure and I am not sure I agree with it but many people will watch with interest to see if it is effective. As we are all aware, in Holland a different attitude is adopted towards cannabis and other soft drugs which are made available in small quantities to drug addicts.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Justice replied to questions in the House about the drug problem throughout the country, including the south inner city of Dublin, which forms part of my constituency. A debate is taking place on how we should tackle this problem.  We should consider the question of whether the Garda Síochána should be told to give hard drugs a higher priority given that a larger quantity of soft drugs has been confiscated.  If the Garda were instructed to give priority to the confiscation of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine and other hard drugs we might be able to prevent drug related crime and avoid the human tragedy whereby some people become addicted to drugs.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that the European Union needs to consider this matter, not only to stem the flow of drugs, which is important, but to determine how the problem should be tackled within the Union.  We may have to take radical measures.  The thinking appears to be that if the problem can be contained at the present level it will not get worse.  Within my own constituency and the constituencies of many other Deputies in the House the problem is serious.  This has a knock-on effect in terms of crime and human misery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the future of the European Union, Switzerland would have no problem in gaining entry but Turkey would, politically and economically. I am not belittling it but it also has a different political tradition.  In time it may become a member but in the short term many matters need to be resolved <Col N="844" /> before it can be considered for membership. I understand that Cyprus and Malta will be included in the next phase, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>Everybody has expressed concern about the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  The mind boggles when one considers their economic position and we will face a variety of challenges when they knock on the door and seek entry.  However, we will have to meet these challenges in a positive way as they have every right to become members of the European Union.  It will be extremely difficult to devise a framework for over 20 states and for these states to work effectively.  We must not, however, undermine the existing Union and throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria are considering their position within Europe at present and whether their sovereignty would be eroded.  We have to ensure that if the European Union is enlarged we will not feel isolated and that it will not be irrelevant to us.  This matter was raised by the electorate during the Maastricht Treaty referendum campaign.  We do not want the European Union to become so large that people will feel it is irrelevant.  It is important that they should feel they are European and the European Union works well.  I have no doubt that the problems can be resolved and during the years we will see the European Union increase in size.</P>
    <P>As the membership increases, there will be problems in terms of voting rights at the Council.  In many ways smaller states can be of help to Ireland in the sense that we should be able to use our voting strength to stop larger countries such as Germany and France from pushing things through with which we do not agree.  It may be an advantage, therefore, if smaller countries join and it should also lead to greater accountability.  In this regard I welcome the accession of the four new states and the enlargement of the European Union.  While this is inevitable we must ensure that it remains accountable and <Col N="845" /> becomes relevant to people in Ireland and throughout the European Union. Many of the countries which will apply for membership in future face political and economic problems.  As many Members said, this matter should be discussed more often as enlargement will present problems and have spin-off effects.  In those countries where referenda are due to take place we have been put forward as a good example to show that the European Community has been good for us and <i>vice versa.</i> Given our size we have a major influence in European affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on presenting the report.  I hope we will get the opportunity to discuss Europe's future as often as possible as it is very important for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for bringing this important issue before the House.  I have not had the opportunity to read in full the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We had a long struggle to establish this joint committee.  One of the benefits is that it allows for reasoned and rational debate by committed people on issues such as European enlargement.  In the past we had the opportunity during Question Time to raise issues but not to debate them. Members can now engage in a more wide-ranging debate and investigate the issues in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way since our accession to the European Communities in 1973.  At that stage the club was small but things have changed dramatically since then.  The aspirations and priorities of the European Union have changed.  The political structures in Europe have changed with the break up of the Soviet Union and the introduction of democracy throughout Eastern Europe.  Whilst those developments are welcome, they bring problems that need <Col N="846" /> to be addressed.  I welcome whole heartedly the enlargement of the European Union.  We are now debating the proposed accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden, countries that are economically strong.  While the economic strength of those countries offers us certain trading opportunities, it will also bring competition and other difficulties which will have to be addressed. The move towards a more cohesive and united Europe has to be good for everybody in the long term.  The obstacles must be confronted and surmounted, making Europe better for all.</P>
    <P>The cost of enlargement will be a major issue.  We have benefited enormously from the European Communities. I am sure that citizens in countries where they are voting on accession are asking their governments what financial benefits will accrue to them from entry to the European Union and unless they receive substantial commitments that it will be to their benefit financially they will not be interested in joining the Union.  People will join a group or an association if they feel there is something in it for them.  Transferring resources to countries joining the European Union will result in the loss of resources to other areas but that is the price one pays for enlargement and integration and a stronger and more united Europe.  We have to be willing to pay it.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the problems caused by our financial dependence on the European Union.  Because of our weak economic position when we joined the Community in 1973, all financial transfers have been to Ireland's benefit. That does not stem from the begging bowl mentality but the fact that huge transfers were necessary to allow us to catch up with other member states.  We had to fight significant battles for resources for agriculture, industry and trade but on the whole we won them and we were then able to raise our standard of living to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>New entrants to the European Union will be seeking similar support to that we received in the 1970s and 1980s and <Col N="847" /> we cannot try to block that.  This will obviously result in some reduction of funding to Government Departments but we have to accept it as part of the price of creating a more united Europe.</P>
    <P>We need to address unemployment from the European perspective.  If one compares economic barometers such as inflation rates or interest rates in member states, we are supposedly one of the ideal economies in the preparation for a single European currency but the vast majority of Irish people make their judgment on the level of unemployment. We have a huge unemployment problem and much more European assistance will have to be directed to it. Low interest rates and low inflation are no compensation for the fact that 300,000 people are unemployed, taking account of the number on the live register, those on early retirement and social employment schemes and so on.</P>
    <P>If in the morning we were to have another referendum on our membership of the European Union &mdash; which I am sure would be accepted by the vast majority &mdash; the question we would face on the doorsteps is: what is Europe doing about unemployment and job creation?</P>
    <P>In 1973 it was hoped that the development of our agricultural industry, with the assistance of European funding, would result in major growth in employment in that area.  Unfortunately, despite the assistance of European funding in developing agriculture, the nature of the development was such that while it resulted in bigger farms, fewer people worked on the land.  One of the great success stories of Europe as far as Ireland is concerned &mdash; the development of our agriculture industry &mdash; did not result in the retention or the expansion of the number of people working in agriculture but in a significant reduction in the numbers employed in agriculture.  That problem continues up to the present and all the figures suggest that in the next ten years fewer people will work in agriculture. This is a major social problem which <Col N="848" /> will lead to the decimation of rural areas and while we cannot realistically expect European policies or funding to be directed at encouraging people to return to the land, we must aim to ensure that our rural areas survive.</P>
    <P>This morning I read a report in one of the daily newspapers on the possibility of extending the services available through rural post offices in order to ensure their survival.  Perhaps this is not an issue of European significance but if we are to encourage people to remain in rural areas, thereby maintaining the rural economy we must ensure that the maximum number of services is available. I hope the Government will take note of the report to which I refer and will act on it.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of European enlargement, one of the issues that will have to be dealt with by 1996, is our defence policy.  I did not see the television programme last night on the future of the Defence Forces; I hope to have an opportunity to view it shortly but I am aware from media reports this morning that, according to a survey undertaken by the programme makers, a majority of people here support, to some degree, European defence co-operation and structures.  That is not really surprising because the days of the Soviet threat and the Cold War are long gone and people are now asking how European countries can co-operate with each other to ensure that peace prevails in Europe and any difficulties, particularly in Eastern Europe, can be resolved.  European defence and security co-operation will obviously play an important role in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like an early debate on this. We often shy away from debating defence policy as if it was some confidential issue about which nobody knows other than the Minister.  That is not helpful.  Debating defence policy should not be any different from debating finance, marine or social welfare policies. Inevitably, people will have different views, all valid, but it should be possible to debate them in public and make whatever decisions are necessary.  We <Col N="849" /> are much too secretive about how we will proceed in European defence and security co-operation.  That will be a major issue in the run up to 1996 and the earlier we have a public debate on it, the better.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will avail of the earliest opportunity to let us know his views on that.  During Question Time to the Minister for Defence we are generally told that the Department of Defence cannot make any real progress in this area until a Government decision is taken on European co-operation and security presumably on the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Another area of Government that would be affected by European enlargement is the Department of the Marine. When we joined the European Community in 1973 our fishing industry in general was sold down the river.  Agriculture was seen as the priority industry and seemed to benefit from all the advantages that Europe could offer. The fishing industry and the people whose livelihoods depended on it were left very much on the outside.  We have never recovered from that policy decision &mdash; it could certainly be called a policy disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not blaming me for that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to see how we can significantly recover from that decision because the resources which should have been allocated to Ireland in 1973 were allocated to other areas and, as a result, the number of people working in the fishing industry is at an all time low.  Notwithstanding our commitments in 1973 and that the Irish waters were more or less opened up to our European partners, I hope we can take action to protect and develop our fishing industry.  While there have been many problems between 1973 and 1993, this problem appears to be getting worse in that the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets will now have greater access to our waters resulting in further job losses and additional problems for <Col N="850" /> our fishermen.  Final decisions have not yet been taken by the Council of Fisheries Ministers, but even at the latest Council of Fisheries meeting no progress was made to protect the Irish industry.  I hope some steps will be taken to make progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be aware from his period as a member of a previous coalition Government that when our agriculture industry came under serious threat in 1983 and 1984 as a result of the proposal to introduce milk quotas, the Taoiseach, former Deputy Garret FitzGerald &mdash; ably assisted by the Tánaiste, Dick Spring &mdash; travelled to the European capitals and secured an excellent deal for farmers through direct negotiations with the European Heads of Government.  I hope the same can be done for the people who depend on our fishing industry and that the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Marine will be successful in putting the point that the industry did not get a fair crack of the whip in 1973 and has been struggling since.  It could be wiped out overnight unless it is given further assistance.  While welcoming the enlargement of the Community and the opportunities it presents we must also be mindful of the difficulties it will pose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering amending legislation to facilitate enlargement of the EU we must recognise and acknowledge what has been achieved by the EU since its foundation and since we joined it in 1972.  Its <i>raison d'etre</i> was to ensure harmony and co-operation among European states after two successive world wars.  By and large that sense of co-operation and ability to coexist has been effectively fostered by the Community. It is important that that be recognised externally and, indeed, it manifests itself in a desire by other countries to join the EU.  I welcome the decisions taken by Austria and Finland and the imminent decision by Norway and Sweden.  That is a recognition of the potential for harmonious co-operation and coexistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I have some reservations about the continued enlargement of the EU in an unplanned fashion.  The question of decision making must be considered. There are 12 Commissioners who form the cabinet, so to speak, of the EU and they make decisions but what will happen when there will be 14, 16 and, perhaps, 20 member states before the turn of the century?  The ability of the EU to make effective decisions in a competent and speedy manner will be undermined unless there is significant reform of the decision making process.  I would like to hear the Tánaiste's views on this matter. It is important that the rights of smaller nations be protected and I am worried by fliers regarding the possibility of countries like Ireland perhaps having no say at Commission level in an enlarged Europe.  The Tánaiste should outline his views on that matter also.</P>
    <P>On accountability, it is important that there be reform of this House to enable Irish MEPs to account to this House and to the public at large for their stewardship at European level.  That level of apathy and disinterest in politics and politicians generally is magnified when EU matters are debated.  That is unfortunate because many improvements over the past 20 years have been as a consequence of our membership of the EU.  At the time of elections to the European Parliament the level of disinterest, which is significant in terms of this institution and local government, is further multiplied.  The turnout at the last European elections was something over 50 per cent which is a worrying trend.  Reform of this House would facilitate a two way exchange of information and ideas and enable Irish MEPs give an account of their membership of the European Parliament.  That reform is long overdue and should be undertaken by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is likely that enlargement of the Community will accelerate significantly between now and the end of the century. The four countries most frequently talked about will be well established in the Union by the turn of the century <Col N="852" /> and will be joined possibly by a plethora of other nations in eastern Europe such as Poland, Turkey, perhaps Cyprus and Hungary.  We must have a rational debate about this development.  Given the geographical position of these nations and the yoke of tyranny under which they laboured for the past 50 years, it is easy to see why the EU is so attractive.  How far further will the EU continue to gallop eastwards without having any logical or reasonable debate about its future and whether some other independent economic and political union should be facilitated to emerge in central Europe and further east?</P>
    <P>Obviously the EU has a responsibility to ensure political stability on its eastern flank and that is why much of the momentum to facilitate an enlarged Europe is coming from Germany.  That is understandable given the history of the former West Germany and East Germany.  The requirement for political stability is enormous in that region.  We can facilitate political stability and the emergence of stable democracies by making funds available to enable these countries consider in a rational forum and atmosphere whether it is in their long term best interests to join the EU.</P>
    <P>We are on the last gravy train from Europe if enlargement continues eastwards at the pace which we are led to believe it will and that will have enormous consequences for this economy. That worries me because there is no evidence that this economy has used the funds given to it in a satisfactory way which would enable it to compete on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>In a new Europe it will be necessary to ensure that our unique cultural heritage is protected and fostered.  There is a tendency to have blanket political uniformity in EU countries but it is important to preserve those features that make us different.  In an Irish context I am talking about preserving and promoting the Irish language.  It would be laudable if, in the context of the treaties to facilitate enlargement, the Government sought to ensure that the Irish language was given the status of <Col N="853" /> a working language in the Community. This would be of enormous significance to those who have worked tirelessly over the years to foster, preserve and promote the Irish language.  There is enormous goodwill towards the language and recognition of it as a working language within the EU would be very significant.  Following accession by Finland and Austria it is possible that there will be a requirement to recognise minority languages as working languages of the EU.  This presents an opportunity for us to redress this glaring omission in our treaty of accession.  I welcome the proposed enlargement of the EU through the accession of Austria and Finland and, hopefully, Norway and Sweden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to dwell on one of the points raised by Deputy Creed and the concerns which should be voiced during such a debate.  All of us will welcome the accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to the EU and the benefits this will bring.  It would be impossible to imagine a European Union without these states, and I am disappointed that Switzerland did not seek membership.  Fears have been expressed about the further enlargement of the EU to the east, but we cannot oppose accession to the EU by countries which are seeking to establish democratic structures.  Membership of the Union will be a natural progression as democratic structures are established and put on a firm footing in these countries. We should encourage them in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue which will have to be considered is representation in the democratic structures of the European Union.  This was also a problem when the Union was much smaller.  As more countries join the Union membership of the European Parliament will increase from 567 to approximately 800.  This poses many practical problems.  It is often said that we do not need 166 TDs to run a democratic structure, and one can only imagine the huge problems <Col N="854" /> which will arise in a European Parliament with 800 members speaking in diverse tongues.  This problem has to be tackled by the EU.</P>
    <P>When I first became a member of the Parliament there were ten Irish representatives and the membership was approximately 180.  We now have 16 representatives and the membership of the Parliament is 567.  Our representation has been reduced from 5 per cent to less than 2.5 per cent.  Further enlargement of the Union will mean that we will have less opportunity to make our voice heard in the Parliament. As democratic politicians we should ensure that there are more Irish representatives in the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Given that the Parliament sits in plenary session for one week only, if every Member spoke each would have less than one minute to put forward their views, or even less when Commissioners and members of the Council attend.  Members who have been nominated by their groups to speak will have considerably less chance of doing so as the Union becomes larger.  This is an important point which should be addressed.  I am not suggesting that membership of the Parliament should be limited to 300, 400 or 500 but as a smaller state we are entitled to have a voice.  I recently visited Washington where states are represented in Congress on the basis of population and represented in the Senate on the basis of the size of the state &mdash; larger states have two senators while very small states such as Maine and Rhode Island have one senator.  Some of the smaller states have produced Presidents of the United States.  The EU will have to consider the introduction of a bicameral system so that countries will have representation on the basis of their size.  The American system reflects the number of states and the Government should be pressing for the introduction of a similar system in the EU.</P>
    <P>As the Parliament becomes larger there will be demands for a transfer of decision-making powers from the Commission and Council to its members.  As <Col N="855" /> democrats we should support such a move.  However, it will mean that the reflection of the national position will be diminished not only within the Parliament but also within the groupings. The socialist group is the largest in the Parliament, yet it has only one Irish representative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not reflect the level of support for the Labour Party or the result obtained by it at the last general election.  In the European elections the Labour Party retained one seat only while the Green Party secured two seats.  Judging from the position they have taken on certain matters, they do not reflect to any great extent the views of the Irish public.  This was evident in the recent debate on the fishing crisis in the Bay of Biscay where Irish and British boats fishing for tuna were attacked by Spanish vessels and given a hostile reception.  Those members of the Parliament did not support our right to fish in those waters.  They considered our fishing industry to be less important than prevention of the by-catch of dolphins. They were elected for their Green policies but they do not reflect the views of the vast majority of people. The setting up of a second chamber would ensure a greater voice for Ireland in Europe.  I hope that problem will be addressed in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems also arise in regard to the centres where meetings are held and the need for a central location for the Parliament. Because of the French influence through the years, Strasbourg has been selected for the plenary sessions of the European Parliament.  Brussels is the administrative centre and Luxembourg is the venue for a meeting once or twice a year &mdash; to pander to that small state and its needs.  The practical problems of holding any kind of meeting in Strasbourg or Luxembourg &mdash; provincial towns in their own right &mdash; mean an enormous transfer of material, papers, civil servants and members of <Col N="856" /> these areas.  Surely that will have to stop.  Brussels will have to be established as the centre for the European Parliament for all its sessions.  A gesture might be made, once every three years, to have a meeting in Strasbourg or Luxembourg.  The huge transfer every month, with the exception of one month for holidays, to Strasbourg which has a small airport, but reasonable train connections, is not practical.  An enormous amount of time is spent by people travelling from Donegal, Galway or even Dublin to such destinations to make their one minute contribution in the plenary session.  The Government &mdash; like those of other states &mdash; should demand a permanent centre for the European Parliament.  Everyone agrees that Brussels should be the centre since it has the Commission and the Council offices.  It would mean a much more efficient approach to meetings.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of representing Ireland in the European Parliament for eight years and in the Council of Ministers for five years.  Members with that experience will ralise that Strasbourg and Luxembourg are uncontrolled centres for the purpose of meetings. If we are to have an efficient operation on behalf of Europe, as far as possible Parliament and the institutions will have to be in one centre.  Every country demands part of the institutions of Europe.  The Minister will be aware that the only European institution here is in Dún Laoghaire.  It is not a high powered centre and its impact is not of great benefit to this country.  We all seek to have such institutions in Ireland. If we are to spend taxpayers' money efficiently, do our work properly and make a better contribution this must be one of the first decisions following the further enlargement of the Community. There must be a centre and the consensus in Ireland is that Brussels would have the greatest support.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further enlargement in the future, although it means problems for us in the area of agriculture. We have been given considerable sums of money to build up our economy <Col N="857" /> which, I have no doubt, will be most efficient following the expenditure of funds which will become available during the next few years.  We are given the opportunity to become efficient for enlargement and we must treat it seriously, having got the Cohesion Funds, which will be a form of compensation for enlargement in other areas.</P>
    <P>We have a reasonable representation in the Commission and our Ministers acquit themselves well at meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Because of the enlargement of the European Parliament I am concerned that it is not physically possible to get our message across in a coherent manner.  We do not sit as members of an Irish group in Europe but every Member who goes out from this country works for the betterment and advancement of our economy.  The recent experience with the Green Party has made it aware that it represents people, it must also be aware that it should reflect the views and needs of this country.</P>
    <P>The Parliament which numbers 567 members, is being enlarged to 800 and with further enlargement it could be 1,000.  It does not add up to democracy to have a parliament of that size.  We should not consider that enlargement is beneficial to the democratic element of decision making.  A parliament comprising 1,000 members is like the congresses which used to be held in Russia where one or two leaders of each group would have their say.  It is a serious problem that has not been sufficiently debated. It needs to be debated and is becoming more urgent as time goes on.  The only reasonable solution in the short term appears to be a second Chamber which would reflect the strength, not just of the populations, but the states that make up the European Community.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a debate which will certainly take place in future.  Last night I watched a television programme about the efficiency of our Army and the future role it may have in the Western European Union.  Such a debate should be held in this House.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, will <Col N="858" /> consider our position, as a member of the European Union, and the extension of support for any military arm which will be under the aegis of the European Community.  As the number of wars diminishes, the peacekeeping nature of our membership of the United Nations becomes more urgent.  The same applies to the European Community within that forum.  We saw the lack of cohesion in places such as Bosnia.  Other nations were asked to make sacrifices in that area on an individual basis.  The European Union will have to decide whether to act in concert in peacekeeping or leave it to individual nations.  This must be debated but the Bill is limited to the accession of the three countries we mentioned.  I welcome the enlargement, it creates problems but they can be overcome and should be addressed.</P>

      <P>It now seems certain that we are going full speed ahead to an enlarged Europe.  Certainly, that will present major challenges for this country but it will also offer major opportunities if we are ready to grasp them, particularly in the areas of trade and tourism &mdash; the areas for which I am spokesperson on this side of the House. However, it will also mean increased competition for our exporters and those involved in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday Finland voted in favour of accession to the European Union by 56 per cent to 43 per cent against.  The Finish Parliament must now vote by a two-third majority in favour of membership to complete the accession procedure which I understand is a matter of form.  Austria voted in favour of accession in June 1994, Sweden will hold its referendum on 13 November and Norway on 27 November.  It appears those four countries will vote enthusiastically to join the rest of Europe.  We must ask why they are doing so.  Even the Americans believe it is better to be part of a united Europe than not.  Europe is moving ahead more rapidly than any other trading bloc in the world and for that reason countries <Col N="859" /> outside the European Union perceive Europe as a place of potential.</P>
    <P>To ensure cohesiveness, more contact between member states and a feeling of involvement, the present structures must meet the aspirations of members. There have been rumblings here about devolution of power to Brussels and Strasbourg.  The European Union has issued a special press release on initiatives launched in Europe and the number is staggering.  However, while initiatives are introduced every week, such as the European Drug Prevention Week, journalism awards, Euro-Mediterranean partnership proposals and satellite communication, people in many peripheral areas such as Ireland are unaware of them.  Even if they are aware of the multiplicity of schemes on offer, they do not know how to apply for them.  People privy to such information derive the advantages.</P>
    <P>From a tourism and trade point of view, enlargement of the Union presents considerable opportunities for us to increase tourist numbers from countries such as Norway, Finland and Austria.  Approximately 32,000 tourists from Norway, Sweden and Finland come here each year, but very few come from Austria.  Last year more than 300,000 Norwegians, 510,000 Swedish and 100,000 Finns visited Great Britain. Approximately, 315,000 people from Denmark visited Britain, while only 17,000 visited Ireland.  The percentage of Austrian tourists who come here each year is very low whereas more than 180,000 go to Great Britain each year. There is a great potential for our tourism industry in that respect.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why a greater number of tourists from those countries do not visit Ireland, especially having regard to our historical links with Norway, Sweden and Finland through the Viking heritage.  There must be something wrong when so many visit Great Britain but so few come here.  The expansion of the European Union will present us with a better opportunity to sell Ireland more vigorously and to <Col N="860" /> encourage more toutists from those countries to come here.</P>
    <P>We could learn a great deal from the people of Austria about promoting tourism.  Austria is one of my favourite countries.  It has captured the outdoor activity market.  We are trying to develop walkways but in many ways they are more an excuse for walkways than what they should resemble.  People are directed to such walkways across bogland and other rough terrain whereas in Austria walkways are well gravelled and signposted in terms of distance and place names.  Such outdoor activity is a growth area in tourism, but we are failing to offer people a similar standard of product to that available in Austria.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the European Union will present us with many challenges.  If we do not upgrade and improve our product as the Austrians have done in Tyrol and other regions we will lose a share of the market.  I hope we can learn from the Austrians in terms of how to manage activity oriented holidays.  They encourage walking and cycling holidays and are sensitive to such activities on their main highways.  Here walkers and cyclists are frequently in danger from insensitive motorists.  For the past 100 years the Austrians have had top class cycling lanes and walkways.</P>
    <P>We can also learn a great deal from the Austrians in terms of food presentation, quality of service and education in the food sector.  It is mandatory for trainees to work in hotels during the summer months &mdash; free of charge &mdash; and the high calibre of people employed in the food sector reflects the quality of training they receive.  In terms of training, food presentation and hospitality skills, the Austrians leave us far behind. We have a great deal of catching up to do in that regard.  Some of those weaknesses were recognised in the operational programme, but commitment of a mere £1 million over six years to develop walking trails and cycling routes is meagre and will not allow us to compete with Austria.</P>
    <P>Norway, Sweden and Finland are <Col N="861" /> beautiful countries and their accession to the European Union will also increase competition.  The number of German tourists visiting Ireland in recent years has increased steadily, although it has remained static this year. Approximately 240,000 Germans visit Ireland each year because of our landscape and contemporary culture.  In recent times we have made the mistake of presenting our culture and heritage in a plastic, artificial fashion.</P>
    <P>Under the last operational programme we went crazy creating interpretative centres nationwide.  That is fine, provided they are attractive and properly constructed.  Unfortunately, we did not have the expertise or knowledge to create attractive tourist centres or present our culture in an interesting, realistic manner, resulting in static displays in centres which I predict will be difficult to maintain, or perhaps even retain, and may remain open for a few months only annually.</P>
    <P>We are now facing into a new era of competition in tourism within the context of an enlarged European Union and must be very vigilant about it. Under the next operational programme we will have to ensure that any undertaking in this area is of a very high quality and is relevant to the marketplace. We must ascertain what German, French or other tour operators in Europe want and endeavour to provide high quality packages or products rather than the type of product we may feel is all right for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred extensively to enlargement of the European Union eastwards, to include countries like Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Baltic states.  This could happen before the next millennium and will present us with further competition not alone in tourism and trade but in agriculture, bearing in mind the very high dependency of those countries on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must be much more aware of what is happening in Europe. We should adopt a more &ldquo;hands on&rdquo;<Col N="862" /> approach because this Parliament in many ways is becoming ever more irrelevant <i>vis-á-vis</i> major decisions taken in Europe.  Although we may enact legislation on local, national or smaller issues, generally speaking increasing legislation emanating from Europe is binding on us.  We must take stock of what is happening there and consider it more seriously since our future depends on what takes place in Europe.</P>
    <P>Places like Poland have land connections with the remainder of Europe, with its large tourist markets in Germany, France and Italy.  We are the only island on the periphery of Europe and that poses difficulties for us, particularly in the peak tourist season here, those six weeks for which people operating the tourist industry make their livelihoods. At times people experience difficulty gaining access here due to lack of ferry and airline capacity.  With ever more land connections throughout Europe, with autobahns stretching across the continent further eastwards, we will become even more peripheral.</P>
    <P>When people contend that this will be the last tranche of Structural Funds for Ireland I become very worried because the amount of such funds filtering through to 1999 will not render us competitive with our more developed European counterparts.  In Europe, rather than adopting the begging bowl attitude, we shall have to point out the realities and difficulties presented to us in an enlarged Community.  Sometimes I am worried when it is claimed in Europe that we have a great economy. Indeed I heard the Taoiseach say in the House that we now have the best economy in Europe.  Such statements are very foolish because we all know, for example, that one cannot compare the German and Irish economies.  When one lumps together all of the people benefiting from the multiplicity of social welfare schemes operating here, such as pre-retirement, disability, unemployment assistance and benefit, one realises there are in excess of 500,000 people unemployed.  When one compares present figures with those in the 1980s <Col N="863" /> when total unemployment amounted to approximately 250,000 and there were fewer schemes and no pre-retirement provision, there could well have been a revolution then.  Now there are many more people unemployed, yet the Taoiseach tells Europe that we as a nation are progressing at top speed, that our economy is booming and so on but that is not the reality.  We must paint a realistic picture of where we stand economically <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners. Bearing in mind the future distribution of European funds, the four new member states and those Eastern European countries, like Poland who will need Structural Funds, we must not marginalise ourselves.  We cannot pretend we are now a fully developed nation ready to keep pace with the level of economic activity in countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Our fisheries policy has been referred to.  I have witnessed a very industrious, lucrative fishing industry being almost wiped out in Kerry because of EC policy and Government policy which makes our fishermen unable in many cases to compete with the Spaniards, Dutch and other member states.  Now we shall have to contend with the Norwegians.  One of the main reasons the Norwegians did not join the EC in 1992 was that they were not prepared to allow access to their fisheries by the Portuguese and Spanish.  I understand they have now come to some arrangement or achieved some derogation.  At that time we did not fully appreciate the value of our fisheries to our economy, and we sold out our fishermen, their families and our fisheries industry generally. It is very late in the day to come to that realisation now.  In any future negotiations &mdash; this was ably articulated by Deputy Bradford this morning &mdash; we must put fisheries to the top of our agenda and not use that industry as a bargaining lever to obtain other concessions; we must obtain concessions in fisheries.  With increased competition from the Norwegians, Swedish and <Col N="864" /> Finnish, our fishermen will face ever increasing difficulties in order merely to survive.</P>
    <P>The accession of these four new member states to an enlarged European Union will present us with major challenges but also with opportunities if we are ready and able to avail ourselves of them.  For example, there is the matter of devolution of power, the strength of our voice within an enlarged Europe. These are matters we must consider carefully and about which we must be vigilant at all times.  Otherwise we could become very small players within Europe.  Despite the cosmetics of the exercise, we could become irrelevant within Europe if we do not fight for our position as a small nation.  That is the reason it is so important we be well briefed on everything happening within Europe and ensure that as much power as possible is devolved from the centre to national parliaments, especially local authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, Opposition Leaders in both Houses should have a greater say in what is happening in Europe.  Being involved in negotiations would strengthen our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Members, Sir, I welcome the prospect of the accession of these four countries to the European Union.  I know all of them.  I have worked in Finland and have visited the others in different capacities, sometimes on holiday.  I am sure the Tánaiste would agree with me that they will provide a notable enrichment to the cultural, social and economic life of the European Union.  We all know Austria fairly well.  Finland is very different from countries that most Irish people know.  Its culture and traditions are very much apart from the rest of Europe and even from Nordic Europe as we know it.  Sweden and Norway, I suppose, are far better known to us.  There have been occasions in the past when not only their cultures but their economies have touched us in ways that we often did not appreciate, but they are countries that we know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> From the economic and social points of view some of these countries are interesting additions to the EU.  Norway and Sweden and to a certain extent Finland could be regarded as exponents of what has come to be known in western Europe as the social market economy, even if Sweden is showing signs these days of having perhaps put too much of the emphasis on the social and rather too little on the market.  I see the Tánaiste smiling.  The Labour Party would do well to make the other error and put a little more emphasis on the market and not quite so much on the social.  There are a great many things for the 12 member states of the European Union to learn from the experience of those countries, from how they have managed their economies and the evolution of their society, because we should not forget that Norway and Sweden particularly were in many ways late developers into the kind of societal structures that we take for granted in western Europe.  Finland took a different path and, had it not been for Swedish influence, Finland might today be even more different from the rest of its neighbours than it is.</P>
    <P>In many ways this accession will shift the centre of gravity of the European Union very much to the north and that will have political, social and economic effects which we would do well to reflect on.  The accession agreements that have been made with these applicant countries show how flexible the European Union can be.  They show a great deal of concern and recognition among the current member states of the European Union of the reality of life as it faces those countries.  I had occasion recently to do a fairly comprehensive study of the accession agreements, and the range of measures included in these agreements to meet the specific needs of those countries is quite impressive.</P>
    <P>To look at the agriculture side first, on this occasion the European Union decided not to adopt the process of gradual alignment of prices that was followed in previous accessions but to have <Col N="866" /> an immediate alignment and compensate for the effects of that over a period, because of course in all of these four countries, with the possible exception of Sweden, farm prices have up to now been considerably higher than in the European Union.  There is a provision built in to cover the period from 1995 to 1998 for digressive compensation on an across the board basis for the reductions that those countries face.  In addition there is a curious provision built in called agricultural eligibility compensation.  That has been put in specifically to take account of the fact that, even though these countries will come into a new system, if will take some time for it to become a part of their administration.  A calculation has been made of what they might lose by the friction that will occur before they get fully up to speed with the way the European Union does its business and compensation has been built in for that.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial provision for agro-environment measures, which is partly to meet the legitimate concerns of those countries with the kind of pressure that has come on natural resources in Western Europe from the agricultural policy we have been operating, a concern which, happly, has been given some real expression within the current 12 member states of the European Union.  Then there are special measures in favour of Nordic agriculture and, indeed, for small farms in Austria, particularly in mountain areas. In the Structural Funds rules, a new objective has been set up to cover the situation in Finland, Norway and Sweden.  In other words, a new dimension has been put into the Structural Funds to deal with the situation as it presents itself in those countries.</P>
    <P>I mention those things simply to say that even though we are all aware of the difficulties of integrating new member states of this kind and, indeed, the difficulties that we already see inside the European Union, there is still the energy and the imagination to adopt a flexible approach and to find ways of meeting those problems.  That should be <Col N="867" /> said in favour of the European Union, particularly at a time when I hope we are beginning to gear ourselves up to another discussion in 1996 on the future development of the Union.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the change in the centre of gravity in the European Union following this accession &mdash; the northward shift in the centre of gravity &mdash; will be that we will look at a very different situation from the security and defence points of view.  The inclusion of Norway, Sweden and Finland in particular makes a very great change in the way Western European countries will now look at their external defence.  Up to now Sweden has been a neutral country, as has Finland and Austria.  They are in very key positions that in previous times were very sensitive.  Those of us who have studied these things will remember in particular the gruelling difficulties of communications between the western part of Europe and its allies in Russia during the Second World War.</P>
    <P>Having Norway, Sweden and Finland as part of the European Union makes a very big change to that tactical and strategic map of Europe.  It means some political changes too.  Sweden has been neutral up to now, as have Finland and Austria.  I do not wish to give offence to anybody on this but it has been very entertaining to read the literature on neutrality produced by those countries. Some years ago I went to the trouble of having a long discussion with the then Austrian Ambassador here on the way neutrality was viewed in Austria.  To my surprise, and bafflement for a while, I was presented with a substantial tome setting out the different doctrines of neutrality.  It reminded me of nothing more than some of the arguments of the old scholars of the Catholic Church who would write tomes of reflections and analyses and exegeses of the reasons various positions were taken, most of them designed to pander to the prejudices of the people who were writing the tomes and designed to help them to <Col N="868" /> arrive at a conclusion they wanted to arrive at anyway.</P>
    <P>The literature on the different types of neutrality is mind-blowing.  The Swedes have a more direct and robust attitude to it.  They regard their neutrality as a statement that they do not wish to be involved in any military alliance, but that they want to ensure that they were armed to the point that no military alliance would consider it worth while to take them on.  Their view is different from the theological positions adopted by Austria.  To their credit the Finns are less wordy about it. They accepted, which the Austrians did not want to do, that they were neutral because that position was forced upon them by a treaty made at the end of the Second World War.  I referred to those matters to make the point that we are inevitably nearing another debate in which some ingenious doctrines of neutrality will be spoken about, not least here.  I have to say honestly &mdash; and the Tánaiste may be surprised to hear this &mdash; that I was encouraged by a speech he made some months ago when addressing the Association of European Journalists.  He appears to be making a deliberate effort to demythologise the discussion on neutrality and put it on a context more relevant and connected to the real world.  I have hopes &mdash; I know the Tánaiste would hate to disappoint me on this &mdash; that this refreshing approach will be reflected in the White Paper on Foreign Policy which we expect will be published before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be published early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to its publication. It will be an important part of the preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 and an important part of our thinking about how we approach questions of enlargement of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter has become the subject of mythology and <Col N="869" /> spurious theory.  That is what is sometimes referred to as a two speed Europe, sometimes as a variable geometry or a variable speed Europe. Those names appear inappropriate for what they attempt to describe.  They attempt to describe, without wanting to say so, a type of Europe <i>à la carte,</i> where some countries which consider they can proceed quickly want to go ahead together and let the other countries catch up as and when they may, a case of the devil taking the hindmost.  I am deeply suspicious of all doctrines that move in that direction because they are anti-pathetic to the idea of setting up a European Community and now a European Union.</P>
    <P>The images of a two speed Europe, or a variable speed Europe, are inappropriate and appear to derive from the idea that if different sized gears are put on a machine, they will allow it to move at different speeds.  However, it must be remembered that even if there are variable speeds, there is variable geometry in the transmission.  The idea is to allow the same machine to move at different speeds under different conditions of power.  The same is true of variable geometry.  People think that means that different parts of the European Union can move at different speeds, but that is not what it is for.  There is a very concrete application of variable geometry in the design of aircraft.  It is designed to allow the whole machine to move at different speeds under different inputs of power and at different altitudes. Neither of them is designed to allow different parts of the same machine to move at different speeds.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the idea of different speeds for different parts of the European Union is gaining currency, because it is a necessary result of this that we have, implicitly or explicitly, more and more of the opt outs that are now beginning to plague some parts of European Union activity.  If there are opt ins for a core group then, as almost a natural law of physics, there are implicit or explicit opt outs.  We have already seen the difficulties resulting from the opt out the <Col N="870" /> United Kingdom got from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.  I have to say &mdash; I know the Tánaiste will not agree with me on this &mdash; I have always been deeply suspicious of the over ambitious nature of the Social Chapter.  I consider large parts of it are anti-employment; they are not proemployee, although that is what they are presented as being.  They are in practice, and in effect, anti-employment. I think it was most unwise of the European Union to go down that road. I would like to see the debate here concentrate more clearly on the realities of what would be involved in these variable geometry, two speed Europe proposals, as they are fundamentally anti-pathetic to the idea of a Community or a Union.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should be congratulated for the report it submitted to us on the enlargement of the European Union.  It is regrettable that we do not have the opportunity to have a more complete debate on that report here.  The committee has certainly done a very good job for the House.  Because we have very little time I will refer to only a few of its recommendations.  Recommendation 10.7 deals with the institutional issues raised by further enlargement of the Union.  At page 69 of the report, it says: &ldquo;It therefore recommends that the implications for Irish policy of the evolutionary and federal constitution models be thoroughly examined and debated&rdquo;.  I have a preference, developed over a long number of years and a great deal of study, for a federal constitutional model, and I would like the House to pay more attention to what that implies.  Deputy Kavanagh referred to the problems he considered would arise in the European Parliament on further enlargement, but I consider much of that debate is misdirected. Because if we are talking about a federal constitutional model, then what we talk about in the European Parliament is not national representation but the representation of federal party groups there.  There is already the basis for <Col N="871" /> believing that that is an effective way to go, because in both the Christian Democratic Group and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament we see at least the beginnings of federal party structures. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that those two groups have indeed been successful in their operations in the European Parliament, and I do not consider the fears expressed about the size of national groups are really all that legitimate in the context of such development.  The House should apply itself to consider that area because it will be crucial to our participation in the future development of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about the prospects of the further enlargement of the European Union to the east.  The most we should do about that, in the immediate future and in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, is to ensure that the model of development we adopt for the European Union &mdash; and I have a preference for the federal constitutional one &mdash; should be open to further development. I do not consider it is possible or realistic at this stage to put a timetable on when such further extension of the European Union will take place.  That is not something that Governments in Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics and Hungary in particular will like to hear but I do not believe that before the end of this century and probably for some time afterwards, they will be in a position where they can fully involve themselves in the operation of European Union of the kind I have in mind. That is not because they are incapable of it but because their structures, habits, economic and social customs will not have evolved to the point where they can, with safety to themselves and to their political and economic systems, take on the burden of operating in the same way as long-standing western capitalist economies.</P>
    <P>The transition is much more than an economic transition.  This was illustrated to me a couple of years ago by a Polish <Col N="872" /> Minister when that country was at the beginning of a transition process.  He told me and some other colleagues that they had a market which was not a market and they had a currency that was not convertible.  He made the very sensible statement that the quicker they changed that position the better.  He said they could not do so in stages, that they must do it all at once.  It is like deciding to drive on the left hand side of the road instead of the right.  To do so in stages and start with the buses would be a recipe for disaster.  The change has to be made all at once.</P>
    <P>For these countries to make the transition to a parliamentary democracy with a market economy would be an enormous transition in itself without having to work within the context of a European Union which still has not fully defined where it is going.  I would caution about considering, in an operational sense, the further extension eastward of the European Union.  I welcome the Bill and I apologise to the Tánaiste that I cannot remain to hear his comments. I look forward to the White Paper and the result of his deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a couple of matters before I refer to the welcome proposals before me.  I am alarmed at the growing use of passports in the European Union.  I recently travelled from Paris to London &mdash; not at the taxpayers' expense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Deputy attacked for doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on three occasions before I boarded the plane in Paris I was asked to show my passport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We told them the Deputy was travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of passports is a relatively new phenomenon.  In the 19th Century there was no such thing as a passport and people travelled freely wherever they wished.  In this supposed Union, which we are proposing to <Col N="873" /> extend, a person travelling from Paris to London &mdash; less than a three hour train journey by way of the Channel Tunnel &mdash; must show a passport three times before boarding a plane.  The reason is that air carriers are held responsible under refugee legislation for carrying persons seeking asylum who do not have proper documentation.  That law must be changed because it makes a total absurdity of the European Union. We are supposed to be taking away barriers and at the same time we are introducing the use of passports on a large scale within the European Union.  A person travelling to the United States is requested to show his passport only once, at Shannon.  This is an important principle, that should be considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I say that as a person who is interested in the development of the European Union and who was director of elections for Fine Gael for the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act.</P>
      <P>On the question of organised crime, there should be greater co-operation between Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, as is the case between Ministers for Agriculture and Foreign Affairs.  Forty thousand tonnes of heroin are exported each year by ten known non-European countries.  Much of this heroin makes its way to the European Union and is the source of a great deal of crime on the streets of Ireland.  Drug abusers mug, pickpocket, shoplift and burgle to feed their expensive habit.  This is the case throughout the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug distribution is organised crime involving some of the nastiest and meanest criminals nationally and internationally. Given this background, the response of the EU is so feeble as to be sinister.  Who or what is holding back the EU from taking on these exporters and organisers of death and mayhem on a grand scale?  Only one European Minister needs to drag his or her feet to block the efforts of other Ministers.  Are sinister forces at work?  Has the Council of Justice Ministers been compromised or nobbled?  Why is there no plan to <Col N="874" /> persuade the offending countries to mend their ways?  It is time a European drugs enforcement agency was established to co-operate with the US Drugs Enforcement Agency in tackling one of the greatest scourges to afflict the international community since World War II.  There should be greater European action in this area.</P>
    <P>If we continue to enlarge the European Union in the way we have been doing we will soon end up with 17 members.  Already the great bear Russia, has asked to be admitted.  The socialist Prime Minister of Spain said that the great bear would turn over the boat if he sat on the side.  I do not know whether that would happen, but we are nearing a position where we will have world government, certainly government involving a whole segment of the world.  The existing structures cannot simply continue to be expanded <i>secula seculorum.</i> It is time consideration was given to the question of sub-regions within the European Union.  I hope the White Paper will address this matter. Should there be a west European sub-region and an east European sub-region and what structures are necessary to deal with this development?  How would an enlarged Parliament be housed and organised?  This is a fundamental question that must be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to ensure that when EU enlargement takes place a small EU member state such as Ireland is vigilant and makes no concessions in terms of constitutional and State voting rights. Ireland should not become part of the second league.  I am sorry to use this term but what we have we hold.  That is what is demanded by the national interest, not just the Irish national interest but that of all the smaller member states.  The Government must prevent any watering down of the rights of smaller member states.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of neutrality which is defined in the Fifth and Thirteenth Hague Conventions as a neutral country denying access to all belligerent states.  Ireland is militarily <Col N="875" /> neutral; it has never been neutral economically in terms of its association with the United States or Europe.  I have spent some time researching this subject and it appears that our neutrality is based on partition.  In 1949 the late Seán MacBride, who was then Minister for External Affairs, said that we would become full Charter members of NATO the day after partition ended.  He was portrayed as the great protector of our neutrality and his was the only reason on record for Ireland adopting this stance.  Neutrality is not mentioned in the Constitution although some people seem to think otherwise.  Given the developments taking place this week, and the new institutional arrangements North and South, is this not a reason in itself to review our traditional stance on neutrality?</P>
    <P>Many people argue that our traditional military neutrality is compromised by our membership of the European Union but that is not the case, rather it has been compromised by our membership of the United Nations.  Every Taoiseach, including Seán Lemass, has said that if it was necessary to take on defence responsibilities within the European Union to meet our obligations as a member, then we would embrace those responsibilities.  We pay homage to this so-called great principle of neutrality and there is much humbug about our responsibilities within the European Union but it was the United Nations which compromised this State in terms of the strict requirements under the Fifth and Thirteenth Hague Conventions during the Gulf War.  This House and State complied fully with its request to be allowed use Shannon Airport and overfly this country in order to bomb Iraq.  Therefore, we did not meet the requirement that we deny access to all belligerent states if we consider ourselves to be militarily neutral.  It was not the European Union which compromised us but rather the United Nations of which the late Seán MacBride was a former Assistant General Secretary. Yet, those people who take shots at <Col N="876" /> anyone who dares to raise this question pay homage to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a healthy debate on this issue and those who question our policy of neutrality should not be dismissed as militarists.  What is wrong with our society that we are not capable of debating in a civilised way important issues of State?  There are few more important issues than defence and security?</P>
    <P>Some argue that we should be aligned to the neutral and non-aligned group but this was not the case at the CSCE where the European Political Co-operation group spoke on our behalf and did not do such a bad job.  Some members of the neutral and non-aligned group are among the largest manufacturers and exporters of armaments of destruction. Therefore, no comparison can be drawn between neutrality and passivism. I would not like Ireland to pursue the record of some of these so-called neutral states.</P>
    <P>Finland and Austria have different reasons for being neutral; this was forced upon them as part of the post Second World War settlement.  They do not appear to have any difficulty addressing the question of neutrality. The neutral club within the European Union will become larger and this question will become a live issue in 1996 when we will hold the EU Presidency. This means that not only will we have to address the issue but we will be in the driving seat when it is raised.  It is time we stopped fudging the issue and misleading the public and took our responsibilities seriously.  If in the future the European Union should become the target of a belligerent state will we expect Belgium and Dutch troops to defend it?  Why should the mothers of Dutch and Belgian soldiers be expected to send their children to defend us when we are net beneficiaries?</P>
    <P>Who in God's name is proud of our record of sitting on the fence when six million Jews were sent to the gas chambers? It is time we spoke the truth and stopped playing on people's emotions. We should debate the principles on <Col N="877" /> which people take a stand either for or against neutrality.  If our membership of the European Union requires us to depart from our traditional policy of military neutrality, I do not see any reason we should not take on defence responsibilities given that we are on the inside and will have an opportunity to specify the circumstances in which this would happen.  If we do not prepare for this eventuality, it will be forced upon us behind closed doors.  Already, we have sent observers to the Western European Union.  I am not in favour of doing anything by stealth or fudging the issue; rather I am in favour of having an informed and proper debate and bringing the people with us.  We should be able to do this without engaging in party political nonsense.  There is a variety of views on this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of employment.  The employment system in almost every member state of the European Union is completely out-of-date. The accession of the Scandinavian countries will be welcomed as they will be net contributors but Poland and the Czech Republic will be admitted soon and they will be net beneficiaries.  Each year in the European Union five million people leave secondary schools without qualifications.  In Ireland we have made great improvements in this area: in 1993 6.3 per cent left school without qualifications but we have set a target of zero for 1999; in 1993 16.4 per cent held the junior certificate on leaving school but the objective for 1999 is 10 per cent; 77.4 per cent of school leavers passed the leaving certificate in 1993 and the objective for 1999 is 90 per cent.  That will be a great improvement because the more educated have better job prospects. However, 1.6 per cent of GDP in the European Union is spent on unemployment assistance.  There is no point in educating people unless there are jobs for them.  As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment said, the way we organise jobs needs to be looked at.  Depending on how one looks at the figures, between 30 and 40 per cent of European Union GDP goes on <Col N="878" /> health and pensions expenditure.  How do we hope to continue to fund unemployment assistance at the rate of 1.6 per cent of GDP and health and pensions at between 30 and 40 per cent of GDP when only 60 per cent of the population is at work compared with 70 per cent in the US and 75 per cent in Japan?  During the process of enlargement, the European Union should address this matter because it is the central issue for young people leaving school with improved qualifications. Why are only 60 per cent of those available for work employed compared with 70 per cent of those in the US and 75 per cent of those in Japan?  If that is the case how can we expect to continue to fund unemployment assistance and health and pension benefits?  That question needs to be addressed now.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to enlarge the European Union.  We cannot presume that having benefited from membership we can pull up the ladder, particularly for countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic who will benefit from membership.  To extend the benefit of membership to them we need to bring in new, rich members from Scandinavia and we welcome their membership.  We must provide structures to manage this growing political entity and in doing so ensure that nothing is done to water down the voting rights of small nations, particularly Ireland's voting rights &mdash; a proposal for first and second league members of the Council of Ministers and the Commission is being discussed. I support the accession of these countries to the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak but I will be brief and confine myself to an area that has received little attention.  The major political and economic issues have been addressed by many speakers and, to a lesser degree, social affairs, and the accession of the Scandinavian countries will provide a valuable input to debates on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recess I attended a conference on European culture and I will <Col N="879" /> dwell on the insights I gained from it. While it is very encouraging to see countries wishing to join the European Union, we must remember that when we were debating its enlargement in the past year it was touch and go whether this legislation would be passed.  One of the critical issues for many countries is their sense of identity and countries are very anxious to protect their individual identity.  We have to allay fears of a loss of identity so that people will feel that in benefiting from being part of a larger group they do not lose things that are very valuable to them &mdash; for which we know minorities will fight and for which some people will give their lives.  We have seen this in our own country as well as throughout Europe.  If these issues are addressed, Europe could be a finer and a richer place.</P>
    <P>A great many people fear that membership of the European Communities means homogenisation.  Already, we suffer from American influences on television.  An element of that is inevitable and part of world cultural development but in every country in Europe there is a commitment to those elements of its culture that make it distinctive. In Ireland, for example, there is an interest in our language and culture &mdash; Gaelscoileanna are springing up all over the place.  I visited one in Cork city this week &mdash; out of Dáil sitting time I am glad to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there is one in my constituency in Ballymun.  There are difficulties but I hope they will be resolved.  It is important, when people think about Europe, that they do not think about homogeneity and loss of identity but of diversity and richness.  It is not sufficient only to state that because it has implications for how we spend resources, on education for example.  In parts of Europe in particular minority dialects are banned, one must be educated in the majority dialect and the dominant culture is supported. <Col N="880" /> While that might not be a passionate issue in a country where it is not an issue it could become a live issue if we feel that our culture is under threat. Europe has a very rich and diverse culture, drawing its strengths from Scandinavian, Celtic, Germanic, Judeo-Christian and something that is little acknowledged, Islamic influence, moving up through Spain and which becomes increasingly relevant as Europe takes in the countries to the East.  In the context of debates at European level, I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to encourage an interpretation of European culture which does not aim to move towards homogeneity but is based on respect and support, financial and in every other sense, for cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>In drawing from the richness of cultural diversity and making that clear when decisions are made on emblems, flags and other matters, we can allay many of the fears that make people drag their feet on the issue of integration.  It is important that this issue gets air time. Looking at history one realises that the couple of hundred years when the countries of Europe were separated by narrow nationalism is much shorter than the many centuries they were part of the Holy Roman Empire and part of the same cultural and economic unit.  In benefiting from the richness of our diversity and by putting culture higher on the agenda in Europe we can allay the fears of many states and ensure a richer and more integrated Europe.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994. The debate has been useful and worthwhile. It is important that every Member of this House not only takes an interest in developments in the European Union but seeks to participate in evolving policy in this House and on behalf of the Government.  The debate was worth while because it allowed the <Col N="881" /> House to focus on one of the major themes that will dominate the European Union agenda for many years to come and it was useful because it allowed many of the issues to be debated.  Many of them were not aired for the first time and indeed they have not been debated for the last time because we will have to debate many of the issues for the foreseeable future as Europe evolves and expands and as changes take place within the European Union.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the constructive nature of the debate.  The current round of enlargement to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway posed few major challenges and opened up a range of opportunities.  This was reflected in the debate over the past few days.</P>
      <P>Future enlargements will pose major additional challenges.  Deputies Owen and Deasy, in their wide-ranging speeches, referred to many of these challenges.  Speakers, while acknowledging these challenges, demonstrated openness in facing them and a willingness to seek out the opportunities that will become available.  This is to be welcomed. It is to be welcomed also that the imperative of enlargement for both political and economic reasons has been acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that part of the reason for the constructive approach to the issue of enlargement of the European Union, which was evident in the debate, has been the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs report on enlargement of the European Union published at the end of last month.  I commend the committee on the publication of that substantial report.  It is clear that significant effort and thought was put into preparing it.  It is clear also that that effort and thought was reflected in the contributions made during this debate.  We can all agree in this House that the establishment of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs is proving to be successful and worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed some concerns about the Social Chapter.  Lest there be any confusion, I assure the <Col N="882" /> House that with the exception of Austria, which secured a temporary derogation on one issue due to an International Labour Organisation commitment, the accession countries have accepted in full all the social legislation of the European Union as well as the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty relating to social policy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that enlargement of the European Union, to the east and to the south, will be one of the major issues the Union will have to address in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Government very much welcomes the prospect of the accession to the European Union of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  These are countries which have long been friendly neighbours to us in Ireland and with which we have a similarity of interests on a range of issues.  For example, like Ireland, all four countries have participated actively in United Nations peacekeeping operations for many years.</P>
    <P>During the course of the enlargement negotiations it became clear that with the European Union we will have many common interests and aims.  These will range from agriculture and regional policy to concerns to ensure that the evolving European Union meets the needs of its citizens well into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out in this debate we are at the start of a process that may take the European Union from 12 to more than 20 members in due course.  These developments will have profound implications for the European Union and for each of its member states.</P>
    <P>I would like to concentrate on the future of the European Union in light of developments in the years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  Following the emergence of the new democracies in eastern Europe the European Union accepted a particular and historic reponsibility.</P>
    <P>The European Union, in the process of strengthening its own internal coherence through the Treaty on European Union, was accurately seen as an anchor <Col N="883" /> of stability by the newly emerging democracies in the east facing the challenge of profound economic and political transformation.  The European Union's response to developments in the countries of central and eastern Europe was at once imaginative and encouraging, generous but realistic. Negotiations on association agreements were begun between the European Union and the central and eastern European countries.  These agreements provide the basic framework of the European Union's relations with the countries of central and eastern Europe and their scope is indeed wide-ranging &mdash; covering trade, political dialogue, cultural relations and economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1994, Europe Agreements will be in force with six countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Before long, Slovenia and, in due course, the Baltic States, will also be associated with the European Union in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The peoples of central and eastern Europe are succeeding in establishing parliamentary democracies and are committed to a path of economic growth based on the market economy. It is not surprising, therefore, that in April, just after the completion of the enlargement negotiations with the four EFTA countries, Poland and Hungary formally presented applications for membership of the European Union. Others may shortly follow suit.</P>
    <P>The countries of central and eastern Europe believe that a clear prospect of accession to the European Union will help them to push further and faster in developing their economies and to underpin their commitment to democratic institutions and reform.  I might stress that human rights and the rule of law are fundamental pre-requisites for membership of the European Union. The countries of central and eastern Europe also believe that membership of the European Union will be the best <Col N="884" /> basis on which to develop mutually beneficial relationships with Russia, Ukraine and the other states of the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Copenhagen in June 1993 decided that the associated countries of central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union.  Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required.</P>
    <P>These conditions include stable and democratic institutions, respect for the rule of law, human rights, protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union.  Future European Union membership is also linked to candidates' ability to take on the aims of political, economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>In the medium and longer term, membership of the European Union is seen by the countries of central and eastern Europe as the means of influencing developments, enabling them to safeguard their identity and exercising a reasonable influence over their external environment.</P>
    <P>The position adopted at the European Council in Copenhagen was reaffirmed by the Corfu European Council last June.  The Corfu European Council also decided that the 1996 intergovernmental conference should take place before accession negotiations for the countries of central and eastern Europe begin.  The Council invited the Commission to bring forward a specific pre-accession strategy in the case of the countries of central and eastern Europe. This is currently being discussed and developed in the Council prior to presentation of the Heads of State and Government for approval at the European Council in Essen next December.</P>
    <P>Key elements likely to be included in this pre-accession strategy for the countries of central and eastern Europe are <Col N="885" /> the creation of a framework for deepening the relationship with the European Union; help and encouragement to align legal and regulatory structures with those of the European Union in order, <i>inter alia,</i> to pave the way for participation in the Single Market; active encouragement of closer regional co-operation between the countries themselves; and enhanced EU-CEE co-operation in key sectors such as transport, energy and the environment.</P>
    <P>The accession next year of Finland and Austria together with, hopefully, Sweden and Norway &mdash; all prosperous and developed countries with relatively small populations &mdash; requires no fundamental changes to the working of the institutions, policies and budget of the European Union.</P>
    <P>As recognised in our debate, further enlargements will be more complex.  We will need to look at ways of preserving the character of the European Union when there are 20 or more members, many of whom as of now are much less prosperous than the current member states.</P>
    <P>How can we have efficient institutions which also give due influence to the member states, including small member states?  How can we ensure continued economic and social cohesion?  I assure Deputies that work is already under way in addressing these and other complex and vital issues. Some of the complexities were raised in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs but, as it points out, there are opportunities as well as challenges.  Opportunities will arise as the single market is increased from 350 million people to between 400 and 500 million European citizens. Ireland has been successful so far in increasing exports in manufactures and foodstuffs to the associated countries in Eastern Europe.  We are also heavily involved in the service sector and through consultancies.  We can and must continue to grasp these and other opportunities.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is extremely difficult to accurately assess the financial impact <Col N="886" /> membership of the CEEs would have on the Union and on Ireland.  It will depend, for example, on the scale of transfers envisaged under the Structural Funds, the future direction of CAP, the size of the EU budget after 1999 as a percentage of the EU's GNP, as well as future growth in the economies of the acceding countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes raised many issues which will be addressed in the White Paper it is hoped to publish early next year.  Consultations are commencing on contributions from the public.  That was generally welcomed by the House and I hope Deputies who take an interest in foreign policy will also take an interest in the preparation of the White Paper to make it as inclusive as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the obvious and worrying aspect of drugs and their availability within the EU.  I assure him that this issue is high not only on the Interior Justice Minister's agenda but on the agenda of the European Council. Chancellor Köhl expressed his concern at the difficulties facing all member states in the battle against drugs and associated crime.  Deputy Mitchell said that some member states were not carrying their responsibilities to the full but I can assure him that as far as we are concerned everything possible that needs to be done will be done to protect the peoples of Europe from the scourge of drugs and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>We have, as a priority in the debate taking place in the EU, the concerns expressed by a number of Deputies regarding the position of small states. Deputy Flaherty raised the question of culture.  I do not detect any attempt to seek to devalue the diversity of culture within Europe.  It is quite the opposite. There is a strong movement within each of the member states to preserve the obvious diversity of our cultures.  There is strength in diversity throughout the EU.  To assist in bringing democracy, prosperity and peace to post-Communist societies in Europe is a profound political project of the first magnitude. It is in the clear long term political, economic and cultural interests of <Col N="887" /> Europe and her peoples to do so.  To face our responsibilities and prepare for enlargement will release creative energies that will help us to deal with and put in their proper perspective the range of other issues which the EU must deal with over the next decade.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The decision of the European Council of Ministers in October 1992 to agree a directive on the protection of pregnant workers, as well as workers who have recently given birth and are breast-feeding, has culminated in the presentation of this Bill to the House.  Ireland fully supported the adoption of this directive and, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I am pleased to introduce this Bill to meet the obligations arising from the Council's decision in 1992 that fall within my Department.</P>
      <P>In the Bill, I propose a number of improvements to protection for pregnant workers which are separate from and additional to the directive and which will be of real benefit.  The directive also involves significant occupational safety and health and social welfare measures which my colleagues, the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare, are implementing separately in parallel legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to implement the directive is, of course, already understood by the social partners as an item of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  That there is such broad support for the measure is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Bill is regarded in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> as a measure which will facilitate the combining of work and family responsibilities, it is perhaps, even more importantly, a statutory support for women in the labour market.  It is this principle of support for women workers on which the existing law was based, namely the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981.  Similar recognition has been afforded to women workers with regard to pregnancy and childbirth in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, which allows special treatment for workers in such circumstances. <Col N="889" /> The concept of employment protection for pregnant workers has also been extended into the Unfair Dismissals Acts and other labour legislation.  It attempts to acknowledge, in statute, the true value to society of a woman's role in giving birth while, at the same time, seeking to ensure that women should not be disadvantaged in the labour market because of that role.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives employees worthwhile and effective rights to meet their needs arising from their pregnant, recent birth or breastfeeding condition and places important obligations on the employer.</P>
    <P>I decided it would be more helpful to employers and employees to prepare the Bill as composite legislation on the employment rights requirements of the directive.  The alternative would have been to draw up a Bill which amended the 1981 Act.  The value of repealing the 1981 Act and re-enacting it here is that it provides, in a single source, the employment rights of this group of workers.  In re-enacting the 1981 Act, provision has been made to retain existing entitlements to 14 weeks maternity leave and the optional four weeks additional maternity leave as well as the rights of workers to job security while on leave and to return to work after leave.</P>
    <P>A careful balancing of rights and obligations is maintained in this Bill and employers will continue to be entitled to adequate notification from the employee about her condition and her intention to avail of entitlements.  At the same time, the diverse range of potential eventualities associated with childbirth are accommodated and the employee's rights are duly protected in those unusual circumstances where notification difficulties may arise.</P>
    <P>In addition to re-enacting the 1981 Act, the Bill also introduces important new provisions.  First, it extends the scope of maternity legislation to all employees who notify their employer of their condition.  It also extends the categories of employee to include not just pregnant employees or employees on maternity leave but also employees who <Col N="890" /> have given birth within the previous 14 weeks and employees who are breast-feeding within 26 weeks of giving birth. These points are addressed in the definitions outlined in section 2.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Act applied initially to those working a minimum of 18 hours per week and excluded women on fixed term contracts with less than 26 weeks left to run.  In 1991, an amendment was made to the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act to include regular part-time workers.  This Bill provides maternity entitlements for which all employees who have notified their employer of their condition are eligible, regardless of hours worked or length of service.</P>
    <P>It will also apply to fixed term contract workers until their contract of employment expires, and it explicitly addresses the position of agency workers with a view to establishing greater clarity as to their rights in this area.  In the past, there may have been some confusion as to whether an employment agency or the agency's client availing of the employee's services was the employer for the purposes of meeting maternity protection obligations. Under section 2, in future the party who is liable to pay the employee is to be deemed the employer.</P>
    <P>Part I covers not only interpretation matters but also commencement, expenses and preliminary and general provisions, while Part II sets out the re-enactment of maternity leave entitlements along with a number of new provisions. The first of these arises from the directive and involves paid time off for ante-natal medical care.  Although time off for ante and post-natal care is provided for in the existing legislation this Bill provides that in future such time off will be with full pay.  The Bill goes further than the directive and extends the right to paid time off for post-natal care for women who have recently given birth.  It is important to facilitate health care needs in the weeks immediately after childbirth, and it is a practice which I am sure benefits not only the employee but very probably the <Col N="891" /> employer by ensuring that post-natal medical problems are tackled before they might seriously impact on the employee's health.</P>
    <P>The second new provision is contained in section 16 which proposes to entitle the father to leave if the mother has died within 14 weeks of the birth of the child.  In such circumstances the Bill will entitle the employed father to leave for the balance of the period of the 14 weeks after the mother's death.  Leave provisions along the lines of additional maternity leave will apply during the final four weeks of this 14 week period with full maternity leave arrangements operating up to that.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in Part III reflect the special emphasis in the directive on the protection of employees who are pregnant, who have recently given birth or who are breast-feeding.  These must be considered in conjunction with the occupational safety and health regulations which are being made by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I would like, therefore, to outline the general approach being taken on the safety and health side.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, we have in place a comprehensive occupational safety and health code contained in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and regulations made under it.  Those provisions require employers to identify any hazards at the workplace, to assess the risks which may be present for their employees and to take any necessary preventive measures.  The new regulations being made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will make explicit the obligations of employers, as these relate to employees who are pregnant, who have recently given birth or are breast-feeding.</P>
    <P>Once the employee has informed the employer of her condition, the obligation on the employer to take action will apply.  If it is not feasible to remove the risk, the employer must consider alternatives, including the possibility of moving the employee to suitable other <Col N="892" /> work.  Only when solutions to the problems cannot be found within the workplace do the provisions in Part III for the granting of safety and health leave come into play.</P>
    <P>Very similar provisions apply as a protection against night work and the employee's doctor must certify that night work for that employee in her condition would be injurious to her health.  The employer's response to this situation must first be to seek to move the employee to day work.  Having failed to find other solutions to the workplace risk or night work, the employer will be required to grant safety and health leave and there will be an obligation on him to pay the employee for the first three weeks and to give, on request, a certificate describing the circumstances in which the leave was granted and stating the commencement date and expected duration.</P>
    <P>It is considered only reasonable that, as the risks exist at the particular workplace, the employer should be obliged to bear some part of the payments during the leave period.  For the remainder of the leave period, there will be a social welfare benefit payable on conditions contained in regulations made by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions in regard to the granting of safety and health leave are contained in section 18.  Additional provisions regarding the varying circumstances in which the leave will end are included in sections 19 and 20.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 to 29 address the issue of protection of employment rights.  As well as re-enacting the protection of rights during maternity leave and the general right to return to work at the end of such leave, they extend these rights to cover the newly-provided health and safety leave.  This Part also deals with the requirement to provide suitable alternative employment to the employee on return to work, where it is not practical for the employer to reassign the worker to her original job. Where this applies, the new contract under which the employee is offered the other work must be not less favourable <Col N="893" /> than the previous one.  Notification procedures and postponement circumstances are covered in these sections also.</P>
    <P>The resolution of disputes is dealt with in Part V.  The disputes issue is well tried and tested, and similar provisions to those which currently apply under the 1981 Act have been adopted.  In the light of experience, however, some adjustment has been made and, in particular, it has been decided to rationalise the dispute machinery so that all cases are first referred to a rights commissioner. The right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal from the rights commissioner will, of course, continue to exist but the current option to bypass the rights commissioner service has been removed.</P>
    <P>The prohibition of dismissal on grounds of pregnancy, giving birth or breast-feeding is set out in section 38 by way of an amendment to the unfair dismissals legislation.  By adapting the unfair dismissals provisions, the traditional resolution and redress mechanisms for dismissals disputes are maintained. Protection is also afforded under the Bill for the statutory rights of pregnant employees in respect of redundancy payments, terms of employment and employer's insolvency.</P>
    <P>As I said, this legislation has been the subject of detailed consideration by a number of Departments.  It has also been possible to reflect on the considerations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on these matters.  In addition, relevant agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority and the Employment Equality Agency have contributed to the preparation of these proposals, and the normal consultation process with employer and employee interests has also applied.  In all the circumstances I would like to hope that we can process the enactment of this Bill without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members to this debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputies that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will hold its first meeting on Friday, 28 October in St. Patrick's Hall, Dublin Castle, at 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forum follows a further intensive round of meetings which I held with party leaders last week, the purpose of which was to reach agreement on the terms of reference for the forum and the level of party representation at both full and alternate membership level.</P>
      <P>As in all previous discussions on the forum my aim was that membership should, firstly, be broadly representative of all the democratic political traditions on this island and, secondly, that membership should reflect to some extent the proportionate level of electoral mandates, with favourable levels of representation accorded to all Northern parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to report that agreement has been reached with all parties concerned to proceed with this noble task of building trust and healing old animosities on this island.  I am also <Col N="896" /> very pleased that the forum will be assisted by the expertise of Judge Catherine McGuinness of the Circuit Court, who has accepted the invitation to serve as the forum's chairperson.</P>
    <P>As to matters related to Northern Ireland, Government policy is carried out in an integrated manner by the Tánaiste and myself, with officials of our respective Departments working closely and effectively with each other. This approach has been carried out with regard to the establishment of the forum, and it is likely that its Secretariat will be drawn substantially from the two Departments.</P>
    <P>Despite our best efforts, it has not been possible to secure formally nominated membership from the main Unionist parties.  However, the invitation to the Unionist parties remains open and I am hopeful that in due course we may see a contribution in some form.  Indeed, building on the impetus of the loyalist ceasefire and in addition to invitations to the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Popular Unionist Party, I have also invited Mr. Gusty Spence, the former UVF commander, and the elected representatives of the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party to take part in whatever way they wish in the forum's work.  Even without such participation, I believe the diverse political make-up of the 11 groupings in membership of the forum is testament of the Government's aim to make the forum a truly inclusive enterprise.  In addition to the political groupings I have also invited Senator Gordon Wilson to contribute his unique and valued perspective to the work of the forum.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the possibility of attending the forum in the capacity of observer may be open to democratically-mandated groups.  To date, in the category of observer, the European Parliament nominated two MEPs.  I also share the view that other parliamentary bodies, such as the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, might also usefully <Col N="897" /> hold such status, and appropriate provision for such representation is being made.</P>
    <P>In any event, from my consultations to date, I am aware of a great level of consensus, on the part of the parties participating in the forum, that it should be both politically and socially inclusive in the performance of its work, and facilitate contributions from community groups, Churches, trade unions, business and vocational bodies in an open, flexible and responsive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will call Deputies in the order in which their questions appear on the Order Paper. As Deputy O'Malley is not present I call Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the abduction and apparent exile from his home of Paul Carroll by the IRA has any implications for the forum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see it having any implications for the forum.  It is a separate issue and we should await the full reports from the Garda to ensure that we all know the true position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the man is apparently being held in our jurisdiction and that the IRA, which is linked in some fashion to Sinn Féin, was involved?  Does that have any implications for the terms of reference of the forum to deal with all matters by democratic and peaceful means?  Does the Taoiseach consider that visits by masked men to private homes, inviting people to leave with them to go elsewhere, come within the category of democratic and peaceful methods of political action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising a very specific matter worthy of a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it would not be possible for me to raise it <Col N="898" /> in any other way in respect of the forum, before it meets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, Deputy, but it is a particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to put the question the other way around.  Will the Taoiseach agree that all the parties taking part in the forum are required by its terms of reference to commit themselves exclusively to democratic and peaceful methods of political action?  Is it the Taoiseach's opinion that the events surrounding the abduction and apparent exile of Paul Carroll come within the category of acceptable democratic and peaceful methods of political action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly a different matter.  The reason the forum is being set up is to let people talk among themselves about issues as they arise and, indeed, obstacles in the way of true peace and reconciliation on this island. Deputy Bruton is making statements here that run contrary to what the father of this young man said.  He said that his son is not being held against his will and that he was not abducted.  I said in the first instance that we should know the facts of the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we should all await exact information from the Garda on this matter before we jump to conclusions. Of course, I would condemn any acts, as I said in this House last week and the week before, that are not in accordance with the underpinning of peace and the development of the reconciliation process on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed reservations in the past about the forum, I hope my fears are unfounded.  Will the Taoiseach accept that failure in regard to the forum could be counter-productive in so far as the peace process is concerned?  Will he accept that the principal aim of having the forum broadly representative of all democratic traditions on the island will not be realised because the Unionists have said they will neither attend nor appear before it?  As the forum will comprise mainly of Nationalist parties and the Alliance Party, and bearing in mind the change in the terms of reference, what does the Taoiseach want it to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want it to achieve what it is being set up to achieve, namely, the underpinning of the peace process and the development of the process of reconciliation between the two communities on this island which have been divided by violence for the past 25 years.  We want to start a new era on this island and between its two traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to being convinced on this matter.  How can the forum achieve that aim when the principal tradition in Northern Ireland, namely the Unionists, will neither attend at it nor be represented on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear <Col N="900" /> Deputy O'Keeffe say he is not convinced in this regard.  Apparently his party is convinced, otherwise it would not be attending the forum.  None of us contemplates its failure, if we did we would not have set it up.  We all want to give it our best shot and to contribute in whatever way possible to consolidate the peace process.  We also want to identify the obstacles and hurdles to true reconciliation between the two traditions on the island.  While it is regrettable that the two main Unionist parties will not attend &mdash; although the door is open and the invitation stands &mdash; the Alliance Party who claim to have a fairly representative view of unionism in Northern Ireland will be represented on the forum.  Senator Gordon Wilson will also attend.  Other small parties, some of whom are represented here and claim they, in turn, have the support of people across the community divide in Northern Ireland, will also be represented on the forum.  It is not correct to say that a purely Nationalist view will be presented at the forum, but we would like a wider Unionist view.  However, it will be open to other organisations and groups to make submissions to the forum and have their point of view put on the record.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that all Members approached this question in an attempt to reach a consensus on the way forward.  In that regard I am anxious that all representatives on the forum are on an equal footing. Will the Taoiseach undertake to express to Mr. Adams the concern of Members regarding reports that an organisation with which he is associated appears to be still engaged in acts of violence, that it should stop, and that no person either here or in the North should be subject to such acts of violence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach did not refer to the word &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo;. Since the announcement of the ceasefire the leaders of Sinn Féin, particularly Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, have frequently used that expression.  Have they discussed it with the Taoiseach?  I can only presume they want the removal of the British Army from Northern Ireland.  Have they signified that in return for the removal of the British Army, or part of it, they would be willing to give up a proportion of their armaments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of demilitarisation has been referred to by many people.  It does not apply only to my vocabulary, it is used regularly in relation to Bosnia and by James Molyneaux. We want total demilitarisation in terms of Northern Ireland, far too many arms are held in both communities <Col N="902" /> there.  The question of arsenal has been put to members of Sinn Féin, who agree that it must be addressed.  Everybody recognises that the process in which we are engaged cannot be successful until the destruction of arsenal is agreed.  I have been heartened by the statement made by representatives of the Loyalist paramilitaries in New York that they are considering handing over arms in the near future, but I do not know what they mean by &ldquo;the near future&rdquo;.  The matter was also discussed at our meeting in Chequers on Monday where John Major, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Tánaiste and I agreed that the security forces on both sides should work out the mechanics and the logistics of demilitarisation. The matter has been brought up with Sinn Féin at both meetings and it is clear that it must be tackled at some stage.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members rejoiced at the withdrawal of the British Army from the streets of Derry for the first time in 25 years.  That is a step in the right direction. We would all prefer if there was no requirement for the British Army to patrol the streets, the sooner they resume normal barracks duties the better for all.  That decision is being taken on a phased basis, similar to the reopening of Border roads.  The more the position improves, the sooner we will see the destruction of the arsenal involved.  Demilitarisation involves the British Army and relates to arms held on all sides in Northern Ireland.  We want to return to a society where the RUC can resume normal police duties and the British Army can resume barracks duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have said the <Col N="903" /> question must be addressed before a peace process can be successful.  We all recognise that if we are talking in terms of an enduring peace and reconciliation there must be a complete destruction of arsenal.  We want normality restored to the two communities in Northern Ireland where the RUC, the British Army or paramilitaries from either side will require arms.  That is the ideal we want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be clear about the events surrounding Paul Carroll's abduction in Armagh.  This young man was removed from his house by masked and armed men for purposes of interrogation, possible punishment and perhaps even worse.  Would the Taoiseach accept that the mask drawn across that episode is an attempt to hide the basic fact that there remain armed people involved in this process?  Second, will the Taoiseach reconfirm that the Downing Street Joint Declaration will not be negotiable at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, that all of its participants are aware of that fact and have been so informed?</P>

      <P>I do not know why Deputy Currie continues to raise the matter of the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  It was a solemn declaration agreed between two Governments and nobody except those two Governments can renegotiate it; it is not up for renegotiation now or in the future.  It will form the basis of the framework document being prepared between the two Governments.  If beatings or punishments are being meted out in the manner described by Deputy Currie I totally deplore them, as does the Government.  I will never try to defend the indefensible.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has asked why I repeatedly pose this question. The answer ought to be clear to him.  I have on many occasions refrained from saying things in this House which might have harmed this process, even though <Col N="904" /> I felt strongly about them.  Will the Taoiseach accept that the reason I keep repeating this question is that I consider it to be fairly fundamental and I believe there are some people who do not understand that the Downing Street Joint Declaration is not negotiable, who believe that they can participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, and attempt to renegotiate that declaration? That is the only reason I have raised the issue.</P>

      <P>The precise purpose of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is to afford various people an opportunity to understand the differing points of view that exist today so that, out of its deliberations, there will emerge a better understanding, hopefully a consensus based on the ways and means of removing obstacles to reconciliation.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach met Sinn Féin last week did he raise his concern about the continuing punishment beatings?  If so, what response did he get?  Did he get a positive response on the matter of the disposal of weapons?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. In relation to punishment beatings, I said in this House yesterday and repeat that the issue of punishment beatings was raised at the first meeting and subsequently. The response was that, in so far as they were aware, there were not any current punishment beatings. However, there was an admission that there had been some initially.  They acknowledged that we had made the case against them and had made it very clear that nobody would stand over that kind of practice.  I have already stated the position in relation to arms and there is an acknowledgment that this must be dealt with in its totality.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it might be more conducive to recognising the complexities of the conflict and to achieving some consensual solution were he to refer to the differing traditions on the island rather than referring constantly to the two traditions? He will know that even Wolfe Tone in his time referred to at least three, when he mentioned Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.  Would the Taoiseach agree that life has become considerably more complicated since then?  Would he agree that if he were to refer to the differing traditions on the island it might have a less polarising effect?</P>

There are many other different traditions on the island and any solution must be inclusive of all those differing traditions.</P>

      <P>How does the Taoiseach envisage the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation interlinking with the talks process?  When does he expect the talks process to begin?  I am sure it would be his hope that it would begin as quickly as possible.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>I cannot put a date on when the talks process will begin.  All I can say is that it would be the hope and expectation of all of us that it would begin as early as possible.  The framework document has yet to be agreed. Only after its publication, when all of the parties will have had an opportunity to digest its contents and make their views known, can the process begin.  It may well be that there will be a round <Col N="906" /> of bilateral meetings first rather than a round table conference on the views of all the parties.  Those arrangements remain to be worked out with the British Government when the framework document has been agreed.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation are fairly flexible.  I have no doubt that some of the issues discussed in the framework document may well be discussed at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation if they are perceived as representing ways and means of improving the reconciliation process.  The Government has not issued any diktat to the forum on its <i>modus operandi.</i>  We are leaving that to the forum itself.  That is the way most parties would want us to do it.</P>

I would be deeply concerned about that. These are proposals which have been put to me by a representative of the Taoiseach.  The manner in which they are being put forward seems to suggest that the Government wants to have it both ways, that they want to be there as Government representatives, take advantage from that, and then also take an advantage from being separate parties. They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>With regard to the earlier questions about continued paramilitary violence, if it is shown that this type of activity continues, or indeed if the current case under investigation is <Col N="908" /> shown conclusively to be an activity of the IRA, will the Taoiseach say whether he will make it clear to the political representatives of these paramilitary organisations that political sanctions may have to be applied at some point if this type of violence does not cease, bearing in mind the overriding desire of the people of Northern Ireland to be free of all types of violence?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that over eight weeks have elapsed since the announcement of the IRA ceasefire and a couple of weeks since the announcement of the cessation of violence on the part of the loyalists, during which period, thankfully, there has been very little violence.  That is the way we hope it will continue.  I have said all along that it is a long road, that undoubtedly there will be difficulties encountered along the way.  Undoubtedly there will be some people, however small in number, who might want to derail the peace process.  It behoves all of us to ensure that that does not happen.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people want to see us push on with the peace process, and the more it can be strengthened on the ground the better and stronger will be the momentum to ensure that it is consolidated and endures.  This is precisely the point I made to the British Prime Minister on Monday.  It is very important to see a continuance of issues like the removal of the British Army from the streets of Derry, the gradual return of the RUC to normal civilian police duties and all the other issues that can be tackled to rebuild confidence.  There will undoubtedly be the occasional problem put in our way but we cannot let them derail the peace process.</P>

      <P>My question relates to activity authorised by the command structure of the IRA as distinct from maverick activity by people who simply want to disrupt the peace process.  While it is important to bear in mind the sensitivities and the necessity <Col N="909" /> to bring a political organisation like Sinn Féin into the process, it must be made aware that if there are authorised activities that involve violence against people in Northern Ireland, or elsewhere, sanctions must be applied to them at some point.</P>

      <Quest>if the initiative he established on strategic management in the Irish public service has reported yet; if so, the changes in management procedures outlined in the report; and whether he intends to publish its findings.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1404/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative which I announced in February last set down two specific Government decisions as follows:  <Col N="910" />  (i)  that each Secretary and head of office put in place a process of strategic management, within the framework of the <i>Programme for Partnership Government, the National Development Plan and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and, as a first step by end September of this year, produce a statement of strategy for their Department or office;  (ii)  that a new co-ordinating group of secretaries be established with a three part remit: to facilitate the preparation of strategy statements in Departments and offices; to recommend the ways in which interacting departmental strategies should be co-ordinated to achieve the benefits of an overall view and to recommend management changes to enable individual secretaries to manage more efficiently and effectively. </P>
      <P>The present position is that the process of strategic management is in place right across the Civil Service and each Department and office has produced or will shortly finalise a strategy statement. Such statements are, of course, only the beginning of the process.  The next phase will involve developing implementation programmes for achieving the strategic goals identified, including in certain cases organisational changes. The co-ordinating group of secretaries is now developing best practice from the strategy statements and working with all secretaries and heads of offices to put that best practice into operation across the Civil Service.  Dialogue between the group and individual secretaries is proceeding. The co-ordinating group is producing a first report to Government on possible approaches to interacting strategies across individual departmental areas of activity and on changes, specifically in the personnel and finance areas, which will assist departmental managements to manage better.  I understand the co-ordinating group will make that first report to Government next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Strategic Management Initiative was, is and will be a <Col N="911" /> particularly worthwhile initiative. Departments and offices have stated that they already have benefited significantly from improved internal communication and greater clarity of objectives within their areas of responsibility. The outcome in terms of statements of strategy across the Civil Service and the identification of obstacles to good management will enable the Government to consider how best the process may be developed and accelerated.</P>
    <P>The Government look forward to having the first report of the co-ordinating group.  As I said in February last, strategic management must become an ongoing process in Departments and the real benefits will come only from commitment over time.  For their part the Government will provide the political leadership and support to ensure that those benefits are realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach answered questions on this matter last March he said he hoped the plan would be in place within six months.  Is he disappointed that the co-ordinating group has not yet reported to Government? Have any of the Departments that have reported made recommendations about possible joint ventures between the State and private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked the Departments to report back within six months and practically all reports were received by that time.  However, some were rather weak and we discussed how they could be strengthened, which took some extra time.  The process is in place and the question of possible joint ventures with commercial State bodies is included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand what is going on.  Submissions are being made by individual Departments and are being co-ordinated centrally to comprise a report with specific proposals for action by <Col N="912" /> Government.  Is this any more fundamental than streamlining internal management in Departments, or will it look at the wider question of public service reform?  Will the report be laid before this House since public service reform is an issue of considerable importance and we should have an opportunity to discuss it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that Deputy Rabbitte fully understands what is going on relating to the setting of corporate objectives and working out a strategic statement of departmental goals.  To give him some flavour of what is happening, the statement of strategy completed today comprises four sections, as follows: (1)  description of a strategic management process within individual Departments and offices; (2) a short statement of the Department's current mandate and of the key factors for success for the Department if it is to fulfil its mandate and, based on those success factors, clarification of the essential function of that Department; (3)  a clear statement of the Department's major goals over the next three to five years; and (4)  objectives for the divisions in the Department stated in outcome terms and showing the manner in which these objectives support the departmental goals.</P>
      <P>Changes are taking place and management has to respond to those changes and manage them.  We in Government have a co-ordinating role to ensure that the objectives set out in the National Development Plan, in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and in the Programme for a Partnership Government are met.  It is only by having each Department draw up its own strategic management plan that we will ensure that the objectives set out are achieved by the Departments and that we can be satisfied at Government level that this will happen.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the criteria for the granting of designated status to an area of high unemployment.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2255/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991, 12 pilot areas were selected for the area-based response to long term unemployment initiative, introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In each of these areas, partnership companies were established, with board members drawn from local community groups, the social partners and State agencies.</P>
      <P>The success of the 12 pilot partnerships in instigating integrated socio-economic development initiatives, aimed in particular at the long term unemployed, was instrumental in the Government's decision to include a local development programme in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The designation of disadvantaged areas to participate in the programme was made by the Government on the basis of objective indicators following the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development, which engaged in detailed consultation with relevant Government Departments, and other agencies, including the Combat Poverty Agency.  The views of the National Economic and Social Forum on local development strategies were also taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three categories of areas were taken into account &mdash; Dublin, other urban areas and rural areas.  The objective was to focus on a number of areas with high concentrations of poverty and disadvantage. The choice of areas was based on <Col N="918" /> an assessment involving (1)  objective and measurable criteria such as statistical indicators of disadvantage, (2)  feasible operational boundaries and (3) viability in terms of size and economic base.  A process of local consultation to establish the exact boundaries of each of the designated areas and the appropriate partnership structure to be put in place is currently underway.</P>
    <P>The 33 partnership areas will be funded under sub-programme II of the operational programme for local urban and rural development 1994-99, which is currently being finalised with the European Commission.  Matching funding for this sub-programme will be provided from the Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>It is likely that other areas would wish to have a specific designation under the local urban and rural development programme but it should be equally clear that to do so would defeat the purpose of designation, namely, to target scarce resources where they are most needed, according to the most effective and objective means possible.</P>
    <P>I stress that communities in areas which have not been designated as disadvantaged will not be excluded from funding under the operational programme. Under sub-programme II of the operational programme, communities which make a collective effort to promote the integrated development of their areas and which are capable of a sustained effort to implement a plan that accords with the objectives of the sub-programme, may also apply to be considered for funding.</P>
    <P>This provision, together with the county enterprise boards and European Union Initiatives such as Leader II and URBAN, will ensure that no part of the country should be excluded from the local development process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply in which some reference was made to my question.  I am curious as to why the Taoiseach, instead of the Minister sitting beside him to whom I put the question, answered it. <Col N="919" /> A question is rarely transferred to the Taoiseach, normally questions are transferred in the opposite direction.  In the Taoiseach's last reply he said he was following a precedent set by his predecessors. In the context of this question I wonder if he is following a precedent set by his predecessor, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in 1989, who said that designated status in Dublin should apply not only to Tallaght but to areas in need of development, such as Lucan, Clondalkin, Balbriggan and Blanchardstown? Have the criteria changed under the Urban Renewal Act since as Balbriggan has not benefited from the wise words uttered by the Taoiseach's predecessor? Will the Taoiseach clarify if the position has changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's comment, it highlights the fact that questions are transferred from other Ministers to me.  There is some confusion in the Deputy's mind in respect of the subject of the question. My Department is responsible for the partnership companies in the 33 designated areas.  Responsibility for areas outside those areas rests with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  Designated partnership companies are spread throughout many areas.  With the assistance of the European Union under the Structural Funds area scheme we are examining areas suffering deprivation and high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People will make cases for different areas but these must fulfil the criteria laid down by the European Union and the Commission.  If these companies were spread across the whole country it would defeat the purpose.  We are trying to use concentrated resources to see what will be the result.  There is no area ineligible for Structural Funds, whether <Col N="920" /> by way of the Community Development Programme or the Leader II Programme. There is an opportunity for any community who puts forward an integrated plan to be supported under the Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The Deputy misunderstands what I am saying.  I have responsibility for the partnership companies in the 33 designated areas and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility in other areas.  The European approach to this matter has changed a lot and programmes now in operation which did not exist in 1989 have brought about many of the criteria we are talking about.  Specific criteria are used to decide the areas that are most disadvantaged &mdash; I am not saying that other areas are not disadvantaged.  The criteria taken into account are the unemployment rate, the labour force participation rate, the percentage of early school leavers, the percentage of unskilled manual workers, the age dependency rate and data relating to the percentage of unemployed in local authority rented accommodation.  Widespread criteria are used to identify the most disadvantaged areas and we direct resources at those areas with a view to improving the position there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Price Waterhouse Management Consultants were engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group to carry out a review of the Defence Forces and to make recommendations for change.  Their report was submitted to the EAG in July 1994 <Col N="922" /> and the total fee of £259,000 in respect of the review has now been paid.</P>
    <P>The report prepared by Price Waterhouse is at present being considered by the Efficiency Audit Group who will in turn report to the Taoiseach.  As I indicated on 10 February 1994, while it may not be appropriate to publish the entire report of the EAG when it is received, the Government will seek to make as much information as possible available to the House.</P>
    <P>I believe it is clear that there is an unquestioned need to reform the Defence Forces.  The Government is publicly committed to a positive and constructive programme of reform focused on providing the Defence Forces with the resources to carry out efficiently and effectively the tasks entrusted to them.  The changes required will be decided on by Government, when it receives the Efficiency Audit Group's recommendations, as part of a long term plan and will be implemented at a realistic pace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be an important day for the Taoiseach and his colleague beside him.  However, I do not wish to waste the few minutes we have left in idle chit chat with the Taoiseach. When will the Government have the recommendations from the EAG?  Will the Minister indicate whether the reports which have been leaked to the newspapers on the closure of barracks and the reduction of the armed forces by about 20 per cent are accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that the <Col N="923" /> EAG report will be available before the end of the year.  As the EAG has not yet reported or made recommendations it is not true to say there are recommendations before the Government about the closure of barracks or about laying off 3,000 members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in condemning the leaking of official documentation before PDFORRA or RACO were consulted.  Will the Minister indicate that well in advance of the report being finalised and a decision taken, there will be consultation with PDFORRA, RACO and another important group that has not been mentioned, the trade unions, who represent many civilian employees in barracks and military establishments?  I agree that a report on the Defence Forces, which have been neglected for many years, is long overdue.  I am sure the Minister will agree this matter should be tackled in a more positive way rather than by way of leakage to the national media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.  The leaking of selected extracts from the report was not for the benefit of the Defence Forces.  It has made the task of the Efficiency Audit Group more difficult in that it has been continually stated that the recommendation is before Government, but that is not the case.  Once the EAG has made its report available to the Government and the Government has made decisions on the recommendations, full consultation will take place with the various associations, trade unions and the military authorities, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from my discussions with officers and men that the leaks damaged morale in the Defence Forces.  I condemn the leaking of the document which is very unfair to the Defence Forces who are dedicated and committed to their work.  In the informal talks that took place everybody accepted the need for change and reform of the Defence <Col N="924" /> Forces.  In the next three or four weeks I intend to continue those talks on a slightly more formal basis.  I accept there is concern that the report will be decided by the Government and implemented without proper consultation. I take this opportunity to assure Members of the House and military personnel that this will not happen and there will be full consultation.</P>

      <P>The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry was published on 29 July 1994.  It drew certain conclusions on the roles of the Government and the Industrial Development Authority in the grant allocation process under the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  The powers and functions of the Industrial Development Authority, as set out in the 1986 Act, have been vested in Forfás from 1 January, 1994.  A great many of these have been assigned by Forfás to Forbairt and the IDA and are exercised by these agencies.  The conclusions of the tribunal are, accordingly, relevant to the operations of all three agencies. <Col N="925" /> Having reviewed the legislation the tribunal concluded as follows:</P>
      <P>General: (i)  the Authority is an autonomous body though subject to the provisions of the 1986 Act; (ii)  one of its functions is to provide and administer such grants and other financial facilities as it may be authorised by the Oireachtas to provide and to administer; (iii)  the grants and other financial facilities which it may provide in accordance with the authority of the Oireachtas are those specified in detail in sections 21 to 32, inclusive, of the Act; (iv)  the only involvement of the Government in the grant making process is if the Authority requires permission to exceed the amounts specified in the different sections of the Act in relation to grants, loan guarantees or the purchase of shares; (v)  in such circumstances the Government may, in lieu of granting the permission sought, grant permission to the Authority for the expenditure of a lower amount in respect of such grant, guarantee or purchase or may grant permission subject to such conditions as the Government may specify, section 35 of 1986 Act.</P>
      <P>Policy Directives: (i)  while the Authority is obliged, in the exercise of its functions to act in accordance with policies set out from time to time by the Minister, these policy directives which the Minister is empowered to give must relate to industrial policy for the country as a whole and cannot apply to any individual industrial undertaking; (ii) in summary, the role of the Minister in the scheme envisaged by the Oireachtas is to lay down industrial policy for the country as a whole; to issue directives in regard to such policy to the Authority and to lay such directives before each House of the Oireachtas; the role of the Authority is to administer the scheme subject to such directives, if any, in accordance with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Role of the Government: (i)  the role of the Government, as set out in section 35 of the Act, only arises when the Authority seeks its permission to make <Col N="926" /> a grant in excess of the amounts specified in the Act; (ii)  the whole purpose of the Act was to ensure that the Authority was the sole body with the power to make grants or provide other financial facilities in respect of any individual undertaking and that the Government had no role in regard thereto unless or until the Authority sought its permission to make a grant or provide financial facilities in excess of the specific amounts set forth in the different sections of the Act, in which circumstances the provisions of section 35 of the Act applied; (iii)  the tribunal was concerned to show by its recital of the relevant provisions of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 that the Oireachtas did not intend that the Authority should be an instrument of the Government in the sense of being subject to the Government's direction with regard to any specific grants or any particular area but should operate as an independent and autonomous body in the exercise of its functions and should not be subject to or affected by the priorities or policies of any Government save such general policy directives as are dealt with in section 13 of the Act: which policy directives are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and cannot apply to any individual undertaking otherwise than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government indicated that a new programme would be introduced to provide opportunities for about 30,000 long term unemployed people.  I am delighted to say that the Community Employment Programme, which was introduced in April of this year, has a target participation level by year end of 40,000.  There were 32,865 on the programme at the end of September and I am optimistic that the target of 40,000 will be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the Government has set up a task force to develop specific proposals arising out of the recent report of the National Economic and Social <Col N="928" /> Forum on the long term unemployed. This task force is to report by 30 November and I have no doubt that the Government will move expeditiously to take decisions on foot of the task force's eventual recommendations.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless we cannot be complacent. The level of unemployment generally and particularly the level of long term unemployment remains at an unacceptable level.  The efforts of the Government will be directed at creating the conditions which will allow the continuation of the uptake in the economy which has been evident over the past number of months.</P>

Is he aware that since his appointment the number of long term unemployed people has increased by 14,000, that we have the highest proportion of long term unemployed people in the OECD and that the figure is many times higher than the figure in other countries?</P>

For this reason the task force has been established to respond to the report of the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>

These include the establishment of a jobs fund, targeted wage subsidies, a national pre-return to work counselling service, a national training <Col N="929" /> scheme, an education and training certification board and a national voluntary scheme of work sharing.  Is he aware that the Government has failed to implement all but one of the proposals in the programme?  While we may be pleased with the CEP is he aware that he made specific commitments but nothing has been done about them and it is not surprising against this background that long term unemployment continues to increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>While I agree that the difficulties encountered in resolving the disputes in both Irish Steel and TEAM Aer Lingus were exacerbated to some extent by the number of unions involved, the main reason for both disputes was the scale and extent of the changes required to return both companies to viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multiplicity of trade unions can be unhelpful in an industrial relations context and it is acknowledged that there is a need for rationalisation. Responsibility for trade union rationalisation rests largely with the trade union movement itself.  It has long been the objective of that movement to bring about a significant reduction in the number of trade unions.  The role of Government is one of encouraging and facilitating the rationalisation process. The State has exercised this role mainly through the Trade Union Act, 1975, which was specifically enacted to encourage and facilitate trade union mergers by simplifying the procedures involved and by making grants available <Col N="931" /> from the Exchequer towards the costs trade unions incur in the process.  A further measure was introduced in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to allow grants to be paid to help defray the costs where an attempt at a merger has been unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Government policy in this area has been successful as evidenced by the volume of trade union mergers in the last decade or so.  To date, 21 amalgamations or transfers of engagements have taken place under the Act and nearly £1.4 million in grants has been paid out by my Department in respect of these mergers.  Largely as a result of rationalisation the number of unions declined from 86 in 1980 to 58 at present, a drop of 33 per cent.  A significant number of these mergers involved craft unions. Despite significant progress, there is scope for further rationalisation.  I am glad that the present merger trend is continuing and that further mergers are in the pipeline &mdash; some involving craft unions.  We are likely to see a further reduction in the number of unions over the next few years.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the existing provisions to promote trade union rationalisation are more than adequate and that additional measures are not required at this stage.</P>
    <P>The problems which arose due to multi-union involvement in both TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel are matters which fall to be dealt with by the trade union movement in the first instance.  In this regard, I welcome the recent announcement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that it has embarked on a review of its procedures with a view to ensuring that the problems which arose in those cases do not arise again.  This review is being carried out by a commission set up by the ICTU and chaired by its president, Mr. Phil Flynn.  I look forward with interest to the outcome of this review and to the contribution it will make to improving industrial relations practices.  If the Irish Congress of Trade Unions requires help or assistance from my Department I will <Col N="932" /> ensure that full co-operation is given in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister's acceptance yesterday of the trends of the capitalist environment, does he accept that it is an ongoing problem for those who seek to manage business, in the State or private sector, to have to deal with multi-unions on one site? Does he agree there should be changes in the labour law to ensure that one union can negotiate on a particular site and that we should provide, as suggested by IBEC, for a single postal ballot of all workers when disputes arise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not present yesterday at the forum but her former colleague, Deputy Cullen was, he heard me say that capitalist economies were never designed to provide full employment and that, therefore, people who argued for it in that context should recognise the limitations of capitalist economies.</P>
      <P>My party gives full support to open and free democratic societies and we are not in the business of compelling people to join a single union or requiring, by force of law, one union to be represented in a particular workplace. On the contrary we believe in the voluntary approach &mdash; and the concept of free association is enshrined in our Constitution. It is desirable, and Congress has been first to recognise the desirability of such a position, that there would be a minimum of trade unions in any one workplace to maximise the effectiveness of the representation of the workers in the first instance which will in turn lead to a more efficient management of the enterprise involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, having regard to the different traditions of different unions and the requirement to get the consent of the members of those unions <Col N="933" /> to participate in the most effective way of balloting their members, will probably come forward with a recommendation similar to the Deputy's suggestion. That is, in the first instance, a matter for the commission of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to investigate and ultimately to recommend.  I do not want to prejudice the outcome or the findings of that commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 82, 89 and 100 together.  The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938 governs the opening hours of retail establishments.  The Act provided for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gave the Minister power by order to add to the list of exempted businesses, or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  However, an order made later that year exempted the whole country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1938 Act was enacted for the primary purpose of the regulation of competition. Therefore, any justification for the reintroduction of the legislation to ban even limited types of Sunday trading would have to be based first and <Col N="935" /> foremost on competition considerations. In the context of the increased incidence of Sunday trading, implementing the EU Directive on Working Time, I have arranged for an independent study to be undertaken on the question of working time and other related issues for shop workers, including levels and conditions of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to put restrictions on the opening hours of shops on Sundays?  Is she of the view that there should be no legal bar to large multiples opening every day of the week if they choose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex issue, not merely a question of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  To reach a balanced conclusion, I set up an independent study, which is being undertaken and I hope to have the results before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Mandate represents in the main shop workers and I am sure many Members will have received correspondence from the union which has no objection to stores opening on Sunday provided (a) it is voluntary and not part of the rota of the working week and (b)  that there is proper remuneration for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider her study of the Mandate proposal as it makes the case that opening on Sunday would have a damaging effect on employment because it would put a number of smaller stores out of business?  Will the Minister confirm the terms of reference of this study?  Did the Minister say she could not alter the legislation except in regard to competition? Considerations such as working conditions therefore will not come into play.</P>

The IPC has been commissioned by the Department to carry out a study into the implications of the increased <Col N="936" /> incidence of Sunday trading, in particular the implications for (a)  the level of employment &mdash; that answers the point the Deputy made &mdash; (b)  the conditions of employment, including hours of work in the relevant sectors; (c)  the existing legislation on conditions of employment, hours of work and hours of trading and (d)  existing EU directives now being transposed into national law and draft directives.  To answer the Deputy directly, yes, that is part of the brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>The document in question was a report from a Scottish firm of consultants, RPS Cairns Limited, who assisted my Department in its examination of Arcon's planning application and environmental impact statement. Arcon's EIS and associated documentation were forwarded by Kilkenny County Council to my Department for comments in accordance with Regulation 18 (2) (d)  of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990.  As the House will know the Department is only one of many bodies which were part of a wide consultation process.</P>
      <P>The report by RPS Cairns was incorporated as an appendix in my Department's response to Kilkenny County Council on Arcon's application.  The Department endorsed the RPS Cairns report and forwarded a copy to the county council on 26 April 1993.  In its conclusions on the matter of the proposed tailings site for the mine development the report by RPS Cairns stated as follows:</P>
      <P>Tailings: One critical issue remains fully unresolved, namely the risk of dam failure due to the presence of karst features and the effects of dewatering beneath the impoundment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arcon has provided comprehensive <Col N="938" /> design and survey data to support the proposed tailings site and design. However, it has not been demonstarted that the site proposed for the tailings impoundment is the optimum site in terms of the risk of dam failure. This is a significant issue which cannot be resolved by approprite planning conditions or regulatory requirement.</P>
    <P>Following submission of the report to Kilkenny County Council the council contacted my Department to clarify the final sentence of the above conclusion. My Department considered the matter and, in the context of the whole report, concluded that the particular sentence in question was open to misinterpretation. The concerns which existed at that time about the proposed tailings site were fully addressed in section 6 of my Department's report to Kilkenny County Council and in section 3 of the RPS Cairns report.</P>
    <P>It was the professional view of officials in my Department that the only thing the particular sentence conveyed was that the site chosen by Arcon had not been shown to be the optimum site. My Department's earlier interpretation was of course based on this logic.  Therefore, no matter what conditions the county council put in a planning permission these conditions could not change this fact, that the site was not shown to be the optimum site.  This of course in itself did not detract from the fundamental soundness of the project.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, therefore, contacted RPS Cairns about the matter and in particular raised the interpretation which might, in isolation, be put on the sentence.  My Department, however, made it absolutely clear to RPS Cairns that they were not being asked to alter their report nor to do anything which would be at variance in any way with their professional ethics. Given the construction which might, in isolation, be put on a sentence, RPS Cairns were asked if they wished to reconsider their report.  RPS Cairns themselves decided voluntarily to delete <Col N="939" /> the sentence and to submit an amended report which my Department then forwarded to Kilkenny County Council. They did so on the basis of a clear acknowledgement that the deletion of the sentence in question did not materially alter the report.</P>
    <P>As the questions which have been raised centre on safety of the proposed tailings site, it would be appropriate for me to relate to this House how the matter was subsequently dealt with through the planning process.  The planning process was originally begun in December 1990 and the environmental impact statement submitted was the most comprehensive one the Department has ever received in relation to a mining project.  Planning permission for the Galmoy project was granted, subject to numerous stringent conditions, by Kilkenny County Council on 28 May 1993.  That permission was subsequently the subject of a number of appeals both by the company, which appealed some of the conditions, and by third parties to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>My Department made observations to An Bord Pleanála on the appeals which were lodged with it and, in the majority of cases, supported the county council's position.  An Bord Pleanála held an oral public hearing in October 1993 into the appeals at which officials of my Department, assisted by RPS Cairns, actively participated.  An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the project on 29 April 1994 which again was subject to numerous stringent conditions.</P>
    <P>Those conditions included additional structural, precautionary and other measures relating to the proposed tailings pond, many of which were proposed either by the company or the consultants who assisted my Department.  It was the view of our technical consultants that provided certain features and measures discussed by them at the oral hearing in October 1993 were adopted and executed by the company, the overall risk of dam failure at the proposed site in Galmoy would not be materially <Col N="940" /> different for a similar dam at a non-karstic site.</P>
    <P>In the event, not only were these additional measures fully catered for in the planning permission granted by An Bord Pleanála for the project, but the board added a number of further conditions relating to the tailings impoundment such as the requirements for a double liner in the impoundment and the provision of a fail-safe berm to contain potential spillage of 25 per cent tailings capacity.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, completely satisfied that the planning authorities have, in the conditions attached to the planning permission, fully catered for the particular characteristics associated with the proposed site of the tailings impoundment.  Under no circumstances would my Department issue a State mining licence for the project unless we were fully satisfied that this was the case and that the project would conform to the highest possible international standards.</P>
    <P>Contrary to certain claims being made both inside and outside this House, the full account which I have now given about this matter clearly demonstrates that at no stage did I personally, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy or my officials, interfere in any way with the planning process in connection with this project.  The record clearly shows that my Department dealt with the many complex and technical issues which arose in a totally objective manner.  Indeed, on most of these issues, my officials found themselves supporting the county council's position in the interests of ensuring that the development was undertaken in an environmentally acceptable manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that the planning process culminating in a full Bord Pleanála hearing is a public and transparent one.  Far from any alleged subversion of this process, my Department participated actively and professionally at all stages and facilitated a complete appraisal of the proposal.  I am, therefore, happy to place my Department's <Col N="941" /> full report to Kilkenny County Council in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>At no stage was I personally involved in any of this process.  However, the particular slant which was put on the issue raised by Deputy Hogan might be interpreted as a slur on the professional reputation of the officials in my Department and those in Kilkenny County Council.  This would be totally unacceptable to me and, I am sure, to every other Member of this House.  I am, therefore, in the light of my clarification asking the Deputy to withdraw his remarks.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, it became clear that a possible misinterpretation of one of the conclusions in the Cairns report was not supported by the analysis of the body of the report and this conclusion would have been an unnecessary but possible obstacle to the granting of the planning permission if it were misinterpreted in isolation.  The Department discussed the problem with Cairns who acknowledged the position and they withdrew this statement.  To have jeopardised so many badly needed jobs on such a misinter pretation would have been a grave mistake.</P>

      <P>I am willing to hear the answers just as I was yesterday.  The Minister said, in summary, the conclusion of RPS Cairns is not supported by the body of the report.  Is it not strange for professional consultants to carry out a substantive analysis the body of which does not support their own conclusion?  How would there be a danger of it being viewed in isolation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the planning authority would look at the full report which the Minister said he appended as an appendix to the document he sent back from his Department.  Surely the county council would look at the totality of the report and not just at one sentence in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the sentences I read out, the critical sentences are:</P>
      <P>One critical issue remains fully unresolved, namely the risk of dam failure due to the presence of Karst features and the effects of dewatering beneath the impoundment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arcon has provided comprehensive design and survey data to support the proposed tailings site and design. However, it has not been demonstrated that the site proposed for the <Col N="945" /> tailings impoundment is the optimum site in terms of the risk of dam failure. This is a significant issue which cannot be resolved by appropriate planning conditions or regulatory requirement.</P>
    <P>In other words, the EIS upon which Cairns consultants were employed by us as statutory consultees and by the planning authority to assist in this, the biggest EIS in the history of mining, was based on the site chosen.  One cannot put in place a planning permission procedure which will deal with a site selection issue.  For example, one cannot apply for planning permission without designating the site and this site was deemed by the developers to be the best available.</P>
    <P>When Cairns examined all the data available to them they stated that the issue of the site selection could not be dealt with by way of a planning permission procedure.  However, this does not suggest that the site was unsuitable and would not, even with proper conditions attached, be capable of dealing with the tailings residue from the mine. In an overall context, there is no question of my Department issuing a State mining licence to any company before first insisting on proper safety standards and that the project meets the highest international practice.</P>
    <P>One could interpret the sentence as meaning that the project was incapable of proceeding.  That was not the case and the interpretation was wrong.  It was a <i>non-sequitur</i> in terms of what had preceded it in the report.  Following consideration of the matter by Kilkenny County Council and discussions between the senior geological staff in my Department with technical and professional expertise and Cairns about a possible interpretation, it agreed that it was not a correct interpretation and they had no problem deleting the sentence to avoid such an interpretation. They can, and will, verify that this is the case.  This morning when the issue was raised I checked that this was the case. The facts confirm that the consultants, <Col N="946" /> the people who issued the report and its authors, had no problem with the deletion of that sentence from the amended report as it did not take away from the central thrust of what they were doing.  Those are the circumstances surrounding its deletion.</P>
    <P>I want to again point out to Deputy Hogan that nobody in my Department deleted anything from the report.  To my knowledge, no public official would even consider doing such a thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

It may be all right to make statements here so that they will be picked up by the media which will give a certain impression to the public, but there is no evidence to support this allegation, it did not happen, the people who were consulted were proper technical and professional staff and there was no involvement by us in regard to these detailed and complex matters.  The professional ethics of Cairns, of the Department and of the Kilkenny county manager are being called into question as a result of the Deputy's suggestion that the county manager, as head of the planning authority, was prepared to countenance a proposal which was in some way wrong or not agreed by the consultants.  That is the logic of the Deputy's case.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the manager of Kilkenny County Council, as a member of the Health and Safety Authority, would have been aware when he saw the initial Cairns report that there were safety implications and a danger to public health and safety of those who might work in the mine.  For those reasons alone, the planning application should have been rejected.  Was this matter ever referred to the Minister's private office or to the private office of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy? Did the Minister or his private secretary discuss this matter with the secretary of his Department on any occasion?  Did he meet Mr. Donnelly, the manager of Kilkenny County Council and discuss <Col N="948" /> with him the planning application by Arcon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the third question first, I never met Mr. Donnelly in his capacity as county manager in regard to this matter and I certainly never discussed this issue with him.  As I said in my statement yesterday, of course I am kept abreast of the progress made on all matters in the Department and certain matters are dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, under his delegated functions.  I was not involved in the detailed technical assessments in regard to this matter as I have no function or expertise in this area.  I reiterate that there was no interference by me, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, or anybody in my Department in the proper discretionary functions available to the county manager or the planning officials in Kilkenny County Council who deal with the planning authority.  We are statutory consultees in this matter, as are others, and we are seeking to assist the planning authority through the provision of technical and other data so that the largest EIS ever to come before a local authority on a mining project is dealt with adequately, with full information available.  That is the clear position.</P>

      <P>Arcon, a fine company, changed its plans substantially in relation to the tailings pond issue during the Bord Pleanála hearing.  Why would it do so had it not been brought to its attention that the tailings pond site was flawed?  The Minister, and his officials, were keen to ensure that the RPS Cairns report was altered in order to push through a flawed planning application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in charge of his Department.  He stated that officials in his Department contacted RPS Cairns in order to influence the outcome of a report by deleting this particular sentence.  The Minister must admit that as head of his Department he is responsible for whatever action his officials take.  I am convinced that the precise reason this sentence was deleted was that Arcon could not be granted planning permission by Kilkenny County Council until that had been removed.  It is nonsense for the Minister to suggest that this sentence was insignificant and trivial.  This sentence was at the core of granting planning permission to Arcon to carry out its mining activity.  The Minister should admit it and say he and his Department took a keen interest in ensuring that RPS Cairns changed their report to allow the development to take place.  Subsequently, Arcon, with huge financial resources, during the Bord Pleanála hearing were good enough to change their plans to ensure we had a safe mine in north Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>Of course, as the planning permission process goes through from Kilkenny County Council to An Bord Pleanála in terms of submissions and appeals changes will be made to ensure the safety issue is dealt with.  The Deputy is suggesting one of two things, first that RPS Cairns acted unethically <Col N="952" /> by deleting a sentence and in a way that affected the integrity of their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if they did not do so voluntarily they acted unethically; if they did it voluntarily and they stand over it, it stands.  What I am saying is that an interpretation could be put on that sentence, as the Deputy is doing, which would mean it would be impossible to obtain planning permission as a result.  Neither the Deputy nor I decide planning applications.  They are decided by the planning authority, Kilkenny County Council.  Kilkenny County Council made that decision in consultation with the statutory consultees, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and others.  RPS Cairns submitted their report without that sentence so as to ensure there would be no misunderstanding as to their position in terms of the analysis of the report.  If the Deputy does not agree with that he is implying that either Kilkenny County Council or RPS Cairns was wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If this is reduced to a question of why was it altered, will the Minister agree that the report was altered because Kilkenny County Council, as the planning authority, could not grant planning permission while the sentence, which is the subject of this controversy, was in the report?  Therefore, presumably, somebody in Kilkenny County Council made contact with his Department.  Who made that contact?  Whose idea was it to contact RPS Cairns to negotiate the excision of the offending sentence?  Who made the contact with RPS Cairns and at whose request?</P>

      <P>Would it have made more sense and would not the man in the street expect a firm of professional consultants to rewrite the paragraph to which the Minister adverted in the statement, which has not yet arrived? The public cannot have confidence in the planning process if a firm of professional consultants put in a sentence which has such material effect on public safety and are prepared to withdraw it if somebody contacts them by telephone asking them to do so.  How is it at variance with the body of the report?  How should professional consultants reach a conclusion that is at variance with the body of the report?  I have asked a number of questions but it is important that they are clarified.  The Minister said it was not a matter for the planning process to deal with the question of siting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the question in another way.  The way of dealing with the site was to refuse planning permission. If planning permission had been refused then we would have sited the tailings pond elsewhere.  Planning permission would have had to be refused if the sentence had not been deleted, and, therefore, the tailings pond would have been located elsewhere.</P>

In other words, this site is not unsuitable for a tailings pond. The suitability of the site is established by the planners.  The Deputy said the report was altered.

      <P>I was seeking to answer it until I was interrupted by the Deputy's eminent backbencher who is showing an IQ of six.  The position is that the report was voluntarily amended by the consultants and it does not affect the body of the report.  As statutory consultees in the Department we were in a position, through the senior geological officer, to put that to them to avoid misinterpretation when the planning authority was dealing with his submission and a whole range of others.  RPS Cairns had no problem in doing that.  As I understand it RPS Cairns verified that with my Department.  That is the position.  If that is the case why the continuous refusal by Deputy Hogan to withdraw his remark which impugns the integrity of the officials of my Department, for which there is no evidence.  Verification of the true position can be given by RPS Cairns and Kilkenny County Council. The public officials serving this country are entitled to clarification on that point from the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister's Department consider that Kilkenny County Council, as the planning authority, would not be able to reach its own decision on the validity, ambiguity or otherwise, of the relevant sentence without his Department having to contact the consultants to ask them to reconsider it?  By making that request of Cairns, did the Minister and his Department not indicate they lacked confidence in Kilkenny County Council's accountability to make such an assessment without the report being changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> Furthermore, who in the Minister's Department contacted Cairns to ask them to reconsider the report?  Have Cairns been paid for the report by the Minister's Department?  If so, how much?  Will the Minister state categorically that at no stage was he briefed about the transactions with Cairns by his Secretary?  If he was not briefed by his secretary about those matters, in view of their importance in terms of industrial safety, does he consider his Secretary was not doing his job correctly in ensuring that the Minister or the Minister of State was apprised of important matters which could affect the lives of those working in the mine at a future date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that we did not have confidence in Kilkenny County Council to deal with this matter. In matters such as this we are the statutory consultees, we assist in every way possible in ensuring the planning authority has full information so that it can make an informed decision and that discretionary power remains with the planning authority.  Under statute it may consult us on matters such as this.  The level of expertise required in a local authority to deal with a planning application like this necessitates that type of consultation and it is in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to answer the Deputy's questions in sequence.  His next question related to an interpretation that may be put on a sentence.  The sentence required clarification so that Kilkenny County Council would be clear in its understanding of the consultant's report on the issue. Clarification was given and interpretation of the sentence did not pose a problem for the Department.  Neither we nor RPS Cairns believe that the interpretation of the words in the sentence would mean a rejection of a planning permission was imminent if it remained. The departmental official involved in <Col N="958" /> the discussions had the technical and professional expertise to discuss the matter with RPS Cairns consultants who confirmed that the Department's interpretation of the matter was in line with their thinking.  RPS Cairns were asked to amend the report to avoid a different interpretation being put on it and they had no problem in doing so. The report came back and an amended one was submitted.  Cairns can verify that position and there is no question of a breach of the integrity of the planning process in that regard.  The ultimate discretionary power for a decision in respect of the planning permission remained in its proper place, with the planning authority.</P>
      <P>I am regularly briefed by the Secretary and other senior officials in my Department.  I met a team of officials on a number of occasions to discuss this matter.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated this was a public document.  Will he agree that if a finalised report can subsequently be altered it has serious implications for EIS procedure and public confidence?  The public paid for this documentation.  Surely the Department should have left the document as it stood.  If we accept what the Minister <Col N="959" /> said as proper procedure, documentation relating to EIS in the future can be altered after it is finalised.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the odds of the failure of a dam at a tailings pond are low, is the Minister aware that there was a collapse of such a dam connected to a mine in South Africa subsequent to granting this planning permission?  That highlights the serious nature of what we are discussing.  It is unfortunate the Minister is defensive on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This has major implications for planning procedure and the protection of the public good in all planning applications.  Will the Minister comment on the fact that there is a divergence of expert opinion regarding whether the site was an active or an inactive system?  That has caused some concern, particularly because one of the weaknesses in terms of the EIS was that while they referred to alternative sites none was fully explored.  At the time this matter arose, was the Minister or the Secretary of the Department involved in seeking a change from the consultants?  Is the Minister saying that the senior official in his Department took this initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the senior official in my Department is the proper person to do it, that he was the guy who was requested by Kilkenny County Council to obtain a proper assessment of the interpretation to be put on these issues.  We had appointed the consultants.  The consultants were assisting us and Kilkenny County Council. We sought that clarification from RPS Cairns.  RPS Cairns will confirm that they voluntarily amended the sentence, which does not change the thrust of their report.  If one is saying it does, one is saying that they are acting unethically, that they are prepared to change their report on instruction from someone else.  That did not happen.  The main thrust of the report remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> With regard to the other point the Deputy made about a tailings pond this site has been subjected to the most rigorous, proper planning process thus far. At this stage it is up to the Mining Board.  The site has been deemed to be suitable subject to stringent conditions. It is a suitable site as far as the planning authorities are concerned.  It is not for me or any other Member of the House to decide.  It has been decided by the independent planning authority itself.</P>
    <P>In regard to what happened in South Africa.  I would not be familiar with individual circumstances there.  Regarding the planning process in this country, as far as my Department and the officials who work in this area are concerned, the question of safety is of absolute, primary importance.  That consideration remains of primary importance, in this as in every other similar type application submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the person who dealt with this matter and with the RPS Cairns people on this issue, was the competent, proper person to do so.  He acted totally properly, got clarification&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, Kilkenny County Council would have requested that this clarification be sought to ascertain its meaning.  There is nothing untoward about that.  I am saying that the Department are statutory consultees, that Kilkenny County Council has spoken to my Department officials who are competent in this matter in a whole range of areas.  This is a most complex planning application.</P>

      <P>I said earlier that I look forward to hearing Members' contributions to this debate because I know there is a genuine interest among many of them on the subjects raised in this Bill.  It is my intention to listen carefully to what is said and to retain an open mind on any constructive suggestions put forward.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of a wider package of initiatives in this area.  It complements the Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993, currently before the other House, which provides for leave in relation to adoption of children. This Bill will not be the last word on the subject of leave since I am continuing to examine the area of parental leave in the light of the draft EU directive on that subject.  As far as pregnant workers are concerned, this Bill represents real progress, a real improvement of their rights.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction representing, as it does, a further step in establishing women's rights in the workplace and related matters.</P>
      <P>I note in relation the Council Directive dated 28 November 1992 that we were supposed to implement it within a period of two years.  It appears the Minister is eight days late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often we have been worse <i>vis-á-vis</i> the implementation of these directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  Nonetheless we like to get these things right <Col N="1033" /> if we can particularly in circumstances in which it would have meant additional money for a number of women had it been implemented earlier.  While it may be a matter of some small concern to some of us, it will be a matter of more concern to those who will have lost out financially.  However, I welcome it despite its being eight days late.</P>
      <P>I note that in Article 3 of the Council Directive on Guidelines states at paragraph 1:</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Member States and assisted by the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, the Commission shall draw up guidelines on the assessment of the chemical, physical and biological agents and industrial processes considered hazardous for the safety or health of workers within the meaning of Article 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has that work been done?  Have these guidelines been drawn up and, if so, is there any reference to them?  Are they available to us?  Other member states in the European Union have additional reasons to ours for bringing in regulations and legislation of this nature. Because of the low birth rate, falling short of replacement level in many countries, particularly Germany and France, women are being encouraged to have more children.  That has been the case in a number of countries in continental Europe for some time.  Our motives in that regard are purer and more idealistic from the point of view of women's rights.  We have not had the problem of a diminishing birth rate; indeed, it has been to the contrary. However, some figures released the other day suggested that the position is different now, that in the past year or two our birth rate has been below replacement level.  To that extent perhaps we are beginning to conform with the trend in other European countries. I do not know the last time births were below replacement level.  Presumably <Col N="1034" /> we would have to go back a very long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was always a problem from the point of view of participation in the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have happened in the exceptional conditions around the time of the famine.  Apart from that I cannot remember any time when the replacement level was below the death level.  We are, indeed, living in exceptional times.</P>
      <P>I have welcomed this legislation. However, there is disquiet in some sectors, particularly among small employers who are asking if, in view of all the trouble it will cause, all the changes that would have to be made, the expense and the inconvenience caused to them and to other employees, they should employ a woman of childbearing age.  This question has been posed more and more recently. Employers point out that men are more adaptable and more willing to undertake tasks formerly described as women's work, and more and more men are available for this type of work.  Why, therefore, employ women if it can be avoided?  It has also been suggested that women over childbearing age have certain advantages in the workplace.</P>
      <P>In response, such arguments have been used for centuries and certainly since women first came into the workforce in considerable numbers, had this argument been accepted in the past, women would still be confined to the sink and to the bed, no progress would have been made on these matters and the enormous discrimination against women would still be at its height.  I pointed out to one person in particular that if the financial and commercial considerations argued for by him had been conceded, children would still be working in the mines and women and children would still be cleaning our chimneys. To that extent, the argument does not hold water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The Minister will be aware from his own experience that such a case is being made in certain quarters.  That mode of talk is about and increasing in certain quarters and this measure has led to comments of that nature.  This is a worrying development which we cannot ignore.  We should do what we can to counter it as I have in my discussions with people who have made these points to me.</P>
    <P>Other reservations which we have a duty to face up to are being expressed on this and similar legislation although not in the same dogmatic way or in the same context as those to which I have just referred.  There is a fear among employers and employers' organisations that the end result of legislation of this nature will be less competitive industry and services in Ireland and in the European Union generally, in Ireland because it has to catch up with other member states within which such rights have been developed gradually and organically within their industrial relations systems.  We can accept that in a number of other countries there has been that organic development of such rights to a much greater extent than in this country or in Great Britain.  My comments refer not only to countries in other parts of the European Union but to New Zealand where there has been what I described as organic development. IBEC has made this point in a positive and constructive way which is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I have also referred to the encouragement to reproduce for demographic reasons in countries like France, Germany and Sweden.  There is a fear in the European Union, because it was considered to be inward-looking where competition is concerned and was not addressing the issue of the effects of the high social cost on its competitive position within, say, the Pacific Rim and other emerging competitors on the world market.  That ought to be put on the record.</P>
    <P>There are other matters to which I <Col N="1036" /> would like to refer.  I have found a surprising degree of unanimity among both employers and employees I have spoken to, including women, about section 18 of the Bill which deals with leave on health and safety grounds.  I refer specifically to subsection (4) which provides:</P>
    <P>For the first three weeks of leave granted to an employee by an employer under this section in any period of twelve months, the employee shall be entitled to receive from the employer remuneration of an amount determined in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>The objections of employers might be relatively obvious in this context.  The Minister referred to consultation with employers, but I am not aware of the extent.  He might indicate what consultations took place.  In simplistic terms some employers who employ a large number of women in their workforce would consider that provision a serious imposition.  It could mean the difference between making a profit or a loss, staying in or going out of business.  Some women to whom I spoke about this matter, in particular a women's organisation, expressed reservations in respect of the proposed three weeks payment by an employer on the basis that some women will be reluctant to approach their employers for such payment.  Some would find it intimidating to make such a request at a sensitive time in their pregnancy and unmarried pregnant women, in particular, might feel some pressure would be exerted on them.  I note the spokespersons for the other two Opposition parties are women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very perceptive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they might be in a better position than I to express those views.  I am merely reporting what has been said to me by women whose intelligence and sensitivity I respect.  They would prefer responsibility for the payment of the first three weeks to lie with <Col N="1037" /> the State rather than employers.  I look forward to the observations of the Minister and my female colleagues on these benches on that matter.</P>
      <P>Section 14 deals with entitlement to additional maternity leave.  I welcome the provision allowing time off from work without loss of pay for the purpose of ante and postnatal medical visits.  I note the Minister stated that such leave is in addition to that provided in the Council directive of the European Union.  I have not had an opportunity to check that but I take his word on it. Assuming that is the position he is to be congratulated.  From the point of view of women's health that significant advance is welcome.  I understand that some employers may have reservations about it and I wonder what rules and regulations will be laid down regarding the duration of time involved in medical visits.  That matter concerns not only women.  In early all employment problems arise in respect of leave to attend the doctor or the dentist.  If we cast our minds back to our school days we will all recognise the possibilities inherent in such a mission.  Today the queues in the doctor's surgery are longer than they were in the past and the question of duration of such visits may have to be considered. However, my comments do not take from my support for that provision.</P>
      <P>Section 16 deals with the entitlement of an employed father to leave on the death of a mother.  That new provision provides that when a mother dies within 14 weeks of a child's birth the father will be entitled to special leave.  I welcome that without reservation.  I do not know whether it was included in the original regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That provision is particularly welcome in the circumstances of grief experienced by a father when the mother of his child dies and having regard to the new responsibility placed on his shoulders, particularly in the case of a first child.  Some fathers are more adaptable in such circumstances than <Col N="1038" /> others, but I do not believe any father would not find it an onerous responsibility. Everything possible should be done to assist.  That provision is most welcome.</P>
      <P>Section 17 may present some problems for categories of workers where suitable work cannot be found on return to work from maternity leave.  That is why I asked a question about the guidelines in the directive on the chemical, physical and biological agents and industrial processes considered hazardous for the safety or health of workers within the meaning of Article 2.</P>
      <P>In the case of air hostesses two matters must be taken into account.  They will come under the section dealing with employees who work at night.  The conditions under which they work are exceptional in that they may suffer tension, strain and pressures over a comparatively short period of time.  In the case of air hostesses who inform their employers of their pregnancy other matters come into consideration in addition to their health, namely the attitude of some airlines to the appearance of female employees in particular.</P>
      <P>Let us take, for example, the position in Aer Lingus &mdash; my previous remarks were not aimed at Aer Lingus.  If alternative suitable work is not available in that airline &mdash; an air hostess is usually grounded in those circumstances and given appropriate work behind a desk &mdash; an air hostess would have little or no alternative but to go on social security and that seems unfair.  I would ask the Minister to consider the regulations from the point of view of air hostesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some respects there may be discrimination against men.  There are certain conditions from which men, and indeed women, suffer &mdash; for example, epilepsy.  I am thinking of one case where a constituent was told by his doctor that he was fit to work and he should carry on with his normal duties, but the company doctor took a different view and said that he should not be allowed work in the company.  This may be slightly removed from the Bill before us, and I am not comparing epilepsy <Col N="1039" /> with pregnancy, but this is a matter that should be considered although not in the context of this legislation.  Perhaps we should compile a list of &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; where this problem would arise.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on some points in the Minister's script.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he proposes a number of improvements in the protection of pregnant workers which are separate from and additional to the directive and which he believes will be of real benefit.  On the placing of what he describes as particularly important obligations on the employer, will the Minister say what consultations took place?</P>
    <P>This legislation is preferable to amendment of the 1981 Act.  As the Minister said, the value of repealing that Act and re-enacting it by way of this Bill is that it provides, in a single source, for the employment rights of this group of workers, which is very important.  The Bill is complicated and it would add to the complication if there were a number of separate Acts, particularly given the number of EU directives in this area.  I agree that this matter should be dealt with in one Act and this legislation is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the past there may have been confusion as to whether an employment agency or the agency's client availing of the employee's services was the employer for the purposes of meeting maternity protection obligations.  Under section 2 the employer is deemed to be the party who is liable to pay the employee.  I am glad that confusion has been cleared up. I have already referred to the matter of the three days and that is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when referring to sections 21 to 29 which deal with the protection of employment rights, said that this part also deals with the requirement to provide suitable alternative employment to the employee on her return to work where it is not practical for the employer to reassign the worker <Col N="1040" /> to her original job.  I foresee difficulties here, particularly in small firms.  For example, when an employee returns after a period she may find someone else in her job and it would be a matter of possibly sacking that person from the job &mdash; further difficulties would be encountered there &mdash; and replacing him or her with the woman who returned from maternity leave.  Difficulties may arise not only from the point of view of the employer but also the other employees.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this matter further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is legislation of which I entirely approve.  It is a step down the road in the protection of women in their place of employment.  I have put on the record reservations that have been voiced by employers and these should be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill. It is just a few days over the due date for implementation of the directive.  On the anticipatory complaints of employers' representatives, it is important to listen to employers in this matter.  The Bill deals with practical issues of the workforce and it would be folly for us to ignore the problems that may be anticipated by employers' representatives. For a long time Ireland has had one of the lowest participation levels of women in the workforce, but in the last ten years or so this position has improved.  The key reason for low participation of women in the workforce in comparision with other European countries was the low level of participation by married women.  In the early 1970s it was extremely unusual for a married woman to go out to work; only one married woman in 20 had a job.  The position began to change in the 1970s, through the 1980s and the boom years before the figure began to fall again during the years of recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factors which prohibit married women from participating in the work force are the presence of a pre-school child in the family and the lack of adequate childcare facilities.  However, <Col N="1041" /> the changing role of women in society has influenced an increasing number of married women to participate.  We have now reached the stage where almost one third of married women have jobs. There are many reasons for this not least of which is the provision of protection.</P>
    <P>The employer representatives have voiced reservations.  While we should listen to them we have to be cautious and should not allow such concerns prejudice our view or stunt our commitment to implement protective legislation for women.  This is not just a matter which affects the work force, it is a question of women's rights.  If anything is to be said about the furtherance of women's rights it is that nothing happens by chance, that everything has to be put in place.  If we were to wait for evolution, women would still be firmly in the home with no opportunities.</P>
    <P>This is also a question of children's rights.  It is essential that new born children are guaranteed the presence of their mother at home following the birth.  There should be no pressure on women to return to work speedily; they should have adequate time to bond with their children.  This has an impact on the proper functioning of the family.</P>
    <P>This therefore is a broad issue and much has been said by the Minister about the role of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  This legislation has major sociological implications.</P>
    <P>The directive which has been implemented in other member states will make a valuable contribution in helping women play their full role in society, particularly in the work force.  It has to be accepted that children form part of the bounty of life, not just of individual women and families.  Therefore those employers and employees who decide not to have children must give their support for these measures. Everybody should be interested in the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>The directive is entitled Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to <Col N="1042" /> encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breast feeding.  This Bill has three main purposes the first of which is to implement the directive.  It is also proposed to re-enact with amendments the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981 as amended by the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed to make a significant change whereby a male employee will be entitled to take leave in certain cases, for example, when the mother of his child dies.  This is provided for in section 16.  This section should be debated and perhaps amended on Committee Stage.  We should consider allowing a male employee to take leave not only when his wife dies but also when the child dies or his wife is stricken with post natal depression.  This condition affects approximately 14 per cent of Irish women.  It can range from baby blues which is so normal as to be predictable to serious psychosis which can render a woman incapable of looking after her own child.  In such circumstances the father should be allowed to take leave to care for the child.  To my knowledge this has happened on a number of occasions and there was no provision in legislation to allow the father take leave to assume the role of the mother who in some cases may be confined to an institution for a period of up to six months. I welcome this section.  While it is compassionate there is room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>Article 14 of the directive adopted by the Council on 14 October 1992, specifies that it should be implemented within two years.  It deals extensively with the rights of pregnant workers and largely focuses on health and safety issues affecting pregnant workers.  The principal change is that where a pregnant worker or a worker who has recently given birth or is breast feeding is exposed to a health risk at work and the employer cannot provide suitable alternative employment she will be given leave which will come to an end <Col N="1043" /> when the employee no longer needs to take leave or when the employer takes measures to remove the risk.  While this is necessary it can only be applied in circumstances where the employer is required by regulation under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 to move a pregnant worker to other work.  I note that these regulations have not yet been made.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position as this part of the Bill will have no effect until this is done.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the directive impose stringent obligations on employers to assess the risks to the safety and health of pregnant workers or workers who have recently given birth or are breast feeding.  It is easy to introduce such regulations and imagine that all employers are the same but such stringent requirements might present difficulties for small employers employing between one and three employees in taking on the responsibilities inherent in this legislation.  There is much red tape involved in the normal employment process.  It is important to simplify the system to ensure that it will not be too much trouble for an employer to take on a woman of childbearing years.</P>
    <P>Parts IV and V of the Bill re-enact the Acts of 1981 and 1991 with minor changes.  The directive lays down a minimum period of maternity leave of 14 weeks.  That is already the position here.  There has been some talk about the introduction of paternity leave.  I am aware this is still being discussed but my view, for what it is worth, is that it would be better to increase maternity leave and introduce flexibility to allow fathers to take leave during the year, for example, when a child is sick rather than introduce paternity leave on a statutory basis.  Maternity leave of 14 weeks is inadequate as by the end of the 14 week period many women are not ready to return to work.  I hear that sentiment voiced right across the board by women at senior professional and lower levels in the workforce.  Fourteen weeks is a very short time to spend with a new <Col N="1044" /> baby.  It usually takes women about seven or eight weeks to recover their mental &mdash; not to mention bodily &mdash; functions after the birth of a child.  I think we should consider the possibility of extending the optional four week period, even if it is unpaid leave, to provide flexibility for those women who want to go back to their jobs but need extra time with their child.  All women are different, some may experience postnatal depression but that is only one of the problems that might arise, a child may be in poor in health or different circumstances might arise.  There should be more flexibility and a sympathetic approach to women who seek to extend the statutory period of leave.</P>
    <P>Most of this legislation and the original maternity protection of employees legislation is confined to women with contracts of employment.  However, many working women do not have employment contracts, for example, the self-employed, proprietary partners in firms of solicitors and so on.  I raised this issue with the Minister when we debated the Solicitors Bill.  Approximately half those who qualify as solicitors and barristers are women and when they arrive at the stage of being proprietary partnerships and no longer employees they have to negotiate maternity leave arrangements with their peers.  Often this is a difficult situation because they do not know how other women have negotiated and they are usually very vulnerable.  Most proprietary partners in firms of solicitors are men and very few women break through that glass ceiling but when they do, they have to negotiate their maternity leave.  In England there are so many female solicitors they have formed a group within the Law Society and have managed to persuade it to recommend draft guidelines for inclusion in partnership deeds so that there is at least a standard maternity clause.  This has not happened in Ireland and the Law Society is very reluctant to take it on board.  A clock is ticking in regard to the participation of women at the higher echelons of the legal profession in <Col N="1045" /> Ireland and sooner or later the issue will have to be addressed.  Women do not have any strict legal entitlement to maternity leave if they are not employed on a contract of employment. That area needs to be thought about.  I realise there is a directive relating to the maternity rights of self-employed women and I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>In Germany, a nurse who worked as a night attendant in a home for the elderly had a contract for an indefinite period but when she became pregnant her employer terminated the contract because of a provision in German law which prohibits pregnant German women from working at night.  The case was heard initially by a German court and in 1994 it referred a number of questions to the European Court under Article 177 asking in particular whether the termination of the contract in the circumstances outlined above was compatible with Directive 76/207EEC, implemented in Ireland by the Employment Equality Act, 1977, on the principle of equal treatment for men and women.  The court first established that the termination of the contract was based on the employee's pregnancy and, therefore, constituted direct discrimination on the grounds of sex.  The net effect of the case is that where statutory restrictions prevent or restrict a pregnant woman from performing particular tasks in the course of her employment, they will not justify an employer dismissing a pregnant employee.  This seems logical as otherwise an employer could circumvent protective legislation simply by dismissing the employee. Other cases were reported recently on the law relating to pregnant workers &mdash; I have a note of two &mdash; and the judgments mean that any unfavourable treatment of a pregnant woman either directly on the basis of her pregnancy or indirectly on the basis of the consequences flowing from her pregnancy, regardless of whether they have their origin in statute, will be considered direct discrimination by the court and contrary to Directive 76/207.  There is <Col N="1046" /> no doubt that the court will champion this legislation.  It may be difficult for employers to swallow when they anticipate the obligations inherent in the legislation but in Europe at any rate the legislation will be championed by the European Court.</P>
    <P>In England new regulations have come into force for the protection of pregnant women and they prohibit women employees from being required or allowed to work in the two week period immediately following childbirth. Many women in Ireland are tempted to work as late as possible up to the time of confinement to have a longer period at home after the birth and I understand that doctors are facilitating their patients and certifying that the baby is due two weeks later than expected.  This means that women are working almost right up to the time of birth which highlights the point I made earlier that women value the time after birth and want to have more time with their baby. The reason is obvious because it is a precious time of bonding with and breast feeding the baby.  It would be very helpful if the Minister would address this temptation to work quite late ending up with the woman almost going straight from the office to the hospital.  That is undesirable from the point of view of their own health but the only reason they do it, and their doctors facilitate them, is that they want to have a longer period at home after the birth.</P>
    <P>The Department of Employment in Britain has advised me that the Maternity Compulsory Leave Regulations, 1994, apply to all women who qualify for statutory maternity leave under the new rights introduced in an Act of 1993.  These regulations prohibit women from working and their employers from permitting them to work during the two weeks immediately following the birth of a child.  Obviously it is desirable that women do not go back to work too early, regardless of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  One of the features of such legislation is that it can only be assessed in practice.  The spirit <Col N="1047" /> of the Bill is firmly in the right place and it is another step in helping women to participate more fully in the workplace. It is compassionate towards women.  It is certainly recommended in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women to which this Government is committed.</P>
    <P>There has been much bleating generally that if we provide such social protections, Europe will become uncompetitive. I can see some point in that argument given the high rates of unemployment in Ireland and in Europe.  The fear is that if we provide social protection and high levels of welfare, we will not improve the competitiveness of Ireland in the context of Europe.  It is important to go back to basics, however, and realise that strong social policy objectives are justified and necessary to enhance the role of women in our society.  As Deputy Currie said, if that advice had not been taken many years ago, the black community in America would still be shining shoes.  Strong protective legislation, which encourages the participation of women in work and which also discourages discrimination, is justified.</P>
    <P>I understand that during the negotiations on the enlargement of the European Union to include the Nordic countries of Scandinavia, Swedish women were very concerned that on entering the European Union they would lose many of their excellent maternity and childcare entitlements.  They had to be reassured by the negotiators in Brussels that their entitlements would not be affected.  While we feel that protection for women in the workplace is a high priority in Europe, women in Sweden were concerned they would lose their privileged legislative conditions for working.</P>
    <P>We will have the opportunity to go through the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  It is a practical Bill and I welcome the fact that the Minister is co-operating with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment because it is in the workplace that the practical <Col N="1048" /> implementation of this legislation will be tested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is disappointing. It is minimalist in its objectives and pedestrian in its approach.  The case for family leave arrangements for workers is well proven &mdash; they contribute towards the reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities as well as other social and economic policy objectives, including equal opportunities, the health and well-being of children and parents, the well-being of families, improved economic performance and reducing unemployment.</P>
      <P>The European Commission Network on Childcare, in its review of leave arrangements for workers with children, concludes that because leave arrangements are of such basic importance to reconciling employment and family responsibilities, a basic entitlement to the four types of leave needs to be guaranteed to all workers by law.  This entitlement should be paid and flexible to include at least 16 weeks post natal maternity leave, two weeks paternity leave, 12 months parental leave and ten days leave for family reasons per child per year.</P>
      <P>I am a realist and I accept that provision may be the optimum and is unlikely to be reached in the short term but it is clear that this Bill falls far short of fulfilling that brief.  It is not only too little, but, as Deputy O'Donnell said, it is late.  To comply with the European Directive the Bill should never been enacted before now.</P>
      <P>In 1981 we were the last country in the EU to enact maternity leave legislation. Yet again, Ireland is at the bottom of the league, scraping through at the last minute with minor legislation to comply with a directive rather than looking seriously and imaginatively at the changes taking place both at work and in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the Bill it is difficult to justify the claim that we are good Europeans. Nor is it compatible with the concept that we, as a nation, are pro-family. Maternity leave is still pegged at the <Col N="1049" /> minimum requirement which has been in force for many years.  Since this is the Year of the Family it would have been appropriate to acknowledge that mothers and children benefit from more extended time together.</P>
    <P>It is also hard to reconcile the fact that the father's role is not taken into account.  A Minister for equality is surely expected to introduce the concept of equality into a Bill which will shape the family roles of men and women.  In 1992 the Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation on child care.  Article 6, which was agreed by member states, including Ireland, states:</P>
    <P>It is recommended that member states should promote and encourage, with due respect for freedom of the individual, increased participation by men (in the care and upbringing of children) in order to achieve a more equal sharing of parental responsibilities between men and women. </P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity to being to act on this commitment but he chose not to.  There is no provision for paternity leave except in one instance. Is there not something macabre about the fact that a father can only get leave to mind his child when the mother of his child has died within fourteen weeks of delivery?</P>
    <P>Recently, a European workshop was held in Dublin on the subject of families, labour markets and gender roles.  It was, ironically, opened by the Minister, Deputy Taylor, he said:</P>
    <P>Demographic change faces Ireland as it faces most other countries in Europe.  The latest statistics on childbirth here show that we now have one of the lowest birth rates in Europe. This represents a dramatic change from a position where traditionally Ireland had one of the highest birth rates in Europe, and in fact one of the highest in the world.  I firmly believe that the change in the birth rate will itself have major implications for the future of the Irish labour force and <Col N="1050" /> will necessitate the more rapid overhaul of outdated employment practices and social structures.  Such changes will undoubtedly have their effect on the realities of life, particularly for women in Irish society and may very well change their roles fundamentally.</P>
    <P>Fine words, however, do not contribute to a rapid overhaul.  In the Bill I could not find any indication of the promise offered by the Minister's words.  It is a paltry document that largely reinforces the status quo.  The Minister will no doubt state that parental leave is a separate issue to be tackled in the future, but the reality is that unless there is an integrated and flexible approach towards leave arrangements he is simply reinforcing inequality.</P>
    <P>At the same workshop where the Minister spoke so glowingly about the future, the background paper, prepared by Drew, Mahon and Emerek, stated unequivocally</P>
    <P>The provision of parental leave &mdash; usually taken to mean parental leave in addition to maternal leave &mdash; is one sign that an organisation recognises paternal family obligations.  If used by men and women, it could be seen as a new way of combining family and working life.  The provision of maternal leave, while a significant gain in EU states, only reifies existing gendered divisions in the labour market unless it is accompanied by paternal leave.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Bill, is solidifying existing gender divisions when he should have lived up to his office.  As a Minister for Equality he should and could have adopted that recommended integrated approach.  There is no need to wait for some future directive to set the pace for reform in Ireland.  The directive on parental leave will not arise again for consideration for at least a year.</P>
    <P>In the past the Government enacted legislation relating to part-time workers without waiting for a directive to lead <Col N="1051" /> the way.  The initiative was taken because it was right, not because it was imposed.  It hardly justifies a Minister for equality if, in this most basic area of family life, we are simply being dragged along in the wake of European reform.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was also lost to extend maternity leave, which is what many people want.  Even if the unpaid, optional leave were extended it would have signalled improvement.  People who could afford to avail of this extension would have benefited.  People take leave for family reasons on an unplanned basis which can disrupt workplace patterns.  If leave were regularised and extended, employers could benefit in being able to replace workers temporarily.  This would serve to spread work around and give unemployed people, particularly women, a chance to work.  If work is not to be the sole province of the better-off then the opportunity for job-sharing and part-time work must be developed for parents.</P>
    <P>The European Pregnancy Directive provides that workers taking leave must receive payment at least equivalent to disability payment.  This directive was put forward as a health and safety measure.  It is worth noting that one of Deputy McCreevy's &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; was to slash the minimum rate of maternity benefit from £69 to £60 per week, a reduction which affected many women on low incomes.  Our record of providing for pregnant women workers is not a proud one.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned if the health and safety provisions of the Bill which I welcome, might lead to discrimination against women workers of child bearing age being taken into the workforce. Inevitably the response by employers to social reforms has been to resist change. The almost hysterical response of IBEC to the extension of workers' rights regarding part-time work and parental leave is a case in point.  The Minister must ensure that women do not lose out as a result of any backlash.  Three weeks pay is a small price for employers to pay for the safety of their workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> IBEC might look at the example of other modern European states which have not only implemented legal entitlements for parental leave but have also developed collective or company agreements which are making a significant contribution.  In Germany 14 per cent of private companies covered in a 1991 survey had agreements offering employees a longer period of parental leave.  Some agreements offer opportunities for part-time employment after the end of parental leave.  In Denmark 95 per cent of those in the private sector have the right to take paid leave on the first day of a child's illness and all workers in the public sector are entitled to the same facility.  Other countries make arrangements which vary from the most comprehensive in Sweden to more individual and modest arrangements within companies.</P>
    <P>This morning we debated the terms of the Treaty providing for the accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden to the EU.  Three of these countries provide for parental leave.  In 1991, 45 per cent of fathers in Finland took parental leave which shows the take-up where such leave is provided.  In Sweden, almost all mothers took paid parental leave and, in 1990 86 per cent of fathers in Sweden took two weeks paternity leave.  There is also a very generous system of leave in case of illness among children or their normal carers. From the private employers' point of view, it is interesting to note that large companies may be better able to replace workers on leave from their own resources or to establish dynamic arrangements but the longer and more predictable the leave, the more likely it is that a substitute employee will be employed.</P>
    <P>What is striking about Sweden, which has a long established and extensive system of parental leave, is how little difficulty it seems to cause most employers. A report produced by Rapoport &amp; Moss in 1990 pointed out:</P>
    <P>...statutory parental leave in Sweden does not seem to present any</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> major problems to employers. Experience has shown that parental leave is workable and that what employers think is impossible is not impossible.  Initial worries went as it became apparent there were no really big problems.  In general, implementation is facilitated because parental leave is predictable and employers get advance notice of an employee taking it.  It only affects a small part of the workforce at any one time.</P>
    <P>That is an important point.  A declining number of people will be affected by the need for parental leave.  Fewer Irish people are getting married and fewer are having babies.  The rate has dropped below replacement level again and now stands at 1.93, the lowest total fertility rate ever recorded.  It has been highlighted in the media that the number of non-marital births has risen to almost 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Poverty is very much a feature of the lives of many lone parents and the opportunity to work is the best chance that many have to extract themselves from the poverty trap.  But a lone parent has a double responsibility to carry &mdash; if they hold down a job then the provision of adequate maternity leave would ensure that responsibility is met in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>Social change has led to a drop in the birth rate, a decrease in family size, an increase in non-marital births, a decrease in marriage rates, an increase in marital separation and divorce, a rise in the participation of mothers in the labour force, an increase in lone parent families, a rise in cohabitation and a growing acceptance of independence between sexuality and procreation.</P>
    <P>These are all features of modern life in Europe and we are affected by those trends.  They reflect the process of modernisation of the family and are tied in with the process of social change.  It is lamentable that this Bill fails to acknowledge the major social changes that have, and will continue to take place in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The most interesting trend which is <Col N="1054" /> emerging indicates the importance of providing a family-friendly work environment. In the Nordic countries where parental leave and accommodation of families is made by employers and by the State and where employment is still relatively high the birth rate has begun to increase.  It is in the southern countries and in Ireland &mdash; countries experiencing high unemployment with workplaces which are generally inimical to the family &mdash; that the birthrate is dropping.</P>
    <P>In the long term, the implications of a very low fertility rate are serious.  We must ensure that there is a healthy birthrate.  The best way to do this, as experience in the more developed European countries shows, is to ensure good supports for families, the provision of parental leave, the facility for parents to move in and out of the workforce without losing out and the establishment of the principle of equality between parents. Many of us are concerned about employment for young people but they grow old and we must look at the implications of a low birth rate and its effect on society.</P>
    <P>Much of the Bill is a repeat of earlier legislation.  A number of problems relating to written notification were experienced in the past.  I have no argument with the procedures but the Minister must ensure that workers and employers are fully informed about them so that deadlines are not missed as happened in the past.  Will the provisions governed by regulations and in the Social Welfare Act be retained?  I refer in particular to the provision for mothers of stillborn babies.</P>
    <P>Section 10 states that at least four weeks must be taken before and after the birth of the baby.  I wonder in these days of generally healthy mothers and safe pregnancies whether this stipulation is not too rigid.  Most mothers prefer to take their leave after the baby is born and are able to work until a few days before delivery.  Surely we should leave it to mothers to make that decision rather than impose it on them.</P>
    <P>Section 17 outlines the arrangements <Col N="1055" /> relating to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, a change which is welcome. However, after the first three weeks it is dependent on provision being made by the Minister for Social Welfare and I would like to know that there will be no short fall between the enactment of this Bill and provision being made by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The provision for appeals to be heard is largely satisfactory although it is important to ensure that there is no delay in hearing them.  Since we are dealing with pregnancy, any appeal on a claim for maternity leave or leave on health and safety grounds cannot be long drawn out, for obvious reasons.  I am not aware that this caused any problems in the past but since employers, for the first time, will be liable for three weeks payment in certain instances more claims may be taken under this Bill than under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.</P>
    <P>My party will support this Bill, but we have no illusions about its meagre provisions. Across Europe there is a demand for well-educated people in the labour force and a need for stable families to ensure the growth of the next generation. Other European countries have developed flexible and generous leave arrangements based on the principle of equality.  They recognise that the State can encourage men to adopt a greater share of caring and domestic work. They recognise that women have adapted to the opportunities afforded them by expanding opportunities while still maintaining their domestic and family roles as carers.  Generally, and particularly in Ireland, men have not done so.  How to ensure that happens is a fundamental issue of equality.  The Minister failed to face up to this challenge. It is its greatest disappointment and the Bill's greatest failing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I wish first to comment on some of the points made by Deputies O'Donnell and McManus.  Deputy O'Donnell <Col N="1056" /> referred to the position of self-employed women and what might be termed &ldquo;proprietary partnerships&rdquo; in small businesses where one partner is male and the other is female.  Difficulties may arise in such cases, particularly between partners in the legal profession, and I ask the Minister in his reply to outline how the legislation deals with the self-employed.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at Deputy McManus's description of the legislation as minimalist.  This Bill builds on the 1981 and 1991 legislation on part-time workers and maternity leave.  For example, section 28, which deals with notification of return to work, is additional to the provisions in the directive. Under the previous legislation if the rigid provisions on notification of return to work, the four-week period and the two-week period, were not satisfied workers had no protection.  I welcome the important new developments in this area.  Under section 50 scope is provided for the payment of medical cheques outside the provisions of the directive.</P>
      <P>The Minister has strongly supported the introduction of paternity leave.  I have no doubt that paternity leave would have been dealt with in a European directive were it not for the opposition of Britain.  The other 11 member states have strongly supported such a directive and I hope it will be introduced in the near future.</P>
      <P>This important legislation will implement in Ireland the European directive on pregnant workers.  The Commission on the Status of Women has recommended the introduction of such legislation, which fits in very well with the rights of the family under the Constitution.  Reference is made in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the need to put support mechanisms in place to ensure that the family is a stable and vibrant unit of society. This is gradually being done by the Minister and this legislation is an essential element in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill builds on the 1981 legislation <Col N="1057" /> which provides for 14 weeks paid maternity leave and an additional four week's unpaid leave.  Under the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, these provisions were extended to part-time workers. These are essential elements of the protection given to pregnant women and mothers.  Very substantial rights are being conferred on employees who are pregnant, who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding.  Women who have to leave the work place when they become pregnant will be given support mechanisms to ensure that they are fully recovered by the time they return to work.  Theoretically, a pregnant women could be given paid leave, depending on her medical condition, for the duration of her pregnancy and up to 26 weeks after the birth of her child, approximately 15 months.  Obviously a women availing of this option would have to meet the conditions specified in the regulations.  This is a substantial improvement on the previous legislation which provided for 14 weeks maternity leave and four weeks' unpaid leave.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 a father will be entitled to leave if the mother has died within 14 weeks of the birth of the child. This is a logical and rational provision. It is the only type of paternity leave available to fathers.  The European Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, has submitted draft proposals on paternity leave to the Commission and the only reason they have not been dealt with in a directive is that the British Government is refusing to countenance them and is dragging its feet on this issue.  The Minister has strongly supported these proposals on behalf of the Government.  I welcome this improvement in the legislation which answers Deputy McManus's unjustified complaint that no concern has been shown for the rights of fathers. The Government has indicated its support for legislation on paternity leave. Under the terms of the Maastrict Treaty the Commissioner can submit proposals <Col N="1058" /> on paternity leave without the agreement of Britain.  I look forward to the introduction of legislation on that subject.</P>
    <P>Leave for adoptive parents is covered in the Bill being debated in the Seanad. The Bill will extend further protection to mothers following the adoption of a child in that maternity leave of ten paid weeks and four unpaid weeks will be granted.  That is a substantial development. This area of the law is building up, step by step, towards further protections for the family.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to section 28 which deals with notification of intention to return to work after maternity leave, something which was prescribed rigidly in the 1981 legislation.  Obviously a small number of women will opt not to return to work.  It appears that the legislation has penalised the others by requiring everybody who intends to return to work to notify the employer of their intention four weeks in advance and to confirm it two weeks before the date of return.  That is a very rigid requirement and failure to comply deprives the worker who has taken maternity leave of the protection of the 1981 legislation.  I am pleased the Minister has availed of the opportunity to relax that rigidity so that the two weeks notification is no longer required and if notice is not given in extenuating circumstances arguments could be put to the rights commissioner or the employment tribunal.  Clearly the position has been improved.  I have always regarded that rigidity as totally unnecessary and it took from some of the better aspects of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 extends protection to mothers who have returned to work after pregnancy, child birth and maternity leave.  The mother is entitled to further paid leave from work for the purposes of medical care and check ups. That is a very favourable development which has to be decided by regulation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important in terms of its impact in the workplace.  It gives stability to the family and conforms to <Col N="1059" /> constitutional requirements.  The workplace has been negative, hostile and cold towards women, particularly married women.  We have come a long way from when women had to surrender their jobs once they became pregnant. We are now assisting, facilitating and encouraging women to come to the workplace.</P>
    <P>I will put in the context of our economy. Our economy is becoming unique in the western world in that the economy is growing but few extra jobs are being created so that employers can cherrypick workers.  It is extremely important that we have legislation to protect the employee.  Legislation to protect the rights of the full time employee and on a <i>pro rata</i> basis the rights of the part time employee is equally important in curbing the growing lack of concern for full time workers granting them the rights to which they are entitiled.  That is one side of the coin.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that this legislation, contrary to what IBEC appears to think, will benefit the workplace. In the first instance it will ensure that there will be healthy women in the workplace.  So long as there is the opportunity for adequate parental and maternity leave and adequate check ups subsequently, the women who return to the work place will be healthy and that is better in terms of productivity for the employer.</P>
    <P>It will help to ensure that employers begin to look at their workers as people rather than as a unit of labour.  We have not made sufficient progress in providing creche facilities in the workplace. Once the legislation provides for greater flexibility, female workers will have more time with their new born children and it will be possible to provide facilities so that the newborn child can be close to the mother in the workplace. The provision of creche facilities will be a welcome development in fostering the concept of family life.  Women are constrained by the fact that they give birth and by and large the workplace has not <Col N="1060" /> been geared to take that into consideration. Now that there are greater statutory rights for women in the workforce, employers will begin to change their attitudes to women and work.  This type of legislation will improve the context in which work is done and that will have advantages for the employer as well as for employees because it will do away with much of the rigidity and the single sex type workplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a further support for women in the workplace and in the home.  I expect the Government to build on this legislation, a commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  An earnest of that commitment is that we have appointed a Minister for Equality and Law Reform, a Ministry which, to my knowledge, does not exist in any of the other European States.  I wholeheartedly welcome the legislation and applaud the Minister for introducing and extending it to the areas not covered by the directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If more women had been at the Council of Ministers' meeting when the European Union debated this directive in Brussels, its provisions relating to women would have been much more generous.  Eleven men and one women debated this directive in Europe and when it was passed in 1992 it was far from clear whether Ireland would support it.</P>
      <P>I followed the developments of the directive at European level and I was very concerned that the Government was not up front in its approach, it hid behind the UK's approach.  I am delighted the directive was passed, but it is not surprising that Swedish women are concerned about joining the European Union.  They fear their welfare rights, particularly those concerning maternity and paternity leave and child care, may be diminished.  It is also not surprising Swedish women may determine its vote on accession to the European Union when we see its proposals in terms of maternity leave provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard differing views from <Col N="1061" /> Members tonight.  While Deputy McManus said the directive did not go far enough, Deputy Costello said the Minister was building on existing provision and that improvements had been made.  Both Members are correct.  There is no doubt that this directive and its implementation in Irish law does not go far enough, but the Minister has gone beyond its provisions in some cases and that is welcome.  Irish women will welcome the improvements resulting in time off for ante and post natal care.  It is extraordinary that we are only now addressing this issue.  Up to now women have had to make excuses and take official holiday leave to keep maternity appointments.</P>
    <P>If we are serious as a civilised society about equal opportunities, the issue of maternity leave and children is critical. That is one of the matters addressed in the Bill.  It is regrettable that maternity leave remains at 14 weeks, it is not enough.  Compared with other European, Nordic and OECD countries we fare badly in terms of leave entitlements for women after they give birth.  We are not a child or woman centred society and we have a long way to go before providing leave entitlements that will give women proper equal opportunities. Our record in supporting the family is poor.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that a number of comments were made about the concerns of employers in this regard which also received much attention in the press. The other side of the coin is that happy workers are productive workers and this is evident in Germany, a regulated economy with high productivity rates. We must adopt a different approach and ascertain what will increase productivity in the workplace.  Employees who are well cared for and whose medical and health needs are appropriately met will give a good return to employers.  We should be highlighting that aspect this evening.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses the issue of paternity rights, particularly on the sad occasion of the death of the mother. This is a start but, again, it is not <Col N="1062" /> enough.  I welcome the Minister's support for the development of paternity rights.  With changing family structures, changing approaches to the involvement of men and women in the workforce and a greater understanding of children's needs and those of their mothers and fathers, our laws relating to the role of fathers must be more sensitive than in the past.  We have been very slow to change in that regard.</P>
    <P>Our birth rate is plummeting and, at 1.93 children per couple, is the second lowest in Europe and below the population replacement level of 2.1.  The fall in the fertility rate has been so rapid and dramatic that it has not yet impinged on the minds of policy makers. Because of the changed pattern in women's economic and social roles the tendency to have small families is not likely to be a flash in the pan and this must be considered if the problems associated with an ageing population are to be avoided in the future.  It is interesting that, faced with this trend, other European countries adopted pro-natal policies, including more generous maternity and parental leave and improved child care provisions, and in France and Sweden the fertility rate has increased.  Because of our high unemployment rate, people tend to avoid discussion on such measures.  Despite the progress we have made in terms of equal opportunities there is still resistance to the full integration of women in the workforce and it comes to light when we talk about provisions such as those contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable the Bill does not go further.  I urge the Minister to create a climate for further detailed and reasoned discussion on extending the provisions of the Bill.  In view of the changing economic position, work patterns, family size and the changing roles of men and women, we must discuss in a more rational manner the issues addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The health and safety measures, especially those relating to breast feeding and the fact that an employer will have to provide a woman who has given <Col N="1063" /> birth with alternative work if the work carried out by her before the birth might endanger her health, will also be welcomed by women.  Will the Minister explain more fully the provisions relating to breast feeding?  Although women will tune in quickly to the provisions of the Bill, when discussing further legal rights for women it is important that employers and women are informed.</P>
    <P>I should like to broaden the scope of the debate somewhat and refer to our general support services for women and children in respect of which we have a very poor record.  Indeed, the reactions in the press to the possibility of paternity leave were very interesting. The suggestion was ridiculed and many of what I would consider to be over the top articles were published.</P>
    <P>On income support of families, at a recent conference organised by the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, in Dublin Castle, some research was presented on how much we support the family.  We were described as the laggards of Europe.  It is very clear that we have a long way to go to being financially supportive of families.  For example, we lag far behind the Nordic countries. Indeed, if their referenda go ahead it will be interesting to ascertain what will be the impact in this area of their joining the European Union.  Will they sensitise us into being more supportive of families?  Babies grow up, become pre-school children, under-fives, undersevens and go on to primary school.  The whole issue of day care provision, of providing a whole range of very supportive options for men and women in relation to their children needs to be developed.  We have the worst record in Europe in the public provision of day care facilities for children.  While the Minister is not addressing that issue in this Bill nonetheless it is linked to the type of maternity protection we provide, being part of the same continuum, and clearly we need to take enormous steps.  Perhaps we are worried that, in supporting the family in this way, or in <Col N="1064" /> providing a range of day care alternatives, somehow we are undermining the family rather than supporting it.  We support the family in such endeavour.</P>
    <P>It is possible to make mistakes in the type of care we provide for children. Recently I heard a person from Denmark speak about the range of crèches they have for their children. They are now reassessing what they have done, feeling that they have, perhaps, institutionalised their care of children a little too much, which is a great danger.  They are endeavouring to give men and women greater choice, particularly when their children are aged under three, in order to create a society in which parents and families can spend more time with very young children rather than feel they must return to work immediately and avail of these crèches during the very early pre-school years.  We are ideally placed to develop services which would better match our needs and respect our traditions in terms of caring for children while at the same time affording men and women the choices they want.</P>
    <P>The question of co-ordination between Government Departments to make them more child-centred warrants urgent attention.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is afforded an opportunity to examine this matter and, hopefully, will take some action in this area.  In this respect the demarcation lines between the Departments of Health, Education, Equality and Law Reform and Justice as far as our children are concerned are not helpful. There is a need for greater co-ordination and flexibility between Government Departments if we are to meet the needs of very young children and of families generally.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of the occupational safety and health and social welfare measures.  When will they be presented to the House?  Let us hope it will be in the near future.  It is important that all elements to which the Minister referred are implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The Minister said that a careful balancing of rights and of obligations is maintained in this Bill and that employers will continue to be entitled to adequate notification.  Will the Minister look at that again to determine whether it is somewhat over-stringent.  I look forward to some further discussion on that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has consolidated this legislation in this Bill which is very important.  I regret that the Bill does not go further which, undoubtedly, tells us something about our attitude to these issues.  For example, it tells us the kind of economic constraint placed on the provision of the services and support we ought provide for pregnant women.  If we are serious about women's involvement and participation in the workforce we shall be returning to this issue in the not too distant future.  We shall need to re-examine this area, to reassess and, perhaps, develop the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The tide of change sweeping through Europe in terms of women working, combining work and family responsibilities and related issues will have to be addressed here in a broader way.  We have the lowest participation rate in the European Union of mothers with dependent children but that pattern is rapidly changing.  For example, in 1985, 18 per cent only of such mothers were in employment whereas, by 1991, the relevant figure stood at 38 per cent.  The figures suggest that the younger the child the more likely it is that the mother will be employed.  This implies there will be a steady, continuing increase in the number of mothers, with children, in the workforce.  Our figures may rise to the European Union average currently at 58 per cent and increasing, which will mean there will be a steady growth in demand for the services I have outlined in addition to a greater demand for better maternity protection and better legislation in this area.  Great participation by women in the workforce means that new approaches and services are needed, that facilities such as child care, now <Col N="1066" /> often available and undertaken on a voluntary basis, increasingly will be undertaken on a paid basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister should continue to ensure, in whatever way he can, that we have a wide-ranging debate on these issues, that employers' concerns are responded to and that some of the other needs to which I referred are clearly spelled out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the provisions of this Bill provide greater flexibility generally.  There has been reference to the fact that this Bill represents another progressive measure initiated or dictated at European level.  It is important to recognise and acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>In the 1970s I worked in the personnel section of Blanchardstown Hospital. Since we joined the European Community, the advances made for people, especially women, in the workplace have been astronomical.  The Bill represents another step in that direction, providing for the implementation of the employment rights contained in the 1992 European Union Directive on pregnant workers.</P>
      <P>However, we need to examine maternity provisions in particular. Today 50 per cent of our population are economically active, 12 per cent in fulltime education and a quarter engaged in what official speak describes as home duties, that is duties undertaken by those working in the home.  It is interesting to look at the participation of males and females in the workplace. Here it is quite different &mdash; 66 per cent of males are active in the work place and 34 per cent of females.  Five per cent of males and 47 per cent of females are active in the home.  This Bill is primarily directed at 35 per cent of the workforce who are female.  Although a section of the Bill does refer to paternity leave, it is basically a Bill for this 35 per cent of the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue addressed by the Commission on the Status of Women but not in the Bill is the rate payable for maternity benefit.  It is payable for a <Col N="1067" /> continuous period of 14 weeks and, of those 14 weeks, a woman must take at least four weeks before the baby is due. The weekly rate is 70 per cent of the woman's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year, subject to minimum and maximum amounts.  It is the maximum amount that I would like to refer to in that I understand it is based on earnings of £11,500.  If a woman earns any more than that she still gets 70 per cent of that figure.  That maximum rate needs to be increased as women progress in the workplace.  If a woman's earnings are £20,000 per annum, 70 per cent of £11,500 is quite a drop, especially if she has a mortgage.  I would like to see that addressed, as recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 11 and 12 which allow for flexibility in regard to the four week periods before and after the birth of a baby because these areas of life do not work to the clock.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where a risk to health and safety exists and no other suitable work is available for an employee who is pregnant, breast feeding or who has recently given birth such leave will apply and will also apply in the case where it is medically certified that a female employee must not be required to perform night work when no day work is available.  I am particularly interested in that because I followed a case closely last year where a woman who worked in a shop lost her job because she was pregnant.  In 1992 she had a miscarriage and in 1993 she became pregnant.  The doctor was concerned because of the initial pregnancy which had resulted in a miscarriage and advised her to take a month's leave from work.  She did so and then the doctor said she could go back to work in the shop but that she was not to use a vacuum cleaner, reach up high or pull at the security shutters.  They were simple instructions which did not involve the selling of merchandise.  However, the employer said that unless she could perform all those duties she had no <Col N="1068" /> business coming back to work.  She then negotiated to go back after the birth of the child, whereupon the employer sent out her tax forms.  That woman's child was born in April 1994 and she now has no job.  Without a shadow of doubt she lost a job because she was unable to do duties which were not necessarily hers. She was quite willing to sell merchandise over the counter.  Her case was brought to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the result is due within the next couple of weeks.  What particularly concerns me about this case is that this woman had been working for that employer for 14 years and had never in that time been out sick.  It is directly as a result of being pregnant that she has no job, having given 14 years of good service.  The principle of leave on health and safety grounds needs to be stressed. Although we need to be concerned about employers, we must be concerned about the protection of employees in the workplace, their rights on health and safety grounds and their right to return to work after pregnancy.  I am glad those rights are strengthened in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to monitor this area in view of the example I gave.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to the granting of time off work for ante and postnatal medical visists without any loss of earnings is very important.  It is particularly important to people who are on a low income for whom it may be economically impossible to take days off without pay.  It is important that they attend ante and postnatal sessions.  This provision brings the legislation onto a more progressive level.</P>
    <P>I would like to see much of the red tape involved in the payment of maternity benefit cut out.  The method of payment of maternity benefit varies depending on where one comes within the system.  This may not be a matter for the Minister's Department but it is confusing.  Under existing arrangements, should a woman be in receipt of lone parent, widow's, deserted wife's or prisoner's wife's allowance, she would receive half the rate of maternity benefit, and they are dealt with in different <Col N="1069" /> ways.  I would like to see the payment simplified.  It is proposed to bring in a new allowance in the area of health and safety to be provided for employees from the fourth week onwards.  I warmly welcome that allowance which is very important especially in the light of the example I gave.  The system should be streamlined and the red tape cut out to avoid confusion about eligibility for such allowances.</P>
    <P>We are begining to recognise the role of the father after birth and the important role he plays in rearing his children.  I hope the fleeting reference to paternity leave in the Bill means that we will see progress from here on.  Here we provide for paternity or special leave for the father if the mother is unfortunate enough to die in childbirth.  An extension of that would be if the mother were very ill and, on either physical or mental grounds, unable to look after the child, especially during the initial 14-week period.  That would be another step in the right direction.  In Portugal legislation provides for paternity leave in cases of physical or mental incapacity of the mother.  It may be argued that there would be financial difficulties in implementing that here but if it can be implemented in Portugal surely there is no good reason we should not look seriously at the possibility of introducing it.  A much broader definition of paternity leave is found in many other European member states.  Greater flexibility is allowed in countries such as Denmark and Spain.  In Spain, for example, if both parents are employed, four weeks of the mother's leave can be transferred in favour of the father.  This is often important because no longer is the man the chief breadwinner in homes and frequently the mother must return to work within the 14-week period. Who better to take on looking after the child for two, three or four weeks than the father of that child?  We could give serious consideration to sharing the 14-week period.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider implementing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status <Col N="1070" /> of Women in relation to paternity leave. The commission proposes that statutory paternity leave be introduced to allow fathers to fulfil their responsibility on the birth of their child.  As a positive move in this direction the Commission proposed that a minimum of five days paternity leave be introduced by 1995. Five days is a very short leave period. Having regard to the improvement in this regard that, for, instance Portugal can afford, it is time we dealt with this area.  The Minister may have considered it and there may be a difficulty in introducing changes at this time, but it is important that the issue be addressed. The Bill is the first step in that direction.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome and credit is due to the European Union for issuing the directive and other legislative improvements to cater for employees, and women in particular, in the workplace. Having regard to the example I referred to of the lady who lost her job, the health and safety provisions in the Bill are of major importance.  Those aspects should be monitored and amended, as necessary.  I welcome the introduction of flexibility in the area of maternity leave and the protection of employees' rights, and I hope there will be further improvements in respect of paternity leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is constructive and progressive.  It is timely and perhaps inspired or in some way assisted by EC directives as is much other legislation.  Nonetheless, it is a recognition of the important role women play in society.  As the Bill supports equality for women we must welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should introduce this legislation because it deals with the area of equality for which he has responsibility.  There is a health, work and welfare aspect to provisions in the Bill and that is necessary.  I would like the Minister to use his initiative to encourage his ministerial colleagues to update legislation in line with modern <Col N="1071" /> requirements.  The areas of social welfare and health should be addressed and I am sure the Minister is applying himself to those areas.  He can be assured of my support as health spokesperson for those matters and I am sure that other Members on this side would be supportive of him also in that regard.  It is welcome that the Bill takes account of the possibility of employees losing their jobs because of being pregnant or for reasons closely associated with their pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with post and ante-natal care are also timely because there have been instances of women having had their employment terminated when the reason given was not necessarily the reasons provided for here, namely, pregnancy, giving birth, breast feeding or other matters associated with the woman's health.  I hope when the Bill is enacted the Minister will monitor its progress to ensure that measures are not taken which would circumnavigate it in respect of employers who might identify other means they could use to discriminate against women in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace made the valid point that a GP might inform a patient that on returning to work following a pregnancy she should not perform duties which, for instance, involve over reaching and heavier than average work.  Employers should consider such circumstances, but some might take advantage of the position and advise employees who cannot perform the duties they performed prior to their pregnancy that because they do not have other suitable work for them, their employment must be terminated. The Bill covers such circumstances in, I understand, so far as it is possible to do so.  When enacted it will need to be carefully monitored to ensure that positions are not contrived to make it possible to militate against the interests of women.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the area of women's health in the context of Hepatitis C contracted not through any fault of those affected but by their <Col N="1072" /> following procedures laid down and accepted by various Departments.  Some women who followed those procedures have been seriously discriminated against in terms of their health.  Given that it is some time since the virus was identified, there are about 1,000 women who still do not know what lies ahead of them.  They do not know whether the treatment they will receive will be adequate.  In some cases difficulties have arisen in that many do not know if they will be able to continue in employment and in one case it has been indicated that the women concerned will have to leave work.  This legislation does not cover that area, but it is one in respect of which the Minister should consider introducing specific legislation. I do not wish to score any political point on such issue but it must be addressed. A similar problem arose a few years ago in respect of haemophiliacs.  The Legislature must address such problems.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for this area but the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has an ancillary role to play also.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform could constructively examine the criteria governing qualification for social welfare benefits or assistance with a view to identifying areas in which the rights of women are eroded on the grounds of their gender and circumstances. This is usually a matter of a woman's word against that of someone else.  I will come back to that at a later stage.</P>

      <P>It is evident that the ordinary television receiver is equipped to accommodate the SHF band, but unfortunately the Minister does not realise that.  As it is important that people have equal rights why, while people living on the east and north coasts may receive up to 20 television channels, do the inhabitants on the south-west and western seaboard not have that privilege.  They are treated as second class citizens: let there be no mistake about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister afraid to introduce competition against the MMDS? Surely he is aware that competition is the life of trade.  MMDS charges amount to approximately £150 per <Col N="1074" /> annum to each customer whereas the deflector system such as that operated by South Coast Community Television gives an equal, if not better service for £30 to £40 per annum.  Will the Minister confirm or deny that special terms were offered to the ten MMDS franchises throughout the country for a fee of £20,000 each, giving a total gift sum of £200,000 to the MMDS company?  The only other payment required is an annual renewal fee of 5 per cent of gross revenue, excluding installation charges and VAT.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Government has reneged on its promise to the electorate during the last general election campaign when Fianna Fáil and Labour TDs and Senators gave a public pre-election pledge that they would support a campaign for the licensing of community television.  Why was that pledge not honoured?  I will note the Deputies who vote against this motion.  They gave a pledge to the electorate and are refusing to honour it.  I would be pleased if the Government honoured its commitment. I remind the Minister that one can fool the people once, but not a second time.  The people of Cork South Central and Cork North Central will shortly give their verdict on this controversial issue.</P>

      <P>South Coast Community Television has no option but to report to High Court action to seek justice for its hundreds of thousands of patrons and, if forced to do so, it will appeal its case to the European Court of Human Rights.  Does the Minister understand what he is doing by giving a monopoly to one firm?  Monopolies are bad in any area.  They are to the detriment of the State.  I have criticised monopolies since I first entered public life and my attitude has not changed since then.  I appeal to the Minister to let common sense prevail.  Surely he does not wish to make second class citizens of the people of Cork city and county, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick, Tipperary, <Col N="1075" /> Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  The Donegal Deputies will soon be judged on this matter.

      <P>Community television is a very important question for the Cork area.  It is well known that South Coast Community Television has for many years operated a very good quality, cheap service for a large section of the Cork population.  In spite of the many applications to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, South Coast Community Television remains an unlicensed operator. This company's operation has not interfered with any other service in the frequency band in the Cork area.  It is difficult for the local people to understand why a licence cannot be granted in this case to allow South Coast Community Television to compete with the existing licence holder in the area.  Cork Communications and South Coast Community Television should be allowed provide a top class service as cheaply as possible.  It is through competition that the customer will get the best deal.  Fine Gael is determined to give the Cork public that choice.  It is up to Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies to decide on the matter &mdash; unfortunately I see only one Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House and there is no Labour Deputy.</P>

I would like to know the role played by former directors in this regard and if they agreed that pressure should be exerted on Deputies to get Ministers to back off.  With other Deputies, a former Minister of State and I were berated by directors of Cork Communications Limited because the community television services were still operating in Carrigaline.  We were told that we should implement the law and put the people concerned off the air. These directors were closely associated with the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>Cosúil le gach duine anseo, tá gach Teachta nó Seanadóir ar an dtaobh seo faoi bhrú mar gheall ar an bhfadhb seo.  I agree that, with 42 deflector systems between Malin Head and Laghy in County Donegal, all Members of the House are under pressure. I agree with my colleague from Cork &mdash; we do not always have good North-South relations on this issue &mdash; that these community television networks would have been closed when licences were granted if it had not been for the efforts of Government backbenchers. Like all Members.  I am anxious to ensure that a proper service is provided to everyone.  That is the reason the deflector systems were provided by community groups in County Donegal in particular where an adequate service was not provided.</P>
      <P>One of the main concerns of those who receive community television services in County Donegal relates to the cost involved.  They are also concerned about health hazards but, unfortunately, unless there is conclusive evidence one cannot come down on either side of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to await the court's decision. I am glad that Government backbenchers had an opportunity to insist that the Minister accept this decision and make any necessary changes.  If I can be given <Col N="1080" /> a categoric assurance that MMDS operators will provide a similar service to every household in County Donegal then the people of County Donegal might consider accepting it.  It should be borne in mind that the MMDS system is based on direct line frequencies.  As a consequence, because of the height of Mount Errigal, reception may be poor.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that people do not have a choice.  I accept, however, that we have to meet our obligations under international agreements and that it was a Fianna Fáil Government which introduced this system.  Successive Governments have struck to the number of frequencies available.  Caithfidh mé a rá freisin, tá muid ag fanacht ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  An bhfuil páirtí Fhine Gael i ndáiríre mar gheall ar Theilifís na Gaeilge?  Ní bheidh Teilifís na Gaeilge ann má bhíonn MMDS ann.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that is the position but I am very supportive of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Many people living in Gaeltacht areas have deflector systems and would like to receive Telefís na Gaeilge, but we cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>My constituents are concerned about the cost of the MMDS system.  Given that we come from a fairly mountainous peripheral area and that MMDS technology is dependent on the line of sight, we are not satisfied that we will get what we deserve in County Donegal.</P>

      <P>In my short time in Dáil Éireann I have seen some dishonest motions come before the House but this Fine Gael motion on the availability of multi-channel television takes the biscuit.  This cannot be called honest or genuine.  On the contrary it is a trick to fool the public into thinking that Fine Gael is in favour of alternative television choices for people living in areas the cable and MMDS systems have not reached.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It was a Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who originally introduced the cable system about 12 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the denial of the rights of the people to watch television programmes of their choice there is also a hidden and more sinister aspect.  While various companies were awarded licences to cable different parts of the country, slowly but surely all of these companies have been bought out or taken over by one major company. To the best of my knowledge only two <Col N="1082" /> of these independent companies have not been acquired by this firm and it appears that their days are numbered.  It is like trying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  This situation should never have been allowed to happen. The original legislation allowed it and a monopoly has been created under the nose of successive Governments.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse the shareholder with the controlling interest in the company is also the largest player in the Irish newspaper industry.  As well as controlling many of our newspapers, national and local, this person has control of the vast majority of companies supplying multi-channel television.  This is not good enough and I see no reason why the Government should not intervene to put a stop to this monopoly.  We have heard nothing from the Fine Gael Party on this matter during the debate since as Fine Gael allowed this to happen in the first place.</P>
      <P>I know more than most about the problems of people who were left without multi-channel television.  The Cork East constituency is a far flung area with a number of medium-sized towns.</P>

      <P>The treatment of these people has been most unjust.  I and many of my colleagues in the Labour Party have tried our best to help them but without success.  The provisions of the original Act have been the main stumbling block.  Some of my colleagues have been threatened with injunctions and other forms of legal action for challenging the existing monopoly.  In desperation representatives of the victimised people have been forced to take legal action against the Minister on the terms of the original Act in order to <Col N="1083" /> assert their right to multi-channel television. The matter is now <i>sub judice</i>, as the Fine Gael Party knows.  This is not a genuine motion but a smoke screen to fool people outside this House.  There is no merit in this motion and it will do nothing to help the victimised people.  I have no hesitation in disclosing this deception.</P>
      <P>Last night I listened with interest to Deputy Bradford's contribution.  His speech was nothing more than a transparent example of cynical opportunism. I am disappointed because I thought he was made of better stuff.  He found his voice to express his views on this issue but he hardly had a word to say inside or outside this House during the Irish Steel crisis.  I would not mind if he believed in what he said but it was clear to everybody that he did not believe a word of it.</P>

They were denied the opportunity of watching soccer on television at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become unfashionable to say anything good about Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien.  I recall that when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he went to various urban areas trying to sell the concept of multi-channel television.  He received a very critical reception because many chauvinistic people who felt we could do without multi-channel television opposed him bitterly.  He got very little support in this House and was left on his own.  He was a visionary and he felt it was more democratic that <Col N="1084" /> people should have access to multi-channel television.  I recall attending a meeting in Connolly Hall on O'Connell Street, Limerick when he got a hotter reception than Deputy Mulvihill got tonight, with people trying to shout him down when he was advocating the rights of people to enjoy multi-channel television. Everything my colleague, Deputy Mulvihill, has said is true.  It is correct that Jim Mitchell was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when the licences were given to various companies. I remember it very well.</P>

At that time I am sure that Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan and John Mulvihill, who was then not a Deputy, could not have foreseen the monopoly that would be created and that one company has been able to buy up all but two others.  That company is the major player in our newspaper industry.  It was a flawed Bill and denied the right to community television.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about deflector systems but about people making television programmes at local level and feeding them into the national grid.  Anybody can put up a deflector but genuine community television and broadcasting could have been made possible.  Not once during the debate did Members on the other side of the House refer to the original Bill that caused all the trouble.  Deflector systems should not be taken off the air because that denies people outside urban areas the right to watch the same range of television programmes as their <Col N="1085" /> friends and neighbours in urban areas. We are democrats and we feel that people have the right to watch television. That is our view and all the shouting in the world will not change it. It is also true that the people involved in the deflector system have taken the case to court and the matter is now <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>This matter is before the courts and is therefore <i>sub judice.</i>  I do not know how the courts will decide but I am most unhappy about the provision of television services to people in the main urban areas.  What has happened is a scandal and a scheme and it was not envisaged by the people who conceived the Bill.  They did not have sufficient foresight to see that one company would take over those smaller companies &mdash; with the exception of two, as Deputy Mulvihill said.  We now have a monopoly similar to that in the national and local press.  I do not know what will happen about that.</P>

      <P>We are all concerned about community initiatives and would like the deflector system legalised, but why have successive Governments not done that?  In regard to the contracts awarded and the licences issued by the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell, I wonder why he did not feel it necessary to change the system or opt for an alternative system.  Was it because of Fine Gael influence on the major investment in the company that they went along with awarding those licences?  That action under Deputy Mitchell's ministry should be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>All this talk about the matter being before the courts is nothing more than a smokescreen to bide time until after 10 November.  Why did the Government insist on abdicating responsibility for such an important issue to the courts?  Surely there is an obligation to legislate on the matter and issue licences particularly since both parties gave firm commitments during <Col N="1092" /> the last election that community television and methods of distributing television signals would be licensed.</P>
      <P>Television is a powerful cultural, entertainment and educational medium. The television signal and choice of channels available to viewers is important.  Last year there was a dispute in Dublin between Cablelink and the television companies.  There was a loss of Sky and other television channels on the network and there was an outcry among the people about that.  I understand the strength of feeling among people who depend on other systems of distributing the television signal.  In many areas of Munster, particularly in Cork, the signal is distributed by community organisations at a reasonable cost.  There is understandable fear that the system will be replaced by a more costly one which may not distribute the signal to many areas, particularly mountainous regions, for the reasons stated by Deputy Coughlan.  There is also concern about the health and environmental implications of MMDS masts.</P>
      <P>Debate on this issue is long overdue. The only reason the motion is before us is Fianna Fáil and Labour did not honour the commitments given in the last general election.  There was ample time for the Government to deal with the issue.  I agree that the legislation introduced by Deputy Jim Mitchell contributed to our sorry mess but that was in the mid-1980s.  Communications technology has changed dramatically and it is strange that Members should want to lock themselves into a framework agreed ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the lifetime of this Government thousands of jobs were sacrificed on the altar of competition in Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann and more are about to be sacrificed in the ESB, all allegedly in the interests of competition and consumer benefit.  Where is the concern for consumers when we talk about receiving television signals?  They are entitled to the benefits of competition which, <Col N="1093" /> when it comes to shedding jobs, seem to be the favourite words of the Government. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was disingenuous in the way he attempted to define community television as solely the production of television programmes by community groups.  That is a form of it but the television signal is distributed by many groups &mdash; this is the case in Cork &mdash; and subscribers are the democratic participants.  That should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I agree with the warnings on monopoly voiced by Deputies Kemmy and Mulvihill.  The danger of a monopoly developing in communications is in evidence particularly in the print media where one person owns 60 per cent of the print media and has a large hold in the area of radio and television.  Power and ownership are concentrated in the hands of a few.  While we have the technology which should, in theory, give the public a greater degree of choice, in practice they will have less choice than at present.  We will have the classic case of 57 channels with nothing on them.  In many respects television production and distribution is reduced to a choice between Beavis and Butthead.  The public must be given a choice.  Competition and the tendency towards a monopoly are matters which deserve to receive more attention in the House than they have to date.</P>

      <P>Bamhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Gilmore as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  There is a number of aspects to the motion before us.  The technical side of the television broadcasting system we are debating is important but there are also health and environmental issues to be considered.  However, the most emotive aspect, given its importance locally and nationally, is community democracy, what it stands for and if it has any meaning in the eyes of the Government.  A number of community groups have <Col N="1094" /> stood their ground and are witnessing a trend by the Government which amounts to a form of oppression which does not find expression with tanks in the streets but amounts to the Minister telling them what they want and what is good for them in spite of their experience and other advice available to them. The group in Carrigaline has decided to challenge the issue in the courts and not wait to be told by the Government what is good for it.</P>
      <P>While the imminent by-elections in Cork have focused our minds on the problems in these areas, it should not be forgotten that this is a national problem. The map of Ireland showing the MMDS broadcasting waves is like a rug covered with coffee stains.  Although awareness of the problem associated with this system is greatest in Cork, no area has escaped.</P>
      <P>The Government must deal with the technical aspect of this issue.  A number of very misleading statements have been made by Ministers about the MMDS system, the various clichés used do not stand up to scrutiny.  The beam bender rebroadcasting system is not independently monitored.  Instead the Government gives us figures and states what is happening.  When one takes its reputation into account, this is not reassuring.  In the Cork Airport site the MMDS signal is very low in deference to aircraft.  This has a different impact from other MMDS signals and the people of Cork would like to know more about its unique effects.  This matter has not been properly addressed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that, unlike community television, the MMDS system does not allow a viewer to videotape a programme on one channel while watching a different programme on another channel.  One could say that such viewers are receiving a disservice, not a service and this is a good argument for not forcing the system down their throats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> The Government refers to point-to-point transmission as if it were an easily achievable goal.  However, we are not living in the Netherlands and given obstacles such as mountains with which we have to deal, point-to-point transmission cannot be guaranteed.  Unfortunately the Government is not telling the whole truth when it refers to the introduction of point-to-point transmission. For example, beam bender rebroadcasting equipment would have to be installed, and this would give rise to other problems.  There should be more independent monitoring to these areas.</P>
    <P>Is the Government prepared to face up to the legal challenge posed by the policy of MMDS operators which does not comply with international conventions? The people of Carrigaline are very clear that the Government's policy in this area is not in line with international conventions.  In my area of North County Dublin the feeling is that Cablelink and, in particular, Cable Management, need to be properly monitored.  The Government should monitor existing operators rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water by imposing a faulty and questionable system which will not meet people's needs.</P>
    <P>In the Malahide and Portmarnock areas cable television is being offered to the public.  Today I spoke to a constituent who told me he paid £120 subscription fee for six channels and a further £120 for Sky Sports One in which he is very interested.  He read in the newspapers a commitment to providing Sky Sports Two but he is unable to receive it.  He has had the frustrating experience of watching part of a programme on Sky Sports One and being unable to see the rest of the programme as it is shown on Sky Sports Two the following day.</P>
    <P>The Government is taking its eye off the ball, forcing its questionable option down the throats of people and allowing <Col N="1096" /> companies which provide a faulty service to go unpunishable.  These companies should be properly monitored and brought to justice.  This injustice is compounded by the Government's failure to monitor this area.  If the Government is serious about democracy and properly representing people it should stand back from its grandiose scheme, talk to people and help them to realise their objectives.  This would ensure the provision of a proper system with the support and co-operation of local communities. It would also enable the Government to retain some popularity, which it is fast losing as a result of its bad management of broadcasting policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>A blatant attempt is being made in this debate to rewrite recent broadcasting history.  Having listened to Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe one would think that the MMDS system was imposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I was a Member of the House when the 1988 Act, which inflicted this system on people, was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, and when, in 1989, he awarded ten franchises at a cost of £20,000 each.  No one can say that this system was introduced, imposed or thought up by Deputy Jim Mitchell or anyone else in Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>We have been led to believe that this motion would not have been tabled if there was not an imminent by-election in Cork.  This is a relevant motion to the people in Donegal whom I represent and there are no by-elections in that county.  It is also relevant to people in Galway, Mayo and many other rural areas.  It is a coincidence that the by-elections will take place in Cork in two weeks' time.  I want to put the record straight on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal is very well catered for in terms of a television service by the 50 community based operators who provide excellent signals to the remotest <Col N="1097" /> parts of the county.  This has been achieved by local communities who took the initiative to fill a vacuum which had existed for many years.  Urban areas, particularly the east coast, had access to cross channel television stations for many years through the cable link system.  However, rural Ireland, particularly the west, including Donegal, was left without access to cross channel stations.  Only through the industry, ingenuity and skills of local community groups was that gap filled. The first community television system in Donegal was established without State help to provide television transmission to many areas not then covered by RTE.  It was subsequently developed to transmit cross channel stations.  An effective economic non-profit making safe system was devised through community effort and co-operation.  It was within the financial reach of even the poorest families.  Community television is an excellent example of community co-operation at its best.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1988, we are forced to jettison and abandon community television in favour of this new MMDS system. It is a disgrace that community television is being blacked and replaced by a suspect system enjoying a huge monopoly in its functional area.  Will the Minister even at the eleventh hour, pause and reconsider?  Where is the sense in replacing an efficient system of transmission with a suspect and much more expensive one?  Each subscriber to the proposed MMDS will be obliged to pay a connection charge of up to £300 and an annual charge that can vary from £80 to £140.  In addition the television licence fee has to be paid.</P>
    <P>The companies granted the franchises are commercial concerns with monopoly status and can fix charges to ensure maximum profit.  This will mean very expensive television viewing in the future.  MMDS is outside the control of the local community unlike community <Col N="1098" /> television which is controlled by community groups and operated on a voluntary basis on behalf of the community. Charges can, therefore, be waived for the elderly and less well off.  No such charitable flexibility can be expected from a commercial concern.  The poorer sections will have to pay the huge increases or else survive without cross channel stations and, in some instances, native stations.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of MMDS can also be questioned.  It was primarily designed for the plains and prairies of the United States and Canada.  To receive microwave transmissions, the recipient must be in line of sight with the transmitting mast.  The topography of Donegal and the west would not be suitable for such a system.  Many people who receive television reception from community television will not and cannot be served by the microwave system and may be left without any reception.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the technology of telecommunications is changing and developing almost on a daily basis.  Satellite television has revolutionised the availability of a huge number of channels and fibre optic technology is coming into its own.  What is the sense in imposing a prohibitively expensive technology on this country when it may well be obsolete in a few years.  This is the time to pause and look at what else is available.  It is certainly not a time to push a system that may have to be replaced by a more modern, effective, efficient and more economic one in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of MMDS which needs clarification is safety standards and its possible health hazards.  There are conflicting views and reports on this. According to the Department of Energy, Transport and Communications and the franchise companies there are no dangers or risks involved.  However, many authoritative sources are concerned about a blanket cover of microwave radiation in the environment if the proposed system is developed.  The international radiation and protection association has guidelines on safe limits <Col N="1099" /> of exposure to microwave radiation. These guidelines are regularly reviewed as knowledge on the effects of microwave radiation became available.  No other country will have the blanket cover of microwave radiation that will prevail here when the full microwave system is in operation.  No studies could, therefore, have been carried out on the long term effects of such exposure on human beings but the limited knowledge available indicates clearly that exposure to microwave radiation should be avoided.  The international radiation protection association guidelines on safety limits also say it is prudent to avoid unnecessary exposure to microwave radiation.  There is no safe level of radiation.  The question must be asked whether we should allow ourselves and future generations to be exposed to microwave radiation for a television system we do not want or need.  I do not wish to cause undue alarm and anxiety about this complicated matter. However, we are entitled to a comprehensive and independent assessment of the dangers of microwave radiation.</P>
    <P>We simply cannot cast aside a system that has served us well for many years in favour of a new one with so many questionable features.  The motion asks the Minister to amend the Act so that community television will continue its proud record of providing its excellent services to remote areas.  Granting a monopoly to a new united system cannot and should not be tolerated.  In the interests of services to the consumer we must maintain a place for community television.  A simple amendment to the Act would enable this to be maintained. That is the essence of this motion.  I hope it will be sufficiently supported in the House so that we can continue with a system that has been devised and controlled by local communities for local communities throughout the country.</P>

However, I cannot accept Deputy McGinley's assertion that it is purely by chance it has been timed for this week, in advance of the Cork by-elections.  During the past year and a half along with members of all political parties I have attended public meetings in my constituency. The members of Deputy McGinley's party in my constituency would have been well aware of the problems associated with MMDS and would have had ample opportunity to raise them before now.  I do not wish to get into history, whether writing it or rewriting it.  We are dealing with a situation created by a number of circumstances during the past few years.  While I accept that it was not Deputy Mitchell who introduced the 1988 Act or introduced the franchises in 1989, I recall that was the period during which his party, through the Tallaght strategy, was engaged in tacit support for the Government.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I support the amendment by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I am pleased, following the determination of the case before the courts, that it allows an opportunity for review and improvement because that is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, will be aware that a variety of multi-channel systems operate in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency <Col N="1101" /> and that there have been problems because of loss of service in areas which previously had access to the deflector systems.  The Minister and I receive frequent complaints from people about the quality of the cable service.  People wonder if they can connect to the MMDS, but they cannot because they are linked to a cable system which is an exclusive licence.  Other areas have direct access to multi-channel signals from the North and areas which previously operated under the illegal deflector systems have lost that service, unlike parts of Cork.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious faults with the MMDS which need to be addressed.  Although the land in my constitutency is relatively flat the Slieve Bloom Mountains prevent many people from receiving a proper service.  We also have a problem with encoding by companies who have the franchise for the MMDS.  Encoding means extra charges are levied on the subscribers who have to rent additional equipment to decode the signal.  That is an unnecessary imposition on them.  We also have the problem of cost.  There are a number of MMDS operators in our area, one of whom charges a reasonable fee with an easy pay method and another who charges a very high fee and insists on people paying a lump sum.  Those issues need to be examined by the Department, regardless of the outcome of the court case.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed by the monopoly position referred to by other Deputies. Initially the franchises for MMDS were given to a number of companies but only two of them are under the control of one group, the same owners of a large part of the print media.  That policy matter needs to be addressed urgently by the Government.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Sargent's comments on community democracy, he may not be aware that a number of genuine community services are available on some of our cable networks and local people participate in making and producing <Col N="1102" /> programmes for their areas.  I welcome that development.  Having regard to the progress on the issuing of additional community licences, it is obvious the Government is committed to the involvement of people in broadcasting and the print media in their areas.  I look forward to further developments not only in radio but also in the television sector.</P>
    <P>People in my area have access to a number of systems, namely, cable, direct signal, former deflector systems, and MMDS.  People are not very concerned about the technical niceties of this matter, they must be considered by the Department.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure that the air-waves, which are owned by the public, are used in an effective and legal manner. The consumer is concerned about three basic matters, namely, cost, quality and service.  Whether the system is cable, MMDS or otherwise, the Government has a duty to ensure the cost is within the grasp of the majority of people, the operators have easy pay systems, the quality of service is adequate and that service is available to people promptly and efficiently.  Unfortunately, that is not the case at present, not alone in respect of MMDS operations but also in respect of cable companies.  Following the determination of the court case the Minister should address those serious issues.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Fianna Fáil and Labour Government rejected the Fine Gael motion to support the need for competition between community television and existing MMDS licence holders.</P>
      <P>This is hypocritical by the Government in view of the specific commitments given before the last general election by both Government parties.  On 13 November 1992, prior to the last general election, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Transport, Tourism and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, promised that Fianna Fáil would arrange for the examination of the monopoly position of MMDS operators under competition legislation.</P>
      <P>Not to be outdone, the Labour Party stated in its campaign literature that in Government it would &ldquo;license community television throughout the country&rdquo;. All that has changed since then is that both Fianna Fáil and Labour are now in Government and in a position of power to do something about this, but are refusing to honour those election promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, attempted to imply that Fine Gael is seeking to represent and legalise all illegal transmission systems that were, in his words, &ldquo;misappropriating the use <Col N="1104" /> of the radio frequency spectrum&rdquo;.  He further stated that the people who operate systems illegally are in effect advocating the abandonment of the national radio frequency plan.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in stating that the radio and television frequency spectrum is a national asset and that it must be controlled by a Government Department. However, this does not give the Government the right, particularly in the context of European Union deregulation directives, to grant exclusive rights to particular companies in a monopolistic way and in a defined geographical area.</P>
    <P>This is a strange statement coming from the present Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications when one considers what he had to say regarding the issue of competitions and the role of the State in this House on 4 March 1994 during statements relating to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> As reported at column 1760 of the Official Report of 4 March, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>... the State owned companies have found that they are not immune to the pressure for change that is sweeping the world.  The cosy security of operating a Government granted monopoly is coming under increasing threat in a single European market that seeks to deregulate and open up to competition every sector of service that was traditionally supplied by way of a public utility.  No longer can a utility expect to be granted protection from market competition in return for providing certain public and social services. </P>
    <P>Furthermore the Minister stated at the opening of Intelevent 1994 in Dublin recently that &ldquo;a more competitive environment was vital to ensure the rapid adoption and diffusion of new technologies at lower costs and promote consumer choice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely these statements of practical <Col N="1105" /> political philosophy uttered by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications confirm his agreement with the spirit of the Fine Gael motion before the House?  It was pathetic to listen to the Minister quote a Fine Gael Minister in 1985 to justify his policy stance on this issue nine years later, considering that it takes a mere week to change a document.  It is particularly pathetic when one considers that it was his own colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, as Minister for Communications in 1988, who introduced the necessary regulations to give effect to the policy. The present Minister, Deputy Cowen, had no problem with the policy at the time.  The Minister will be the first to admit that rapid technological change is taking place that will allow competition and co-existence of community television with existing licence holders.</P>
    <P>In his statement last evening I hope the Minister was not advocating a closed shop policy on this issue in respect of local community groups coming together, taking the initiative to provide a good quality, cheap service to subscribers while not interfering with any other radio or television stations in their respective areas.  Deputies Kemmy and Mulvihill warned the House of the dangers of having advertising, local radio and television, local media in the hands of a few powerful individuals. Perhaps that is the Minister's wish. When one reflects on the changes that have taken place in the media world in recent years there is plenty of evidence that smaller media operators are rapidly going out of business or being taken over by other operators to the detriment of a competitive environment.  All of us, particularly those in the local media, are very aware of this important development.  There is no doubt that there is a vested interest involved in seeking to ensure that the majority shareholding of existing MMDS licence holders is well protected by a few powerful individuals.  What the MMDS <Col N="1106" /> transmission system can offer in the future in terms of local advertising is a powerful incentive to those people with large amounts of money to become involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister was correct in quoting Deputy Jim Mitchell nine years ago when he stated that the technological base did not exist at that time to allow for the legislation of community television. That is no longer the case.  If local competition to MMDS is allowed by the Minister, all that needs to be done is to set transmission standards. One such technological development has been the advent of digital compression which has rendered the transmission of high quality digital television a reality.  In future it will be possible to transmit multiple high quality television signals on a much smaller frequency band through compression.  In other words, the technological base will be available to allow the Minister to grant a licence to community television groups while not interfering with existing operators or international treaties.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about our international obligations when he correctly quoted from the International Telecommunications Union documentation, from the Treaty agreed in Stockholm in 1961.  Is any licensed or unlicensed operator at present interfering with the requirements of those international treaties?  The Minister failed to address that question.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding the fact that there is technological development taking place, there are community groups who have organised themselves in recent years and filled the vacuum the State failed to fill by providing a low cost, high quality, retransmission service to local communities.  We have heard of many examples in Cork, Waterford, Donegal and south Kilkenny.  Many communities operating with low cost equipment, imposing a low charge on the consumer, have been providing a very effective, high quality television <Col N="1107" /> service over the years.  Only within the context of MMDS licence holders coming on stream has the Minister availed of the opportunity to take those people off the air, deeming their operations illegal.  That will be the case no longer if we accept the spirit of the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>I regard it as totally unreasonable that the general public should be deprived of choice within their local area by ministerial diktat.  Many people, particularly the elderly, who have come to rely on community television over the years, will be unable to afford the costs imposed by a monopolistic company. All of us are aware of the costs of multi-channel viewing.  When one compares those with some of the successful community television operations, one immediately sees the huge discrepancy in the charges imposed on subscribers. If community television is terminated the chance of multi-channel viewing will be eliminated for many people.  Community television would not be in operation today were it not for the fact that communities had to take up the challenge themselves.  The State is required to meet the public demand by adopting the new technological arrangements now available.  Competition between MMDS operators and community television represents the best and most effective way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the model of licensing local radio adopted by the Independent Radio and Television Commission could be adopted for community television when, if ever, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications decides to open his mind to new developments in this area rather than hiding behind a court case not likely to be heard until 11 January 1995.  It is not acceptable that the Minister should not give some indication of whether he is prepared to review the present legislation, irrespective of the outcome of <Col N="1108" /> court cases initiated by community groups against the Minister and the State and existing MMDS operators in Cork.</P>
    <P>Some people have been very concerned in recent years about the existence of MMDS transmitters in their areas and the potential hazard to health. Various scientific views have been advanced by MMDS transmitter operators indicating that they are safe, while other scientific evidence has been offered by local communities indicating the contrary.  I made a reasonable suggestion to the Minister on many occasions, that the Radiological Institute, an independent body, should be charged with responsibility for monitoring the emissions of non-ionising radiation from these transmitters so that people who live in those areas, at a considerable distance from the centre of power where such decisions are taken, will be afforded an opportunity to be informed on the contents of those studies, their relevance to their general health and the risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will await the outcome of the court action taken by South Coast Community Television against the State, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and Cork Communications Limited before reviewing his policy on this issue.  That is a total &ldquo;cop out&rdquo;.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies, who gave specific commitments before the last general election, to take the honourable course and meet those commitments to the people who voted for them in good faith, believing that they were prepared to support the licensing of community television. They received significant votes on the strength of that commitment.  In order to retain their credibility and honour their election commitments I ask them to support the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>Arising from the unsatisfactory and unconvincing reasons given yesterday by the Minister for Justice at Question Time as to the significant delay and inactivity of the Office of the Attorney General to deal with extradition warrants to extradite Fr. Brendan Smyth to Northern Ireland, very serious questions arise as to how properly the Office of the Attorney General deals with extradition matters generally.</P>
      <P>The claim by the Minister for Justice that the Attorney General had not seen the warrants from the RUC &mdash; let alone dealt with them &mdash; seeking the extradition of a paedophile to Northern Ireland is shocking, defies belief and is unconvincing.  The Minister would have us believe that although the warrants were received by the Garda on 29 April last year and forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General the following day, the files were never brought to the personal attention of the Attorney General over the succeeding seven months, or at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to believe that, it raises the question that if the Attorney General does not know what is happening in his office, who does? How many other extradition warrants are lying around in the Office of the Attorney General awaiting his gaze?  Is there some sort of selection process whereby they are vetted before they reach his desk?  What magic ingredient is needed for the subject matter of the warrants to merit being placed before the Attorney General?  That is all the <Col N="1112" /> more pertinent given that under section 5 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act. 1987, the Attorney General's function in the matter of extradition can only be delegated by him in circumstances of illness or absence.  Who makes the key decisions in the processing of extradition warrants?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what happened to the warrants for Fr. Smyth after they were received in the Office of the Attorney General on 30 April 1993? What clarification or further documentation was sought by the Office of the Attorney General from the prosecuting authorities in Northern Ireland either directly or through the Garda? Surely there is a file in the Office of the Attorney General the contents of which would demonstrate that some consideration was given to that matter.  If the prosecuting authorities in Northern Ireland were not communicated with then either nothing was done or inquiries were made separately in the South. That gives rise to other questions.  Did the Office of the Attorney General seek to contact Fr. Smyth directly?  Did it seek to contact his Order, the Catholic hierarchy or the Garda to investigate the subject matter of the warrants? Those are not academic points given the nature of the case and the gravity of the crimes.  Surely those serious crimes merited a deep and considered analysis in the Office of the Attorney General? Surely it was realised by the staff of the Office of the Attorney General that the matter deserved urgent attention as the paedophile could have been continuing his activities in the South.  We now know that Fr. Brendan Smyth was in the South during that time.  How serious must a case be before it arrives on the Attorney General's desk?  He said that he did not see those files.  That is an implicit attempt to pass the buck to his civil servants.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Justice yesterday used as an excuse for the delay that the alleged offences ranged over 20 or 30 years.  This is an alarming precedent because most disclosures and allegations of child sexual abuse, if made by adults, will relate to offences which happened more than 20 years ago.  If this dangerous precedent is allowed stand, it will place a statute of limitations on all <Col N="1114" /> such cases.  For that reason the procedures in the Attorney General's office are in need of review.  We look forward to a full and frank account of the activities of the Attorney General's office in the report due in this House in December this year.  There is clearly need for more accountability and to examine who is managing the Attorney General's office.  If he does not receive files on urgent matters of public importance, particularly relating to child sexual abuse cases, we should be told who deals with them.  We should also be given the reason for the unconscionable delay in this case.</P>

      <P>There is no question that this case was complex legally because it raised for the first time extremely important legal questions about the provisions of the Extradition Act.  Under the Act the High Court may direct the release of a person who has been arrested on an extradition warrant if, by reason of the lapse of time since commission of the offences in the warrant and other exceptional circumstances, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to deliver the person concerned. Contrary to some statements made recently, this provision applies to all extradition requests from the United Kingdom, whether of the so-called political type or otherwise.  Whatever the nature of the crime alleged, it is obviously a very far-reaching and significant provision because the decisions in this case would have implications in other cases in the future.  This is the first case since 1987 where a decision on this point was called for.</P>

      <P>It is obvious I will not be allowed to make the statement unhindered.  I wish to make two final points on this case.  I am more aware than most people of the burden of work in the Attorney General's office.  The Attorney General takes great care to ensure that every matter is dealt with expeditiously and there are no avoidable delays in his office.  I am aware, through my work on legislation, of the amount of work done in the Attorney General's office, which has greatly increased in the last four or five years.</P>
      <P>The events surrounding this case have given rise to concerns, not only among Opposition Deputies, and I am pleased these concerns have been addressed by the Attorney General.  The Attorney General has issued a direction that in future every request for extradition received by his office should be notified to him immediately it is received.  That has not been the practice heretofore and was not done in this case.  In that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wish to say, without reflection on my colleague from County Wexford, that I am disappointed that neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Minister for the Marine is here to answer what I regard as a very serious issue.</P>
      <P>On 22 September 1992 an incident took place off the Wexford coast in an area just north of the Smalls.  Two vessels, the <i>Orchidee</i>, an Irish registered boat, and the <i>Agena</i>, a French registered boat, were involved.  The incident has been politely called a collision, but I have my doubts about that.  Two lives were lost in this incident.  The families of Bobby Doran aged 20 from Bridgetown, County Wexford, and Jimmy Power from Dunmore East, County Waterford, are still awaiting an answer to their questions 25 months later.  The families have two simple questions: what happened and who was responsible? What efforts, if any were made to save these two people?  It is interesting that the <i>Agena</i> was left intact and the crew saved while the <i>Orchidee</i> was sunk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation into the event which took place in international waters is in the hands of the French authorities. A judicial inquiry called a Rogatory Commission has been instituted.  To date there have been no results from the work of this commission and the families are still waiting for information.  The longer they wait the greater the trauma <Col N="1118" /> and suspicion and the stronger the rumour.</P>
    <P>Matters have been complicated by international and maritime law.  No provision is made under Irish law for the establishment of a similar commission. The marine inspector appointed in Ireland is not recognised by the French authorities and to date his questions have not been answered by them.  The discussions involving the Department of the Marine, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office on how to resolve the legal difficulties have not yielded results.  I am aware that officials in the Department of the Marine have expressed frustration. It is the responsibility of the legal section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Paris to make representations to the French authorities.</P>
    <P>At my request the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, raised the matter with his French counterpart last December.  In a letter handed to the French Fisheries Minister concern was expressed about the constraints placed on the Irish inspector's investigation.  In short his investigation cannot be completed until the French investigation has been completed first.  The bereaved families cannot begin to rebuild their lives until justice is done.  What began as a human tragedy has been turned into a legal farce.  The French judicial system has treated the deaths of Bobby Doran and Jimmy Power with shameful negligence. Justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>I want a cast iron guarantee from the Department of Foreign Affairs that the non-stop pursuit of this issue will be given priority.  If this requires us to camp outside the relevant offices in Paris then that is what must be done. There are two grieving families awaiting justice and they want to know what happened at sea on 22 September 1992 to put their minds at rest.  They demand that those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones be brought to justice. The Doran and Power families have <Col N="1119" /> only their Government to turn to.  Concerted action at ministerial level is required.  I hope this will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Byrne, for raising this issue and I apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>A collision between the Irish-registered trawler <i>Orchidee</i> and the French trawler <i>Agena</i> occurred on 22 September 1992, 50 miles off Dunmore East in international waters.  The <i>Orchidee</i> had three crew on board.  One crew member was rescued by the French trawler, the two other crew members lost their lives.</P>
      <P>On the same day, a marine surveyor of the Department was appointed under section 728 if the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 to report on the accident.  The purpose of such an investigation is to determine the cause of the accident and to recommend measures to prevent a recurrence.  The marine surveyor interviewed the sole survivor and has largely completed his investigation.  However, some two years later, he has not received permission from the French authorities to conduct interview with the French crew, or to obtain any other information from French sources.  As a result, the Department's investigation into the accident cannot as yet be finalised.  This is a matter of considerable concern to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the prolonged delay is the very complex legal nature of the French proceedings in this case. Because of the serious nature of the incident, the French maritime authorities proceeded with a judicial inquiry into the accident.  The head of maritime affairs in Auray, France was judically empowered to carry out the inquiry.  I understand that he will have assessed during the inquiry whether there is <Col N="1120" /> cause for criminal responsibility on the part of the skipper and crew of he <i>Agena</i> or other persons.  His findings have to be presented to the French maritime court where proceedings are renewed and judgment eventually given.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the judge carrying out the inquiry forwarded questions relating to the accident to the Irish authorities through diplomatic channels.  At the same time a comprehensive list of questions relating to the accident was prepared by the marine surveyor appointed to report on the accident.  These were forwarded last year to the Department of Foreign Affairs for transmission through the French embassy to the French authorities.</P>
    <P>The judicial inquiry was completed last April.  The Department understands from the embassy in Paris that the judge has not yet presented his findings to the maritime court but has indicated this will be done fairly soon.</P>
    <P>The Department, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish embassy in Paris, is constantly pressing the French authorities for progress.  Meetings have taken place between embassy officials and the relevant French officials in Paris.  The Minister personally raised the matter with the French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries last February and was assured that the matter would be expedited and completed within a few months.  While the French judicial proceedings have been under way it has been difficult to obtain substantive information on developments.</P>
    <P>In addition to pursuing the matters through diplomatic channels the Department is also endeavouring to obtain permission from the French authorities to have observer status at the ongoing judicial proceedings.  Even this has proved difficult to achieve to date.</P>
    <P>No stone is being left unturned in our efforts to advance matters urgently with <Col N="1121" /> the French authorities so that the Irish investigations can be finally completed. A report of the investigation will, subject to legal considerations, be published as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>Senior officials have been keeping in regular contact with the families and will, of course, continue to advise them of developments.  The matter has been given, and will continue to be given, the utmost priority.  The concerns and anxiety of the bereaved relatives to bring this matter to finally are entirely understandable and fully shared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  Without questioning the ability of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I am surprised my constituency colleague, the Minister, is not present to respond to the Debate.  I am sure the Minister of State who is an excellent representative will convey my views to him.</P>
      <P>The form, Schedule 5, states clearly that it is not obligatory for a farmer to produce an RSI or a tax reference number if his total headage payments do not exceed £500.  They are only obliged to declare that their headage payments amount to £500 or less, sign the form and return it with their headage application to their local livestock office. This week to their dismay farmers received a letter which states that it is not good enough to state they do not have an RSI number, that if they do not have such a number they must obtain one from their tax office and that their grants amount to less than £500.  In other words, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has reneged on his promise given some time ago.  I ask the Minister of State to reverse this U-turn by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tens of thousands of farmers in the small farmer category are dismayed and bewildered by this U-turn in regard <Col N="1122" /> to the regulations governing the 1994 cattle headage scheme.  If they are compelled to produce an RSI or a tax reference number, they will be forced to consult an accountant and, in many cases, the meagre income they derive from their small holdings will not meet their accountant's fees.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to withdraw the circular sent to these farmers and adhere to the conditions specified on the back of the form, Schedule 5, that it is not necessary for a farmer whose headage payments amount to less than £500 to supply either an RSI or a tax reference number.  It is all very fine for the Minister to ask farmers to apply for an RSI number but the moment the farmer does so he receives a batch of tax forms to fill in.  Surely commonsense should prevail and the Minister in his wisdom should see fit to honour his promise and not make U-turns.  This Government has made far too many U-turns in its policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this important matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in the House.  The position is that following discussions between farm organisations and Government Ministers it was agreed in March 1992, that RSI numbers would not be required for disadvantaged areas headage payments until the beginning of January 1994. From January 1994 onwards, farmers applying for disadvantaged areas headage payments which in total amount to between £500 and £5,000 must state the following on their application form(s): the RSI number issued to them for tax purposes; the tax office dealing with their tax affairs and that to the best of their knowledge, their tax affairs are in order.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment and who, accordingly, have no tax liability simply have to quote the RSI number associated with their means-tested social welfare payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> In the rate event of applications for headage payments totalling £5,000 or more in any one calender year, farmers are required to supply a tax clearance certificate from the Collector-General with their headage applications.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to all farmers in the disadvantaged areas in December 1993 giving details of this new arrangement. I should also add that the requirement applies to all headage grants to which an applicant may be entitled and not just to cattle headage grants.</P>
    <P>Local offices of my Department are fully aware of the conditions under which RSI number must be submitted. It is, however, possible that, in a very small number of cases, farmers whose full entitlement under all headage grants is under £500 may have inadvertently been requested to submit an RSI number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now enormous public concern in the Ringsend-Irishtown-Sandymount-Ballsbridge and south east area of Dublin about plans for a proposed incinerator in Ringsend. For a number of years health care waste has been the subject of increasing concern in the EU.  Concerns over the safe management and disposal of health care waste arises as a result of its offensive and potentially hazardous nature.  The possible transmission of infectious diseases such as Hepatitis, malaria, HIV <Col N="1124" /> through accidental injury by a needle or contact with infected body fluids has attracted particular attention.  The handling and disposal of health care waste is a significant issue due to its potential to cause harm and ill health to health care workers and the general public.</P>
      <P>I note that in a table of member states categorising the quantities of health care waste arising.  Ireland is, surprisingly, second highest on the list.  The EU has concluded that segregation at source is the key issue.  A group study at EU level concluded that segregation was the key to effective health care waste management.  The vital element is strict segregation at source &mdash; I emphasise that it is at source &mdash; by qualified health care personnel capable of assessing the risk posed by the waste.  A project group examining this for the European Union suggested that validated pre-treatment methods for health care risk waste should be encouraged and utilised more widely, if a decrease in risk to human health and in pollution and a reduction in cost is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The public need to get more information on how the Government intends to handle this issue.  Public concern is growing as is public awareness of the risks and the environmental issues connected with health care waste.  In my constituency the public are asking some very serious questions about this proposed plant.  It is clear that Ireland lags behind many countries that are potential member states &mdash; Denmark and Austria have made serious efforts to reduce medical waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A disturbing picture emerges when we examine the situation in Ireland.  I raise this matter tonight because the issue needs to be tackled at national level.  A royal commission has reported in the UK on clinical waste disposal.  In Ireland we have no legal definition of clinical waste on the Statute Book and practice seems to very enormously in our hospitals.  Many hospitals are using old and out of date plant; waste is not monitored and it is unlicensed and <Col N="1125" /> unregulated.  Some hospitals use their own incinerators and others are exporting hospital waste for example, from Limerick to Manchester.  I am calling for a national waste management strategy in this area to help provide a better framework for rational decisions.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin South East, a private company, will develop what is called a health care confidential paper waste disposal by incineration facility on the Pigeon House Road.  This request to develop this plant in an urban area beside Dublin Bay and near a local population centre raises serious questions about how we have disposed of waste to date.  It means that the Government must outline its plans immediately in this area.  Does the Minister for Health support this development?  Is he satisfied that all waste from Leinster hospitals should be disposed in the Ringsend area of Dublin?  Is he concerned about the health effects and is he satisfied with the waste management strategies employed by Irish hospitals? Has he plans for Irish hospitals to develop an active PVC elimination programme? How is he encouraging the development of alternative technologies? The community in south east Dublin is extremely concerned about the possible siting of this incinerator to dispose of hospital waste from 37 Leinster hospitals and health care facilities. Environmental groups are also dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a private company should now fill the vacuum that has been created and operate in the absence of a national plan for the disposal of hospital waste?  When does the Minister intend to introduce national standards and guidelines relating to the definition, segregation, storage, handling or disposal of clinical waste?  It is said that medical waste incinerators are a major source of toxic air emissions, especially dioxin.  A new study in America raises serious questions about the effects of dioxin on health.  It is critical <Col N="1126" /> that we look at all the technologies so that we can address this problem properly.</P>
    <P>There is a plan for a major incineration waste disposal unit in Dublin.  Will the Minister indicate whether he feels this is the way forward in the absence of a plan to manage hospital waste?  What action does he intend to take to ensure that we have a proper hospital waste management system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for giving me this opportunity of replying to this important question.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate that waste disposal in the health services in a manner that is safe, efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective has become a very difficult problem to resolve.  I am, therefore, glad to inform the House on behalf of the Minister for Health, that considerable progress is being made in tackling this problem, although there are still many difficulties to overcome, not least in the technical field.</P>
      <P>The approach of the Department of Health to solving the problem of disposal of health care waste is one which has four stages: putting in place an environmentally conscious health care waste policy; examination of the technical and organisational options for the treatment and final disposal of health care waste; preparation of a strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste on a nationwide basis and implementation, following consultations, of the strategic plan.</P>
      <P>The first stage has been completed and the policy document has been issued to health agencies.  The policy promotes good waste management practices, including prevention, reduction and segregation as well as the preparation of waste management plans by each hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The Department has carried out studies of best practice in management of health care waste in European hospitals and of final disposal methods used both in Europe and the United States.  A trial of one of the new disposal methods was carried out recently at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Following these studies and trial, a strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste has been circulated to the health agencies.  The plan proposes four central treatment facilities nationally, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, utilising one or more of the new technologies.</P>
    <P>A process of consultation with the <Col N="1128" /> health agencies is in progress in order to arrive at detailed implementation of plans which will give effect to the strategic plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is determined that a successful outcome will be achieved in relation to this process and I know the Deputy will appreciate that continuing vigilance will have to be exercised by everyone involved, to ensure that the anticipated satisfactory results are achieved.</P>

      <P>The SME Community Initiative offers a small fund of £22.9 million to Ireland over five years to fund developmental activity which complements mainline programmes. The broad agenda for this small fund is set by agreement between the Commission and the member state concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme for small business and services responding to some of the <Col N="963" /> recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business and the Task Force on Jobs in Services is being negotiated at present with the Commission.  To that degree, the programme reflects the detailed consultation with small business organisations during the tenure of the task forces.  This consultation now continues on a broad front with my Department's newly created Small Business and Services Division.</P>
    <P>New activity under this fund must, by definition, be additional to existing programmes and it is proposed to cover both manufacturing business and services sectors in the actions envisaged under the Small Business Operational Programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 70, 76, 119, 120, 124, 125, 126 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> The primary objective of the community employment programme is to provide opportunities for persons who are long term unemployed and on the live register and as such, persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are eligible to participate.  In addition, persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance are also an eligible category although they are not included on the live register. The question of whether or not a particular individual fulfils the eligibility criteria is, of course, a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>
    <P>The possible extension of the agreed eligibility criteria on a limited basis to allow participation by other categories of persons not on the live register is under consideration at present through the Interdepartmental Policy Committee for the Local Development Programme which operates under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department. Account will, of course, have to be taken of the cost implications of any such extension.  I would point out that resources for the programme are limited and extending the eligible categories means that more people are competing for the available opportunities.</P>
    <P>There were 32,865 participants on community employment on 30 September last of whom 27,761 had been in receipt of unemployment assistance immediately prior to their participation, 3,889 had been in receipt of unemployment benefit, 408 had been in receipt of lone parent's allowance and 807 were referred by the National Rehabilitation Board.  I am glad to note that the number of women benefiting from community employment has increased significantly when compared with its main predecessors, the social employment scheme &mdash; SES &mdash; and the Community Employment Development Programme &mdash; CEDP.  Of the 32,865 participants on community employment on 30 September last, 10,200 or about 30 per cent were women while the corresponding number last January was 5,688 or around 25 per cent of the then total <Col N="966" /> number of participants on the SES and the CEDP.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the targeting of community employment at particular categories of unemployed people is not contrary to the Community Support Framework.</P>

      <P>My Department has introduced a range of labour-employment legislation in the past five years, some of which was enacted to comply with EU Directives.  There are four Acts covering employment rights &mdash; the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.  For the benefit of the House, I am circulating details of this legislation.</P>
      <P>In the industrial relations area, my Department introduced the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  This Act provided for the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission and put in place a number of other measures to improve the framework for the conduct of industrial relations.  It also amended the laws relating to trade unions.</P>
      <P>As regards occupational safety and health matters, details of all legislation introduced in this area in the past five years are given in the Annual Reports of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health for the years 1990-93 inclusive.  In addition, three sets of regulations have been implemented during 1994 and details of these follow.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Employment Rights</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the employment rights area, the following individual Acts were introduced:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, which established a range of rights for all employees relating to the payment of wages;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, which extended the benefits of a range of protective legislation to regular part-time employees;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, which introduced certain technical and other changes to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, which requires employers to provide to employees a written statement of the terms of employment and any changes in those terms of employment. This Act was introduced to give effect to the provisions of Council Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship.  </P>
    <P>
      <i>Occupational Safety and Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash; European Communities (Classification, Packaging, Labelling and Notification of Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 77 of 1994). </P>
    <P>These regulations which came into effect on 7 April 1994 implement Council Directive 92/32/EEC of 30 April 1992, amending for the seventh time Directive 67/548/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances, together with seven other associated Commission Directives which adapt to technical progress the Annexes to, or which expand some of the provisions of, Council Directive 67/548/EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" />&mdash; European Communities Dangerous Substances and Preparations (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 79 of 1994). </P>
    <P>These regulations which came into effect on 6 April 1994 implement the requirements imposed in relation to the marketing and use of dangerous substances and preparations by EC Directives 89/677/EEC, 91/157/EEC, 91/173/EEC, 91/338/EEC, 91/339/EEC and 91/659/EEC which amend Council Directive 76/769/EEC.  The regulations also consolidate into a single text seven existing sets of regulations which previously gave effect to the first seven amendments to that Directive.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, (Biological Agents) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. 146 of 1994). </P>
    <P>These regulations which came into effect on 23 May 1994 implement Council Directives 90/679/EEC of 26 November 1990 &mdash; seventh individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC &mdash; and 93/88/EEC of 12 October 1993 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware these are early days yet in the affairs of county enterprise boards and some of the information sought such as the number of jobs actually created is not yet available.  This information will be available after the end of this year when it is proposed to publish an annual report.</P>
      <P>To date a total amount of £18.4 million has been approved by the 35 boards in respect of 2,100 projects which have a job potential of 3,224 full time and 877 part time jobs.  Of the projects approved approximately 400 are in respect of companies with the remainder broken down between individuals, partnerships, community groups and co-operatives.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to quantify the average investment per job but in terms of grant aid and taking two part time jobs as the equivalent of one full time job the average grant aid per job at approval stage is £5,000.</P>

      <P>Statutory minimum rates of pay, minimum holidays and other conditions of employment of certain workers employed in certain areas of the service sector are prescribed in Employment Regulation Orders made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals from Joint Labour Committees. At present, in so far as the service sector is concerned, Employment Regulation Orders are in operation in respect of certain workers employed in the following areas: catering, excluding Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire; contract cleaning, city and County of Dublin; hairdressing, Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire and Bray; hairdressing, Cork city; hotels, excluding Cork city, Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire; retail grocery and allied trades.</P>
      <P>Fast food outlets come within the scope of the Employment Regulation Order for catering establishments where such outlets serve hot food for consumption on the premises.  A Joint Labour Committee for catering establishments in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, which do not come within the scope of the existing Employment Regulation Order, has been established.  It is expected that the new committee will submit proposals for an Employment Regulation Order to the Labour Court in the near future.</P>
      <P>Employment Regulation Orders are enforced by the labour inspectors of my Department.  These inspectors have power to enter premises, inspect wage sheets and other records, interview the employer and workers concerned, recover arrears and, if necessary, take legal proceedings against an employer who is in breach of an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> Service sector employees, who are not covered by Employment Regulation Orders, have the same statutory entitlements as other employees under holidays, minimum notice and other employee protection legislation.  I am satisfied that adequate provisions exist under legislation to enable employees to secure their entitlements under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Holidays (Employees) Acts, 1973 and 1991 provide that any employee who considers that his-her employer has not complied with the provisions of that legislation may refer a complaint to my Department.  My Department will investigate the complaint and, where necessary, legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, would also apply in the case of service sector employees under the age of 18 years.  Complaints under this Act are fully investigated by my Department and, where necessary, legal proceedings may be instituted for breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Other Labour protection legislation such as the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977-1993, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-1991, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1993, would also apply to service sector employees, working under a contract of service, who fulfil the eligibility requirements of the relevant legislation.  These Acts make provision for an adjudication system to deal with complaints from employees in relation to alleged contraventions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Any employee who feels that his-her employer has contravened such legislation may refer a claim to the adjudicative authorities, i.e. the rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, for determination.  Where the findings of the adjudicative authorities are not implemented by the employer, the matter may be pursued, if necessary, through the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> On the question of safety representation, under section 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, all employees are entitled to select and appoint one of their number to act as a safety representative.  The rights of employees and their representatives to be consulted with regard to health and safety matters which are included in the 1989 Act are further enhanced by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993.  I am not aware of any cases in which these entitlements are being denied.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question of social insurance cover would be a matter appropriate to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made towards adopting the code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services; his views on whether this code could have been very helpful in recent industrial disputes and that every effort should be made to have the code adopted by all concerned without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission and published in January, 1992, aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of disputes.  The code places particular emphasis on the avoidance of disputes in essential services, with additional safeguards set out for inclusion in employer-trade union agreements in such services.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that adequate procedural arrangements should be in place and be followed if industrial relations are to be conducted in a professional manner.  Indeed, I have spoken many times previously in this House about the necessity to develop and enhance industrial relations procedures.  The promulgation of the code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, represented a very important development.  I would now encourage managements, employees and trade unions to take a fresh look at this code with a view to seeing what aspects of it could be moulded to the individual circumstances of their own organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for procedural safeguards in organisations providing essential services is widely acknowledged.  In some <Col N="975" /> organisations a fresh and critical examination of procedures may be overdue. This is an aspect of industrial relations practice that I have been particularly concerned about for some time.  I have been disappointed with the pace of progress towards the negotiation of more robust employer-trade union procedural agreements in these areas.  Recently, I have been encouraged, however, by the new conciliation and arbitration scheme agreed for the Civil Service and the manner in which it draws on the principles outlined in the code.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that I have had a series of meetings with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Relations Commission with a view to establishing a basis on which the negotiation of better procedures could be further encouraged, particularly in essential services.  These meetings were very positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>Arising from this consultative process, the Labour Relations Commission, under the auspices of its advisory service, now proposes to carry out a detailed review, over the coming months, involving managements and trade unions in a range of organisations providing essential services.  The purpose of the review will be to establish the potential for improving the procedures and processes used in dispute resolution.  I look forward to the ready co-operation of employers and trade unions with this process.</P>
    <P>The commission has undertaken to make available to me the outcome of this review as soon as it is completed.  I would hope that this could be as soon as the early part of 1995, although I am conscious that there will be many complex issues to be addressed during the course of this review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of good industrial relations in all sectors of the economy is, and always has been, a major priority in my Department.  Many initiatives have been taken in this regard over the years &mdash; one of the most significant in recent years being the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission.  Under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, the commission has been given general responsibility for promoting the improvement of industrial relations. The main services provided by the commission to improve industrial relations are the conciliation service and the industrial relations advisory service.</P>
      <P>The concilation service assists employers and workers to negotiate settlements of industrial disputes.  If disputes cannot be settled at conciliation they can be referred to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation. The recent establishment of industrial relations advisory service introduced a new dimension to industrial relations in this country.  The advisory service has as its central brief the prevention of disputes by means of promoting, advocating and assisting with the development of good industrial relations policies, practices and procedures. The services of the advisory service are provided jointly to management and unions on a confidential basis. Regular users of the labour relations commission's dispute settling services are monitored on an on-going basis to identify enterprises where the assistance of the advisory service is required.  Since it was established, the advisory service has been working with a number of semi-State companies with a view to improving industrial relations in those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the disputes in TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel some of the problems that arose are matters that fall to be dealt with by the trade union <Col N="977" /> movement in the first instance.  In this regard I welcome the recent announcement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that, as a result of those disputes, it has embarked on a review of its procedures.  This review is being carried out by a commission set up by congress and chaired by its President, Mr. Phil Flynn.  The commission will try to establish what went wrong in these two disputes and consider what can be done to ensure that the problems which arose in these cases do not arise again.  I look forward with interest to the outcome of this review and if congress requires any help or assistance from my Department I will ensure that full co-operation is given in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the disputes in TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel proved extremely difficult to resolve it would be wrong to suggest that this is indicative of a major deterioration in industrial relations generally or in the semi-State sector.  The downward trend in strike activity in recent years is being sustained in 1994. Only 18,500 work days were lost in 24 strikes in the first nine months of the year.  If this trend is continued for the remainder of the year, and present indications are that it will be, then 1994 will have the lowest number of strikes and work days lost since records began in 1923.  This major reduction in strike activity is happening at a time of unprecedented change in Irish industry.  It is clear, therefore, that management and unions, with the assistance of the services provided by the State, are largely succeeding in dealing with the industrial relations aspects of change without resort to industrial action.  The highly publicised disputes in TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel are exceptional and do not reflect what is happening in employment generally or indeed in the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>While significant improvements have been achieved in industrial relations in recent years we cannot afford to become complacent.  The primary responsibility for improving industrial relations in any enterprise rests with its management, trade unions and <Col N="978" /> employees.  I am confident that if all parties in semi-State enterprises make full use of the expert assistance provided by the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission and co-operate fully with it, further lasting improvements can be achieved in the conduct of industrial relations in these bodies.  My Department is in discussion with both the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission on an ongoing basis regarding possible improvements in the service that they provide.</P>

      <P>Telecom Éireann agreed to waive the requirement for (1) deposits and (2) personal guarantees where the applicant is willing to complete a direct debit mandate.  The ESB agreed to waive indemnity deposits for start-ups employing ten people or fewer, provided they pay by direct debit.  Neither organisation has plans to change this situation in the near future.  It should, however, be emphasised that this is subject to review.</P>

      <P>Forbairt and IDA Ireland, the two main operating industrial development agencies falling within my remit, have responsibility for creating and developing indigenous and overseas industries respectively.  In carrying out these functions, the agencies are required, <i>inter alia</i> to foster the national objective of regional industrial development and to continue the former IDA's mandate for balanced regional development.  This involves the provision of a focused service for creating new and expanding existing companies across the full range of commerical activities including management, product development, finance and a broad range of technological services. SFADCo and Údaras na Gaeltachta have specific regional remits in the mid west and Gaeltacht regions respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist them in their objective, both main operating agencies have a network of regional staff.  A regions division has been established within Forbairt to co-ordinate that agency's regional activities and this has been followed by the recent appointment of eight regional directors. The presence of these new directors and their terms in the regional offices will enhance Forbairt's regional dimension and serve to strengthen the agency's role at regional level.  IDA Ireland is also represented at regional level.  The operating agencies, in consultation and in co-operation with FÁS and ABT, will have a key role in developing the strengths of individual regions and specific initiatives which need to be undertaken to achieve greater economic development at local level.  These agencies, at regional level, will work in tandem with local organisations including county enterprise boards, <i>Programme</i><Col N="980" /><i>for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships and community groups to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to such local development. The overall aim of all these organisations is the development of a region's competitive advantages which will contribute to both attracting new investment and helping existing regional enterprises to expand and grow.</P>
    <P>To support them in their task of regional development, the Government, through the relevant agencies-bodies, provides infrastructure in the regions. This includes serviced industrial sites and buildings, transport facilities, telecommunications, education and training.</P>

    <P>The community employment programme was introduced last April as a replacement for the social employment scheme, the community employment development programme and Teamwork.

    <P>*  Complete data in respect of 1993 is not yet available due to late registration of apprentices by employers but indications are that the 1993 intake figure is around 3,000.</P>
    <P>Such factors, coupled with the lead time of apprentice training creates considerable difficulty in matching the supply of and demand for apprenticeships, but there is concern that adequate numbers of apprentices should be recruited in each year in order to avoid skill shortages in the labour market at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is commitment to a process of improving the matching of supply and demand for apprentices, as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress and Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and the national apprenticeship advisory committee (set up to oversee the implementation of the new standards-based apprenticeship) is at present examining this issue.  In the meantime, all designated apprenticeships are being actively promoted by FÁS and I would again call on employers as I have done on many previous occasions to focus not just on their immediate needs but to take account of future needs in deciding on their apprenticeship recruitment levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 69 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the answer which I gave to Parliamentary Question No. 93 on Thursday, 13 October 1994.  That reply drew attention <Col N="985" /> to the fact that the cost of insurance is determined by the cost of claims and further stated that my Department is at present finalising proposals which seek to address the current relatively high cost of claims in this country as compared to competing economies.</P>
    <P>The House should also be aware from the earlier reply that decisions on legislative initiatives to implement these proposals, which cover both the cost of personal injury compensation and the overhead costs associated with the settlement of personal injury claims, are a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a statutory Insurance Ombudsman's office. For the information of the House the insurance industry has already established an ombudsman service which is similar to that in operation for other financial services such as banking. Although funded by the insurers this service reports, not to the insurers, but to a council which is composed mainly of persons independent of the insurance industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much in this study entitled <i>Taxes on Labour in Ireland and the United Kingdom</i> which I can identify with.  The study examines the principle differences between the Irish and British systems for taxing labour. The broad thrust of the summary and conclusions of the report is that economic policy in respect of the exchange rate, pay and taxation must take cognisance of the complicated web of trading relations with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I would agree with the <Col N="986" /> report's conclusion that competitiveness is the key to raising out put and expanding employment in the Irish economy and this is an issue at the top of my priorities.  I would also identify with the emphasis which the authors of the report attach to trading relations with Britain and the consequent importance of the exchange rate with Sterling. Maintaining the competitiveness of pay levels in Ireland with those in the United Kingdom is an important guideline for pay policy.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides for moderate levels of pay increases for this country up until 1997, which should help to secure the objective of maintaining wage competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the analysis in the report found that the direct tax burden in Ireland is significantly higher in the case of single people and also for married couples where both spouses are working.  The report concludes that to re-integrate larger numbers of the unemployed back into the labour market, it is desirable that the taxation burden on earned income be reduced.  This Government is aware that the share of revenues deriving from the taxation of earned income in Ireland has increased substantially over the past two decades. It is indisputable that our income tax regime bears heavily on modest incomes.  The 48 per cent tax rate comes into play at a relatively low threshold in the case of single people.</P>
    <P>Reform of the taxation system to achieve a reduction in the tax wedge has been a priority of this Government.  It is obvious that substantial costs are involved in making any significant improvement in the income tax and PRSI codes.  Nevertheless, in this year's budget, this Government addressed this issue by making considerable concessions to low paid employees.  An exemption from both the 1.25 per cent health levy and the 1 per cent employment and training levy for those in receipt of incomes not greater than £9,000 a year was introduced in the budget.  Also, the Government introduced a tiered system of employers' <Col N="987" /> PRSI with a reduced rate of 9 per cent applying to incomes up to £173 per week equivalent to £9,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The provisions included in the 1994 budget as I have outlined were intended to address in part the overall imbalance between UK and Irish labour costs. Accordingly, I intend keeping under constant review those factors which contribute to the imbalance between UK and Irish labour costs including the differentials between UK and Irish income tax and PRSI structures.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to continuing progress along the road of tax reform and improving competitiveness. I would, however, have to caution against an exaggerated view of what tax reform on its own can achieve in resolving our economic problems. Tax reform measures can, at best, be only a part of a wider response to the employment challenge.</P>

      <P>Our relatively high level of long term unemployment (approaching 50 per cent) is the result of two types of factor, firstly, factors contributing to high unemployment generally and, secondly, factors specific to long term unemployment.</P>
      <P>The reasons behind our high level of unemployment have been well analysed and documented.  These include cyclical factors such as developments in our external markets as well as the deeper, structural reasons such as the shake-out in agriculture which still continues, the continuing high levels of new entrants to the labour market, and factors which have weakened job performance on the industrial front, particularly those which were highlighted in the Culliton and Moriarty reports.</P>
      <P>Factors which impact more specifically on long term unemployment include competition for jobs from new entrants to the labour market and, in many cases, education and skill deficiencies of the unemployed.  It is a fact that those who are a long time out of employment experience particular difficulty availing of whatever job vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>The Government focus in addressing this particular problem is threefold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, the economic policies of Government are directed at creating the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the economy; secondly, the Government is adopting a focussed approach to meeting the needs of the unemployed in terms of their reintegration into the labour market; thirdly, additional measures to tackle long term unemployment are <Col N="990" /> being implemented.  The Government is adopting an integrated approach, combining work experience, training, counselling and placement, to assist the reintegration of the long term unemployed into the labour market.  Community employment, both as a national programme and as a key element of the Government's local development programme, is an essential response in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is far too early yet to say what the prospects are of the company becoming involved with Irish Steel.  However, I am confident that, as a result of the recent agreement reached with the workforce in Irish Steel on restructuring and the introduction of new work practices and with new State investment in the company, the possibilities of attracting private sector involvement in Irish Steel are greatly increased.  I should, of course, say that before the State investment can be made the approval of the European Commission and all member states must first be received.  There is nothing automatic about getting this unanimous approval and a lot will depend on the quality of the Irish Steel business plan which must convince the Commission and the other Member States that Irish Steel can operate as a viable entity.</P>

A total of 115 merger or take-over proposals were notified to me in this period in accordance with section 5 of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 as amended.  Of these 58 did not fall within the scope of the Acts and one was withdrawn.</P>

    <P>The number of mergers or take-overs notified is affected by a range of factors, including economic conditions.

I am not, therefore, in a position to estimate the number of merger notifications which I could expect when <Col N="995" /> the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994 is enacted.

      <P>I am aware of the significance of the issue of late payment to the small business sector in Ireland. In particular, the cash flow implication <Col N="997" /> of late payment must be seen as unmistakeably contributing to the existing patterns of business failure.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year in his budget speech, the Minister for Finance, reflecting the Government's commitment to stimulate employment, announced that from 6 April 1994 a reduced PRSI rate of 9 per cent would be levied on incomes up to £173 per week.  Above £173 the normal rate of 12.2 per cent would apply on all income, subject to a weekly ceiling of £496.  In addition, the Minister for Finance announced that, as part of the Government's concern to improve the position of low income earners, an exemption would be introduced from both the 1.25 per cent health levy and the 1 per cent employment and training levy for those in receipt of incomes not greater than £9,000 per year for the self-employed and £173 per week for employees. <Col N="998" /> Moreover, in order to reduce employment costs for lower paid jobs, the Minister for Finance proposed the removal of the obligation on employers to pay these levies in respect of employees with medical cards.  I am confident that the above measures will help job maintenance and creation by reducing the tax wedge in certain areas and easing pressure on payroll costs.  These measures are also intended to reduce the employment costs of Irish enterprises against competition from overseas, particularly the UK, and in this context I am keeping this situation under continual review.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, a number of organisational and financing measures have recently been put in place which will help enterpreneurs to expand their businesses which should then lead to an increase in the number of their workforce. For example: the ICC loan subsidy scheme is making £100 million in subsidised loans available to small and medium sized enterprises since February 1994.  Such types of facilities have long been requested by entrepreneurs and their representatives and, I am glad to say, are now available.</P>
      <P>Since late last year a nationwide network of county enterprise boards has been established to provide funding and commercial assistance to new and expanding enterprises employing up to ten employees, and it is expected that this initiative will result in many more business start ups throughout the country, with consequent increased job opportunities.  The creation earlier this year of a separate agency, Forbairt, to concentrate on the development of indigenous industry will, I am sure, make a valuable contribution to increasing the numbers in the workforce over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of venture capital and similar type funding has been substantially improved by the emergence of such initiatives as the Smurfit Job Creation Enterprise Fund and other seed-venture capital initiatives.  In addition, my Department is currently in negotiation with the relevant parties to <Col N="999" /> agree how EU structural funds can best be used to augment the availability of venture capital to Irish firms.</P>
    <P>I also note that the Associated Banks have introduced a number of loan schemes over the past year which are particularly tailored towards the needs of small firms.  I welcome this development and would like to see it continue and expand.  As a result of this Government's concern regarding the development of small business, a Task Force on Small Business was established during 1993.  The report of this task force was presented to me earlier this year, and I have established a specific unit in my Department to address both the many recommendations of this report and to promote the further development of service industry in this country.  I would hope that, over time, the activities of this unit will help in reducing the operational costs of small business, and the creation of further employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to reducing the cost of employment and encourage entrepreneurs to expand their businesses. The overall business environment is continually under review and if new or additional measures are thought necessary, these will be introduced as appropriate.</P>

Ways in which the issue might be progressed, consistent with our voluntarist tradition in industrial relations, have recently <Col N="1000" /> been the subject of discussions within the context of the Central Review Committee. Officials of my Department participated in these talks.</P>
      <P>In my discussions with both employers and unions I am seeking to promote and encourage the idea that new forms of management-employee relations simply have to be part of the wider enterprise dynamic.  It is my objective to bring all relevant groupings &mdash; shareholder, management and workforce &mdash; to develop new relationships, founded on open and clear lines of communication, involving appropriate information and consultation about the business on a partnership basis.  I do not believe that this adjustment can be brought about by fiat or by the imposition of regulations, but by progressing in partnership.</P>

      <P>I would not agree that the take up of funding for cross-Border projects under the first INTERREG programme was disappointing, particularly since it was the first structural fund programme of its kind.

    <P>The guidelines for the new INTERREG Programme place a considerable emphasis on cross-Border co-operative projects under the new programme.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer concerned applied for a repayment of tax while unemployed stating on his application that he was in receipt of unemployment benefit, which is a taxable payment.  The inspector of taxes advised him on 3 October 1994 that no refund was due to him as his stated unemployment benefit exceeded his weekly taxfree allowance.</P>
      <P>However, in response to this inquiry, the inspector has confirmed with the local Department of Social Welfare employment office that the taxpayer is, in fact, in receipt of unemployment assistance which is not taxable.  Based on this information the inspector has now dealt with a repayment of tax in the amount of £224.85 which will issue to the taxpayer shortly.</P>

      <P>The amount of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is determined by a health board so as to leave the recipient with a post-rent income appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.  Those in receipt of payments at the supplementary welfare allowance level contribute not more than £6 towards their accommodation costs while those on higher payments pay the £6 minimum plus the difference between the supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to their family size and the corresponding rate of their particular payment.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that the couple concerned was in receipt of a monthly rent supplement of £226.40 which was calculated on the husband's income from invalidity pension.  His wife was awarded a carer's allowance from my Department in March 1992.  However, the health board did not become aware of this until April 1993.  The level of rent supplement in payment was reduced to £160 per month in August 1993 to take account of additional income from the carer's allowance and the increase in the income of the household following the July 1993 rates increase.  The supplement was recalculated further to take account of the 1994 July rates increases and the increase in the minimum contribution from £5 to £6 from the end of July 1994.  The person concerned has been advised that her supplement will be £147.60 per month from 2 November 1994.</P>
      <P>I am keen to ensure that those receiving carer's allowance should be supported in every possible way in this work.  I am currently reviewing the position of those in receipt of carer's allowance with regard to their entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the SWA scheme.</P>

      <P>Child dependant increases are payable up to age 18 and, for claimants of long term social welfare payments, including long term unemployment assistance, up to age 21 where the child is in full time education.</P>
      <P>The age limit was extended from 18 to 21 years for those in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate over the period 1989 to 1991.  The extension was in recognition of the particular financial difficulties of people who are long term unemployed.  The child in question attained 18 years on 3 October 1994 and payment of child dependant increase ceased on that date.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the payment of child dependant increases with unemployment benefit for children over 18 years of age who are participating in third level education would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that the determination of the purchase price of ground rents by arbitration by the Land Registry is governed by section 7 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1984.  Under that section a distinction is made between leases which have more or less than 15 years to run and that generally where the lease has less than 15 years to run the price payable is at its highest reflecting the increasing potential pecuniary interest of the landlord in the property.  I am informed that the intention of the provision was to have due regard for the property rights of both ground rent landlord and ground rent tenant within the context of constitutional requirements.</P>

It is possible of course that a full check of the available records would show that there were some but I think that it can safely be said that such applications, if there are any, would be extremely rare. <Col N="1006" /> I would of course agree that any person who seeks asylum arising out of torture should, of course, receive every possible treatment to recover from ill-treatment.

      <P>The difficulties which arose in TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel were not due to any identifiable defects in the official mechanism provided by the State to assist in resolving industrial disputes.  In both cases the disputes were eventually resolved on the basis of proposals recommended by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>These disputes, which arose from proposals for extensive changes and cost cutting measures in both enterprises, were by their nature extremely complex and difficult to resolve.  The State's dispute settling agencies, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission worked extremely hard in difficult circumstances to bring about a resolution of both disputes.  The difficulties encountered in resolving these disputes could not be attributed to any defects in the manner in which the matters were dealt with by these bodies.</P>
      <P>Arising from these disputes, however, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has embarked on a review of its procedures. I welcome this initiative and await its outcome with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for good industrial relations and resolving disputes in any <Col N="1011" /> enterprise rests primarily with its management, employees and unions.  The Labour Relations Commission provides an Industrial Relations Advisory Service which assists employers and Unions to develop good industrial relations policies, practices and procedures.  Since it was established, the advisory service has assisted enterprises in both the public and private sectors to improve the manner in which they conduct their industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I would add that our statistics for strikes and man-days lost for 1994 to date are the best since we started collecting such statistics in the early 1920s.</P>

      <P>The question of funding for this scheme, and for water and sewerage services projects generally, has been considered in the context of the resources available under the National Development Plan.  The high level of existing commitments, and the demands of schemes already prioritised for investment, account for all finance available to the water services programme at present.  It is not therefore possible to provide funding for this scheme at this stage.  This position will, however, be regularly reviewed during the period of the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>The reply to Question No. 127 of 14 April 1944 gives details of rate support grant allocations for the years 1987 and 1993.  The information requested in respect of 1978 is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Because of the introduction of 100 per cent capital grants in 1988 for a variety of services, and the elimination of loan repayments and subsidies on capital loans written off by the Exchequer, there was a significant technical once-off reduction in the rate support grant allocation in 1988 which carries through in subsequent years.  Other adjustments have also been made over the years to take account of the elimination of levies, and the transfer of certain costs to the Exchequer.  As a result, the allocations set out in the following table for the years 1979 to 1987 are not comparable with those for the 1988 to 1993 period. It should be noted also that the rate support grant is but one source of grant aid from my Department to local authorities. Therefore, cognisance must be taken of increases in other grant allocations in assessing the overall position. For example, road grants from my Department have been increased from £53 million in 1980 to £301 in 1994.</P>

      <P>Specific road grants are not generally made available to local authorities for public lighting.  In the case of Cork Corporation, substantial State support for public lighting has been made available through the 100 per cent grants for improvement projects on national roads in the area and through a nationwide programme for the replacement of obsolete lanterns on these roads.  In the case of non-national roads in Cork, the discretionary State grants to the corporation have been increased to £1.3 million in 1994, an increase of £0.39 million or 42 per cent on last year's figure.  These grants can be used by the Corporation, at their discretion, to finance improved public lighting.</P>

      <Quest>if the eligibility of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford for a suckler cow quota and payment for 1993 will be reconsidered in view of the fact that he could not change from the friesian breed of cows as required to do by his Department because his farm was locked up arising from an outbreak of potential TB reactors and the local DVO denied him the opportunity of applying for the cow suckler grant; if some arrangement can be made for him to allow some benefit under the scheme for 1993 in view of the fact that his Department also has records that he did have these suckler cows for the particular year in question.</Quest>

      <P>Some ferry companies have ceased carrying animals from Ireland to the Continent because of pressure from animal welfare interests.  However, progress has been made in putting in place alternative transport arrangements and animals are continuing to be exported to continental markets.  The action of the ferry companies has had no significant impact on the prices of calves and weanlings.  Animals leaving Ireland are subject to stringent welfare controls.</P>
      <P>An EU proposal containing detailed rules for the welfare of animals being transported, and which it was hoped would provide a basis for the resumption of normal trade by the shippers, was discussed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers yesterday but agreement was not reached on the issue.  The matter will be considered again in the future.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for grants on ten animals under the November 1993 ten month special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>He did not submit a 1993 area aid application, however and as a result could be considered for payment on up to 15 reckonable livestock units only according to the relevant EU Regulations. Unfortunately, his large milk quota took up all these livestock units, leaving him ineligible for premium on any of his cattle.</P>

      <P>For many years I have considered that there is a vital need for a school of music in Galway and I have studied a number of position papers on how this might be achieved.  As a Deputy for Galway I have held several discussions with local interests and agencies to encourage the establishment of such a school.  These discussions have included the possibility of Galway Regional Technical College offering a music course at third level. My Department has made representations to the Minister for Education (as part of her preparation of the White Paper on Education) in regard to all of the arts, including music, in the educational system.  The decision to provide the resources for a school of music in Galway is a matter for the Department of Education.  I have had discussions with the Minister for Education and will be in further discussion with her after the publication of the White Paper on Education regarding the provision of practical music courses throughout the country.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the waiting list initiative 1994 a total of £850,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.</P>
    <P>In addition, a sum of £400,000 was allocated to the Western Health Board this year in respect of the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has issued to the Board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and consultant anaesthetist together with the necessary support staff.  This should help reduce the overall waiting time for orthopaedic patients within the Western Health Board area.</P>
