      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton.  I call on Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <P>I request permission to debate a motion regretting the confusion caused by ministerial statements about EC aid and calling on the Government to submit a revised schedule for the timing of projects under the National Development Plan to the Comptroller and Auditor General for a value for money audit so that lasting benefits will be guaranteed to accrue to the Irish people for all investments made.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11, 12, 2 and 8, No. 8 to be taken immediately after Question Time.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) The proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 11 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; (2) the debate on No. 8 shall not exceed one hour and the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and (ii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be <Col N="1463" /> called upon to reply not less than five minutes before the debate is due to conclude; (3) Business shall not be interrupted until the conclusion of the proceedings on No. 8; (4) the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m. to take statements on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the statement of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (ii) a Minister shall be called upon not later than 3.40 p.m. to make a concluding statement not exceeding 20 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party informed your office, we will be moving a motion under Standing Order 102 to have this Bill recommitted because it does not apply retrospectively and will not apply to cases in the pipeline.  That is unsatisfactory. The 1987 Act applied retrospectively and this legislation should do likewise.  A person should not be allowed claim the political offence exception for murderous acts.</P>

      <P>Will the Government agree to two hours for this debate?  The Fine Gael Party has tabled a motion seeking a value for money audit for the revised National Development Plan to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We believe it is necessary in view of the persistent lack of candour and economy with the truth of ministerial statements on this matter.  I would be grateful if the Government would agree to extend the time by an hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on the Order of Business yesterday that tomorrow's debate should be about the National Development Plan.  It does not make sense to debate the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which is largely based on the National Development Plan and the money it is claimed will be received from Europe.  I propose an amendment, that the words <i>&ldquo;Programme for Competitiveness and Work&rdquo;</i> be deleted and replaced by &ldquo;National Development Plan&rdquo;.  We should spend tomorow's time debating that issue.</P>

      <P>It is important to put on the record that the request for the debate tomorrow came from Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.  It is a little naive to come in at the last moment to try to change the debate.  The Government is responding to a reasonable request.  I would point out to Deputy Bruton that the Government has no intention of carrying out very intricate technical negotiations in public, through the media.  It is a matter for the Government and the Commission and when we have discussed the matter we will come back and inform the House exactly where we stand.</P>

      <P>The Government is right to look for a private investor, it is badly needed.  I sought to raise this matter another way; I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether he was aware of the proposals to have a private investor and he said he was not.  I am concerned that the Taoiseach is not on top of what is happening in the country.  There is little point in the Tánaiste flying a socialist flag&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Harney rightly raised a question in a supplementary yesterday, I said the Government had no proposals before it nor was I aware of any proposal.  The Deputy is correct, I was not aware of any such proposal until 9.30 last night.</P>

However, will anyone on that side of the House deny that, to secure the future success of Telecom Éireann, there is a need to get into strategic alliances to ensure the company keeps up with world communications and technology, a sensible way to protect the vital interests of Telecom Éireann and its workforce?</P>

In view of the fact that a man was released and was not extradited earlier in the week because the relevant judge decided that section 4 of the existing Act did not extend to him, would the Taoiseach consider delaying consideration of Report Stage of this Bill until next week so that the Opposition could be afforded an opportunity to consider the High Court judgment?</P>

Neither the Government nor this House can have any control over the type of publicity surrounding any particular allegation or charge against any person.  That was one of the grounds on which the judge found that the chances of a fair trial for the person concerned were certainly in doubt.  That is not an issue which can be dealt with under this Bill.  Rather it deals with the other loopholes in legislation.  It is important that its provisions be implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The matters are very technical.  Amendments tabled by my party to section 1 of the Bill on Report Stage this morning have been disallowed because the issues raised in section 1 (2) and (3) did not arise in the proceedings on Committee Stage.  However, in the period between Committee and Report Stages there has been an important High Court decision as to the nature and effect of section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, which decision casts <Col N="1482" /> section 1 of this Bill in an entirely different light.  That is the reason we have tabled this motion.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) and (3) of section 1 deal with the issue of retrospectivity.  In this Bill it is proposed, in short, that the new definition of a &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; shall not apply retrospectively in some cases but shall apply retrospectively in a number of other cases.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes in section 1 (2) that nobody who has been the subject of a decision under the existing defective statute law on the issue of whether his or her offence is &ldquo;political&rdquo;, or an offence connected with a political offence, may be extradicted when this Bill becomes law, even though it will provide that offences of that type shall not thereafter be regarded as &ldquo;political&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In section 1 (3) the provision of the Bill goes even further, to exclude from the new definition of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; any person who is currently the subject of an extradition request under Part II of the 1965 Act, which deals with international extradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have wasted time already.  I would have been half way though my statement had I been allowed to continue.  Section 1 (3) goes on to exclude from the new definition of political offence any person who is currently the subject of an extradition request under Part II of the 1965 Act which deals with international extradition or is the subject matter of a warrant issued and capable of being dealt with under Part III of the 1965 Act.  It should be noted that the proposed exclusions are not limited to cases where court proceedings have actually commenced here.  They also exclude cases which are at a preliminary stage such as being considered by the Minister under Part II or being vetted as we speak by the Attorney General under the provisions of the 1987 amendment Act.</P>
      <P>The effect of section 1 (2) and (3) is to render immune from extradition an unknown number of unidentified persons in respect of an unknown category of serious offences including terrorist offences.  The Minister may know the identity of some of these people, the Attorney General may know the identity of others, but the full category cannot be identified because the number of warrants issued, and to which section 1 (3) (b) applies, is incapable of verification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed provisions are quite arbitrary in their effect.  For instance, if two persons are accused or suspected of participating in a terrorist murder in England or Northern Ireland and if one of <Col N="1484" /> them has successfully relied on the existing defective legislation which defines a political offence in the courts but the other is first brought to the court after the new Bill becomes law, then it is not only possible but probable that one will be extradited while the other, who might be the ringleader or the moving party in the murder, goes free.</P>
    <P>More serious still, by enacting section 1 in its present form, for all we know very serious offences now in the pipeline or on the Attorney General's desk, will result in a failure to extradite.  It is because the Minister cannot or will not disclose to this House the identity of all persons affected or the offences for which they are sought.  We could be excluding from extradition the murderers at Warrington, Birmingham, Guildford or Bishopsgate.</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly know what the actual effect of section 1 will be.  We do not know how many warrants would be affected by section 1 (3) (b), nor, indeed, will we be consulted or informed if existing warrants are quietly cancelled in Britain and new ones issued to circumvent that provision.  Is that the way to legislate for this very serious matter?</P>
    <P>This section will, for instance, have effect in the case of Joseph Magee, a case which was decided between Committee Stage and today.  If that decision is not appealed to the Supreme Court, as appears probable, then, although the offence outlined in that case would fall four-square into the First Schedule in this Bill, no action can be taken on the extradition front in respect of it.  If other persons are sought in respect of the same killing after the Bill becomes law &mdash; there were three people involved in the killing of Sergeant Newman in Derby &mdash; they will become liable to extradition while Mr. Magee remains free in Ireland.  So this issue is not academic.</P>
    <P>As far as the law is concerned, I can see that the Minister has some difficulties. However, I do not see that the provisions before us are necessary or desirable from a constitutional point of view.  The case of Sloan and Others <i>v.</i> Culligan decided by the Supreme Court in November 1991 <Col N="1485" /> made it clear that it is competent for this Legislature to withdraw the political offence exception from terrorist murders, whether they happened before or after the legislation which changes the definition of political offence.  In other words, retrospectivity has already been challenged in the Supreme Court in the Sloan case and has been upheld by that court.</P>
    <P>In that case, it was decided that the constitutional prohibition in Article 15.5 on retrospecitve criminalisation of acts did not apply to retrospective divestment of political status for offences in extradition law.  Dealing with section 3 of the 1987 Act, with which this Bill also deals, the Supreme Court said:</P>
    <P>Section 3 merely makes a statutory amendment to what was a developing jurisdiction concerning the definition of a political offence for the purposes of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended. I do not create any offence or any infringement of the law in our jurisdiction. The court is satisfied that the provisions of Article 15.5 of the Constitution are an expressed and unambiguous prohibition against the enactment of retrospective laws declaring Acts to be an infringement of the law.  It does not contain any general prohibition on retrospection on legislation. Nor can it by any means be interpreted as a general prohibition.</P>
    <P>The different question that now arises is whether it is competent for this Legislature to withdraw political status from an offence where the courts have, by reference to a previous defective definition, already ruled that the offence was political.</P>
    <P>In Sloan's case, the Supreme Court also considered the issue whether the retrospective effect of section 3 of the 1987 Act infringed constitutional rights other than those expressly protected by the Constitution.  The Supreme Court rejected the argument that it did on the basis that the:</P>
    <P>right of the plaintiff as of every other citizen concerning the question of his <Col N="1486" /> delivery into another state for the purpose of reserving a sentence lawfully imposed on him in that State, was, the court is satisfied, a right at any time to proper, due and fair procedures concerning an investigation of the validity of the warrant in respect of which he is delivered, and to a fair and proper and due inquiry into the protections applicable in law, within the State at the time of the application for its delivery, which may afford him a protection arising from the concept of a political offence...</P>
    <P>In short, the court held that our rights amount to an entitlement of due application of the law as it exists for the time being in relation to the political offence to extradition.  If the issue in such &ldquo;political cases&rdquo; is simply whether the law for the time being allows or prohibits extradition, then one must ask why it is now argued that once that issue has been resolved by reference to one statutory definition, it cannot be subsequently reopened by reference to another, and later, statutory definition.</P>
    <P>While there may be an argument that the Legislature cannot retrospectively alter the outcome of a court case without infringing the constitutional separation of powers along the lines of the decision in the Sinn Féin funds case, there is no constitutional principle which requires the law to discriminate between the liabilities of those who successfully relied on the provisions of a superseded statute and the liabilities of those who were never so tested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill makes it quite clear, that, when it comes into force, murder can never be a political offence.  The Bill will apply generally to offences committed before it comes into operation. However, it will not apply retrospectively to a case where the matter has come before the court and the court has decided that in the particular circumstances in question the offence was a political one.  This matter is dealt with by section 1 (2).</P>
      <P>In considering legislation in this House I do not think it would be appropriate for us to discuss how the Bill will affect the case of a named individual, particularly when that case may appear before the Supreme Court in the future.  Subsection (2) was not drafted with any particular case in mind.  It was included because it was considered that serious constitutional issues would be raised of the Legislature in introducing a Bill which proported to directly overrule specific decisions of the High Court or Supreme Court.  I do not consider that it is appropriate under the Constitution for the Legislature to intervene with the intent to deprive a person of his or her liberty and deliver him or her up to a foreign jurisdiction after the courts in this jurisdiction has considered the matter and decided that the person in question should not be extradited and should be set free.  I have already made it clear that I think murder should never be a political offence but I respect the independence of the courts and I would not like to be seen to be attempting to interfere with any specific case decided by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) deals with cases where extradition proceedings have been initiated and are still within the judicial domain.  In the case of Buckley<i>v.</i> Attorney General 1950 IR67 it was held that under Article 34.1 of the Constitution the judicial process was inviolable <Col N="1490" /> while in actual operation.  To delete subsection (3) might well be regarded as, and I quote from the court decision, &ldquo;an unwarrantable interference by the Oireachtas with the operations of the courts in a purely judicial domain&rdquo; and call into question the entire constitutionality of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is an attempt to apply the provisions of the Bill to cases which are currently before the courts or to cases where the courts have already made a decision.  To say the least, the constitutionality of such an approach is very suspect.  Therefore, I am opposing the recommittal of the Bill.</P>

      <P>May I raise a point of order?  I suggest the best way to deal with this matter is for the House to adjourn consideration of this Bill at this stage.  I wish to make three brief points.  First, the judge ruled on the basis of a District Court procedure, that is something we need to look at.  Second, because of pre-trial publicity the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the Attorney General in Britain must take responsibility &mdash; I mentioned this on Second and Committee Stages &mdash; for this man not being extradited because of pre-trial publicity in that jurisdiction which would not be allowed in this jurisdiction.  Third, in the view of the judge, section 4 did not meet the test that the assassin created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons.  I raised the matter of the plural, persons, on Committee Stage and I have serious reservations about this.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 3. Amendments Nos. 6 and 20 form a related composite proposal. I suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 3, 6 and 20 together, by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash; Where a request is received for the extradition of a person from the State, the requesting state shall be required to provide, before the District Court, evidence in written form as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence or offences for which extradition is sought, and extradition shall not be granted unless such evidence produced <Col N="1495" /> establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of involvement in the offence or offences alleged.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter was the subject of considerable debate on Committee Stage and when the legislation was passed in 1987.  Since 1986 we have had three Acts dealing with extradition.  This reflects the degree to which extradition has been regarded as politically sensitive and approached in a tentative way.  There may be a necessity for a fourth Bill unless we address the issue which has arisen since we last discussed this question, namely, the case dealt with in the High Court during the past week, which is highly relevant.</P>
    <P>In that case the court decided not to proceed with extradition on three grounds: because of the way the procedures was followed in the District Court, because the offence was considered a political and because the accused might suffer as a result of prejudicial comment in the British press.  My principal concern is not the extent to which the court procedures were followed, although many members of the public wonder why a technicality should be so important in such a serious case.</P>
    <P>The political nature of the offence is central to this legislation.  When it is signed into law the offence in this case will no longer be regarded as political. It will not be possible to make the case in court that the shooting of a policeman or soldier, irrespective of the way it was carried out, constitutes a political offence.  I found it offensive that because an illegal organisation claimed responsibility for the crime it was used to support the argument it was a political offence.  It beats me how &mdash; what the judge called a well planned assassination &mdash; could be regarded as a political offence.</P>
    <P>We must give consideration to the question of prejudicial comment.  It is perfectly in order for the courts to take the view that if what passes for journalism &mdash; cheap, monosyllabic racist commentary which is a feature of some <Col N="1496" /> sections of the British tabloid press &mdash; would prejudice the case of a peson he should not be extradited.  If a <i>prima facie</i> case is established in such a case there is an obligation on us to ensure that the person concerned is tried in this jurisdiction. The accused should not walk free because of prejudicial comment in the British press.  Where extradition is refused on this ground the person should be tried in this jurisdiction for the offence.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I propose there should be a requirement to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case before an extradition warrant is granted.  The procedure is that an extradition warrant is presented to the Attorney General who considers the matter in private and decides whether there are sufficient grounds on which to proceed with extradition.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that matters of this kind should be decided by any officer of the State, the Attorney General or otherwise, in private, they should be decided in open court.  The argument has been made, not only on this occasion but in previous debates, that the Attorney General is not the appropriate officer to deal with this matter.  We have to make up our minds whether it should be decided in the courts or in the political domain. It is the responsibility of politicians and the legislature to decide the basis on which extradition should be granted and the rules that should apply.  It should not be decided in the political or quasipolitical domain.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is the Government's law officer; it is a political appointment and very often there is a change on the appointment of a new Taoiseach or Government.  On some occasions the Attorney General has been a Member of a House of the Oireachtas.  There is a necessity to ensure that extradition applications are not decided in the political domain; they should be decided in the judicial domain where the application is considered in open court.  The Attorney General should not consider the issue in private.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a necessity for this country to have extradition arrangements. <Col N="1497" /> Somebody accused of a serious crime, what is classified as normal crime or terrorist offences, should not have the right to walk free by returning to this jurisdiction.  The political justification for crime has an honourable history and was born out of the idea that those who engaged in struggles against oppressive regimes should not be sent back if they sought refuge in another state.  However, we now live in a world where it is possible for a terrorist to place a bomb in the centre of London and to be back in Ireland before that bomb explodes.</P>
    <P>We need extradition arrangements that ensure that people cannot simply walk away from crimes.  We also need to ensure that there are safeguards in our extradition laws, that it is not a process that is used willy-nilly but is used and seen to be used carefully.  That is why it should be a primary requirement to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case that extradition is justified, and that case should be established in court and not by private examination by the Attorney General of documents presented to him.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to repeat everything that was said during the long discussion we had on Committee Stage when I put this to a vote and found myself in a minority. Deputy Harte told me that I may have created parliamentary history because it was the first division in the history of the House where only one Member voted for the proposition.  It is certainly a far cry from the exciting times of 1986 and 1987 when the same proposition was decided on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not know if I can hope for a greater degree of support for this proposition than I got on Committee Stage, but one never knows; a lot of water has passed under the bridge since Committee Stage so I live in hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name is similar to that tabled by my party in 1987.  It calls for a procedure in the High Court by way of affidavit to show probable cause.  Extradition is not a simple process divorced in any way from civil liberties.  There are very real constitutional and justice issues at stake.  It <Col N="1498" /> is up to us to get it right and not cede ground on civil liberties.  That is why the Progressive Democrats consistently argued for the introduction and maintenance of fair and effective safeguards against arbitrary or oppressive demands for extradition.</P>
      <P>The present system, which involves the Attorney General vetting warrants, is inferior to the more transparent judicial procedure which we propose.  Advice given to successive Governments on this issue has been defective in that it failed to distinguish between Irish citizens in respect of whom we can insist on evidence and others in respect of whom we cannot now insist on evidence without denouncing the 1957 Convention.  The best safeguard against automatic extradition of citizens without a sound evidential base is to require that an affidavit be submitted to the High Court to show the outline of the evidence against the accused, not for the purposes of adjudicating finally on guilt or innocence or the merits of the case, but to oblige the requesting country to demonstrate that the request is based on substantial grounds and show that it is not insubstantial or based on mere suspicion for the purposes of creating a case and that it is not otherwise oppressive or political.</P>
      <P>We believe the <i>prima facie</i> case should not be required but that there should be a procedure to oblige the requesting State to show good and substantial grounds. However, we object to the way substantial grounds or probable cause are vetted at the moment by the Attorney General in secret and the fact that he is not obliged to outline to anybody, including this House, how he came to his decision.  The object of this legislation should be to depoliticise extradition.  We should have strong safeguards to protect civil liberties but we should not cede ground on transparency and the need for a judicial rather than a political process. Otherwise there will be the fear that there might be political interference in reaching decisions about whether a warrant should go to the next stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Deputy Gilmore's point.  In the McGee case the other day the <Col N="1499" /> decision was based on three grounds.  The first was that the District Court procedures were defective and prejudicial &mdash; we have also pointed out in this House that the District Court is not the right forum for extradition proceedings and that the High Court should be the court of first instance in matters of extradition. The second ground was that the political offence exception applied.  That was the judgment of the court and the loophole we are closing would remedy that.</P>
    <P>The third ground is a serious one which relates to prejudicial comment in the media.  I agree that the Government should make some approach to the British Government with a view to the British Attorney General setting down clear guidelines on media comment, circulating them and enforcing them through the contempt of court laws.  It would be a shame if, having closed the loopholes, extradition could still be avoided by virtue of prejudicial media comment.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the same guidelines be adhered to in parliamentary and extraparliamentary political comment and that the security forces should not, because of press leaks, prejudge or finger suspects so as to compromise extradition arrangements, and that the hearing of trials should not be the subject of a huge overkill as they are in Great Britain entailing the use of security cordons, helicopters, marksmen and the like.  That is a political issue which must be taken up by the Minister with the British Attorney General. It is part of the territory of extradition that it engages media attention, and prejudicial media comment could be disastrous and unravel all we are trying to do in tightening up our extradition procedures.  If that can still be put forward as an excuse for avoiding extradition and it is upheld by our courts we are really in trouble.  Some effort must be made at political level to stop such prejudicial damage in the British media.</P>
    <P>I do not hold out much hope that this amendment will be accepted, but we still hold to our views on this matter of the requirement to show probable cause in a <Col N="1500" /> judicial setting rather than via the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot support either of these amendments which I did not support on Committee Stage.  I understand the points being made.  However, the danger of a trial within a trial is that citizens would be sent away from this State with a guilty tag attached to them and that is what both of these motions translate into.</P>
      <P>I was alone on both Second and Committee Stages in calling on the British law officers &mdash; the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the Attorney General &mdash; to consult and have the courage to do something about the outrageous behaviour of the Fourth Estate in Great Britain.  What happens there in terms of pre-trial coverage would not be allowed in this jurisdiction.  If they do not have the courage to take on the press, how can they expect others to take on terrorists? This House has shown its determination in implementing the provisions of the European Convention on Terrorism and this legislation meets those provisions. However, there is little point in implementing them if the three main law officers in Britain allow a position to prevail whereby suspected terrorists are allowed off the hook because those officers have not got the bottle to take on those who are prejudicing trials.  I was alone in making that point, but Mr. Justice Flood in the High Court last Friday made it one of the three grounds for not extraditing a suspected person. That matter must be addressed.  I hope a message goes out from this House to the British Administration that if it is not prepared to address that question we can pass as many laws as we like, but the Irish courts will find it difficult to extradite an Irish citizen to a jurisdiction where trials are prejudiced in a manner which would not be allowed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British law officers must take responsibility for that matter as it is central to the question of extradition.  It is cowardly of them not to take on the press in this matter.  The press in Britain should be required to be responsible for <Col N="1501" /> the way it reports on pre-trial matters, otherwise people who face charges for serious offences will have a way out.</P>
    <P>The other two grounds on which Mr. Justice Flood made his decision are matters which concern this jurisdiction.  One of them is a procedural matter relating to the manner in which the case was dealt with in the District Court.  I presume the Minister is examining that matter and that those procedures will be tightened up in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell that we should deal with the remaining section today.  Mr. Justice Flood stated that the assassin did not create a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons.  Accordingly, the matter did not come under section 4.  Does the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; mean two persons other than the person assassinated or seriously injured or does it mean the person who is attacked and one other person?  Why is the plural used in this case?  The singular is used elsewhere in the legislation.  We may believe we are passing proper legislation here but if it goes to court and is challenged by eminent lawyers, they will want the court to decide precisely the wording of the legislation.  Some time ago a question arose in our courts about the meaning of &ldquo;automatic weapons&rdquo; and it was established that they are different from other firearms.  The court was very strict in its interpretation of that wording.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the two amendments because there is a trial within a trial&mdash; the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> or probable cause case &mdash; persons would exhaust all those procedures before being extradited.  People are extradited every day of the week.  We are saying that terrorists should have special terms of reference and given preferential treatment while those extradited every day of the week cannot have a trial within a trial.  If a <i>prima facie</i> or probable cause case is established and, for example, we extradite a person from here to the British jurisdiction, that person is sent with a tag around his or her neck, so to speak.  They would not be extradited in the first place if a <i>prima facie</i> or probable cause case <Col N="1502" /> was not established in our courts.  Even though a judge may direct a jury to ignore that matter, it will be brought out in the case.  It is not beneficial for a person who is innocent until proven guilty, to be extradited following a <i>prima facie</i> or probable cause case being established.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who tabled the amendments that there is a problem about accountability.  Deputy O'Donnell eloquently made the point about the Attorney General making decisions behind closed doors.  I have a fundamental problem about the Attorney General not being accountable for his decisions.  I have no difficulty with the fact that he makes decisions because he holds a semi-Executive post rather than a judicial one.  It is a Government to Government responsibility.  It is the Government of Ireland who are charged with international relations, not the courts.  It is not a court to court or court to foreign Government relationship. Although the Attorney General is not a member of Government, he sits around the Cabinet table and is probably the right person for the job, but he and the Director of Public Prosecutions should be accountable for their decisions.  I am not referring merely to extradition matters, but to the exercise of their powers generally.  I do not believe anybody should be so independent as to be unaccountable.</P>
    <P>Even judges, who are totally separate from the Government and the Legislature, make their decisions in open court.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions here differ greatly from their counterparts in Great Britain on one fundamental matter, namely, the Attorney General in Great Britain advises Parliament and must be a Member whereas the Attorney General here advises the Government and need not be a Member of Parliament.  When the Attorney General in Great Britain hived off some of his powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions he retained accountability to Parliament.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions fails to prosecute a case for not bringing forward <Col N="1503" /> a book of evidence on time &mdash; as happened here in relation to a debt and stolen tobacco worth up to £1 million &mdash; the Attorney General accounts to Parliament, but here we cannot even ask a question in Parliament in that regard. This is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>In exercising his powers generally and accounting for the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, we must establish a forum through which the Attorney General is accountable to Parliament.  If he is not required to be a Member of the Dáil or Seanad he should at least be required to answer questions before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. The accounting officers in the offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions are required to attend before the Committee on Public Accounts to answer questions on financial regularity and value for money aspects of the administration of their offices.  I see no reason the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions could not be required to attend in a similar fashion before a committee of Parliament to account for their stewardship.</P>
    <P>The amendments are worthwhile and the Deputies made a good case for them, but for the reasons outlined, I cannot support them.</P>

      <P>The topic raised by Deputies O'Donnell and Gilmore was discussed at great length on Committee Stage.  I will not give a lengthy reply now as I gave a detailed one at that stage, but I will summarise the position. We cannot impose unilaterally any type of <i>prima facie</i> requirement where our extradition laws are governed by either convention or treaties.  That excludes all countries except the United Kingdom because we have no written treaty or convention with it.  Experience in the UK has shown that a formal <i>prima facie</i> requirement in whatever form gives rise to considerable difficulties and delay in practice and for that reason I cannot accept it.  A requirement for probable cause to be shown by affidavit would give <Col N="1504" /> rise to similar difficulties and delays in practice.  The existing safeguard provided in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 applies only to the United Kingdom because there were particular concerns relating to that country.  I am satisfied the Attorney General is the appropriate person to apply those safeguards.  As I said on Committee Stage, the existing system works well and I see no need to change it.</P>
      <P>We all accept extradition is a two way process.  For example, in 1993 five people were extradited to the United Kingdom from here and 13 people were extradited from the UK to this country.  It is in our interest to ensure that workable extradition arrangements continue to operate between both countries.  As I said on Committee Stage, the general thrust of discussion at European Union level is that it should be possible to simplify extradition arrangements between member states since every member state is a parliamentary democracy, has an independent judiciary and is party to the European Convention on Human Rights. To introduce any type of <i>prima facie</i> requirement would run counter to the approach being taken in the European Union and no European state imposes such a requirement in respect of extradition to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All three Opposition spokespersons referred to the publicity surrounding cases involving extradition in the United Kingdom.  At Anglo-Irish meetings, and one will be held next week, we have at all times discussed areas of security, legislation in this country and the United Kingdom and, from time to time, extradition matters.  I intended to raise the matter of the attendant publicity in the most recent case in advance of this debate and the debate in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Following the decision in that case certain senior members of the British Parliament made severe criticisms of the Government and in particular the Irish Legislature.  The criticism related to only one aspect of the reason for the non-extradition of the individual involved and they choose to ignore another aspect which concerned <Col N="1505" /> their jurisdiction.  As Deputies rightly said, if there was such publicity here, the persons responsible for it would be held in contempt of court.  Deputies made reasonable points about what happens across the water and I have no difficulty raising them at the Anglo-Irish Conference. I will avail of the opportunity to raise it with my colleague, the Home Secretary, at the next meeting of European Union Justice Ministers due to be held shortly.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies, although I am sure they do not need reminding, that under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976 it is possible to try a person accused of offences in Northern Ireland before the courts here.  It is also possible to try persons accused of murder and explosive offences committed in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Mitchell's final question, the plural is used in section 2 (a) (II) because it refers to an act against property.  It does not relate to an act of violence against the life, physical integrity or liberty of a person.  Invariably, even if only one person is involved in, for example, a bomb attack on property, it poses a threat or as stated in the Bill, &ldquo;a collective danger for persons&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised by the Minister's response to the amendment because it is in line with the one she gave on Committee Stage.  Her position is considerably at variance with the positions taken on this point by both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party when they were in Opposition.  The record of the House in 1986 and 1987 is peppered with fine speeches from many members of both parties, some of whom are now in Cabinet, arguing for the making of a <i>prima facie</i> case before the courts and for the inappropriateness of the office of the <Col N="1506" /> Attorney General to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister intends to raise the issues which arose in the McGee case and the concerns expressed by Judge Flood, particularly in respect of prejudicial publicity in Britain.  I am not sure what progress she will make.  The manner in which the British Government relates to its press and members of the British Parliament express themselves on matters relating to Anglo-Irish relations, extradition and so on, is outside our control. It would be worth their while remembering that there is a determination in this State to deal effectively with the problem of terrorism.  The cheap, nonsensical jibes made periodically by British politicans seeking a headline and by sections of the British tabloid press willing to print it that this country is soft on terrorism do not hold up.  The State has had to deal with the problem of terrorism for a long time and has done so effectively.  It would considerably help this State if the British establishment and press behaved in a responsible way and ensured fair procedures and trials for people accused of terrorist offences. That would contribute a great deal to ensuring the safety of people on both islands and ensuring those who are accused of having committed terrorist type crimes are brought to justice.  People who speak off the top of their head and use cheap headlines have not helped the process of dealing with terrorist offenders.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by the Minister's response to the amendment and I ask the Acting Chairman to put the amendment formally to the House.  In view of my unhappy experience on Committee Stage I do not intend to ask the House to divide on it.</P>

      <P>In page 2, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash;Part III of the Principal Act, as inserted by section 2 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, is hereby amended by the deletion of sections 44A and 44B and the substitution of the following new section:</P>
      <P>`44A.  &mdash;(1)  A warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence under the law of a place in relation to which this Part applies shall only be endorsed for execution under this Part if a Judge of the High Court certifies that he is of the opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecution of, the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offences specified therein in a place in relation to which this Part applies, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A Judge of the High Court shall only certify a warrant under this section when a request for extradition is accompanied by a statement of fact, by way of affidavit or statutory declaration, which satisfies the Judge that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed <Col N="1508" /> and that the person sought committed it.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a consequential amendment and I do not propose to delay the House on it because we had a long debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  The issue is whether the person examining the warrants should be the Attorney General or a High Court judge.  I stated previously that the Attorney General is not the appropriate officer to do so.  Considering that the first amendment on this matter failed, this is the fallback.  The Minister responded negatively to the amendment on Committee Stage and I simply wish to put it on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1987 Act there is a requirement that an annual report be presented to the Oireachtas on the operation of the extradition procedures.  I stated on Committee Stage that the last report was published in 1991 and I was concerned to ensure that reports are published on time.  My amendment proposes that the <Col N="1509" /> report be published within a period of three months.

      <P>I support the general thrust of Deputy Gilmore's amendment. The Minister's amendment goes a long way to meet our requests.  The whole question of publishing information on extradition is important.  A requirement, once passed into law, should be met.  We have a habit of making laws that reports be published by certain dates but we do not ensure that is done.  The Minister proposes that the report be published not later than 31 December of the following year.  In those circumstances the Minister would have all of this year to compile the report for 1993, which seems a long time since the details should be readily available. However, it is an improvement on the present position.  The amendment does not require the Minister to lay the report before the House.  Perhaps she would consider that suggestion between now and the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, unless there is already a requirement in the original Act that these reports be laid before the House.</P>

      <P>It is not often that I agree with amendments from the other side but in this instance there is a case to be made and I support the thrust of Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  In an area that is so complex and sensitive and in which many of us would have different views, it is important that there be a report to the Dáil on a regular basis. However, I am concerned about the timescale of three months proposed by Deputy Gilmore.  Due to the complexity of the issue the Minister would need reasonable time to report back to the Dáil on the previous year's progress in implementing extradition provisions. Deputy Mitchell is concerned that a year may be too long and perhaps that is the case.  I have no hard and fast views on that matter, but a three month time limit for the preparation of a comprehensive report is too short.  I appeal to Deputy <Col N="1510" /> Gilmore to consider giving greater flexibility to the Minister of the day in reporting back to the House.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Mitchell's point, we are not changing the thrust of section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 which provides that the report be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The point was made on Committee Stage, particularly by Deputy Gilmore, that reports of the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a specified period.  The Deputy suggested a deadline of 1 April, which he has repeated in his amendment today.  When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage I gave a commitment that I would ask my officials to talk to the officials in the Attorney General's office to see what could be achieved.  I did that because I agree with the principle behind Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  For reasons which I will explain I cannot agree with the deadline of 1 April.  There are also technical problems with Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  My amendment will go some of the way towards meeting the general thrust of the Deputy's proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment refers to &ldquo;beginning with the year 1989&rdquo;.  The report for 1992 will be submitted to the Government shortly for approval and will be laid before both Houses.  The proposed deadline for the 1992 report would be 1 April 1993, which is already past, and if I were to accept this amendment in its present form the Government would be in immediate breach of its statutory obligations.  That is not reasonable and for that reason alone I would have to oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the principle that some deadline should be laid down but it should be a reasonable one.  In setting down deadlines we should be realistic and ensure we can meet them.  Officials of my Department have consulted the Attorney General's office &mdash; that office drafts the reports for each year.  I considered the matter in the light of those consultations and I am of the view that the present <Col N="1511" /> practice of including an indication of the outcome in each case is a valuable one and should be retained.  For the readers of individual reports it would obviously be much more helpful if they could assess the number of extraditions and the outcome of those requests.  For that reason it is worth waiting a reasonable time so that that kind of information can be included.  Obviously, we should not wait indefinitely.  Most cases would be decided within 12 months and that is why I propose the deadline of end December.  That would mean that the report for the 1993 cases would have to be laid before the Houses before 31 December this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for responding positively to the amendment proposed on Committee Stage.  Nobody can justify a time lapse of two to three years in the production of a report.  We talked a great deal about the need to ensure that there are safeguards in the operation of our extradition laws.</P>
      <P>One of the safeguards built into the 1987 Act was a requirement that the Government would make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas setting out how the system was operating, the number of people extradited, etc.  There is a need for such reports to be presented on time. I accept that three months might be too short, but I am still perplexed as to why it should take a full year to produce a report which does not contain a great deal of information &mdash; the number of extraditions is not great.  I accept the Minister's point that it is desirable to track what happened to people who have been extradited and that it may not always be possible to do this within a 12 month period.  In practice the 1993 report will be produced at the end of 1994, which effectively means there will be almost two years between the extradition of a person at the beginning of 1993 and the publication of the report at the end of 1994.  This gap is too big.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given my occupational background, I am tempted to ask the Minister if she would be prepared to split the difference between the three month and 12 month <Col N="1512" /> periods.  If she would be prepared to do so I would be very glad to hear it, but if not I am happy to withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash;In section 50 of the Principal Act the words `or the Minister' in subsection (1) and subsection (4) are hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with a matter to which I referred earlier, the extraordinary power of the Minister under section 50 of the 1965 Act to overrule a decision of the courts in an extradition case.  On Committee Stage the Minister said that this power had never been used. Regardless of our qualms about giving the Attorney General executive powers in the vetting of warrants, it seems extraordinary to give the Minister a power which would allow her to overrule a decision of the High Court or Supreme Court and which she does not use.  What is the justification for including this executive power in the Bill?  The Progressive Democrats are seeking to depoliticise acts of terrorism, I would be interested to hear the Minister's justification for retaining this power.  Is it constitutional for her to retain a power which enables her to overrule decisions of the Supreme Court in extradition cases?</P>

      <P>If this is the case, why is the Deputy proposing that the power should be deleted?  The power has not been used or abused and there has been no call for its deletion.  Does the Deputy have some theoretical, philosophical or ideological objection to this power?  I accept some of the points made by the Deputy, but I do not understand why she should be so concerned to have this power deleted from the Bill.  If the courts are not concerned about this power&mdash;my information is that they are not, but I am sure the professional <Col N="1515" /> practitioner opposite who attends court very often will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; why should we, as legislators, seek to remove one of the discretionary powers of the Minister?  Is there a problem of conscience which says that we should bow to the courts in all matters of this kind? If that is the motivation behind the amendment I certainly would not be happy with it.</P>

      <P>If a power of this kind is used to overrule a decision of the courts it will raise questions about the Executive superimposing its view on a matter which it put in the hands of the court, presumably with the intention of accepting its decision.  It is strange if, after putting an issue before a judge, listening to his decision and, if necessary, listening to the decision of the Supreme Court, the Executive arm of the State says it does not agree with this decision and will do what it wants itself.  That used to be the case when people were sent forward for indictable offences from the District Court.  There used to be a provision under which a person could be put on trial on an indictable charge &mdash; the book of evidence was brought before a district justice and if he ruled there was no case to meet, the Attorney General &mdash; now it is the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; had the right to say it did not matter what the district justice thought, that he was sending the case forward for trial anyway.  I think that was struck down as a principle in the Costello case.  The issue here is whether a Minister could use <Col N="1516" /> this power.  Unless the Minister is in a position to say she could reverse a Supreme Court decision, I can see no reason for leaving this power on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Returning to the subject matter of this morning's barney, if the argument is made that it is necessary to prevent legislation impinging on existing court decisions and the Legislature has to be told it cannot undo court decisions, how can we argue for the proposition that a Minister can do it?  What constitutional principle gives Ministers powers which the Legislature does not have?  It is a case of the Minister having her theoretical cake and eating it.  She must accept one proposition or the other, she cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I gave a detailed account of the reasoning behind the powers given to the Minister for Justice.  I also touched on the constitutional issues involved. Attention was drawn to the possibility that the High Court might decide in a particular case that a person should not be released while the Minister might come to a different view and order the release of the person concerned.  I agreed to consider this aspect further and it may be helpful if I address the constitutional issues involved.</P>
      <P>Section 50 gives the Minister a discretionary power to direct the release of a person in certain circumstances.  The 1965 Act carries a presumption of constitutionality. Furthermore, in the light of the Supreme Court decision in the case of East Donegal Co-operative <i>v</i> Attorney General, 1970, IR 317, there is a presumption that any Minister would exercise his or her discretionary powers under the section in a constitutional manner. In light of this presumption, it is highly unlikely that a court would find section 50 of the 1965 Act, as it now stands, repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further question arises as to whether it would be constitutional for the Minister to order the release of a person under section 50 when the High Court had declined to do so.  This is an academic <Col N="1517" /> point as it is highly unlikely to arise in practice.  However, if it did cognisance would have to be taken of the fact that the exercise of the Minister's power under section 50 to release a person could not result in any infringement of that person's constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The only issue, therefore, is whether the exercise of the Minister's powers would represent an interference in a purely judicial domain.  On Committee Stage I argued that extradition was not solely a judicial matter and that there was an executive role involved.  Since then my attention has been drawn to a statement made by Judge Walsh in the Supreme Court in the case of Finucane <i>v.</i> McMahon, IR 1990, 165.  The relevant part is at page 216 of the report.  The judge addresses the Minister's power to order the release of a person where extradition is sought and states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice can, within the provisions of the 1965 Act, direct that a person shall not be extradited. His power in this regard is more restricted than that vested in the Executive in other states but it is an additional safety factor in the process as he may have better access to information from his political and diplomatic sources which ordinarily would not be available to the courts and possibly could negotiate for better treatment for the fugitive if returned.</P>
    <P>While this statement is <i>obiter</i> and not conclusive it certainly supports the view that section 50 is not repugnant to the Constitution.  I have consulted the Attorney General and he is of the view there is no reason to amend section 50 on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>It is highly unlikely that I, or indeed any other Minister for Justice, will ever exercise the powers available under section 50, but I consider they should be retained.  Hence I am opposing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her response and if she is satisfied with the Attorney General's advice that <Col N="1518" /> section 50 of the 1965 Act is indeed constitutional, I am prepared to accept that advice.  In relation to the matters raised this morning, was it the Attorney General's advice that the amendments to section 1 were necessary, given that the 1987 legislation was deemed to be constitutional in relation to retrospectivity?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 16, to delete &ldquo;the offences&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any offence which, if the act or omission constituting the offence took place in the State, would be an offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to give full credit to Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy McDowell and Deputy O'Malley for raising this issue. The amendment they put forward, which I propose to accept with a slight modification, will remove what could have been a serious cause of uncertainty in the application of the First Schedule by the courts.  Section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, as amended by section 2 of this Bill by the insertion of a new section, subsection (3) (a), will provide in effect that an offence listed in the Schedule to this Bill cannot be regarded as a political offence for the purposes of extradition to a convention country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If extradition is sought the person would be charged with an offence not under Irish law but under the law of the country where he or she is alleged to have committed the crime.  The way subsection (3) (a) of the Bill is currently worded persons sought for extradition could argue that as they committed an offence under foreign law and not under Irish law, the Schedule does not apply to them as it only lists offences under Irish law. <Col N="1519" /> In the case of most of the serious offences listed in the Schedule, that argument is academic because they would be covered in any event by the main part of section 3 of the 1987 Act as amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are, however, certain offences &mdash; mainly those dealing with possession of firearms and explosives &mdash; listed in the Schedule which are not covered by the main part of section 3 and the argument might have some force in those cases. The amendment proposed would make it clear beyond any doubt that the Schedule is not limited to Irish offences only but applies to any act carried out abroad, which, if carried out in this jurisdiction, would constitute one of the offences listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>It is important to remove any potential for doubt and make it clear that the First Schedule to the Bill is intended to apply to criminal acts committed abroad which, if committed in this country, would fall within one of the offences listed in the Schedule.  I fully accept the principle behind the amendment put down by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Malley.  The draftsman wished to make certain minor changes to the amendment as put down and for that reason I put down my amendment.  There is no fundamental difference between the two amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the point we made.  It was in trying to devise a later amendment concerning membership of illegal organisations that we discovered the weakness in the Schedule and that it related to correspondence rather than the actual offence which is at issue.  It is surprising that the obvious can be overlooked and it highlights the need for sufficient time to debate such complex legislation.  What happened this morning only arose when we were considering the implications of the McGee case on Friday.  That is why we sought more time and requested that the Bill recommitted.</P>

If the Minister's amendment to add the words &ldquo;or omission&rdquo; is right in this context, it would be right in that context also. The Minister might consider including an equivalent amendment to the definition section in the 1987 Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and</P>
      <P>c) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3A) (inserted by this section):</P>
      <P>`(3B) This section shall apply to an offence of membership in Northern Ireland of an organisation of which membership in the State is an offence for the time being under the provisions of section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arose from a discussion on Committee Stage in which the following circumstance occured to me as one which should be covered.  If somebody is convicted in Northern Ireland of being a member of the UVF, for example, and either escapes custody or skips bail prior to the trial and travels to the South, or if a person disappears during the trial and is later convicted of the serious offence of membership of the UVF, they are not liable to be extradited to Northern Ireland to serve the sentence the court imposed on them there.  The offence of membership of an illegal organisation is not an offence to which the Schedule to this Act applies.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> I chose the UVF as an example in order to be less controversial, but the same obviously applies to someone convicted in Northern Ireland of membership of the IRA.  If a person accused of that offence comes to the South and evidence against them is available in Northern Ireland, they would be able to stay here and would not be liable to extradition.  It is true, of course, that they would be charged if there was evidence of membership of an illegal organisation within this State.  They would not be liable in any circumstances to be sent back to Northern Ireland to serve their sentence. That applies to either side of the equation, whether one is dealing with Loyalist or Republican terrorism.  There is a loophole in our law in that somebody can have been convicted of a very serious offence, membership of an illegal organisation, and can effectively evade liability to serve the sentence by remaining on the other side of the Border.  The phraseology of the amendment tabled on Committee Stage was not clear.  We then considered amending the Schedule to include membership of an illegal organisation but that gave rise to more difficulties of interpretation, especially having regard to what the Minister said about subsection (3A).  The end result was the proposal that subsection (3B) should be included, that people should be liable to extradition to Northern Ireland if they had been sentenced to a jail sentence for membership of an illegal organisation there in circumstances in which there would not be evidence to put them on trial here for the same offence.</P>

      <P>I was speaking to a man last evening who said he had just returned from a visit to Belfast.  When a group were talking in his presence they asked who the two fellows were with the Mexican accent.  He wondered what they meant and it transpired they were talking about two men from south of the Border. I very much doubt if many UFF people travel south of the Border, to take refuge from Northern Ireland.  However, if that is the case, we should tidy the legislation. I wonder whether the term &ldquo;Northern <Col N="1522" /> Ireland&rdquo;, as used in the proposed new subsection, would stand up in law, or whether the term should be &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  For example, is the phrase &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;, or a similar phrase, used in other legislation?  Is there a precedent for this and would it stand up in law?  I have no difficulty with the idea behind the amendment and, if it would strengthen the provisions of the Bill, I see no reason it should not be accepted. I simply wonder about the terminology used and whether the proposed subsection would add to the provisions of the Bill.  If that is the case, I would have no difficulty in supporting it.</P>

      <P>We discussed a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  Just to clarify the matter for Deputy Gay Mitchell, in the 1976 Act we used the phrase &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The offences excluded from this Bill, from the scope of the &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; exception, all relate to violence, even if it is from the mere possession of explosives or firearms.  I think there is a general consensus that offences involving violence should not be regarded as &ldquo;political&rdquo;. However, to extend the scope of the Bill to offences which do not involve acts of violence would destroy that consensus and undermine the entire credibility of the Bill.  For that reason alone I strongly oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>I have a number of other reservations about the amendment.  It relates only to an offence in respect of Northern Ireland. All other offences referred to in the Bill apply in respect of all Convention countries, not just one jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is extremely broad and covers a non-violent, political organisation.  For example, under section 18 (f) of that Act an organisation which &ldquo;promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any public fund or the non payment of local taxation,&rdquo; is regarded as an &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo;.  This type of offence is far too broad.  I am sure Deputy Michael McDowell does not want to <Col N="1523" /> extradite that kind of individual.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>Alter egos.  The IRA is not declared unlawful because it is a group of people with a particular point of view.  All these organisations are engaged in violence, about which the Minister says there is a consensus in this House.  There would not be as much violence if there were not such organisations. On many occasions, all one can do is to imprison the godfathers on evidence of membership of the organisation; they will never be caught with their finger on the trigger, with a fingerprint on the explosives or whatever.  In respect of scheduled organisations such as Óglaigh na hÉireann, the IRA or whatever <i>vis-à-vis</i> these Schedules which are handed into court &mdash; it should not be the case that somebody &mdash; Republican or Loyalist &mdash; sentenced in Northern Ireland for such an offence comes down to the South, and effectively says he will not serve his sentence.  That is wrong and repugnant to the rule of law.  We should back up the law in Northern Ireland.  As the UVF <Col N="1524" /> is unlawful in both jurisdictions nobody should be able to evade justice by moving across the Border.</P>

We had a good discussion both during Committee Stage and today.  I gave certain commitments on Second Stage and Committee Stage and I have lived up to those in so far as I could.  Amendments were tabled which I either accepted in full or amended in a small way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting some of my amendments.  I am pleased that the legislation has passed and have no difficulty in supporting its general thrust.  My party's position has never been in any doubt.  We made it clear where we stood and have been consistent in our approach to the legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance that the section 4 difficulties which Mr. Justice Flood highlighted last Friday will no longer exist when this Bill becomes law. I further accept that she will address the District Court difficulties which the judge referred to.  I am sure those administrative matters can be sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter we need to stress before the legislation passes is pre-trial publicity <Col N="1529" /> in another jurisdiction.  I made clear on Second and Committee Stages my view that the Lord Chancellor, the British Home Secretary and the British Attorney General should collectively address this question because it can prejudice trials and put at naught the efforts of this Legislature to pass legislation of this kind. We have come under attack from certain extreme members of another Legislature who referred to parts of Mr. Justice Flood's decision but not to other parts which were within their competence to deal with.  I am sick and tired of listening to extreme comments of people who get publicity over the dead bodies of terrorists' victims.  They are not bringing the terrorists to justice but are playing into the hands of those who give them a weapon to further advance their cause.</P>
    <P>When will those British MPs, who had a particularly strong go at Members of this House in recent days, have the courage to address the question of pre-trial publicity in the way we addressed it which is accepted by journalists as being fair and reasonable?  While that problem exists we cannot be certain that the courts will not continue to refuse to extradite people. They should earn their salary and expenses and not point the finger at this House.  They should have the courage to take on those journalists and lay down contempt laws which will not make it easy for people to be excused from appearing before the courts in Britain on serious charges.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and hope it will not be delayed in the Seanad.  Our stand on terrorism and those associated with it is clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting amendments.  My party is disappointed that the Bill was not recommitted in order to address what we see as deficiencies in section 1 in relation to the retrospective application of the new law. It is disappointing that the motion was defeated.  It is illogical given that the issue of retrospective application was upheld by the Supreme Court in the Sloan case. It is because we support the legislation that we were pernickety in pushing it to <Col N="1530" /> a vote this morning.  We have consistently supported the tightening up of extradition legislation.  In 1987 Deputy O'Malley foretold the loopholes we are now closing.</P>
      <P>We argued for more time on this Bill and unfortunately over the weekend a case arose which raised issues we had little opportunity to address today. However, it would be appropriate to recommit the Bill and discuss the issues on the retrospective application of the new law.  Why not get it right this time? As the debates in 1987 show clearly, the loopholes we are now closing were predicted. They have been obvious since 1991.  Governments have been lethargic about introducing amending legislation and that is to our collective shame.</P>
      <P>Extradition is the story of the slow abandonment of problems of terrorist violence in the minds of Irish people and generations of legislators.  It is in keeping with the spirit of the Joint Declaration and taking the gun out of Irish politics that we have moved to close the loopholes in the extradition process.  I am disappointed we did not have more time to discuss section 1.</P>

When that issue was out of the way the debate was a positive one.</P>

    <P>I commend the Minister on the manner in which she was prepared to take on board the views expressed by the Opposition. I commend Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Liz O'Donnell and Deputy <Col N="1531" /> Michael McDowell for raising issues with which I was able to identify.</P>
    <P>I have an ongoing concern in relation to what appears to be a deliberate and concerted attempt by certain elements in the British media and in the British Parliament to ensure that even before people extradited reach the British shores they are already found guilty.  This is unfortunate.  Our laws must ensure there is balance at all times, taking into account our determination as a State and as a Legislature to extradite all those accused of terrorist offences.  At the same time we have to ensure to the best of our ability that there will be a fair trial.  The kind of pre-trial publicity we have seen in the past must be ended.  It should go out from this House that we want this done and that we cannot give any guarantees in the absence of those controls that, even where there is a strong case, extradition applications will be treated favourably.</P>

When we consider the previous debate on extradition and all the hype and intimidation on that occasion, we will see that today's debate lead to a better discussion.  I echo the sentiments expressed by a number of other Members.  In the recent past the criticism has been expressed by British politicians and by the British press that Irish politicians are soft on terrorism. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with this matter in a very professional way.  We are serious about what we are doing and that message must go out loud and clear.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the anomalies, if any, in the residential property tax that he intends to rectify in the forthcoming Finance Bill; and if he has given consideration to those cases where householders have a high mortgage or where the combination of the family income leads to liability or the clear discrimination against joint ownership of houses.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government on 8 Februay 1994 announced that any anomalies with the residential property tax scheme would be examined and dealt with in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  In accordance with this undertaking the Government is considering anomalies which could cause unreasonable hardship.  The aim is to preserve the essential features of the budget proposal, particularly in terms of its contribution to the wider pro-employment thrust of taxation policies, while at the same time catering for the more deserving anomalies in the scheme which have been highlighted in recent weeks.  Any such anomalies have, of course, been inherent in the basic structure of the scheme as it has existed since its introduction and which has not been altered by the budget extensions.</P>
      <P>The Government remains convinced that the RPT as extended is fully justified as a modest contribution towards tilting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps in creating and safeguarding employment, and also giving a greater measure of equity in the tax system.  From the employment viewpoint, the relative tax advantages of investment in dearer housing can only be to the disadvantages of industrial and commercial investment which is essential for employment growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister hold the view that those objecting to residential property tax are a well-heeled minority, as he is supposed to have said in Brussels? Is it fair that people are asked to pay what is in effect a home tax on houses that are owned in the main by the banks or building societies, for example, one could have a £60,000 mortgage on an £80,000 house?  Is it fair that pensioners with sons or daughters living with them will have to pay the tax because the total household income is above the income limit?  Is the Minister aware of the specific anomaly with joint ownership?  People who have two houses in separate names each worth £75,000 would pay no tax but should they pursue Government policy and have the properties in joint names, the tax yield would be £1,250.  Will he give a specific commitment either to abolish the tax and withdraw his proposals or remove these anomalies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government almost a month ago announced that any anomalies would be examined.  Deputy Yates mentioned a number of the anomalies at which I am looking.  The Government has no intention of abolishing residential property tax, which was brought in by the Deputy's party.  I supported such a tax for many years.  It is neither equitable nor reasonable that people living in houses worth between £500,000 and £1 million should pay the same service charges as those in more modest houses.  Is the Deputy suggesting that we move away from the principle of residential property tax, which is already on the Statue Book?  The yield from this modest tax is under £10 million.  The argument about the numbers is a separate question, but only 14,000 households pay it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have argued in <Col N="1534" /> favour of a modest tax.  That is the principle. No doubt there are some anomalies in the system, but they have been there since day one and not since January 1994. The anomalies will be dealt with.  The anomaly arising from joint ownership existed from the start and I am not sure how Deputy Yates proposes we should deal with it.</P>
      <P>He specifically asked how people over 65 years would be affected and I am having that examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to £1 million homes but ordinary householders in suburban Dublin feel they will be penalised by being brought into the net because modest homes in areas of high residential value are now in the net.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the definition of income?  Will higher education grant payments, VHI refunds and income before DIRT all constitute gross income under the extended residential property tax income threshold?  What does he mean when he says he will remove the anomalies?  All I have heard is a defence of this tax, which is fundamentally an attack on home owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 12 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The additional full year yields to the Exchequer, expressed in 1994-95 terms, which are expected to arise from the phased restriction of mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief to the standard rate of income tax over the years after 1994-95 are estimated at a further £26.5 million for 1995-96, a further £26.5 million for 1996-97 and a further £13 million for 1997-98.  With the estimated 1994-95 yield of £14 million, this gives a total yield of £80 million from the measures when fully in effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming the enactment of the changes proposed in this year's budget, the increases in the standard tax band which could be provided over the next three years for these amounts of revenue are estimated as follows in 1994-95 terms: for 1995-96 &mdash; further increases for £260 for single and widowed persons and £520 for <Col N="1536" /> married persons; for 1996-97 &mdash; further increases of £270 for single and widowed persons and £540 for married persons, and, for 1997-98 &mdash; further increases of £150 for single and widowed persons and £300 for married persons.</P>
    <P>These estimates of yield and cost are, of course, provisional.  As stated in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, future strategy in relation to income tax will focus resources on improving the position of lower and middle incomes and, in particular, will have two priority goals: (i) alleviating the burden of taxation on workers with low incomes, particularly those with families; and (ii) raising the income threshold at which the higher rate comes into play.  It is the Government's intention that the progressive increase in the yield from the standardisation of discretionary reliefs will be used, as a priority, to expand the standard rate band.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of course, that the recent budget already provided for an increase in the standard band of £525 for single and widowed taxpayers and £1,050 for married taxpayers at a cost of £58.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that it is Government policy, taking the family home tax and the changes in VHI and mortgage interest relief together, to make a direct assault on middle income earners paying more and more for fewer benefits?  Will he also confirm that middle income earners will lose £20 per week when the changes in mortgage interest relief are put into effect and up to £7 per week when VHI relief is restricted to the standard rate of 27 per cent rather than 48 per cent?  Does the Minister have any regard for these people, 350,000 in number, who support approximately one million people?  They are very bitter that they will progressively pay more tax during the next three years.</P>

The Government intends to use the yield from these measures to widen the standard rate tax band to ensure that those on lower incomes pay tax at the standard rate of 27 per cent rather than at the higher rate of 48 per cent as is the case at present. We want to move from the position where two people living side by side, one on an income of £15,000 and the other on £75,000, both pay tax at a higher rate of 48 per cent.  It is the Government's priority to remove this anomaly to ensure the person on low pay pays tax at the standard rate of 27 per cent.</P>

Any resources saved by way of these measures will be used to widen tax bands.  A saving of £80 million will accrue when they are fully in effect.  We are anxious to ensure that those on low incomes do not pay tax at the higher rate.  A single person earning £12,000 and a married person earning £20,500 pay at the higher rate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a precise breakdown of the housing stock by range of market values is not feasible without a comprehensive nationwide valuation survey.  In the absence of such an exercise the estimation of the number of houses within various value ranges must draw on available data which is, in general, of a limited nature.  The principal source of information available is the data from the ESRI survey of income distribution, poverty and usage of state services.  This was a nationwide survey of more than 3,000 houses, undertaken in 1987.  The results drawn from this survey have been updated to reflect movement in house prices since 1987.  The resulting data is, of course, supplemented by experience of the operation of the residential property tax scheme.</P>
      <P>The estimates in relation to house value requested by the Deputy are as follows: the estimated number of houses worth in excess of £75,000 is 60,000, and the estimated number of houses worth in excess of £100,000 is 18,000.</P>
      <P>In relation to household income I am informed that statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would allow for a firm estimate of the number of households with income above £25,000.</P>
      <P>While the number of houses worth in excess of £75,000 is estimated at 60,000 it is assumed that over 50 per cent of this number will qualify for income exemption. This assumption is founded upon the practical experience of the Revenue Commissioners in administering the tax and borne out by compliance mechanisms such as the tax clearance procedure. On this basis it is estimated that the number of households with a property value in excess of £75,000 and a household income of £25,000 or over is 28,000.</P>

I put it to him that there must be a <i>fourchette</i> or a range of possibilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. There is not as much certainly about this tax as one would wish, but this is not the only tax where this is the case.  From the hype that was generated for a few weeks after the budget, one would think everybody was going to have to pay this tax. On the basis of updated statistics, and allowing for subjectivity in regard to returns, it is not an unreasonable shot, and the 10 per cent reduction for each child under 18 years of age and the marginal relief means a 50 per cent reduction. That has been the position every year since 1983 when Deputy Dukes introduced this tax.</P>

      <P>I am flummoxed by the Minister's reply.  I am very much acting on behalf of the taxpayer.  Have these figures been filed in the documents in the High Court because of the row about whether to appoint a receiver or an examiner? Is it not the case that £17 million has been found to be outstanding in taxes, that the Revenue's own estimate was £5 million, that of that £17 million due in taxes £11 million is due to the Irish Exchequer?  Did the Revenue Commissioners acquiesce in the change from receiver to examiner when they would have been a preferential shareholder if a receiver had been appointed?

      <P>Two competitions will be held in the Civil Service this year, one for executive officer and another for clerical officer and both those competitions will be confined to people with disabilities.  We are endeavouring to increase the number of people with a disability employed in the Civil Service.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to paragraph 2.57 of the 1992 report of the European Court of Auditors regarding manual alterations by customs officials of export forms, that in a post-audit letter the Court of Auditors indicated that such alterations were found to be quite common; that the Irish authorities did not contest the accuracy of the court's findings and hence the court acted in good faith in paragraph 2.57; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I can of course accept that the court acted in good faith in this matter.</P>
      <P>The statement made in the relevant paragraphs of the post-audit letter referred to by the Deputy, in so far as it refers to manual alterations of forms by Customs, was not challenged specifically at the time.  The emphasis in the reply by the Irish authorities was on the arrangements for authentication of forms by Customs and their scrutiny by the paying agency prior to payment of export refunds.</P>
      <P>However, the position in regard to the alteration of forms by traders, and their authentication by Customs, has since been fully elaborated in correspondence with the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter refers to a reply <Col N="1548" /> I received from the Minister to a question I tabled on 23 November last arising from a matter referred to in the 1992 report of the European Court of Auditors.  The report suggested that Customs officials frequently altered forms manually.  In his reply the Minister said that the Revenue Commissioners stated contrary to what was contained in the auditor's report, that none of the alternations was made by Customs.  In the light of the Minister's response today and his acceptance that there was a post-audit letter that, effectively, ticked Ireland off and to which we did not respond formally, was the court correct to note the alterations and to report on them?  If there was a failure, was it a failure by the Irish authorities to correct a misapprehension by the European Court of Auditors or an implicit admission, which is what the auditors understood it to be, that forms are frequently manually altered here?  That is what the report of the Court of Auditors implied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a considerable debate on this issue on the last occasion the Deputy raised the matter and I undertook to follow up the matter.  The Deputy is correct in saying that the reply by the Irish authorities to the post-audit letter concentrated on assuring the court that payments would not be made to traders on foot of any amended documents until the paying agency, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this case, was satisfied that any amendments were authenticated by Customs.  The courts primary concern was that the payments were made correctly and that Customs were not altering forms in that regard.  The Deputy is also correct in saying Customs did not answer the question about whether its officials were involved in making changes.  I have clarified the matter with them and received correspondence from our auditor, Mr. Richie Ryan, on the matter.  I am sure the alterations were not made by Customs officials but by the trader representing a number of companies who appears to have made numerous alterations.  The auditors would prefer to receive documents <Col N="1549" /> without any alterations.  I accept that the auditors were undertaking to deal with the matter as they saw fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that such practice, either by traders or Customs officials, has ceased?  Is it still possible for someone, for example, a person working in customs or a trader, to manually alter forms which may be the subject of subsequent disputes about money payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I must accept the information I have been given.  I have inquired who makes such changes on many occasions, not just in this case.  This is an important matter and substantial money is paid out on the basis of such documentation. I am assured that customs staff are not involved.  However, at the point of export there is a practice in some cases where the trader is allowed check forms.  In some cases, one trader may represent a number of companies and that trader is allowed check that the total amount is represented on the various forms.  I understand it is normal practice for traders to act in this way especially in cases where there is a change in a consignment.  In this case there were 167 parts to the consignment and I can understand the trader's difficulty.  The form should be withdrawn and replaced by a new unambiguous form.  That would be my preferred choice and I have indicated that to the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you indicated by letter last week that my original question has been diluted and I will now have to ask each Minister for the overtime figure for the State bodies under his or her control.  I suspect the total figure is enormous.  Will the Minister agree that if overtime were eliminated in a number of large commercial State bodies, we could employ tens of thousands of people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That case has been made and I made it in my previous ministerial post.  A reduction in overtime in an establishment should lead to increased employment.  I agree with the Deputy's point.  I checked the position in a number of Departments.  I note the Deputy's question referred to semi-State bodies and I suspect the overtime figure for those bodies would be greater than for the Departments.  I checked most of the administrative budget arrangements and the figures are smaller than I would have thought.  The overtime figure for the Department of Social Welfare is approximately £2.75 million for 1994 and approximately £4.5 million for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the figure is substantial in other areas.  In 1973 the overtime figure for the Department of Justice was more than £14 million. The total outturn for overtime in the Civil Service was under £31 million last year.</P>

      <P>A major scheme of conservation and partial restoration works is required before Dungarvan Castle can be fully opened to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that this work will be funded by the current phase of EU Structural Funds.  The first step of the project will be to conduct an extensive archaeological excavation which will determine the timescale for the conservation work programme.

      <P>We all know of Deputy Timmins's tremendous interest in historical structures such as Dungarvan Castle.  Work on it was progressing satisfactorily but during the past few years work appears to have come to a halt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give an assurance to the Deputy in that regard.  The work came to a halt because the site is such an historical one and the archaeological excavation is necessary.  It would be detrimental to carry on the work until further archaeological excavations have been undertaken.  While the conservation programme may take five to six years the commissioners hope that within the first two years parts of the site, including the castle, will be open to the public and the remainder of it will open on a phased basis as work progresses.</P>

      <Quest>if he has assessed the impact of the VAT applied to scientific equipment on the level of original scientific research being conducted in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of scientific research conducted here is determined primarily by factors other than VAT, in particular, the amount of funding for such research provided by Irish industry, the State and its agencies, universities and hospitals, and from resources provided by international organisations.</P>
      <P>The VAT treatment of scientific equipment, as with all goods and services generally, is governed by EU VAT law, which, in turn, governs Irish VAT law. Under EU law, because scientific equipment is not on the list of goods and services to which a reduced rate may apply, it is therefore taxable at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 21 per cent.  As scientific equipment was not at a reduced rate here prior to 1 January 1991, it is not open to us to avail of the EU parking rate facility which allows application of a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent on a temporary basis.  Nor is it open to us, or indeed any other member state, to introduce further zero rates.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, VAT is recoverable only by registered businesses.  A firm which undertakes scientific research in the course of furtherance of its business would usually recover the VAT on purchases of scientific equipment through the normal bi-monthly returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, however, that there is provision under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Union whereby institutions of the EU are entitled to recover any VAT charged to them on foot of purchases for their official use.  For example, where a research contract is carried out commercially for an EU institution, such contracts are, in effect, zero-rated.  It should be noted that the relief is allowable only where the expenditure is borne directly by the EU institutions but, it would, of course, apply to any equipment directly purchased in the course of a research project.  The relief does not apply to expenditure borne directly by a university or other non-taxable body carrying out contract works for the EU since, in accordance with EU and Irish VAT law, these bodies do not charge VAT and are not entitled to recover the VAT <Col N="1554" /> element of any expenditure borne by them.  I would like to mention in this connection that the fact that bodies such as universities and hospitals cannot normally recover VAT on their expenditure is taken into account in determining the funding provided to them by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that, under the terms of a special refund scheme, a refund may be given equivalent to the full amount of VAT borne on certain high-cost medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations for use in hospitals including equipment used in their laboratories.  Moreover, as the Deputy will be aware, I announced in my financial statement on 26 January last that I intend to extend this scheme to cover donated high-cost research equipment for use in the medical laboratories of universities and similar institutions.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, I do not believe that a detailed study of the impact of VAT applied to scientific equipment on the level of scientific research being conducted in Ireland would serve any useful purpose.</P>

I think I know the company Deputy Bruton is referring to and I am in negotiations with them on the terms of the refund order. The company concerned spends a substantial amount of its research and scientific budget in this country.  The <Col N="1555" /> Government appreciates the work it does here and we will come to some arrangement on the terms of the order.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain criticisms have been made recently in a gardening magazine about Ilnacullin (Garnish Island). While it is not possible to satisfy all shades of opinion, I can assure the Deputies that the gardens are being managed and maintained to the highest standards. Problems have arisen from excessive rainfall in recent years combined with high visitor numbers resulting in damage to grass walks, but measures have been taken to counteract the problem and the position is being constantly monitored.</P>
      <P>A vigorous year-round programme of horticultural maintenance is sustained together with extensive renewal of plants, shrubs and specimen trees.  Management of the gardens is reviewed on an ongoing basis and additional works are undertaken as resources permit to improve the facilities there for the better enjoyment of the gardens by visitors, who numbered more than 80,000 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> A fully comprehensive computerised inventory is in place at Ilnacullin.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I feel the comments made in the magazine article in question, though obviously very wellintentioned, might have been better put directly to the commissioners in the first instance to enable them to respond or to put corrective measures in place if they felt this was warranted.  I visited Garnish personally last July in the company of my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and viewed at first hand the difficulties being experienced by the Office of Public Work's assistant park superintendent and his staff due to high rainfall and heavy visitor pressure.</P>
    <P>Following that visit, the commissioners put in place a programme which will involve taking on additional staff shortly to assist in the gardens.  This indicates the level of commitment there is within the Office of Public Works towards maintaining high standards on Garnish and preserving the excellent reputation it has as a tourist and visitor amenity.  I can also assure Deputies that my own commitment to seeing this valuable amenity resource properly protected and developed in the future remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Sheehan on his elevation to spokesperson on the Office of Public Works.  I look forward to working with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind remarks.  I look forward to working with him to the benefit of the country. I have no doubt he is aware of the beauty and enchanting setting of Garnish Island which is a jewel in the crown of Stateowned property.  I am sure he is also aware of the much worn grass walks, wet spots on lawns and paths worn through wooded areas.  Admittedly we had a wet summer last year but measures should be taken to alleviate the damage caused.  I would ask the Minister whether plants in <Col N="1557" /> container pots receive sufficient attention and if bedding hybrids of appropriate colours are chosen.  Why are the walled gardens sprouting weeds and why was a famous specimen of Kashmir cypress allowed to die so that only the stump remains?  It is a disappointment that this stunning garden is not properly maintained. The public owns the garden and the Office of Public Works is in charge of it.  Is there not sufficient money available for its proper upkeep?</P>
      <P>I should inform the Minister that this is not an isolated case.  Glenveagh Castle in County Donegal, which is also under the control of the Office of Public Works, is in a similar condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest people get the wrong impression, I do not think the Deputy is criticising the staff on Garnish Island.  If he was, I would take a different view of the matter.  The staff there does a magnificant job.  On the damage caused to the grass walks as a result of the high number of visitors and a succession of wet summers, 2,500 square feet of new grass turf have been laid, as have temporary bark mulch pathways.  Signposts have been placed in and around the gardens to divert people from the worst affected areas &mdash; the valley has been most affected &mdash; and some areas have also been roped off.  More than 500 square metres of monoslab honeycomb cement grid with a 75 per cent grass content is being laid in the worst affected areas. This will allow the grass to grow through the concrete and will protect it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of plants and containers, if the Deputy and I visited the gardens at some stage we might be happy with the position, but somebody else might feel differently &mdash; it is very much a matter of personal taste.  The plants in containers are very well looked after and <Col N="1558" /> are properly fed and watered.  The plant referred to by the Deputy died simply from old age.  An unsuccessful attempt was made to replace it and a further attempt is being made at present.</P>
    <P>On the question of Glenveagh, the author of an article on this matter was contacted by the staff of the Office of Public Works on the criticisms he made in this respect, which were not as detailed as in the case of Garnish Island.  I agree that he may have been somewhat over the top in his criticisms in this regard.  I will be visiting Garnish Island again in June with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, and I invite the Deputy to join us.  If things are not 100 per cent right at that stage we will sit down and discuss how they may be rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is currently preparing a post-budget medium-term economic projection which will cover the period to 1996.  The intention is that this projection will underpin the Convergence Programme which, in <Col N="1559" /> keeping with decisions taken at the European Council, Ireland will send to Brussels later this year.  The programme, which will be laid before the House will deal with the question raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The question deserves a response based on a fully up-to-date assessment of medium-term economic prospects.  A quantified reply at this juncture would have to rely on assessments made some time ago.  I trust that the Deputy will bear with me while the full implications for the medium-term of such recent developments as the 1994 budget, the proposed arrangements to follow the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the most recent forecasts for growth and inflation in our trading partners are being incorporated into our assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's wish to give an up-to-date assessment, but will he agree that a medium term target, agreed by the social partners and the Government, is set out in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work? Surely this target is underpinned by some view of the medium term growth in the Irish economy.  Will the Minister outline the figures which underpin the target of a debt-GNP ratio of a minimum of 95 per cent by 1996 as contained in the programme? This is a matter of public policy, it has already been agreed by the Government and social partners.  Presumably, unlike the property tax, this target is not based on random estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The target in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work was based on the outturn data for 1993 &mdash; we were working on this data prior to Christmas.  As the Deputy is aware, the OECD, the European Union and most of our main competitors, issued different data for 1995.  It is probably not too difficult to guess the level for 1994, but it is difficult to predict the level for 1995 as a number of factors have changed substantially. However, I am already on record as saying that I hope we achieve <Col N="1560" /> the target set for 1996.  I would like to think we could surpass that target in the medium term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow we will debate the Programme for Competitiveness and Work in which the Government gives a commitment that by 1996 the debt-GNP ratio will be 95 per cent.  Will the Minister confirm that the Government has abandoned any real progressive efforts to reduce the national debt and retain tighter control on the public finances?  Some economic commentators have forecast that the outturn for this year will be approximately 97-98 per cent.  The achievement of such modest progress between now and 1996 in such benign circumstances, low interest rates and substantial growth, really means that the Government has lost any commitment to substantially reduce the level of debt and, subsequently, taxation arising out of debt servicing costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the target in the programme is one which will at least be reached, based on international developments but I hope we will reduce the level before that.  This must be done having regard to the criteria.  The programme states that fiscal policy will be conducted to continue reducing the national debt to GNP ratio, with a minimum target of bringing that ratio down to around 95 per cent by 1996.</P>

      <P>I would not like Deputy Yates to think that we are no longer committed to the Maastricht guidelines. I want to see us moving towards the level of 60 per cent; I hope we do not reach the position where this trend has to be reversed.  Apart from devaluation which naturally broke that trend, the level of debt-GNP ratio has dropped by approximately 3 per cent each year.  I think the figure for this year is 103 per cent, which gives a figure of approximately 100 per cent for 1994, but I hope it will be even better.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not have the information I require perhaps he will provide it later.  I accept his point about the need to revise the medium term estimates in the light of current information. The Minister referred to data available up to the end of 1993.  Will he give a reply to Deputy Cullen's question on the basis of that data because the nature of the target depends partly on the size of the debt and partly on the level of GNP?  In view of the forecast changes in the level of GNP, was the target for 1993 a soft or hard one?  The only way we will know is to ascertain what it would have been prior to the adjustments to GNP and which should help the Minister to achieve his target much more easily than in the absence of significant growth in GNP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for 1993 is approximately 103 per cent.  I could make an assessment but I do not want to do so off the cuff.  I have been looking at the figures for a number of months and much of the data used to arrive at the target contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was based on the assessment carried out by us last summer. Nothing happened between summer and Christmas to change the position for 1993 <Col N="1562" /> but things have changed substantially in the international&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give some data in this regard.  Technically speaking, stabilisation of the debt-GNP ratio is achieved when the level of borrowing each year is reduced in relative terms.  No more than the amount added to gross national product, the level of our nominal GNP will depend very much on what happens in the coming years.  This is the basis on which I would like to base updated data. If I did this last year I would have been looking at figures of 0.5 per cent for 1993, 0.25 per cent for 1994, 0.75 per cent for 1995 and 1 per cent for 1996.  I would despair if I thought that was still the European Union position.  I think the figures have been changed substantially. If I can continue to control the EBR, as I did in recent years and as successive Governments have done since 1988, we should achieve a level of 95 per cent by 1996.</P>

      <P>The Minister acknowledges that the level of allocations under the Community Support Framework will have an influence in determining the assessment to which he is referring.  Is he presuming that will be clear by April and that the normal six months deadline will apply, or is it his intention to apply for an extension if agreement is not reached by the relevant date in April?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of an assessment we are well aware of the position.  The figure agreed in October is the one that must be taken into account. We do not know what will happen in 1996 on review and it is pointless trying to make an assessment of that because I could not stand over the figures.  As I said in the House recently I must work on the basis of the £7 billion figure which we have achieved.  For me to guess the 1996 figure at this stage or try to assess the GNP ratio over the medium term would <Col N="1563" /> be a pointless exercise.  I will work from the figure that is already known which is in excess of £7 billion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the changes that the Government is required to make to our VAT regime arising out of the final phase of the EU harmonisation of VAT by the year 1996; and the progress made to date in phasing in these changes, with particular reference to the 1994 Budget.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the current VAT system applied to intra-EU trade based on taxation in country of destination, is intended to be transitional in nature.  The relevant European Union VAT Directive envisages that the arrangements for the definitive system, to be based in principle on taxation in the member state of origin of the goods or services, will be decided by the Council by the end of 1995 based on <Col N="1564" /> proposals from the European Commission to be made before the end of 1994.  The transitional system will last at least until the end of 1996.  However, if the target date of 1 January 1997 for the changeover to the definitive system is not met, the transitional regime will be extended automatically until the date of entry into force of the definitive system and, in any event, until the Council has decided on the definitive system.</P>
      <P>At present, our VAT rating arrangements are fully consistent with EU requirements and, unless changes are necessitated as a result of the review due to be undertaken later this year, they may be maintained until the end of 1996, at least.  The minimum level of the EU standard rate &mdash; currently 15 per cent &mdash; to be applied after the end of 1996 will be part of this review, as will the scope of the reduced rates and all of the transitional measures relating to rates, that is, the position of the zero and other super-reduced rates and the parking rate facility.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reduced rating, the Deputy will recall that I signalled in my financial statement on 26 January last that, in the interests of encouraging employment, the Government intends, subject to budgetary constraints, to retain labour intensive services at the reduced rate of VAT in the medium term and that I will be pressing in the review of the VAT regime for the option to maintain the current position of labourintensive services beyond the current transitional period.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not a matter of being required to make changes or phasing in changes to the VAT regime, rather one of negotiation of the definitive system based on the proposals to be made by the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern that if the definitive system goes ahead as proposed, a number of services currently at the parking rate of 12.5 per cent will have to go on to our top rate of 21 per cent?  I refer to construction related services, which would have to be put on the standard rate, and accommodation <Col N="1565" /> in hotels, for example.  Will the Minister indicate what he believes the outcome of the discussions later this year will be?  Can they be maintained at the parking rate?  If not, what steps will he take to reduce our top rate to that of the UK rate of 17.5 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about not achieving the position outlined in my Budget Statement because it would create many difficulties.  We are preparing our case and already in some of the transitional regime discussions which are taking place between member states to decide what route we should go, I have made that position quite clear.  I have made that clear also at some of the informal ECOFIN meetings over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>It is known that both the Commission and the Germans strongly favour a major change in the system.  Deputy Cox probably knows as much about this as I do because it has been discussed at various committees of which I have seen various reports in recent weeks.  Some preliminary international newspaper reports have come to my attention which claim that the forthcoming German Presidency will try to steer member states in the direction of the origin system at the end of the transitional arrangements.  I have discussed this matter with IBEC and others because I do not want to wait until we are faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> on the issue.  An origin system would radically change the whole position and would certainly mean that the present zero rates would be eliminated.  An origin system could not work on the basis of zero rates. If the Germans and the Commission are pushing for that, it would represent a radical change.  I say that in direct response to Deputy Yates's question in regard to the 21 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to move from the zero rating to a minimum rate, we would have one rate of 15 per cent or over, two reduced rates but no zero rate.  That would significantly alter the system.  This would not be helpful because moving from a zero rate to a rate of 3-5 per cent in the context of the Irish system would not <Col N="1566" /> result in a reduction in the higher rate because the amount of income subsitution that would have to be done for zero rated items such as clothing, oral medicines, books and other items would not allow much scope.  We are facing a lengthy period of discussion and I believe there will be much debate on this matter in 1995 which will commence with the German Presidency.  It is a matter to which we should all give some consideration. I have asked the various business interests to give me their views as to how they would like to see this develop over the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point of origin principle in VAT, has the Minister initiated within his Department a study of its potential implications for the operational effects on the Exchequer, apart from the views the business interests and others might have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as part of my overall review I asked the various business interests to give me not only their views but their best assessment of how this can actually work.  Having studied it at some length I would have to say it is a complicated system and would create many difficulties for business generally. The present principle is based on what happens within the State where a supplier charges VAT and recovers VAT.  One does so on an international basis through a clearinghouse.  It is a major system.  I could understand easily how it would work if all member states imposed similar rates, for example, if the higher VAT rate here was the same everywhere else along with the lower VAT rate being similar.  There will be an enormous amount of work to be undertaken in the transitional period between now and the end of 1996 to ensure it operates effectively. It would appear to be an enormously difficult administrative task to undertake, but we have begun.</P>

    <P>(5)  The Committee shall consist of twelve members, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State, and four of whom shall constitute a quorum.  The Committee shall otherwise be constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders 70 and 73, and so as to be <Col N="1619" /> impartially representative of the Dáil.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the amendment to the motion tabled by Deputies John Bruton and Ivan Yates, which seeks to have a value for money audit carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Value for money audits may be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The first part of this section provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out such examinations as he considers appropriate for the purposes of ascertaining &mdash; (a) whether and to what extent the resources of a Department (i) have been used, and (ii) if acquired or disposed of by the Department... have been so acquired or disposed of economically and efficiently, and (b) whether any such disposal has been effected upon the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable.</P>
    <P>The other subsections read as follows:</P>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department or person concerned or the manager of the fund concerned for the purpose of enabling the Department or person or the manager of the fund to evaluate the effectiveness of its or his operations may be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) and (2), the Comptroller and Auditor General may, in carrying out examinations under this section, make such comparisons, including comparisons of systerms, procedures and practices, as he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>(4) Where the Comptroller and Auditor General proposes to make any examination under this section, he may, at his discretion, seek the views of the committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report <Col N="1620" /> to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the type of value for money audit envisaged in the amendment does not come within the terms of the relevant section of the 1993 Act.  That section covers examinations of economy and efficiency in the use of resources and in the acquisition and disposal of resources; it also covers the possible examination of systems, procedures and practices employed in a Department for evaluating the effectiveness of its operations.  It clearly does not cover an examination of Government plans or policies.  In fact, the Act specifically excludes the Comptroller and Auditor General from questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of policies or of policy objectives.  The effect of this amendment would be to draw the Comptroller and Auditor General into the area of policy and political controversy which would be totally unacceptable. Therefore the amendment must be opposed.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Jim Mitchell's proposals to amend paragraph (3) of the terms of reference, the effect of the first part of this amendment would be to prevent a non-commercial State body, or one of the other bodies subject to audit, inspection or examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, from protecting its interest by restricting the publication of confidential information concerning its activities and plans.  This does not exclude the Committee of Public Accounts from dealing with such matters in private session.  When one considers that the bodies in question are being made directly answerable, under statute, for their performance it seems unreasonable not to give them the same protection as a Minister or Government Department. Therefore I cannot accept this proposal.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment relates to an attempt to involve the Committee of Public Accounts in policy matters.  This would represent a breach of the long standing tradition that Minister answer to this House in policy terms, not to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> These new terms of reference are made necessary as a result of the additional functions given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Act of the Oireachtas which extended his functions specifically excludes him from the policy area, as I have already said.  Thus there are no grounds for making this change as a consequence of the statutory changes. Accordingly I shall be opposing the amendment.</P>
    <P>The motion itself is for the purpose of amending Standing Order 130 which deals with the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts.  These terms of reference have to be brought up to date because of the expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General following the enactment last year of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act.  In the White Paper on the Role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which preceded that legislation, the Government undertook to propose revised terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the substance of the motion before the House it is appropriate to record the appreciation of the Government and this House for the outstanding work carried out by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Indeed as a former member, and having had experience of the working of that committee, it has to be said that it is one of the committees of this House which has done an excellent job.  The committee is a crucial link in the chain of public accountability for the use of taxpayers' money. Successive committees have been very diligent and conscientious in carrying out the functions assigned to them.  The new terms of reference will greatly enhance their role.  I am sure they will not be found wanting in meeting the new demands made on them.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in accordance with Article 33 of the Constitution, reports to this House at stated periods as determined by law. Standing Orders assign responsibility for considering his reports to the Public Accounts Committee which, in turn, reports to the Dáil.  Heretofore, the <Col N="1622" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's reports were mainly concerned with matters arising from his statutory audit of the appropriation accounts, the revenue accounts and central fund services.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Public Accounts Committee as laid down at present are &ldquo;to examine and report to the Dáil upon the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by the Dáil to meet the public expenditure, and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the Estimates submitted to the Dáil&rdquo;. The appropriation accounts are, in effect, the annual accounts of Government Departments.  The committee examines these accounts in detail and, in the course of its examination of each of them, calls the responsible accounting officer to attend for the purpose of giving any explanations which members require in relation to the account and any matters raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Thus, the role of the Public Accounts Committee is to act as watchdog in relation to the public expenditure approved by the Dáil, as accounted for by the accounting officer for each Vote and as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>While it is intended that the traditional role of the Public Accounts Committee will continue, its terms of reference need to be expanded to cope with the new statutory functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The existing Standing Order restricts the Public Accounts Committee to examining the departmental appropriation accounts. This is no longer adequate because the wider terms of reference of the Comptroller and Auditor General now cover the financial transactions of health boards, vocational education committees, non-commercial State bodies and certain other bodies, mainly in the education and cultural areas, which are largely dependent on public funding.  The accounts of all these bodies will now fall to be examined by the Public Accounts Committee.  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General now has the discretionary power of inspecting and reporting on the accounts, books and <Col N="1623" /> records of commercial harbour authorities, the regional tourism organisations and any other body, other than a commercial State body or a local authority, which received 50 per cent or more of its gross receipts directly from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In addition to extending the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit to bodies other than the Government Departments and offices, the audit process itself has also been broadened.  Traditionally, the emphasis of the process has been on regularity and compliance &mdash; the principal concern was whether accurate and detailed records of expenditure were kept and whether moneys spent were used for the purposes for which they were voted and did not exceed the limits set by the Oireachtas.  While these objectives will remain and will always be important, the audit process in the public sector internationally has been developing into new areas, notably into the area of &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; auditing and this has been written into the new legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to assigning extra powers and functions to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the new legislation provides for the first time a comprehensive statutory basis for the duties of accounting officers.  The act obliges an accounting officer, whenever he is so required, to give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee on the regularity and propriety of the transactions recorded in his accounts, on the economy and efficiency of his Department in the use of its resources and on the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department for the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations.  All these duties reflect the range of functions assigned by the Act to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Up to last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports on the public accounts were presented annually to the Dáil, in accordance with statutory requirements.  The new legislation provides for the presentation of reports as they are ready rather than submitting them annually in bulk.  The proposed <Col N="1624" /> terms of reference provide at paragraph 2 for such reports being referred automatically and without delay to the committee, whose own reports, in turn, can be published without the need for further motion of the Dáil.  Given the increased volume of reporting which will take place under the new system, it is essential to speed up the process of getting reports to the Public Accounts Committee and from the committee to the Dáil and the public.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 (a) repeats the terms of the existing terms of reference in regard to the committee's power to send for persons, papers and records.  This raises the question of the power of the committee to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and the degree of privilege to be accorded to evidence so furnished to the committee. This is a general issue which can and does affect other committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to introduce legislation to cover these matters and I am glad to inform the House that such legislation is being drafted at present and will be introduced at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 deals with the relationship between the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This was debated during the passage of the legislation through the Dáil and it was agreed that, because of the constitutional autonomy of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he cannot be given directions in regard to his work programme. The Public Accounts Committee, however, is being given the right to communicate privately to the Comptroller and Auditor General from time to time its views relating to the work to be carried out by his office.  I know there is a good relationship between them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything controversial about the remaining amendments to the terms of reference but I shall, nevertheless, be interested to hear the views of Members on what is proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Jim Mitchell who will deal with Standing Order 130 in detail.  The Opposition is frustrated about this matter.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the terms of reference for the Committee on Public Accounts as announced by the Government Chief Whip.  However, it is clear that he misunderstands the purpose of my amendment.  I wish to praise the members of my committee who give a lot of time and expertise to it and who deserve recognition.  It is also important to recognise the extremely good job done by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. McDonnell and his staff service the committee and the State with great expertise and it is a pleasure to work with them.  In tabling my amendment I fully accept that the committee has no role in policy matters and, as chairman, I have consistently ruled out any attempt to query policy. Paragraph (3) of the proposed terms of reference not only give the right to a Minister of the Government to direct or request the committee not to discuss a confidential matter in public &mdash; that is acceptable &mdash; but it also gives the same power to officers in semi-State bodies or other quangos which is not acceptable. If a quango or a State body feels that something is so confidential they should be able to persuade their own Minister who would then make the request to the committee.  Paragraph (3), as drafted, is very loose and would undermine the central role of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1993, and the central purpose <Col N="1627" /> of the terms of reference before the House.  Will the Minister not accept that while the Government can request confidentiality that should not be handed down to any other person?</P>
      <P>The terms of reference refer to the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government. I presume there is no difference between a policy of a Minister and the policy of the Government.  That is the reason I propose that the words &ldquo;a Minister of the Government&rdquo; be deleted.  My principal concern is that the Minister and the Government would agree to delete the words &ldquo;or the body concerned&rdquo; and also the words &ldquo;or equivalent Office holder&rdquo;.  If this is not done there could be various attempts to deflect the committee from proper consideration of the bodies under its remit and the public accounts could be the poorer for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he expects the new legislation on compellability and privilege of witnesses to come before the House in the near future.  That promise has been made on a number of occasions during past years.  This legislation was promised before Christmas, later we were promised it would be published during the Christmas recess and now we are told it is at an urgent stage of drafting. This is very important legislation.  That part of the terms of reference which state that the committee shall have the power to send for persons, papers and records is an empty formula.  It is a paper tiger unless we have the compellability and privilege of witnesses legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that when the Committee of Public Accounts summoned the Governor of the Central Bank he refused to attend and there was nothing we could do about it.  Many of the points he had made would have been supported by evidence given to the committe previously.  He had made an important speech alleging widespread fraud in a significant area of public expenditure in social welfare.  Yet, he refused to come before the very committee established by this House, whose principal role is to prevent fraud in the public finances. <Col N="1628" /> I absolutely condemn the Governor of the Central Bank for his refusal to appear before the committee.  I realise he is an independent person.  However, such independence ought not to be confused with a lack of accountablity to Parliament. If the Governor of the Central Bank has evidence which suggests widespread fraud in any area of public expenditure he has a duty to come before the Committee of Public Accounts and give that evidence.  Our duty is to pursue fearlessly and impartially any area of fraud or inefficiency in the public finances.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State give the House an assurance that the new legislation will come before the House in a matter of weeks rather than months and will be enacted before the summer recess?  The absence of such legislation is thwarting the effectiveness of the committee.</P>
    <P>These terms of reference update the role of the committee and are a great help.  Even though, at times, the Department of Finance has been criticised by the committee we have got the best of co-operation from them.  The attitude in the Department of Finance is extremely positive.  Since my time in Government I note much improvement in the overall approach, expertise, knowledge and positiveness of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the terms of reference do not give specific power to the committee to examine up to date matters, for instance, scandals that may arise in this year's accounts; they do not exclude such issues but neither do they specify them.  The terms of reference should provide that if there should be a scandal in any area of public expenditure in respect of either last year's accounts or this year's accounts before the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported to the committee, that should not preclude the committee, where it is in the public interest to do so from investigating such matters urgently.  Otherwise, as often happens, we are investigating cases that have dimmed into the distant past.  Public accountability, effectiveness and <Col N="1629" /> efficiency in public expenditure are not helped by the passage of time.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I said I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.  I accept that the Committee of Public Accounts has no role in policy but I hope the Minister of State can give an assurance that the compellability and privilege of witnesses legislation will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to adopt this new Standing Order in subsititution for the old Standing Order 130. It is necessary, as the Minister of State has said, because of the enactment of the new Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1993, and it is also necessary to take account of changing circumstances and the wider duties of the comptroller and, accordingly, the duties of the committee.</P>
      <P>Recently I became a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I find the work extremely interesting though it is more onerous than that of any other committee of the House.  If you are to do the work properly it requires a great deal of reading and preparation.  The function the committee performs &mdash; if it does its duties properly, as I believe it does &mdash; is very valuable.  In the absence of such a committee I hate to think what would go on.  Indeed, notwithstanding the committee, I shudder at what is going on but it would probably go on to the power of five if the committee did not exist.  The fact that the committee is there and performs its function well is a guarantee for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the proposed amendment by the chairman, Deputy Mitchell.  I do not understand where the difficulty is.  To have what is described as &ldquo;the body concerned&rdquo; able to prevent the committee from publishing a report in relation to it is entirely wrong.  The whole point is that you publish the report regardless of whether the body concerned wants it. For the body concerned to say, where widespread fraud is taking place, they do not want any information supplied is not good enough.  It is perfectly in order for a Minister to make a request that certain confidential information may not form part of a report, even though sometimes that may make a report meaningless.  I <Col N="1630" /> can see why that should be necessary but I do not see why &ldquo;the body concerned&rdquo;, which in time will probably be construed as covering virtually anything and everyone, should have that power.  I do not like the phrase &ldquo;or equivalent Office holder&rdquo;. There is no equivalent of a member of the Government.  The Minister of State is not the equivalent.  Who is this phrase supposed to include?  Is it supposed to include, for example, the Attorney General?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it includes the Attorney General should it not include a bank manager or somebody else?  It was almost at random that I picked out the Office of the Attorney General and the Minister of State nodded his head in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only the Office of Attorney General but the Office of Ceann Comhairle and the Ombudsman are regarded as equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We could spend some time debating that point as they are quite different offices.  The functions of the Ombudsman are certainly not akin to the functions of a Government Minister.  His function is to look at public administration in Departments and this is something akin to the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Our Attorney General tends to be treated as some sort of sacred cow, entirely immune from mention.  I recall an exchange in the Chamber a week or two ago when Deputy Harney was stopped in her efforts to refer to the office of President &mdash; which again seems a bit unreal &mdash; and began to refer to the Attorney General. She was told that the Office of Attorney General is as untouchable as the office of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to contrast the way officialdom wish the Attorney General to be treated in this House with the way the UK Attorney General is treated.  The UK Attorney General is under very severe criticism for his conduct of the affairs being looked into by the Scott inquiry.  I would have thought that the degree of <Col N="1631" /> culpability of the holder of that office in the UK was a great deal less than the degree of culpability of our office holder in a series of incidents and events.  It is almost impossible to refer to him in this Chamber.  He is, in fact, a political appointee holding a political rather than a judicial office.</P>
    <P>In the past Attorneys General have been Members of this House and probably will be in the future.  It seems very unreal to treat the Attorney General as if he were a judge or the President. Should the phrase &ldquo;or equivalent Office holder&rdquo; cover a great many people it will give them an immunity to which they are not entitled.  It is a way of trying to avoid normal proper public criticism of office holders who are not carrying out their duties as they should and who should be subject to questioning.  It is wrong not to be able to do so and for that reason I think the phrase &ldquo;or equivalent Office holder&rdquo; should be removed, as the chairman of the committee suggested.</P>
    <P>The committee is hamstrung by the continued absence of legislation empowering it to compel witnesses to attend.  Some people who should have attended have refused to do so and I know that other committees have had such results.  In recent months An Post wrote to a committee simply saying representatives would not attend.  An Post snubbed the Oireachtas, although it took enough money from it for many years. We had the greatest difficulty also with Aer Lingus and representatives of that company would not attend until everything was signed, sealed and delivered. We have had a similar problem with Telecom Éireann as well as with a number of other organisations.  In one of the inquiries the Committee of Public Accounts is conducting a former chairman and a former chief executive of a body whose activities were very properly being looked into by the Committee of Public Accounts simply refused to attend and made no apology.  Without the power of compellability in respect of persons and papers this committee and others is somewhat hamstrung.</P>
    <P>Last February the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said that legislation <Col N="1632" /> was agreed in principle and promised that as soon as it was drafted it would be introduced in the House.  A year has passed and we still have not this Bill. We are entitled to know when it will be produced.  These committees are very ineffective without these powers.  It is not in the public interest that they should be unnecessarily ineffective in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been fortunate to be a member of the Committee of Public Accounts since 1989.  All that has been said about it today is true.  I note that the former chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell is in the Chamber and I compliment him on the enormous amount of work we got through under his chairmanship.  It is proper that we are taking steps to reconstruct the Standing Order in the wake of the recent Bill passed by the House on the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Giving statutory basis to value for money audits is one of the most innovative and worthwhile decisions that have been taken.  Up to now the Comptroller and Auditor General could conduct a value for money audit but had no statutory basis for doing so.  Notwithstanding that it was immensely useful, for example he carried out a value for money audit on the efficacy of the BES scheme which highlighted serious issues while observing the sometimes narrow line between policy and the areas within the remit of the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is only one such case.  Obviously, for reasons of staffing and presumably because it was not on a statutory footing, it was not used as widely as it might.  Under the new arrangements there is no reason that this should be the case.</P>
      <P>It certainly will be a great deal less onerous on the taxpayer to use this mechanism to inquire into certain matters rather than other methods to which we have been forced to resort.  The Comptroller and Auditor General could examine whether moneys were expended for the purposes for which they were voted but it is a major step forward to put this on a statutory basis.  It is an important contribution to public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies Jim Mitchell &mdash; the <Col N="1633" /> chairman &mdash; and O'Malley referred to the long promised legislation on privilege and compellability of witnesses.  I would not be as optimistic as Deputy Jim Mitchell but that is probably because I am more naive.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, is the Government Chief Whip and he is in a position to tell us with reasonable certitude when the legislation will be ready.  We have not seen the tenor of the Bill but it is true that it was promised by previous Governments. Its absence undermines the efficacy of the committee.  For example, on occasions in the past it would have been not only desirable but necessary that the Minister concerned would be brought before the committee to assist the committee with its inquiries.</P>
    <P>Because of tradition and precedent this has not proved possible.  Whatever about Ministers, there is no reason the power to send for papers, persons and so on should not be underpinned by legislation. We should be able to compel the person to whom Deputy O'Malley referred to attend the committee.  In finalising a matter this morning relevant persons were not amenable to the committee although their examination was central to its inquiries.</P>
    <P>The remit of the committee is being broadened to include health boards, vocational education committees and non-commercial State bodies.  This is an important development.  Recently a virtue was made out of the fact that a large proportion of the proceeds from the tax amnesty were used to clear the historical debt of the health boards. While this is welcome, for obvious reasons, serious questions must be asked as to how this historical debt was accumulated. It is valuable that the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General will include the health boards, vocational education committees and so on.</P>
    <P>Without underlining the arguments by Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Malley in support of Deputy Mitchell's amendments, I welcome them as they make sense.  I am especially concerned about the phrase &ldquo;or the body concerned&rdquo; as this could seriously threaten the good work of the committee.</P>
    <P>The public recognise that the work of <Col N="1634" /> the Committee of Public Accounts is of immense value, the report published each year by the Comptroller and Auditor General would never be ventilated in public were it not for the assiduous work of the Committee of Public Accounts. We are now moving a step further.  Can the Minister of State tell us when we may expect the legislation dealing with the questions of privilege and compellability?</P>

      <P>The Government does not have any money; it is the function of Parliament to approve the spending of taxpayers' money.  In this context there is accountability to Parliament through the Committee of Public Accounts which is the most important committee of the House.  We should never lose sight of this fact.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Minister for Finance can only draw down funds from the Exchequer account with the prior approval of the Comptroller and Auditor General who will only grant approval on the authority of the Oireachtas.  This is a good safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one exception to this rule, national lottery funding, which is not lodged to the Exchequer account.  There is a need to review the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the way these funds are drawn down.  Any weakness will have to be addressed either in legislation or in a convention to prevent a Government Department drawing down funds without the prior approval of Parliament as certified <Col N="1635" /> by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>We must address the question of contempt. On one occasion the Committee of Public Accounts cited a witness for contempt.  He was sentenced in the High Court but this was quashed on appeal &mdash; he received good constitutional advice &mdash; on the grounds that the sentence was not specified; in other words, in theory any length of sentence could have been imposed and he may have been entitled to a jury trial.  The Committee of Public Accounts established an advisory group and sought the opinion of senior counsel, which it attached to its report, on how the question of contempt and the compellability of witnesses should be addressed.</P>
    <P>There will be a temptation for some civil servants to advise the Government that it should not extend the provisions relating to the compellability of witnesses to include the Committee of Public Accounts because usually the accounting officer attends at the committee.  I strongly advise the Minister of State not to accept their advice.  The Committee of Public Accounts should be entitled to compel witnesses to attend if it deems fit.</P>

      <P>I agree that this committee should always be recognised as the premier committee of the House.  For the past 70 years it has played a praiseworthy and noteworthy role in examining the ways in which the taxpayers' money has been spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates's remarks about the amount we will receive in European funding were nonsense.  We are confident that the sum of £7.2 billion will be forthcoming <Col N="1636" /> for the National Development Plan.  When the chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts invited Ireland's member of the Court of Auditors, Richie Ryan, a former Minister for Finance and outstanding Member of this House, to attend he raised the question of European funding and identified an anomaly in the system as, very often, we do not know exactly where this money is spent.</P>
    <P>During our discussion I made the point that during the period of the National Development Plan approximately £4 billion will be transferred to Brussels and that very often we do not know exactly where the taxpayers' money is spent in Europe.  People tend to forget, when they see cartoons in which politicians are depicted carrying a begging bowl, that we make a contribution to Brussels, even though we are net beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of Standing Order 130.  A welcome new development is that we are not looking just to see that money was actually spent, the amount that was spent and the way it was spent but will be examining in detail economy, efficiency, effectiveness, evaluation systems, procedures and practices.  I thank the Department of Finance for the support it has given the committee by appointing a senior official to it and for giving us a very interesting briefing during the year, including examples given to us by the Secretary, Mr. Cromien, of how other countries conduct their appropriation accounts.  I found the document relating to New Zealand particularly interesting.  Unlike ourselves and most countries which operate a simple cash in, cash out system, the New Zealanders have established a system whereby the country values all its assets in the manner of a large public corporation.  That is a road down which we could go with profit.</P>
    <P>On the question of compellability and privilege, I applaud the Minister for telling us that we will have the necessary legislation and we will actually be able to send for persons, papers and records. Against that, the Committee of Public Accounts is not televised and we, as back-benchers, find that a drawback in that we are there for two or three hours every Thursday morning, examining accounts <Col N="1637" /> line by line.  We often make interesting comments, I think, and those comments cannot be reported on television.  On the question of privilege and compellability, the sooner the legislation is in place the better, because it will allow for transparency and allow people to see their oldest and most famous Dáil committee at work.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with research and backup. We arrive at committee meetings having received a fair amount of documentation but often, because of the sheer volume of the work that must be undertaken, there are not enough facilities for research and back up.  The secretarial staff do an excellent job but research facilities need to be much more professional to enable us to focus on the key issues under discussion on a particular day.  I accept the Minister's comments on policy matters.  These are outside the remit of the committee.  However, recently we examined issues like the Kilrush Marina, one of the Aer Lingus companies, the collection of fines etc. and it seemed necessary that we should at least be able to make recommendations to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that he should take those up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new Standing Order and commend the Government for strengthening the powers of this senior committee of the Dáil and giving it more of the teeth necessary to do the job properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this short debate.  I joint with Deputy Mitchell, the chairman, in his praise of the committee. As a former member of that committee I join with those who have praised him and his predecessor for their work as chairmen.  On behalf of officials of the Department of Finance who cannot speak in the House, I thank the Members who have been generous in their praise of the approach of the Department of Finance to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment removing protection from people in non-commercial State bodies because I believe everybody should be treated equally and should get equal protection under the legislation and the <Col N="1638" /> Standing Order.  It is only fair to allow the body concerned to judge whether confidential information given to the committee would be likely to damage its interests if published.  That is not to say that information should not be forthcoming in private session; it is the public session that I am concerned with.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept the proposal to delete the words &ldquo;or equivalent Office holder&rdquo; from the Standing Order. The Deputy will accept that a Minister of Government and the Government are not the same in legislative terms.  A question was raised as to who an equivalent officeholder might be and it was suggested that it would be, for example, the Ceann Comhairle, the Ombudsman or the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>All Deputies who spoke raised the question of compellability.  Like them, I am anxious that this legislation be brought forward.  I see it as an important part of the Dáil reform process which began last year.  From my experience in the last 12 months I am wary of mentioning exact timetables, but the legislation is at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that it will be before the House before the summer.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy O'Malley has returned because I hesitated to say anything in his absence.  I find remarkable the Progressive Democrats' fascination not just with the Office of the Attorney General but with the officeholder. Hardly a day goes by without one or other of the Progressive Democrats launching an attack on the Attorney General. I do not intend to make judgments on how culpable anyone across the water is, but Deputy O'Malley's statement earlier that the culpability of the holder of that office &mdash; referring to the current Attorney General &mdash; was far greater than the culpability of one across the water was an extraordinary attack on the Attorney General and it is beneath contempt that the Deputy should use the House to launch such an attack.  If Deputies look back over the record of the past 12 months they will find that in practically every case where the Progressive Democrats launched sustained attacks on the Attorney General because of decisions he made, the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1639" /> were wrong and the Attorney General was right.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Public Accounts should not attempt to second guess the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports.  We should not allow the committee to carry out investigations in advance of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is a good working relationship between the two and the Comptroller and Auditor General is usually willing to deal with any concerns Members may have.</P>
      <P>I take the point in regard to people showing contempt of committees and not appearing before them.  The legislation on compellability will address that problem. In regard to the legislative committees, Members are answerable to the House and not to an individual committee of the House.  That is a very important tenet of our democracy and we do not foresee it changing.  I will agree to the deletion of the words &ldquo;equivalent Office holder&rdquo; from Standing Order 130 and commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  This is the first time I raised specific incidents north of the Border.  I am doing so because of the intensity of the representations made to me in relation to incidents which occurred on 24 and 26 <Col N="1641" /> February last in the Silverbridge area of County Armagh.  The first incident involved a number of British troops and RUC personnel and I was told that five helicopters backed them up.  They surrounded a house and outbuildings which were occupied by a number of people.  I accept a large number of people in one house can attract attention, particularly in Border areas, but it is my understanding that on this occasion the transactions in the House and outbuildings were legitimate.  One of the people involved was a 54 year old handicapped person who resides in the house.  He was detained for nearly four hours with many others who arrived at the scene.  The British Army and RUC interrogated six of those people for nearly four hours and a number of them were physically assaulted.  I have a doctor's report to back up those allegations.</P>
      <P>The second incident was more serious. On 26 February at a checkpoint, manned by approximately eight British soldiers a woman of 22 years was taken out of her car, pinned up against it and interrogated for approximately one hour.  A number of people who passed by in cars asked if she was in difficulty but were told in no uncertain terms by British Army personnel to remove themselves from the area or they would be dealt with in a similar fashion.  I have spoken to many people who know the woman in question and it is my understanding that she was physically abused by members of the British Army.  When members of her family were contacted &mdash; one of whom is a solicitor of good repute in the area &mdash; and arrived at the scene the British soldiers ran away and left the woman on the side of the road.  She subsequently went to her local doctor who submitted a letter to me giving details of her medical report.  She stated that she was suffering from extreme anxiety as a result of the incident.  She had bruises on her chest from being flung across the bonnet of her car, she had bruising on her right shoulder and abrasions all over her body. The doctor said she had to be heavily sedated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those two incidents are the culmination of a heavy security presence in recent days in the south Armagh area. <Col N="1642" /> Local people especially young females travelling alone, are living in fear.  I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming into the House to reply and urge him to raise the matter through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and Conference and any other channels available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Ahern for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  I am aware of the two incidents in question.  An individual from the south Armagh area contacted my office on 28 February with a report of harassment and ill-treatment of six local men during a raid by the RUC and British Army at Silverbridge on the afternoon of 24 February and a disturbing account of ill-treatment of a woman &mdash; and threats against her &mdash; by soldiers on the night of 26 February.  On receipt of those reports my officials raised the matters on an urgent basis with the British authorities through the Anglo Irish Secretariat.  On my instructions they have sought an urgent full account and explanation from the British Government of the reported behaviour by the Northern security forces.  I shall ensure that the Deputy's concerns in the matter, which I am sure are widely shared in this House, are brought to the attention of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputy illustrate clearly the problems that arise in the situation where the Nationalist community has little confidence in the security forces.  They illustrate also the importance of ensuring an end to incidents of harassment by members of the security forces and the mistrust to which they have given rise.  The creation and development of confidence by the Nationalist community in the security forces in Northern Ireland remains a central objective of the Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish agreement. Within the conference framework we have raised the issue of harassment and individual cases as they arise.  We have stressed to the British authorities &mdash; and will continue to stress &mdash; that the promotion of security objectives in the <Col N="1643" /> interests of all sections of the community and the promotion of Nationalist confidence in security forces are necessarily complementary.  We have drawn to the attention of the British authorities the inflammatory effects of incidents such as those reported in Silverbridge and the obvious propaganda benefits which the paramilitaries reap from them.  I shall ensure that developments in this area, including specific cases that arise, will continue to be closely addressed within the framework of the conference.  The Government will continue actively to engage the British Government on the question of harassment and ill-treatment by members of the security forces with the aim of achieving a position in which the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland can have full confidence in the security forces, their accountability under the law and the administration of justice.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise this important matter with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. I am sorry the Minister is not present to hear my plea on behalf of the residents of the Schull and Ballydehob areas.  It is well known that the western division of Cork County Council forwarded the tender for the water supply to the Minister's Department on 19 August 1992 for approval.  According to information I received from the Department that tender is still on the Minister's desk awaiting approval and the provision of finance to carry out a much needed extension of the water supply to the Schull regional area.  Schull is an international tourist resort and it is of paramount importance that an adequate water supply is available in the area for the promotion and extension of the tourism, fishing and other industries in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the fishing and agricultural industries cannot expand without an adequate water supply and the development and expansion of the <Col N="1644" /> cottage cheese industry is hampered for the same reason.  Machinery in fish plants is frequently damaged by the lack of pressure in the inadequate water supply and the expansion of ice making facilities are seriously curtailed for the same reason.  There is a demand for 2,000 tonnes of ice per day in the fishing season from the port of Schull, especially during the hake season.  It is sad that ice must be shipped from Castletownbere and Union Hall to supplement the meagre output from the plant in Schull and that farmers cannot cool milk to conform with EU standards due to the poor supply.</P>
      <P>Schull and its hinterland have enormous potential with a proven history of enterprise and growth.  The area has a national and international reputation. Beneath that success lies an empty well and without a proper water supply it cannot continue to survive and prosper.</P>
      <P>It is more than four years since the areas of Schull and Ballydehob were promised a proper water supply.  A billboard in the area outlines EU funding for stages 2 and 3 of the Skibbereen water scheme and indicates it will be extended to Ballydehob and Schull.  Lichens are now growing on that billboard.</P>

      <P>What happened to the European funding received for stages 2 and 3 of the Skibbereen water scheme? Where has that money been spent?  Has it been used for building flyovers and bypasses in Dublin?  The people of west Cork are crying out for a proper water supply in the Schull area.  Action is overdue in this case.  The Minister has the remedy in his Department, he should give the green light, approve the tender and provide finance to carry out this project immediately.</P>

      <P>,<i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the urgency attached to stage 3 of this project which is designed to improve capacity in the Schull and Ballydehob areas of West Cork.  Tenders <Col N="1645" /> for stage 3, which has an estimated cost of £2.7 million, were received in April 1992 and have been technically approved.  However, in common with many other worthwhile proposals in County Cork and throughout the country, it has not been possible to provide financing for it up to now due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water services programme.</P>
    <P>Considerable work and investment have already been undertaken to upgrade the water supply system in Skibbereen. Stage 1, which cost £3.75 million, involved the provision of a new intake, reservoirs, pumping station and distribution network for the town and was completed in August 1988.  Work on stage 2 included the construction of a reservoir and laying of rising and distribution mains to serve the rural area west of Skibbereen.  This stage was completed in July 1992 at a cost of £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>West Cork has more recently benefited from the last round of Structural Funds where, in addition to a flood relief works scheme in Skibbereen, a major water supply project at Timoleague-Courtmacsherry was also completed with EU assistance.</P>
    <P>Nationally, substantial progress was made during the last operational programme with expenditure of nearly £400 million on water and sewerage infrastructure and an EU Structural and Cohesion Fund contribution of over £177 million.  Continued investment to consolidate and build on the progress made to date is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan and the availability of Cohesion Funds will support an accelerated programme of investment in environmental infrastructure relating to water supply and sewage treatment, with investment of around £100 million a year over the period of the plan.  In 1994 alone, £122 million has been provide for water services &mdash; the highest provision secured for this important programme in the history of the State.  Nevertheless, in spite of substantial grant assistance from the EU together with Exchequer financing it is difficult to meet the demands at the pace which we would all like.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> Work is well advanced within the framework of the National Development Plan in putting together the operational programme for environmental services. The determination of priorities under the operational programme will take account of a wide range of factors including the need to meet our obligations under the urban waste water and drinking water directives and the requirements of industry and the tourism sector.  Until this process has been completed, it will not be possible to indicate those schemes which will get to construction in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I recognise the urgency of the case made by the Deputy and I will keep him informed of the position with regard to Skibbereen water supply scheme, stage 3, in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This issue relates to a development which the Tánaiste stated would break up this Coalition Government.  On 24 May last the Tánaiste said in Cork that if Fianna Fáil insisted on including the privatisation of Telecom Éireann on its agenda, it would not be in Government with Labour.  He went on to state that the Government would be failing in its duty if it were to be seen to be looking for a fast buck by selling off part of such an important strategic asset.</P>
      <P>The offer from Cable &amp; Wireless to buy a 25 per cent share in Telecom Éireann's international business, if accepted by the Government, will amount to a sell off of a significant part of Telecom Éireann.  The Government is, of course, anxious to dress it up as a strategic alliance, but this cannot disguise the simple fact that it is a part privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the time has arrived to test the Tánaiste's word about the future of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt anxious to avoid the political <Col N="1647" /> embarrassment of their coalition partners, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications told this House this morning that they did not know about the Cable &amp; Wireless proposal until 9.30 last night. This statement is simply not true.  Not only did the Taoiseach know about the Cable &amp; Wireless interest in Telecom but he was instrumental in teeing it up at a meeting in 1992 with Lord Young, the Chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless.</P>
    <P>On 23 May last, a British Sunday newspaper reported that Cable &amp; Wireless, led by Lord Young, was engaged in high level talks in Dublin with the Irish Government about the purchase of a significant shareholding in Telecom Éireann.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 May reported that Government sources has confirmed that the Taoiseach had met Lord Young and had discussed &ldquo;the general possibility of co-operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this House was denied the opportunity of questioning the Taoiseach about these meetings because the Ceann Comhairle disallowed a question to him on the grounds that the Taoiseach did not have responsibility to the House on the matter.  However, on 1 July last, I had the opportunity to question the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications about the Taoiseach's meetings with Lord Young and in a disingenuous reply the Minister stated: &ldquo;Presumably the reason the Taoiseach spoke to Lord Young about Telecom Éireann was that the subject came up in conversation between them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government is now trying to tell us that despite widely reported and acknowledged meetings between the Taoiseach and Lord Young at which Telecom Éireann was discussed, the Cable &amp; Wireless attempt to buy into Telecom Éireann was never on the agenda &mdash; that despite widespread newspaper reports of the Cable &amp; Wireless bid, both the Taoiseach and the Minister were taken completely by surprise at 9.30 last night.  That kind of subterfuge is not acceptable.  The sale of part of Telecom Éireann, in this case a part of the company's most profitable international business, was no surprise to the Government. <Col N="1648" /> It was hatched out in the Taoiseach's talks with Lord Young.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has, for some time, been considering the possibility of strategic alliances to exploit the international telecommunications business.  Such an approach would be welcome, but the current proposal for Cable and Wireless represents cherry-picking of the most profitable part of Telecom's business. The hiving off of the international business of Telecom Éireann to a part-privatised company will expose not only the staff of Telecom Eireann but also domestic consumers who will be left to pay higher telephone charges to a phone company stripped of its most profitable activity.</P>
    <P>We now need a clear statement from the Taoiseach about this meeting with Lord Young and an assurance from the Minister and the Taoiseach that this deal will not go ahead and that no joint venture or strategic alliance will be concluded without the agreement of the staff of Telecom Éireann and the consent of this House.</P>
    <P>There must be an end to the old Fianna Fáil trick in dealing with the issue of privatisation.  This is not the first time a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and Minister have come to this House and tried to convince us that selling off part of a State company does not constitute privatisation.  When the Government was selling the Irish Sugar Company the then Minister for Agriculture and Food repeatedly stated in the House that selling off parts of the Irish Sugar Company did not constitute privatisation.  We now know that the company was privatised, and in time to come we will know that this deal is the first step in the privatisation of Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>The mandate laid down for State companies in the Programme for Government is that &ldquo;the main strategic initiatives and enterprises remain in the ownership of the Irish people while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private sector&rdquo;.  The role of these enterprises was further developed in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work which charged them with &ldquo;the delivery of services which are efficient, effective and able to compete in the markets they serve&rdquo;.  It is in this context, therefore, and in keeping with this mandate that I have asked Telecom Éireann to complete an examination it has already begun to evaluate fully the role, nature, scope and structure of strategic alliances with all potential partners in fulfilling its mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of efficient, wide-ranging and competitive telecommunications services is essential not only for our business sector but for domestic customers as well.  As a result of changes in technology, the merging of many communications channels and the much more aggressive competitive nature of the market, many telecommunications companies see threats and opportunities in the developments which are already taking place and in how the future is likely to evolve.  As a result there are significant structural changes in the way telecommunications companies are operating worldwide and this is leading to new alliances, mergers and acquisitions between competing and related companies and groups.  It would not be in the interest of Telecom Éireann, the Irish taxpayer or Irish consumers that the company would remain detached from these developments.  It is a fact that the Government, as its shareholder, has <Col N="1650" /> recognised.  I am glad to note that it is also recognised by the company's management and staff.</P>
    <P>Given developments in the worldwide markets it is predictable that other telecommunications companies see opportunities for acquisition, expansion and investment overseas.  It is in this context that Cable &amp; Wireless submitted a proposal earlier this week to enter into a strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann by way of a joint venture between the two companies in which Cable &amp; Wireless would hold a minority stake.  This proposal arises originally from exploratory contacts between the parties some time ago initiated by Cable &amp; Wireless.</P>
    <P>In so far as the proposal contains financial details, these are tentative and conditional on several critical assumptions made by Cable &amp; Wireless.  Furthermore, Cable &amp; Wireless is only one of the overseas telecommunications companies expressing a potential interest in a linkage with Telecom Éireann.  In these circumstances, it would be premature and inadvisable for me to divulge the exact details of the proposal at this stage. This might well prejudice the terms of any other proposals that may emerge. While neither this specific proposal nor any alternative has been considered by the Government, I wish to make it clear that any decision on possible future strategic alliances between Telecom Éireann and any potential partner is a matter for me as Minister responsible for this sector in the first instance and for the Government as shareholder and will be taken in the context of the clear policy as stated in the Programme for Government.  This possibility has never been the case as far as I was concerned, and there is no question now of the Government taking up any individual proposal in isolation. The full range of options will only emerge from the exercise I have today directed Telecom Éireann to undertake.</P>
    <P>The Government must be satisfied that all possible options are on the table and have been properly evaluated.  In doing so, it is clear that account must be taken of the needs of the wider economy and the necessity to ensure that the main utility services impose the lowest possible <Col N="1651" /> burden on our international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, asked the Board of Telecom Éireann to consider, as a clear priority, the options for the future of the company and, in particular, the type of arrangement or strategic alliance it believes would best fit the strategic mission of the company, the interests of the wider economy, of consumers and the employees of the company.  I have also asked it to draw up a full list of potential partners which would have the corporate identikit which would best fit the strategic mission of Telecom Éireann.  The board should report to me on all these matters within six months.  As part of this assessment it will take into account the Cable &amp; Wireless proposal.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am pressing ahead with determination of the appropriate future regulatory regime in line with EU requirements in the whole telecommunications sector.  This is necessary before determining the strategic future of the company.  In any event potential partners would need to know the regulatory terms on which they enter into an alliance or joint venture.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann and its employees have demonstrated an admirable ability to manage necessary change in recent years.  I am confident that these qualities will stand them in good stead in the future when rapid technological and regulatory changes will have to be taken on board. My intention is that the Government will facilitate management of these changes in such a way to ensure the long term growth and wellbeing of the company, its employees, its consumers and the telecommunications sector in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean no disrespect to the Minister, but I regret that the Minister <Col N="1652" /> for Health is not present to reply to a number of questions.</P>
      <P>In 1972 the need for Castlebar General Hospital, as it was then known, was identified by the Western Health Board.  The brief for the development was completed in 1977 and forwarded to the Department of Health.  Ten years later the then Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, approved the commencement of part of the development.  Phase 1 of the hospital was completed in 1991 and brought into service.  This development included 110 beds, theatres, departments of radiology, an out-patients department and a catering department.  The completion of this development is still awaited.</P>
      <P>It was never envisaged in the design brief that this would be a phased development, and the present difficulties in the hospital reflect this.  It is necessary for the development to be completed for the following reasons.  First, there is an urgent need for a geriatric assessment unit.  This hospital serves a catchment area with the highest percentage of people over 65 years of age.  Second, the casualty department, with three cubicles, is totally inadequate to deal with an average of 16,500 patients each year.  The isolation of the casualty department from the X-ray and ward areas costs approximately £30,000 per year on an ongoing basis.  This department is also the treatment centre for the major accident plan for Horan International Airport, Knock Shrine and the Asahi Plant.  Third, the proposed centre of the building is now at the extreme end and staff have to walk approximately a quarter of a mile to retrieve patients' charts on admission, thus giving rise to very lengthy delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourth, the hospital stores are located 150 metres from the main hospital building. Fifth, the maternity department and labour ward require major upgrading and improvement.  Sixth, there is no flexibility in the integration of male and female patients in the same speciality due to a lack of adequate toilet accommodation and privacy.  The facilities for female patients are inadequate &mdash; four toilets, one bath and two wash-hand basins for 34 patients.  The insufficient number of medical beds has led to constant overcrowding. The Minister's Department <Col N="1653" /> received evidence of this some time ago. In addition, there is a general lack of privacy in the outpatients department which was originally designed as a selfcontained unit.</P>
    <P>The last official transmission of information on this matter took place in the Seanad on 3 February 1994 when the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, in reply to Senator Burke assured him that the need for the second phase of this development is fully accepted and will be given the go ahead as soon as resources permit. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the hospital developments currently in progress and the other contractual obligations and priority commitments to be provided for, particularly in areas such as the provision of health centres and facilities for the handicapped and disabled, it will probably not be possible to proceed with phase 2 in the near future.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a number of questions to which I am not sure Minister Cowen will be able to respond.  Will he confirm that this scheme will be completed by the Government during its term of office? Former Ministers, Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy O'Rourke and EU Commissioner Flynn gave the green light to this development, yet nothing has happened to date.  Will the Minister confirm that this capital development is the number one priority of the Western Health Board?  Public representatives have been told by the health board that it is its number one priority, yet when a delegation recently visited the Minister for Health confusion arose over this matter.  Will he confirm that this development is the number one priority of the Western Health Board in terms of capital and investment and say whether this has been so notified to the Department of Health?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the discrepancy of approximately £9 million between the figures for the completion of the phase 2 development as between the Friends of Mayo General Hospital and his Department?  I will give the reasons for this discrepancy.  Some of the <Col N="1654" /> developments referred to by the Minister of State in the Seanad have already been completed, for example, the conversion of the existing hospital to provide a CSSD physical medicine department and nurse accommodation, and it has been decided that a nurses' training school is not required.  The Department has said it will cost £15 million to complete this development while the health board says it will cost £5.5 to £6 million.  The Discrepancy between the figures has led to confusion about the resources available to the Department.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the consultants who are leaving Mayo General Hospital.  Will the Minister confirm if he has received any factual evidence which support these reports?  If consultants are leaving the hospital it will not benefit the hospital or the people of Mayo.  The people accept the need for the completion of this development.  The work can be completed over the next three and a half years at a minimum cost each year. When the work is completed we will have a fine hospital with over 300 beds which will provide medical facilities to the people of Mayo well into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health is unavoidably absent which, as the Deputy is aware, can happen from time to time.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Kenny for giving me this opportunity of responding, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to the issues he has raised in relation to Mayo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reported departure of consultants, the Western Health Board has no information regarding any consultants leaving Mayo General Hospital.  Where consultants are leaving employment, three months notice is required and no such notice has been received by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the phase 2 development of the hospital, the Minister for Health met a deputation from the friends of Mayo General Hospital some months ago and he indicated that the phase 2 development would be considered in the context of the health capital programme for 1994, having regard to the availability <Col N="1655" /> of resources and the many other competing demands for hospital developments. The Minister accepts the need for the second phase of this development and it will be given the go-ahead as soon as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Phase 2, as planned, includes two ward blocks, the provision of a CSSD, provided for physical medicine, administration, nurse changing, hostel accommodation, on-call staff accommodation and oratory, the extension and upgrading of the obstetric unit as well as a new mortuary.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of these works is in the region of £15 million and it would be wrong to give the impression that this scheme can be accommodated in the 1994 capital programme, given the limited capital funding available.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the board may be considering proposals for a reduced scheme but the Department of Health has no details of these proposals at <Col N="1656" /> present.  As soon as such proposals are submitted to the Department, they will be considered in the light of the overall availability of resources.</P>
    <P>This year's revenue expenditure allocation to the Western Health Board included a special allocation of £200,000 to allow for development of a satelite dialysis unit at Mayo General Hospital. This will improve greatly the service available in the Western Health Board Region for dialysis patients.</P>
    <P>The Minister is sorry he cannot be more specific in relation to the timing of phase 2 of the Castlebar scheme, but the infrastructural deficiency created by the need to complete the scheme is acknowledged and every effort will be made to achieve some progress in the medium term.</P>
    <P>The specific questions Deputy Kenny raised on the Adjournment would be best dealt with during Question Time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 4 March 1994.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value, that is, the rental value of the property. Accordingly, new rateable valuations and revisions of existing valuations reflect the operations of the property market and changes in general economic conditions.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Acts provided mechanisms which allow rateable valuations to reflect changes in rental levels.  The continuous revision cycle is available on an ongoing basis to local authorities and ratepayers to adjust valuations of individual properties.  Statutory provision has been made for adjusting such valuations in order to maintain a reasonable relationship with the valuation of similar properties made previously.  Approximately 15,000 such revisions are processed each year.  An aggrieved ratepayer has the option of appealing a valuation, in the first instance to the Commissioner of Valuation, and, in the second instance, to the Valuation Tribunal.</P>

      <P>The general thrust of corporation tax policy over the past few years has been towards broadening the tax base and eliminating special tax reliefs and shelters in favour of a lower rate of mainstream corporation tax.  Having said that, there will always be a role for targeted, sharply focused reliefs and incentives which provide a clear and verifiable return in terms of employment.</P>
      <P>The 1993 budget and Finance Act contained a comprehensive package of measures designed to assist job creation and stimulate enterprise which spanned all areas of the tax code.  The relief granted under section 51 of the 1993 Finance Act to First Step was a small but important part of this package and its introduction must be seen in this context.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the need to maintain the general direction of policy towards broadening of the tax base it is necessary to maintain the clear policy-based focus of reliefs such as that granted under section 51.  The purpose of this relief is clear; it is a measure to assist an organisation with a proven track record in the area of enterprise development to further improve upon the excellent service which they provide and I believe that it is important to maintain that clear focus. Not only would an extension of the relief obscure this focus, it could also be very costly to the Exchequer.  Accordingly, I do not propose to extend the scope of this relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is available in relation to accounting periods falling between 1 April 1992 and 31 March 1993, in respect of which corporation tax was payable in calendar year 1993.  These are the first accounting periods for which the offset against the bank levy became available.  For those accounting periods, the total amount of bank levy which has been claimed by banks for offset against their corporation tax liability was £26 million.  This figure, I might add, is provisional pending final confirmation by the Revenue Commissioners of the appropriate amounts which qualified for the offset.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I would emphasise that the major objective of the new bank levy arrangements introduced in 1992 was to encourage them to increase the size of their corporation tax amount while at the same time guaranteeing, through the levy, an adequate receipt to the Exchequer.  The new provisions for the levy provide the banking sector with an opportunity to reduce the impact of the bank levy on their annual profit results shown in their commercial accounts but to achieve this a bank must increase its corporpation tax liability above a certain threshold.  This threshold, however, is not static and moves up in line with any increase in accounting profitability of the bank in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This threshold is based on the average corporation tax liability of the banks in the two year period ending 31 March 1991.  That base is in turn indexed in line with the banks' profitability over the years since then.  Thus if a bank has increased its profits since that time, its corporation tax liability must increase to a corresponding level before any possibility of levy offset arises.  Only where the corporation tax liability increases above <Col N="1572" /> that level are the banks entitled to offset an amount of bank levy equal to the excess.  In summary the increased profitability of the banks is being reflected in the 1992 arrangements for the bank and I see no reason therefore why this system should be changed.</P>
    <P>Despite the offset mentioned above, the banks still paid tax as between corporation tax and bank levy of almost £87 million in 1993, a figure that compares favourably with the position in earlier years which clearly indicated that the tax yield from the banking sector is increasing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would add that I agreed with the banks in 1992 that the current levy arrangements would be reviewed after three years in the light of developments over the intervening period.  On that basis I will be reassessing the levy arrangements in the context of the 1995 budget.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new scheme of early retirement from farming which is an EU scheme.  This scheme is one of the accompanying measures to the CAP reform agreed in May 1992.  The scheme is co-financed at the rate of 75 per cent by the EU agriculture budget and is designed to help redress two of the main structural defects in Irish farming, namely, farm size and the age profile of farmers.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that as the EU scheme is specifically directed at farmers it is not relevant to any other type of employment.</P>

      <P>Protection of existing natural habitats is given priority over creation of new habitats as this is more cost effective.  Protecting threatened species and their habitats is a major part of the implementation of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This is achieved by various means, in particular general protection under the planning laws; assessment of developments in areas of scientific interest; and the most vulnerable sites are protected by drawing up management agreements with the landowner or by acquisition.</P>
      <P>Over the next year, I plan to designate a million and a quarter acres of land, 7 per cent of the territory of the State, as natural heritage areas.  These areas are areas where protection of habitats and wildlife will be actively encouraged.  The rural environment protection scheme (REPS) to be implemented this year by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will provide aid for land-owners to protect such habitats.  I also plan this year to designate 30 areas of special protection areas for birds.  The State also directly manages 160,000 acres approximately as national parks and nature reserves.</P>

      <P>Since the completion of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, persons may <Col N="1575" /> purchase duty paid goods in other member states of the European Union, virtually without limit, for their personal consumption in this State, without incurring further tax liability on importation here.  In the event that a person is queried as to the level of purchases of excisable goods, certain guidelines, including indicative amounts, have been laid down at EU level to assist memeber states to distinguish between private and commercial transactions.  Where indicative amounts are exceeded, the onus is on the individual to show that the goods in question are for personal use.</P>
      <P>Duty free purchases made in authorised outlets in the EU fall into a different category where separate rules apply. Such sales are, strictly speaking, not in conformity with the operation of the Internal Market; nevertheless, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers agreed that, as an exceptional arrangement, duty free sales to travellers within the EU may continue until mid-1999 in order to allow the operators involved sufficient time to diversify their activities. Depending on the nature of the goods involved, various quantitative and value limits continue to apply.  In the absence of internal border Customs checks in the EU, compliance with the relevant limits on such sales to individuals is achieved by means of vendor control arrangements. The duty free vendors are obliged to restrict sales to individuals to the permitted limits in the case of specified goods &mdash; drink, tobacco, etc &mdash; and to charge VAT on other goods where the specified value limit is exceeded.  In this regard, I would inform the Deputy that the EU Council recently agreed that this value limit should be doubled to 90 ECU &mdash; £73 &mdash; with effect from 1 April 1994 at the latest.  I am pleased to say that Ireland is already complying with this decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 33 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from the probate tax was £1.7 million in 1993.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I announced significant changes to the probate tax in the budget.  Following careful consideration of the matter, I have decided that spouses are to be completely exempted from probate tax.  Moreover, agricultural land and buildings will be reduced in value by 30 per cent for probate tax purposes.  Both of these significant new reliefs will be retrospective to the introductiopn of probate tax.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the probate tax strike a fair balance between the need to broaden the base for capital taxation and the need to have regard to ability to pay.  It is estimated that, after taking account of the new reliefs, the probate tax will yield about £7 million in a full year.  The probate tax, therefore, represents an important element in the capital taxation code, and the Government has no plans to abolish it.</P>

      <P>The yield from making unemployment benefit, pay related benefit and disability benefit reckonable as income for tax purposes is estimated at approximately £50 million in a full year.  The yield from the taxation of farming profits of full-time and part-time farmers is estimated at £52 million in 1993 and £56 million in 1994. Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures given are to some extent estimated. The figures are the tax paid by full-time farmers together with estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits.</P>
      <P>The figures do not include the PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1990-91, the latest available, indicates that some £33 million in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the actual yield, from making the above mentioned short term social welfare benefits reckonable as income for tax purposes, arises from the taxation of an additional portion of income of a very large number of taxpayers. If the social welfare benefit is the only source of income of the recipient and the recipient's spouse in the tax year, than the income tax exemption limits will generally ensure that no tax will fall to be paid.</P>

      <P>I am committed to a policy of equality of opportunity for all Civil Service staff.  In this context, I am, naturally, anxious to <Col N="1579" /> see a greater gender balance at senior levels in the Civil Service and every effort is and has been made to ensure that there are no barriers, hidden or otherwise, preventing women from progressing to the highest positions.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service has been to the forefront among Irish employers in relation to gender equality matters.  Policy and guidelines on equal opportunities for the Civil Service have been in place since 1986.  They provide a statement of basic principles on which the ongoing development of an equality policy is based.</P>
      <P>Each member of staff is provided with a copy of the policy and guidelines booklet. In addition, a series of equality workshops is being held in individual Departments to ensure that line managers and supervisers are fully aware of the policy and to enable them to explore ways of giving the guidelines practical application in their areas of responsibility. The implementation of the equal opportunities policy in the Civil Service is looked after by the Equality Section in my Department in close consultation with the Civil Service unions.  The review and development of our equality policy is an ongoing process and includes monthly meetings of a joint staff and management equality committee.</P>
      <P>Promotion and recruitment competitions held for appointments in the Civil Service are, of course, open equally to men and women.  Advertisements and circulars announcing external and internal competitions indicate clearly that the Civil Service is committed to a policy of equal opportunity.  Members of interview boards convened by the Civil Service Commission are briefed on the Civil Service policy in relation to equality of opportunity and, in addition, are provided with written guidelines stating the policy in relation to the conducting of interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics relating to the candidature and outcome of recruitment and promotion competitions and membership of interview boards are collected by my Department from the Civil Service Commission and from each Government <Col N="1580" /> Department.  The information is analysed by my Department, in consultation with the Civil Service unions, and is made available to all staff in an annual report. To date the statistics give no indication of gender bias in selection for appointments in the Civil Service, either on recruitment or promotion.  The results show that, in general, women are at least as successful as men in promotion competitions.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Training Centre provides a training course for women in management grades.  The course, which was introduced in 1984, is specifically designed to encourage middle-management grades to develop and enhance their management potential.  Participants in the &ldquo;Women In Management Conference&rdquo; have the option of becoming part of a women in management network on completion of the course.  The network holds half-day workshops about four times a year.  Training in relation to equality issues for staff at clerical levels was introduced recently.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may recall that, in replying to a question on 27 October last, I informed the House that the statutory provisions permitting the reinstatement to their former positions of certain women who resigned from the Civil Service had been challenged by the Employment Equality Agency under the terms <Col N="1582" /> of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and had been found by the Labour Court to be discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment.  The court recommended that the relevant statutory provisions be repealed.  Having taken legal advice on the matter, I informed the House at the time that I believed I had no option but to terminate the practice of reinstatement and introduce the appropriate amending legislation.  My Department subsequently arranged for a Bill to be drafted to give effect to the Labour Court determination and consulted with Departments on the proposed repeal. The draft Bill was ready for submission to the Government when I learned that the Labour Court determination was to be the subject of judicial review by the High Court.  As it appears that the grounds on which the Labour Court made its determination are being challenged in these proceedings, I have decided to suspend further action on the repeal of the legislation pending the outcome of the judicial review.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the changes in the benefit-in-kind on company cars introduced in the 1992 Finance Act.  I have received representations from employers, employees and from various representative bodies about these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I want to point out that this aspect of income tax cannot be seen in isolation from the totality of the measures taken in the income tax area in the last few budgets &mdash; both their underlying rationale, and the fact that these <Col N="1583" /> measures effected substantial mainstream income tax reliefs &mdash; which will benefit all taxpayers to a very significant extent.</P>
    <P>The previous rates of taxable benefit &mdash; i.e. 20 per cent of original market value where all the costs are met by the employer falling to 12½ per cent where the car only is provided &mdash; were clearly very lenient when compared with the costs of private ownership.  When the sliding scale was originally introduced in 1982, it was intended that these rates would double to 40 per cent and 25 per cent for 1983/84 and subsequent years but this change never took place.  There is no doubt that the annual cost to an individual of providing and running a new car is over 40 per cent of the purchase price.  This being the case the increase in the BIK rate to 30 per cent is seen as being fair.  Equally the Government consider that the curtailment of tapering relief, so as to impose a charge in all cases where a company car is available for private use, is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the benefit-in-kind charge does not apply where an employee arranges with his employer that he will not have the use of the car other than for business purposes; therefore, the provision of cars exclusively for business purposes is not being taxed. Alternatively, no charge will arise where an employee uses his own car for work and subject to Revenue approval, is recouped the cost involved by his employer.</P>
    <P>I do not therefore agree that there is a particular tax penalty involved in this charge and do not propose to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <P>The employer PRSI threshold was introduced with a view of targeting relief at sectors where pay levels were considerably below £173 per week.  In my view the restructuring of employers' PRSI has been effective in achieving this objective and has been welcomed by certain employer representatives.</P>
      <P>The impact of the levies threshold on wage formation where an employee's gross income is just below the threshold has been brought to my attention and the situation is being reviewed.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union came into effect on 1 January this year.  As a result a number of Articles of that Treaty which will help bring about the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) which includes a single currency are now effective.  In particular, the European Monetary Institute (EMI) whose tasks include the strengthening of monetary policy co-ordination and to make preparations for the establishment of the European system of central banks, is now operational and is one step towards European Monetary Union.  Other measures such as monitoring of excessive deficits in member states and prohibitions on central bank lending to Governments are designed to help convergence of the <Col N="1587" /> economies of member states towards European Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>As regards other member states, I am not aware of any that have indicated that they do not wish to join the third stage of European Monetary Union.  Ireland, for its part, still aims to be a member from the outset of European Monetary Union and the single currency.  The other member states are also committed to European Monetary Union and the single currency, though both Denmark and the United Kingdom have indicated that they will not be party to European Monetary Union at the outset.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to clause 2 of the proposals for a new pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>Annex 1 to the draft pay agreement deals with the application to the public service of that clause.  Clause 2 (iii) of Annex 1 sets out the proposed arrangements and procedures for dealing with outstanding claims in the public service under clause 3 &mdash; local bargaining &mdash; of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay agreement which has not yet been processed to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 2 (iv) of Annex 1 emphasises the full commitment of the Government and the trade unions concerned to approaching those negotiations on the <Col N="1590" /> basis that real changes involving savings and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will be achieved.  In that context, the proposals provide for payment of 1 per cent on 1 April 1994 which will be fully offset against the outcome of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>What is intended is that for each group of employees outstanding claims will be discussed and arrangements for processing them, on the basis of the options set out in the clause, will be settled.  When that has been done an amount of 1 per cent of the basic pay of the group concerned, from 1 April 1994, will be available either for payment then, if the group concerned so desires, or for use in any subsequent negotiations.</P>
    <P>Until the negotiations have been concluded, I am not in a position to comment on the likely outcome in each case.  The cost of the 1 per cent payment is estimated at approximately £30 million in 1994 or £40 million in a full year in respect of those groups whose claims have not yet been processed to a conclusion.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give a higher threshold of exemption from capital gains tax for people over 65 years of age who, because they will not qualify for old age pension, will be forced to cash in their assets in order to survive and who will quickly run out of money.</Quest>

      <P>Where an individual disposes of an asset it is the capital gain realised on the asset only which is subject to capital gains tax &mdash; CGT &mdash; not the asset itself.  Moreover, capital gains tax is only payable on the real gain &mdash; i.e. the gain net of inflation. The first £1,000 worth of real gains made by an individual in each year of assesment is exempt.  In the case of married couples, the first £2,000 each year is exempt.  These significant reliefs mean that the effective rate of capital gains tax is generally well below the nominal rate of 40 per cent.  There are also a number of investment options which are either exempt from tax or subject to tax concessions, for example, Savings Certificates and Savings Bonds which are completely tax-free and Government gilts which are exempt from capital gains tax in the hands of individual investors. In addition, an individual can invest up to £50,000 &mdash; £100,000 in the case of a married couple &mdash; in a Special Savings Account which is subject to DIRT at the concessionary rate of 10 per cent. Moreover, individuals over 65 years of age who are not liable or fully liable to income tax can obtain a refund of DIRT from the Revenue Commissioners.  All of the above reliefs are of considerable benefit to retired people over 65 years. Accordingly, I do not propose to provide any additional capital gains tax relief for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that an individual's entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension is assessed with regard to the income and assets of the individual.  Generally speaking, a person would not be deemed ineligible for non-contributory pension unless he or she had a reasonably significant level of assets.  In practice, most people who have accumulated such a level of assets will have worked before <Col N="1592" /> reaching retirement age and will have built up a PRSI record sufficient to enable them to qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>The Government remains convinced that the changes in the residential property tax announced in the budget are fully justified as a modest contribution towards tilting the balance in the tax code more in favour of productive investment, which helps in creating and safeguarding employment, and also giving a greater measure of equity in the tax system.  From the employment viewpoint, the relative tax advantages of investment in dearer housing can only be to the disadvantage of industrial and commercial investment which is essential for employment growth.</P>
      <P>The Government on 8 February 1994 announced that any anomalies in the residential property tax scheme would be examined and dealt with in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  In accordance with this undertaking the Government is considering anomalies which could cause unreasonable hardship.  The aim is to preserve the essential features of the budget proposal, particularly in terms of its contribution to the wider pro-employment thrust of taxation policies, whilst at the same time catering for the more deserving anomalies in the scheme which have been highlighted in recent weeks.  Any such anomalies have of course been inherent in the basic structure of the scheme as it has existed since its introduction and which has not been altered by the budget extensions.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to his questions on Tuesday last (Questions Nos. 80 and 83), the person concerned is currently in receipt of Disability Benefit at the weekly rate of £25 together with a smokeless fuel allowance of £3.  He is also in receipt of a supplementary welfare allowance payment directly from the Eastern Health Board of £30.60 a week as well as £24.65 rent allowance.  The national fuel allowance is not payable in conjunction with disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, section 175, responsibility for making supplementary welfare allowance payments is vested in the health boards.  Each health board administers the scheme on behalf of my Department through its community welfare service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these arrangements it is not possible for my Department to pay supplementary welfare allowance directly to a Social Welfare Customer.  My Department has initiated the development of a new integrated computer system for all short-term payments, which will allow instant interaction between claims for supplementary welfare allowance and the Department's short-term payments.  It is planned to complete this major project in phases over the next three years.  In the meantime, my Department is working closely with the health boards to establish in detail the requirements of the new <Col N="1595" /> system in relation to supplementary welfare allowance payments.  When fully implemented, the integrated computer system will facilitate the co-ordination of sickness and unemployment payments with those of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

However, the additional costs, if any, of the managerial and top professional offices are likely to be marginal, bearing in mind that creation of the offices concerned involved, in many cases, the suppression of other offices.  While proposals for the creation of a small number of additional professional offices at various levels were sanctioned, any additional costs arising would not be significant.</P>

When he brought his cattle identity cards to the local livestock office for punching and stamping it was found that one card had already been punched and stamped indicating that the animal had previously received premium.  In accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme he was initially deemed to be ineligible for payment on any of the animals applied on.

      <P>The person named was paid an advance of his 1993 beef cow grant on 3 December 1993.  His application is being processed further at present and any balance due will be paid in the near future.</P>
      <P>He cannot be paid any suckler cow premium as he has no quota at present. If he succeeds in obtaining a quota from the national reserve, his 1993 suckler cow application will be considered.  Application forms seeking allocation from the national reserve will be available within ten days.</P>
      <P>He applied for the January-February 1993 special beef premium on four animals but failed to present the cattle identity cards despite being requested twice to do so.  He applied for the June 1993 special beef premium on 11 animals but three of these were found to be under age at inspection on 24 September 1993. The application in respect of the remaining eight animals is being processed at present and if found in order, a 60 per cent advance will be paid shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of the balance cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him-her in the course of 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with <Col N="1609" /> EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.  The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the level of employment in the semi-State sector is determined by the respective entities involved in the sector.  The most recent information available to me indicates an employment level of 60,800 in respect of semi-State bodies which operate under the aegis of my Department.  It is difficult at this stage to predict precise variations in overall employment by 1999.  It is the responsibility of each body to employ an organisational and operational strategy best suited to its needs.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> it is stated that the most significant contribution which the State enterprises can make to national economic and social development is the delivery of services which are efficient, effective and able to compete in the markets they serve.  In addition, State enterprises will consider, where possible, the issue of productive job growth in the context of their mandate to manage and develop profitable enterprises.  I have no plans to engage an advisory or study team for the purposes suggested by the Deputy.</P>
