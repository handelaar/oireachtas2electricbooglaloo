      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies John Bruton and Gilmore.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call first Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I request your permission under Standing Order 30 to move the adjournment of the Dáil to debate a motion requesting the Government not to nominate Mr. Harry Whelehan, SC for appointment as President of the High Court until an adequate explanation has first been given to the Dáil of the seven months delay in Mr. Whelehan's office in examining an extradition warrant for Father Brendan Smyth and a letter in the matter from the British Attorney General and deploring the inadequacy of the ministerial replies to date on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and <Col N="1366" /> important matter of public interest: the need for the Government to make a full statement on the circumstances of the seven months delay in processing a warrant for the extradition to Northern Ireland of Father Brendan Smyth, where he was wanted for serious sexual offences against children, and the need for the Government to defer any proposed appointment of the Attorney General to a senior judicial position until all aspects of the handling by his office of the extradition warrant for Father Smyth have been clarified.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matters fully I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 30 and, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 4, 5, 1, 6 and 8.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 3, 4 and 5 shall be decided without debate; (2) the Second Stage of No. 1 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate; (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State, the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 45 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case and (iii) Members may share time.  Private Members Business shall be No. 19.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 3, 4 and 5 be decided without debate satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with No. 1 satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the time limits but I am concerned that a legitimate question should be capable of being put to any Member in possession during a debate.  It would be <Col N="1367" /> unfair if a Member's time was to be restricted by the fact that he accepted legitimate questions from other Members.  Will you, Sir, interpret these time limits with a degree of flexibility which would allow additional time at the end of a contribution where a Member has been good enough to accept a question from another Member and respond to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, the Chair is obliged to conform to the rulings of the House.  Any departure from that would be a matter for the House itself or, in the first instance perhaps, the Committee on Procedure and Privilages.  What the Deputy is suggesting is, to my mind, a contentious matter and one which as yet has not been acceptable to the Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into contention with you, Sir, but it is a long established precedent in this House that interruptions are allowable. There is not anything in Standing Orders to prevent them and the precedents of earlier rulings of your predecessors allow them.  In practice, however, they are not being allowed now and that is probably because we have time limits.  I am asking you, Sir, if you will agree to interpret the time limits with a measure of flexibility so that if a Member accepts a legitimate question from another Member, that will not be taken away from the allocated time.  We can deal with the matter by changing Standing Orders but a flexible interpretation by you, Sir, would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Chair will be flexible, as the House knows, in all such matters but in the matter of a <Col N="1368" /> serious departure of the kind suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if you refer to the Official Reports of this House there is no doubt that at one time what Deputy Bruton referred to was permissible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that some process has happened in the meantime to make it impossible.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, if you are a man of flexibility &mdash; and I accept you see yourself as somebody who is flexible and wishes this House to be a relevant and lively debating Chamber &mdash; to revert to the better practices of your far distant predecessors and abandon the rigidity which has crept into this House in recent times.  It is a bit like hardening of the arteries.  We have to go back to being a youthful, vibrant assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell.  For the information of Members of the House, this matter was a formal item in my name on the agenda for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at its last meeting.  It has been agreed to discuss this, Sir, at a meeting of the Whips to take place tomorrow to <Col N="1369" /> deal with this and other matters.  Hopefully, we might arrive at a successful conclusion to our deliberations at that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to allow this time limit to go through at this stage, having made my point, but we will be returning to this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with Item No. 1 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach said on the radio there were a number of questions that have to be answered about the Attorney General's handling of the paedophile case and the delay involved, will he make provision for the Minister for Justice to make a statement in the House on this matter when the answers the Taoiseach has sought have been provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly appropriate now, Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate to some of the business we are dealing with today, including the Courts and Court Officers Bill.  I would be reluctant to see the Government nominate Mr. Whelehan to any position while he remained under a cloud of unanswered <Col N="1370" /> questions here in the Dáil.  For the sake of the judicial system, these questions should first be answered in full for everybody's sake, including that of Mr. Whelehan.  I hope the Taoiseach will be willing to have answers in the House to questions that he admitted this morning have not yet been answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clear up the matter for the House.  We asked for explanations.  The explanations are not fully in accord with what we would expect and we are asking for further explanations.  It is not a matter of unanswered questions or the suitability of the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it there will be no appointment until these explanations &mdash; if the Taoiseach wants to call them explanations, I am happy to use that term &mdash; have been provided here in the House?  Can we take it there will be no recommendation to appoint Mr. Whelehan until the explanations to the Taoiseach have been provided in the Dáil?  They have not been provided so far.</P>

Is the <Col N="1374" /> Taoiseach aware that if there is a repetition of the circumstances that arose in the tragic Kelly Fitzgerald case, the health boards cannot intervene to protect the lives of children?  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is outrageous that this legislation has not been brought into force?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of wideranging and significant reforms of the legal system, which is a central part of our democratic society.  The operation of the entire legal system impacts, often profoundly, on the lives of our citizens. Key elements of that system &mdash; the courts and judicial structures &mdash; have served this country very well.  However, modern demands and pressures on the system have pointed up the need to reshape the courts structure and to change our approach to some aspects of the judicial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reforms that I am introducing in this Bill cover three broad areas of the <Col N="1382" /> legal system: the courts, the Judiciary and legal costs.  In the courts area the first of two major provisions represents something of an innovation in the development of our courts structure.  A new Court of Appeal with both criminal and civil jurisdiction is to be established. This meets the commitment in the Programme for Government to ease the workload of the Supreme Court and improve access to it.</P>
    <P>The background to this is the substantial increase in appeals to the Supreme Court in recent years and the inevitable delay in hearing those appeals which has resulted.  Appeals against High Court decisions in personal injuries actions account for much of this increase and are often subject to most delay because of the urgent nature of other types of appeals, for example, in constitutional cases.  Delays of this nature may result in a considerable injustice on litigants and I am anxious to avoid unnecessary delays in hearing cases.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new court, staffed by three full-time judges with jurisdiction to hear appeals against High Court decisions in personal injuries actions and in certain other matters is the right response to the appeals backlog. It will allow the Supreme Court to concentrate to a greater extent on constitutional matters and appeals on other important questions of law, which is more in keeping with its status as a court of final appeal as provided in the Constitution.  The new court will also incorporate the existing jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I will come back to the structure and functions of the new court later in my speech.</P>
    <P>The second major development in the courts area relates to the Judicial Commission. In the Programme for a Partnership Government we included an undertaking to establish a Judicial Commission. The Courts and Court Officers Bill has given me the opportunity to make provision for setting up a Judicial Commission.  Section 29 will empower <Col N="1383" /> the Minister for Justice to set up such a commission to be known as the Courts Commission.  The commission, in accordance with this section, will be established, on a statutory basis.  It will become a permanent feature on the landscape in so far as the administration of justice through the courts system is concerned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the commission will be to advise the Minister and the Government on the organisation and management of the courts and courts service and on such other matters which, in the opinion of the Minister or the Commission, have a bearing on the capacity of the courts to discharge their functions.</P>
    <P>The administration of our justice system has undergone rapid change in the last 30 or so years.  As a result more people are now using the courts.  We have more judges, courts staff, solicitors and barristers than at any other time.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, many aspects of our courts system have not kept pace with these changes and, consequently, many of those people who have had to use or work in our courts have not, for one reason or another, been able to do so in ideal conditions.  Some court users may have had difficulty in gaining access to the courts; others may have experienced unfriendliness in the courts; others may have found the condition of the courthouse accommodation totally unacceptable, while others may have found recourse to the courts grossly expensive.</P>
    <P>Major reform of the law governing the organisation and structure of the courts is long overdue.  While the proposed Bill is a big step in the direction of major reform, there is also a need for an overall review of the existing system. I consider that the establishment of the proposed Courts Commission is the best way to achieve this.</P>
    <P>To be effective, the commission must have an input not only from judges at senior level and from lawyers but also from non-lawyers who have expertise in other relevant fields.  I am thinking of <Col N="1384" /> people with experience and expertise in the world of business, management, administration, finance, people with knowledge of consumer requirements and so on.  While it would not be possible to create, at one stroke, a commission which would represent all the interests that we might consider desirable &mdash; if the commission is too large it will not function effectively &mdash; I will be looking to the kind of interests and expertise I have just mentioned when it comes to the initial appointments.  I say &ldquo;initial appointments&rdquo; because, in general, it would be desirable to allow up for change in commission membership from time to time so that different kinds of expertise can be brought in as and when required.  I will make an announcement in the near future concerning terms of reference and membership of the commission.</P>
    <P>There is, as I said before, a need for an overall review of the existing system which would examine current practices and procedures, find ways to maximise the use of our resources and devise an overall strategy and approach to achieve a modern and efficient system for the administration of justice.  I consider that the proposed Courts Commission should be given the task of advising me and the Government as to how these objectives might be met and that the commission should reflect the views of the various people who work in the courts or who have recourse to the courts on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the question of establishing a permanent independent courts service operating outside the aegis of the Department of Justice is one issue which the commission will be asked to address.  I and my Department would welcome consideration of this issue by the commission.</P>
    <P>In addressing the question of establishing a permanent independent courts service, the commission will have to have regard to whether such an institutional change in the arrangements of our courts system would best serve all users of the courts effectively, efficiently and inexpensively.  The Government <Col N="1385" /> and I look forward to its views on this and other important areas of the courts administration.</P>
    <P>I now come to the second broad area of reform.  This relates to the Judiciary. Part III provides for setting up a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. Firstly let me say that certain basic principles underlying the procedure for the appointment of judges cannot be affected, for constitutional reasons, by the new arrangements to be put in place.  The Government will continue to decide the names of persons to be forwarded to the President for judicial appointment in accordance with Article 35.1 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  As a Parliament, however, we can move towards introducing new and more transparent procedures leading up to the appointment of a person to fill a judicial office.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge that the present system for selecting persons for appointment to judicial office has served us well.  As a people we have been fortunate to have a Judiciary which is respected for its integrity, fairness and independence.  These facts, however, do not mean that the system for appointing judges is immune from criticism of the manner in which it operates. It may be inevitable that the system is open to criticism as it is a procedure reserved thus far exclusively to the Government, without any clear accompanying statutory or other guidelines as to how the system should operate.</P>
    <P>It will be the task of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which will consist of senior members of the Judiciary, the Chairman of the Bar Council and the President of the Law Society, to advise me and the Government, through its committees, of the names of persons suitable for appointment as judges.  I might add that I have no fixed view about the precise makeup of the board, and I would be interested to hear the views of Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the advice of the Advisory Board will not and cannot be binding on <Col N="1386" /> the Government, because of the provisions of the Constitution, nevertheless it is expressly provided in the Bill that the Government shall first have regard to the names submitted in advising the President on the appointment of a judge.  That is a significant direction to Government and highlights the pivotal role that I expect the new board and its committees to play.  No Government could lightly ignore a recommendation made to it by a committee of the board.</P>
    <P>The board's remit will not extend to appointments to the offices of the Chief Justice or Presidents of the other courts. This exception is desirable because the Government, in considering appointments to these top judicial offices will want, among other things, to ensure continuity and consistency in the running and operation of various courts. That is why I have provided in the Bill that the Government would have to first have regard to the suitability of serving judges when appointing persons to fill these offices.</P>
    <P>The next major change that I want to refer to affecting the Judiciary is the lowering of the retirement age of judges.  This will only affect judges newly appointed after the enactment of the Bill.  Therefore, the retirement age for serving judges remains at 72 years in the High and Supreme Court, 70 years in the Circuit Court and 65 in the District Court with provision for annual extensions up to age 70 for District Court judges.  It would, of course, be completely unacceptable, and not just for legal reasons, to interfere with the terms of service of existing judges.</P>
    <P>However, for some time, I have been considering why the retirement ages of the Judiciary should be any different from the position that applies generally across the public and private sectors. One effect of the higher retirement ages for the Judiciary is that the age profile of the Judiciary as a whole tends to be high.  Obviously the appointment of younger judges would result in a younger age profile among our judges in the short term but ultimately could be guaranteed only by aligning the <Col N="1387" /> retirement age of judges more closely with the &ldquo;norm&rdquo; of 65 years.</P>
    <P>However, it has been represented to me that senior judges in all courts would have valuable experience and insights that should not be lost through too restrictive an approach to this issue. Therefore, I am considering whether the proposed retirement age should be set at a higher level than 65 years as provided at present in the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this matter.</P>
    <P>Another key provision of this Bill in regard to the Judiciary is contained in section 39.  The effect of this provision is to make solicitors of ten years standing eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges.  At present solicitors are eligible only for appointment as judges of the District Court.  I see no good reason a practising solicitor of ten years standing should not be eligible for appointment at least as a Circuit Court judge.  It has been suggested that solicitors lack experience of advocacy and experience in the conduct of cases in that court but many solicitors possess highly relevant and desirable qualifications based on their experience as practitioners.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in its report on the legal profession published in 1990 said: &ldquo;It is arguable that the adversarial system of justice requires that judges should preferably be recruited from the ranks of experienced advocates&rdquo;.  It found that experience of court practice and procedure as well as of the law is probably more important than advocacy skills.  We should take a wider view of what makes a lawyer eligible, in terms of qualifications, for judicial appointment.  Experience of advocacy may be an important factor in determining whether a person is suitable for appointment as a judge, but I question whether it should be the primary factor taken into account.</P>
    <P>The legal system itself will be the clear winner as a result of this provision because it will increase the pool of potential candidates for appointments <Col N="1388" /> to the Circuit Court.  There is the prospect of a spin-off benefit too.  The appearance of solicitor-judges on the Circuit Court bench is likely to encourage the solicitors' profession to exercise its rights of audience in the Circuit Court.  Apparently it has been reluctant to do this up to now although there are a few notable exceptions.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission believed that the presence of former solicitors as judges would encourage more solicitors to engage in advocacy, since they may well be inhibited from exercising their rights of audience at present because judges in the Circuit Court and higher courts are former barristers.  The Fair Trade Commission also stated that more use by solicitors of their rights of audience would give the public more choice and could reduce legal costs.</P>
    <P>On a separate issue in relation to judicial appointments, I formed the view some time ago that it was anomalous that service by judges on European Courts counted for nothing in terms of eligibility for appointment to our superior courts.  Therefore, I have included in section 20 of the Bill a provision whereby service as a judge of the European Court of Justice or the European Court of First Instance shall be reckonable for the purpose of qualifying for appointment as a judge of the superior courts.  The basic eligibility requirement for appointment to the High and Supreme Courts under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, is 12 years practice at the Bar.  The device used in the Bill to take account of service in these European Courts is that such service will be deemed to be practice at the Bar.</P>
    <P>I now come to the issue of court dress.  I expect that many Deputies will give a wholehearted welcome to my initiative on banning the wearing of wigs by barristers in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The wigs will not only be on the green, they will be on the bonfire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many barristers favour the retention of the wig on the grounds that it makes them gender and age neutral in presenting cases in court.  However, I do not believe that this argument stands up to much scrutiny. I question whether it is necessary that barristers should have to disguise their age and sex to this extent when appearing in court.  Legislation has already been introduced in the area of court dress.  The wearing of wigs and gowns by judges, barristers and solicitors in all family law proceedings in the District, Circuit and High Courts was prohibited under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 provides that neither the judge, barrister or solicitor concern in the examination of a witness by way of television link in certain proceedings, including a sexual offence, shall wear a wig or gown.  The purpose of these provisions was to ensure that these proceedings were more informal and I am satisfied with the effect of those changes.</P>
      <P>I might again refer to the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  They did not believe that the wearing of wigs in particular added to the formality and the solemnity of the court, rather the reverse, they considered them to be anachronistic, unnecessary and possibly intimidatory.  The commission went on to say that it would be a sensible move towards a more modern profession if barristers no longer wore wigs.  It is my view that the practice of the wearing of wigs by barristers in court would be incongruous in the modern courts and judicial system that I have in mind in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to move on now to those provisions of the Bill concerning certain court officers.  Many of the changes that I am proposing in this area are aimed at reducing legal costs as provided for in the Programme for Government.  The two Taxing Masters of the High Court have the task of determining the costs which a successful party in an action <Col N="1390" /> may recover from another party&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;party and party&rdquo; costs, the costs payable by a client to a solicitor, solicitor and client costs &mdash; where these have not been agreed.  They have a vital role in adjudicating on fees and costs claimed by counsel and solicitors.  A decision by a Taxing Master is reviewable by the High Court, on the application of any party who is dissatisfied with the costs allowed.  The powers of the Taxing Masters have been the subject of review and consideration by the courts over a number of years.  The decisions of the courts in several cases indicate that the current powers of the Taxing Masters to disallow fees of counsel and solicitors in respect of High and Supreme Court actions are more limited than I consider desirable in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned that the public interest is not being served by the current limits on the powers of the Taxing Masters to disallow fees charged by counsel, solicitors or expert and professional witnesses which the Taxing Masters considered to be excessive.  The costs of litigation impact on the ordinary citizen.  The Taxing Masters do not have sufficient powers to measure and determine legal costs in the High and Supreme Courts and this has implications for the cost of litigation.  It is essential that sufficient powers are vested in the Taxing Masters to enable them to disallow excessive fees charged by counsel, solicitors or expert professional witnesses.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 36 of the Bill, the Taxing Masters will be empowered to measure and value the work done by solicitors or counsel and to allow any charge or expense which they consider in their discretion to be fair and reasonable.  There is a number of other important provisions in this section such as requiring a party who claims costs to pay the costs of taxation where the Taxing Master taxes off more than one-sixth of a &ldquo;party and party&rdquo; bill of costs.  At present the &ldquo;one-sixth rule&rdquo;, as it is known, only applies to solicitor and client taxations.  This provision was among the recommendations <Col N="1391" /> made by the working party established by the Attorney General on increased efficiency and reduction in costs in High Court personal injury actions.  I will be speaking in a moment about other recommendations made by that working party.</P>
    <P>I should add that the new powers being given to the Taxing Masters will also extend to &ldquo;party and party&rdquo; taxations in the Circuit Court, which are carried out by county registrars, who are vested with all the powers of Taxing Masters of the High Court for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Master of the High Court, I am proposing to increase the Master's jurisdiction to enable him or her to deal with a range of applications that at present must be dealt with by High Court judges.  Section 32 of the Bill confers on the Master of the High Court the powers of a judge of the High Court in relation to High Court applications allocated for hearing by him or her by the President of the High Court. I am convinced that this will help streamline High Court proceedings by freeing up the time spent by High Court judges in dealing with these applications.</P>
    <P>Under section 22 of the Courts Acts, 1981, a judge may order the payment of interest on damages awarded to a litigant. The Master of the High Court and other court officers have the competence in specified cases to order payment of moneys.  However, the High Court has ruled that the discretion to order the payment of interest is not vested in court officers at present.  This means that a plaintiff who seeks an award of interest on foot of an order by a court for the principal sum must apply separately to a judge at additional cost. To my mind this is not acceptable and certainly was not what was intended in framing the Courts Act, 1981.  The purpose of section 35, therefore, is to provide that the Master of the High Court and other court officers can order payment of interest where an order for the payment of the principal sum comes <Col N="1392" /> within their competence.  The Bill also makes provision for appeals in relation to these new powers.</P>
    <P>Section 35 also provides that interest on legal costs will become payable from the time the costs are taxed, or are agreed between the parties, whichever is the earlier.  This is a move away from the existing position, decided by the Supreme Court in 1988, whereby interest on costs awarded by a court are payable from the date of the court judgment.  Where costs are not agreed or are not agreed for some time, it seems to me that calculation of interest with reference to the date of judgment is inappropriate.  I am satisfied that a fairer reference is from the time of taxation or agreement of costs.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in section 37 to confer on the Superior Courts Rules Committee the power to make rules requiring the disclosure of experts' reports in High Court personal injuries actions without having to apply to court.  The idea is to speed up these actions and to reduce costs.  The background to this provision is that in 1991 the then Attorney General established a working party on increased efficiency and reduction in costs in High Court personal injury actions.  The working party was comprised of representatives of the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Irish Insurance Federation.  The working party made a number of recommendations and it has been possible to incorporate some of these in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the working party was that provision should be made obliging litigants to make disclosure to other parties to a personal injury action of information, sources of evidence and expert opinion in relation to their case.  Section 37 of the Bill empowers the Superior Courts Rules Committee to make rules of court requiring disclosure in personal injuries actions of a report or statement from any expert intended to be called to give evidence of medical or paramedical opinion such as registered medical practitioners; a statement or report from any other expert of the evidence intended to <Col N="1393" /> be given by that expert; the names and addresses of any witnesses intended to be called to give evidence as to facts in a case; a full statement of all items of special damage claimed and a written statement from the Department of Social Welfare detailing all social welfare payments made to the plaintiff subsequent to an accident.  These proposals, when implemented, should help to reduce the length of personal injuries actions in the High Court and thereby reduce costs.</P>
    <P>Finally, and again in the area of costs, I will have a new residual power under section 43 of the Bill to make &ldquo;party and party&rdquo; costs rules.  These are the costs paid by an unsuccessful litigant to a successful litigant.  This enabling power could be used where a court rules-making body fails to make costs rules or where costs rules are submitted to me which I consider to be excessive. The powers of the Minister for Justice at present are limited to concurring or deciding not to concur, with rules made by a rules committee.  Again the provisions of section 43 are aimed at reducing the level of legal costs.  Deputies will agree that the provisions I have just outlined will establish a very firm basis for keeping legal costs to reasonable levels in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I want to return to deal in some more detail with the provisions of the Bill relating to the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  In section 2 I am providing that the new court will be established on a day to be fixed by a Government order.  I can assure Deputies that there will be no avoidable delay in the establishment of the new court but time will be necessary to get the new structure up and running.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the designation by the Government of an ordinary judge of the High Court to be President of the Court of Appeal and the designation by the Chief Justice of two ordinary judges of the High Court to be ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the provision ensures that the judges of the new court will have a constitutional status.  One effect of this <Col N="1394" /> arrangement is that existing statutory provisions relating to High Court judges will automatically apply to the judges of the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.  Appeals against High Court decisions in personal injuries actions will take up much of the time of the new court, but its jurisdiction will also include appeals against decisions of the High Court in relation to <i>ex parte</i> motions and other applications, except in judicial review proceedings, as well as decisions on actions under specific enactments such as the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear appeals in these matters is being transferred to the new court.  However, the Court of Appeal will have no role in appeals where they involve a question of validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  Such appeals shall continue to lie to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Earlier proposals to establish a new court envisaged a Court of Appeal with a purely civil jurisdiction.  It has since been decided, I think wisely, to amalgamate the existing Court of Criminal Appeal with the new court to form a single, full-time court of appeal.  There are a number of advantages in amalgamating the two appeal jurisdictions into one court.  One clear advantage is that it gives us a simpler courts structure. Section 4, therefore, transfers the powers, jurisdiction and functions of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the new court.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 15 is that the Superior Courts Rules Committee, with my concurrence, may make Rules of Court for carrying into effect the provisions of the Bill relating to the Court of Appeal.  Such rules would relate to matters such as pleading, practice and procedure before the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 16 changes from three to four the number of <i>ex-officio</i> members of the Superior Courts Rules Committee and makes provision for the <i>ex-officio</i> membership of the Committee of the President of the Court of Appeal.  The full <Col N="1395" /> complement of <i>ex-officio</i> members will be the Chief Justice who is chairman of the committee, the President of the High Court who is vice-chairman, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the organisation of the Court of Appeal.  It provides that the full court of three judges shall hear and determine matters before the court.  Subsection (3) is similar to section 7 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928.  It provides for the hearing and determination of interlocutory applications by the President or by a judge of the court and is an exception to the requirement that the court shall sit as a court of three judges.</P>
    <P>Section 19 increases the number of ordinary judges of the High Court from 16 to 19, three of whom will be designated to be judges of the Court of Appeal.  This is not the only increase in numbers of judges that I will provide for in this legislation.  I will move an amendment on Committee Stage to increase the maximum number of High Court judges, including the President of the High Court, from 20 to 22.  I will also propose an increase in the maximum number of judges of the Circuit Court, including the President of that court, from 18 to 25.  In addition, the maximum number of judges of the District Court, including the President of the District Court, will be increased from 46 to 51.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional judges will help to eliminate the delays being experienced in the hearing of criminal trials and family law cases and other civil actions in these courts.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with new procedures relating to the appointment of judges.  Section 23 provides that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will consist of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the President of the Law Reform Commission, the Chairman of the Council of the Bar of <Col N="1396" /> Ireland and the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  I have an open mind as to the appropriateness of the proposed composition of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the board will perform its functions through committees. For considering persons suitable for appointment to the Supreme, Appeal and High Courts, there will be a committee consisting of all the members of the board, except the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts. For considering persons suitable for appointment to the circuit Court, there will be a committee consisting of the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the Chairman of the Bar Council and the President of the Law Society.  In the case of appointments to the District Court the will be a committee consisting of the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the Chairman of the Bar Council and the President of the Law Society.  In the case of appointments to the District Court the committee will consist of the President of the District Court, the Chairman of the Bar Council and the President of the Law Society.  This committee system is a very practical approach, one which, I feel sure will facilitate the work of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that where a judicial office is vacant the Minister shall request the relevant committee to submit to her-him the names of at least three and not more than five persons whom the committee believes are suitable for appointment and the reasons for that belief.  The Government will be obliged first to have regard to the names of those persons in advising the President on the appointment of a judge.  A committee may consult the Attorney General on the suitability of a person for judicial office.</P>
    <P>Section 25 also prohibits a committee from submitting the name of a person to the Minister unless that person has completed such courses of education or training as the Minister may provide for in regulations, following consultation with the board.</P>
    <P>There should be provision for the further education and training of persons who wish to be appointed as judges.  Many lawyers specialise in particular areas of the law and may not <Col N="1397" /> have the opportunity to keep up to date with developments in other branches of the law in which they have not specialised.</P>
    <P>Section 25 will enable me to ensure that prospective appointees are sufficiently up to date with developments in the law before they are appointed. The training and education of lawyers understandably concentrates on a study of the law.  However, in practice we require our judges to have more than an excellent understanding of the law.  We expect them to be compassionate, understanding and to appreciate the practical problems people face daily in a complex society.  We are fortunate that our Judiciary consists of persons with these qualities.  However, there is a case for ensuring that prospective appointees to judicial office have a wider training and education than study of the law.  This provision will give me statutory powers to require prospective appointees to undertake that wider training.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that a person who wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office or who wishes another person to be considered for appointment may inform the board in writing.  A committee may not submit the name of a person to the Minister unless it is satisfied that the person satisfies the relevant statutory requirements and has displayed in his or her practice a degree of competence and probity consistent with the proposed appointment, is suitable on grounds of character and temperament and is suitable in all other respects.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill contains a wide range of reforming measures affecting many parts of the courts and judicial system.  Society today, which these legal structures support, is undergoing rapid change.  Ours is a modern and complex society which places many demands on those legal structures.  It is right that these structures should be updated and reformed to reflect society's needs.  If our legal structures, in particular our courts and judicial systems, stagnate we risk <Col N="1398" /> impeding the development of our society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must look closely and critically at the structure and form of these systems.  The Courts and Court Officers Bill is the result of such a review and introduces a number of vital structural and other changes which I am satisfied will greatly improve our courts and judicial systems.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the many and novel proposals in the Bill.  I will be open to ideas from all sides of the House that would improve it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will incorporate a number of my suggestions in the Bill.  One of its greatest weaknesses is that it lacks provision for accountability.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has slavishly allowed successive Governments to strike at the very heart of democracy by using the Whips system to ensure that the views of the Government, more particularly of a Minister or the Civil Service, prevail and that Parliament is no more than a rubber stamp.  Accountability has become a thing of the past, with whole sections of Government having enormous power without accountability. Even Ministers who, under the Constitution, are accountable to Dáil Éireann have developed the habit of giving minimal, often misleading, information to the House by the clever use of words or the omission of detail.  The House itself must put an end to this practice.  We have the power to do so.  I referred to this in my brief contribution to the debate on the formation of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Ceann Comhairle must evolve, with or without the consent of the Government, into one which protects the basic rights of Members and the public.  The Ceann Comhairle himself should lay down rules which, if broken, would amount to contempt of Parliament and which would be punished severely.  The House should give legislative support to such rules.  We <Col N="1399" /> have rules of court: why not rules of Parliament?</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill add further to the total lack of accountability which attaches to the office of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the efficient, effective and economic administration of the courts as distinct from the judicial process itself within the courts.  There are too many unaccountable, independent republics within this Republic.  Being independent does not and must not mean being unaccountable.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Judicial Appointments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bil, 1994 published by me on 6 October last contains many sections which have been incorporated in one shape or another in the Bill before us.  However, three important sections of my Bill have been totally ignored, they are sections 14, 15 and 16.  Section 14 of my Bill would require the Courts Commission to have an Accounting Officer who would be answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the value-for-money aspects of the work of the commission and for the efficient administration of the courts.  He would also have to report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on the workings of the commission, that is to ensure that the laws laid down by the Legislature are being applied and that the appointment of judges and their training is being conducted in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>There had been some suggestion that parliamentary committees might vet judicial appointments.  On balance, this may have been too difficult a procedure to introduce but a requirement whereby a commission would report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on the way it goes about its work, and to the Committee of Public Accounts for the financial probity, has not been included in the provisions of this Bill. Furthermore, the Fine Gael proposal that each of the presidents of the courts should be given their budgets for which they would account to the commission has not been proceeded with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> Here again we see that any attempt to introduce accountability and transparency to Parliament is dealt another blow.  What we are getting is a dictatorship of the courts administration system and the Department of Justice without any accountability whatsoever.  We have no Attorney General to answer questions in this House.  We have a courts administration system which will be supervised by the commission but no accounting officer to report to the Dáil. The Dáil should not allow this happen. We are the people who decide whether this goes through.  It is time we dealt a blow to this whole approach to Government by ensuring that there are adequate and proper systems of parliamentary accountability.</P>
    <P>A further illustration of this lack of accountability is to be found in the roles of the Attorney General and of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In Britain the Attorney General is a Member of Parliament and answers questions in the House of Commons, as we discovered yesterday, in relation to his own brief and, where applicable, to that of the Director of Public Prosecutions. No such facility exists here where the Director of Public Prosecutions can be responsible for a case being thrown out by the courts because a book of evidence repeatedly is not available to the court in a serious case involving manslaughter, and there is nobody to give an explanation.  A newspaper reported recently that a judge had written to the Director of Public Prosecutions about a case, before its hearing, which the judge himself subsequently heard.  Again, there is nobody to account to Parliament as to the propriety of these actions.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has had additional powers vested in him by the courts in the exercise of which he has been inconsistent and patchy.  He has been zealous in his approach to the X case and that of Cabinet confidentiality but, in the case of an accused paedophile, subsequently found guilty, we find that an extradition request to Northern Ireland lay in his office for almost seven <Col N="1401" /> months without any action being taken on it.  We are asked to believe that the Attorney General did not see or hear of this extradition request and that nobody in his office advised him of its existence. After all, there are officers in the office of the Attorney General, a small office. Whether the Attorney General was told about the request, or got to hear about it, in the words of one lawyer, it should have taken between three minutes and three days only to decide on the processing of these warrants.</P>
    <P>There is something very unusual about a request to extradite a man on serious charges from the Attorney General in an adjoining jurisdiction, which was communicated to the office of the Attorney General here &mdash; this was confirmed by way of parliamentary question in the House of Commons yesterday &mdash; which was not acted on and, we are led to believe, not even brought to the attention of the Attorney General here who, under the 1987 Extradition Act, is personally responsible for ensuring that the legislation passed by this House is enacted.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the 1987 Extradition Act all extradition warrants, political or not, should be seen and dealt with personally by the Attorney General.  That is what the law requires. It is puzzling to have the House informed that this had been the first request since 1987.  A particular form of words was used to give that impression, later used to justify the suggestion that this was a reference to a particular part of the Act.  The British Attorney General told the House of Commons yesterday that his office had been in touch with the Attorney General's Office directly in the Northern Ireland paedophile extradition case.  I believe strongly, and am confident the evidence I have shows that the Dáil was misled last week in reply to questions put by me.  The Minister for Justice led the House to believe that the extradition request was somehow complicated, unique and therefore required time to consider.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but, as he and the House will be aware, I have sought consistently to protect individuals who are not Members of this House from serious allegations made against them under privilege of the House.  I would ask the Deputy to remember my words on various occasions, that if serious charges are to be made against persons outside this House, or indeed in this House, it should not be done by way of innuendo across the floor of the House but rather by substantive motion.  Therefore, I would ask the Deputy to refrain from any reflection on Ministers, or especially persons outside the House, because those people I seek to protect outside the House, have no redress against accusations made in this privileged Assembly.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for that most helpful intervention but I stand over every word I have said.  My reference was to a reply to a parliamentary question in this House.  If you mean, Sir, by substantive motion a motion which would be carried by the Opposition in this House against a Government with a huge majority, then nothing could be carried in this House.  That is undemocratic and unacceptable.  I have to say this, Sir, that you may seek to protect those people but I seek to protect children outside this House who were left exposed for seven months while a law officer of this State, and agents of Government, whose duty it is to protect them, took no action.  I would put those concerns before anybody's ruling.</P>

      <P>The Minister said also that the Attorney General was not personally aware, as he was required to be under the provisions of the 1987 Extradition Act, of the request.  Given <Col N="1403" /> the reply to a parliamentary question in the House of Commons yesterday this information now also appears to be disingenuous since the British Attorney General stated that his office made a direct request to the Attorney General's office in the Republic of Ireland as early as 29 April last year.  Therefore, it is insulting to Members of this House that we must depend on information given in a foreign Parliament and that Ministers here are pompously protected no matter how economic they are with the truth.</P>
      <P>The following quotation is from an article by Liam Collins in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 30 October 1994:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the 1987 Extradition Act, all warrants must be seen personally by the Attorney General unless he is sick or out of the country&rdquo;, said one senior legal figure.  &ldquo;It is of the essence that, political or not, all warrants are personally vetted by him.  In that context, what happened is absolutely astonishing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The article continues:</P>
      <P>Another senior lawyer believes that the 1987 Extradition Act goes further than making the Attorney General personally responsible for dealing with extradition warrants.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Attorney General has to give a specific direction that the warrant is not to go ahead, and in the absence of a specific direction from the Attorney General's office, the warrant would then be processed by the gardaí&rdquo;, the lawyer said.  What this means is that he would actively have had to stop it. &ldquo;The whole thing looks extraordinary to me&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General must make a statement on these matters and should be available to be questioned by Members of the House.  Perhaps the best way to do this would be to require him to appear before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Last week a senior civil servant was wheeled <Col N="1404" /> out to be questioned by journalists. Why should the Attorney General not be questioned on grave matters of this kind?</P>
    <P>We have missed a golden opportunity to introduce accountability for the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in given circumstances where the public interest requires it.  This Bill is the product of the most closed Department of State led by a Minister who has many skills but who puts no value on accountability and transparency.  Why do we allow ourselves to be bullied?  Surely it is time the Dáil had the courage to assert itself. What happened to the great Labour tradition under Brendan Corish and Frank Cluskey?  This latest legislative chicanery will add fuel to the fire.  There is a burning desire in the hearts of the people for greater accountability.  It is time that became a fire in the hearts of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Judges themselves cannot escape criticism.  There is no Lord Mackay in the Four Courts.  The opposite appears to be the case.  It has been suggested that the Government's efficiency unit has been denied access to the courts.  It should be sent in at once.  I understood we were to have 19 High Court judges and a new court of appeal.  However, the Minister informed the House this morning that we are to have 22 High Court judges, an increase of six, 25 Circuit Court judges, an increase of seven, and 51 District Court judges, an increase of five, the total increase being 18.  People criticise the number of legislators we have.  Now, however, we have 103 judges, including the five Supreme Court judges.  It is fine if there is justification for appointing 103 judges, but how are we to know there is justification when the Government efficiency unit is blocked by judges from going into the courts to find out if this burden on the taxpayer is necessary?</P>
    <P>We have more High Court judges than Cabinet Ministers, and they have a difficult job to do.  However, do they, and their colleagues in the lower courts, sit sufficient hours daily and <Col N="1405" /> sufficient days per year to justify an endless creation of more judges?  I will put it in blunt terms that both the judges and the public will understand.  Some judges and administrators have the system over a barrel; there will continue to be a backlog of cases until we appoint four judges.  That is the way they operate and this is the main reason for the creation of more judges.</P>
    <P>There has been no independent examination of the efficiency of court procedures.  In the North there is an agency with its own chief executive responsible for the administration of the courts.  The Bar Council and the Law Society have jointly recommended a similar agency for the Republic, again, resisted publicly by a leading judge.  The administration of the courts has more to do with the Executive than with the judicial wing of Government, yet the Judiciary seems to believe they should have authority with no responsibility. The Bill makes no effort to tackle this matter although we in this House are charged with taking on vested interest wherever we find it.  Without doubt the Judiciary have served this country well, but where we find the need for critical examination, democracy demands that we should have the courage to carry out that examination.  Nowhere is this matter addressed in this Bill.  I will seek to amend it accordingly on Committee Stage.  Nowhere is there provision for accountability by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, nor is there representation on this board for anybody but judges and lawyers, although the Minister referred this morning to the possibility of involving people with financial expertise, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The proposed courts commission which would have the function of advising the Government on the organisation and management of the courts and court service is mentioned but, again, its make-up is not clear.  It was in connection with the courts commission that the Minister mentioned finance and management people.  Why should the consumer not have strong representation on this board?  Under section 43 (1) <Col N="1406" /> dealing with the scales of costs, a rulesmaking authority will be requested to submit to the Minister rules concerning questions of costs, including scales of solicitors' costs and counsels' fees. Surely the Director of Consumer Affairs should have strong representation on this authority.  The Minister made no reference to that authority.</P>
    <P>The President appoints the Chief Justice and President of the High Court. Who will appoint the President of the Appeals Court?  Under section 4 (2) (b) it is provided that there shall be vested in the Court of Appeal all powers, jurisdictions or functions which, immediately before the date of its establishment, were vested in or capable of being exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal, and all cases pending before the Court of Criminal Appeal on that date shall be cognisable by the Court of Appeal.  This is not what was promised in the Programme for Government. Section 4 (3) may well be unconstitutional. Furthermore, I ask the Minister to spell out what is meant by section 6 (2) regarding remuneration. Who will be the President of this Court of Appeal?  Is it to be a Labour nominee to compensate for its loss of face in regard to the Presidency of the High Court?  What has happened to respect for the judicial process when positions of this kind are traded off for political advantage?</P>
    <P>I have been campaigning for reform of the courts since I published the Reform of the Courts (Administration) Bill, 1986 and whereas I welcome many of the changes being introduced, I repeat that the proposals so far announced do not provide for proper accountability to Parliament for the efficient administration of the courts. This is a serious defect.  The Bill must not be allowed to pass without this defect being remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the membership of the commission.  She might consider the appointment of a suitable former politician to this board, somebody who would be acceptable to all sides of <Col N="1407" /> the House.  It is often thought that politicians are somehow tainted but most politicians have tremendous experience in dealing with the needs of the community. I do not want to see some party hack of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other party being appointed, but it should be possible to find somebody whom everybody would agree would be a good appointee to serve and bring to bear his or her experience as a former Member of this House or of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the retirement age of judges.  I do not fancy the idea of the Minister or anybody else having the power to extend judicial appointments from year to year.  I note, if press reports are correct, that some of the Minister's colleagues raised this point with her at a Fianna Fáil Party meeting.  In general a retirement age of 72 years in the High Court and 70 years in the Supreme Court is too high.  Most people have to retire at 65.  Perhaps in the judicial process where people have gained much experience we could allow a year or two more.  However, whatever age is allowed &mdash; and I certainly would not support going beyond 67 years &mdash; there should not be an extension unless for exceptional reasons, and such extensions should not be on a year to year basis with the sanction of the Minister, as that would be tantamount to saying that a judge will get a year's extension if he behaves to the Minister's liking and that would be unconstitutional.  We need to trash this out and, if there is a reason somebody over 67 should be appointed a judge, I would be happy to listen to the arguments for that also. However, I feel that in general 72 is too old.</P>
    <P>In regard to the appointment of solicitors to the Circuit Court, the Minister has relied heavily on the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on the reform of legal procedures.  Following the publication of the Bill I introduced on reform of the courts administration in 1986 I gave almost three hours of evidence to that commission during the course of which I pressed for some of <Col N="1408" /> the proposals recommended by the Minister in this legislation.  On the wearing of wigs I sought to introduce an amendment to provide for the removal of that regulation in a recent Bill, but was told if I withdrew it a similar amendment would be included in a future Bill.  I welcome that provision in this Bill.  I referred earlier to wigs on the green or on the bonfire.  I am sure Deputy McDowell will burn his wig on Sandymout Green to mark the passing of this legislation.  If the regulation governing the wearing of wigs by lawyers and judges is abolished, one of the great distinctions which intimidated solicitors would no longer exist.  It would not be possible to determine if a person sitting on the bench in the court was a barrister or a solicitor unless judges continue to wear gowns to maintain the distinction. Solicitors could overcome that by wearing gowns also.  One of the difficulties heretofore was that a solicitor who appeared in court stood out because he was dressed in civilian clothes while his barrister and the judge wore wigs and gowns.  The solicitor was intimidated, felt out of place and was often made to feel so by lawyers sitting on the bench.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of solicitors to the Circuit Court, but why not go the whole hog and appoint them to the High Court?  I know of many competent solicitors on whose opinion I would more quickly rely than that of some barristers and <i>vice versa.</i>  Many solicitors are competent enough to sit as judges in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  If they are allowed argue a case before those courts consideration should be given to allowing them sit as judges in those courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in her speech that: &ldquo;Under the provisions of section 36 of the Bill the Taxing Masters will be empowered to measure and value the work done by solicitors or counsel and to allow any charge or expense which they consider in their discretion to be fair and reasonable&rdquo;.  I hope that is not the Minister's way of telling us she will give them discretion to increase fees or to allow costs to be increased and that <Col N="1409" /> this is somehow a sop to people who might otherwise have concerns about the Bill.  I want to ensure that consumers who go to court to have their rights vindicated are considered first and foremost in terms of the proposed changes.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Bill is marred by the fact that it is the most extensive smoke screen ever to billow from Government Buildings.  It attempts to cover a wide gulf between the Government parties.  The manner of its announcement clearly illustrated the underlying instability of the Government as it was meant to be a cover for Labour's retreat, but the Minister for Justice did not even leave it this veil to cover its embarrassment.  I invite Labour Deputies, particularly those who are Members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to consider the defects I highlighted and to join with other Members to ensure this Bill does not pass without fundamental amendment, particularly in terms of accountability to Parliament for the administration of the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation certain aspects of which are pertinent to recent political events particularly relating to the suitability of the current Attorney General for the position of President of the High Court.  I welcome the attempt to depoliticise judicial appointments. Article 35.2 of the Constitution requires judges to be independent in the exercise of their functions.  That principle of judicial independence is one of the most important bulwarks of our democracy. It is generally agreed that our judges have served us well, in the main, but there is something wrong with a system of appointment to a judicial vacancy when the first point of inquiry by people speculating on the successor whether here, in the Law Library or in legal circles, is the political affiliations of potential candidates.  The linking of judicial appointments with political services rendered or even political allegiance in former years or in student <Col N="1410" /> years debases the nature of judicial office.  Furthermore, it is no longer acceptable to the majority of citizens &mdash; we live in a more questioning and sceptical world.  It has become essential that the independence of our judges be clearly demonstrated.  While the Progressive Democrats welcome the shift to depoliticise judicial appointments, it is ironic and singularly unprincipled of the Government to change the law as a trade-off in the rather inelegant squabble between the Government parties to secure the appointment of the current Attorney General to the Presidency of the High Court.  The longer the Government leaves the filling of that appointment on the long finger the more stark will be his appointment as an exception to the rule which will be put into law when this Bill is enacted.  Under this Bill, sitting High Court judges will have to be considered first for appointment to the Presidency of the High Court and the tradition of giving the Attorney General the first offer of a judicial appointment during his term of office will no longer continue.  If the principle of depoliticising judicial appointments and introducing fair procedures in respect of them is worth promoting in legislation, surely it is sound enough to apply to this appointment.  We are seeing a trade-off in that Fianna Fáil will have its way on this appointment in return for future changes.</P>
      <P>It is worth remarking that under this Bill all ordinary judicial appointments will have to go before the appointments board but not appointments for President of the various courts, although the Bill provides that in future the Government must give first consideration to sitting members of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the specific problem we have faced over the last few months, namely, the appointment, because of tradition, of the current Attorney General to the post of President of the High Court.  When I asked the Taoiseach about the origins and sustainability of that precedent, the matter was ruled out of order as it would anticipate the debate on this legislation I <Col N="1411" /> would like the Minister now to outline how that precedent was set, its workability and to accept that it is a missed opportunity not to address it in this Bill with immediate effect in terms of the forthcoming appointment to the High Court.  It is a missed opportunity for the Bill to ignore the salient problem we face which has brought about a political crisis and had the capacity at one stage to bring down the Government.  As legal adviser to the Government and an <i>exofficio</i> Member of the Cabinet the Attorney General is already a highly political animal.  He is the personal political appointee of the Taoiseach of the day.  As has been shown, the appointment of a serving Attorney General to the bench can become the subject of intense political scrutiny and that is highly undesirable and brings the Judiciary into disrepute.  In recent weeks, particularly when the crisis arose, we saw an unprecedented display of the names of judges being used as weapons by the political parties in Government.  Given that all Attorneys Generals are closely linked with the Government of the day, the supposed tradition that Attorneys General are given first refusal on judicial appointments ought to be re-examined in the light of the central importance of the principle of judicial independence.  We could go so far as to say that it is time to consider whether Attorneys General ought to be debarred from holding judicial office until the period of office of the Government they advised has expired.</P>
    <P>This House has been greatly insulted by the fact that in the House of Commons questions were answered on the contacts made between the Attorney General's office and the Northern prosecution authorities in the Fr. Brendan Smyth extradition case while those questions, which were legitimately put by me on the Adjournment last week, were not replied to either by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice.  I asked for information to demonstrate that real <Col N="1412" /> efforts were made to facilitate the RUC in the execution of these warrants, but no answers were forthcoming.  We heard today that the British House of Commons was told in written replies to a Member of Parliament, that contact had been made between the British Attorney General and the Attorney General here.  I was refused answers to those questions last week.  This is the final insult to this House in terms of accountability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell spoke cogently about lack of accountability to this House by the Attorney General and the DPP.  Serious issues arise on an ongoing basis which should be replied to in this House.  I refer particularly to questions I tabled on activities or non-activities of the DPP.  Even on general issues of policy there is no method by which I can put a question to the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice on prosecuting cases, how victim impact evidence is compiled or, for example, how serious charges were withdrawn and lesser charges preferred against the parents of Kelly Fitzgerald.  There is no vehicle in this House to address such issues.  We must consider the procedures for accountability to this House by the Attorney General and the DPP.  It is frustrating, particularly for spokespersons on Justice, to be unable to get answers to such questions.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the Attorney General did not see the extradition warrants in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  As a sop to the Opposition howls of protest at this neglect of duty in the Attorney General's office, a direction has been given to that office that in future all extradition warrants must be brought to the attention of the Attorney General. This is an admission that the provisions in the Extradition Act, 1987, were not complied with.  Under that Act the Attorney General has direct responsibility for dealing with such warrants and is relieved from that responsibility and allowed delegate those functions only in times of absence or illness.</P>
    <P>The admission by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, on the <Col N="1413" /> Adjournment that things went wrong in the Attorney General's office and that new procedures were being put in place misses the point.  We are talking about accountability, whether the matter was brought to the attention of the Attorney General or whether his officials acted incorrectly and without due haste is beside the point.  The Attorney General, as the chief law officer of the State, is responsible for the processing of warrants under the Act and he failed in that duty.  This lack of responsibility, which also applies to ministerial functions, and the attempt to blame officials and avoid accountability is very worrying.</P>
    <P>There are many proposals in this Bill which are not new.  The principal change outlined by the Minister, the introduction of a Court of Appeal, was mooted many years ago and was included in the Programme for Government when the Progressive Democrats Party was in Government.  It is typical that the introduction of a reasonably good proposal is delayed for years and then rushed through with indecent haste in response to a political squabble between the Government parties and to give a job to a nominee of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been trumpeted by the Government as a measure designed to overcome court overcrowding and to bring the court system into the 20th century, are very worthy aims, but the Bill fails to satisfy those needs.  The measures in the Bill have, in large part, been dictated by the mandarins in the insurance industry, particularly in regard to the Court of Appeal.  While nobody would deny that courts are overburdened with personal injury cases, this Bill will alleviate the stress suffered by insurance claims managers and defence solicitors rather than that of plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses and jurors.  The Bill merely addresses overcrowding in the High Court and Supreme Court, courts that deal with a tiny part only of the business of the court service, the insides of which most ordinary people will never see.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I welcome the Minister's confirmation &mdash; I had intended to remind her of the promises made by the Taoiseach &mdash; of an increase in the number of judges in the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court.  Delays and backlogs in cases throughout the country have resulted in a lowering of morale among the staff who work in the courts system, the general public and solicitors and barristers in making settlements which may not be in the best interests of their clients but in order to avoid further adjournments that would result in interminable delays in the processing of litigation cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to create a modern court system but again the Government has failed to address the vital need for a family court system as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. In its report the Law Reform Commission pointed to the huge increase in family law matters which contribute in large part to the delays in Circuit Court and High Court cases. Regional family courts must be established on a national basis.  The need for reform is colourfully outlined in chapter 7 of the Law Reform Commission report which states:</P>
    <P>...serious problems and defects in the manner in which family cases are handled within our existing courts system.  This concern is shared by many professionals working within the system.  Many of the problems derive from under-resourcing, both physical and human.  The picture which emerges is one of a system struggling and barely managing to cope with the very great increase in family litigation in recent years.  The result is a sad parody of that which might be expected in a state whose Constitution rightly places such emphasis on the protection of family life.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the acute problems in the Circuit Court outside Dublin where, in some venues, a judge may have as many as 70 cases on the list for one day.  It states that applications for <Col N="1415" /> judicial separation raise complex issues of family finance and property and sensitive problems concerning child custody and access.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;We have heard of judges sitting late into the night in attempts to complete their lists, but for many cases adjournments for several weeks are inevitable.&rdquo; The commission said this is intolerable for judges and litigants alike.  There is an urgent need for the establishment of family courts and the opportunity has been missed in the Bill to deal with this matter. This need is becoming greater every day given the increasing number of family law cases coming before the courts. The Circuit Court has increased jurisdiction since 1991.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the urgent need to address the question of court accommodation which is in a disastrous state throughout the country.  I am advised that some of our courts sit in buildings which have been condemned as dangerous while others sit in dance halls and other unsuitable premises because proper accommodation is not available.  In most courthouses there are no consultation facilities with the result that people are forced to discuss confidential and often painful matters with their lawyers in the full gaze of the public and within earshot of their opponents.</P>
    <P>In their submission to the Department of Justice the Bar Council and the Law Society outlined their considered views and suggestions for reform of the court service.  One of the matters they highlighted was the question of delays &mdash; to which I referred &mdash; and another that delay undermines justice.  They also indicated that the experience of many litigants of their day in court is a nightmare given that people are crowded into small ante-rooms and there are no proper consultation facilities; they will remember it as a traumatic experience rather than as an opportunity to obtain justice.  Most of those who have had the painful and stressful experience of attending court in this jurisdiction will tell the Minister that they are the <Col N="1416" /> Dickensian court buildings, the lack of privacy and dignity afforded to litigants, the delays in hearings in the District and Circuit Courts and the Government's repeated failure to alleviate the pressure on the family law list which are the real scandal and anachronism.  The Bill fails to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill establishes a new court to be called the Court of Appeal, heralded as the solution to the problem of overcrowding in the system.  There is no doubt that this will relieve pressure on the Supreme Court, which is necessary, although it will not have an impact on the District and Circuit Courts where most of the business of the courts for ordinary citizens is transacted.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that section 3 (2) (a) provides that the President, who shall be an ordinary judge of the High Court, shall be designated by the Government.  Perhaps it is a mistake to use the word &ldquo;designated&rdquo; but this is a revealing provision.  The Government has not been given the power to designate a judge under any other statute with the exception of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which established the Special Criminal Court. This exception is provided for under Article 38.3.1º of the Constitution.  As the Minister outlined, under the Constitution judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. The question of which duties are to be performed by a judge when appointed has always been a matter for the President of the court of which the judge is a member.  This provision may be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge as a result.  Be that as it may it is clear that section 3 (2) (a) has been drafted for the purpose of ensuring that the Government can give this job to its preferred candidate.  I can see no other reason for exempting the appointment of the President of the new Court of Appeal from the appointment provisions laid down elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) (a) provides that all cases pending before the Supreme Court on the date of establishment of <Col N="1417" /> the new Court of Appeal shall be cognisable by that court.  All appeals now before the Supreme Court were brought in exercise of a constitutional right of appeal to that court.  While that right may be validly regulated by statute no statute regulating that right existed at the time those appeals were brought. Accordingly, section 4 (2) (a) retrospectively interferes with a constitutional right and may be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is empowered to identify and inform the Government of the names of persons suitable for appointment to judicial office.  It will operate in committees and the relevant committee will be required to submit the names of between three and five persons to the Minister with reasons for each person being considered appropriate.  I have not had an opportunity to consider other options in great detail.  On Committee Stage we might discuss the question of whether this provision should be altered; the Minister said she will consider the possibility of including other candidates on the list.</P>
    <P>The Government is to retain its power to advise the President on the appointment of the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the other courts.  I see no reason this should be the case.  As recent events have shown, appointments to these positions can be as politically charged and controversial as any other; perhaps more so.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the submission of names to the Government.  This procedure is flawed and unworkable in a number of ways.  Subsection (4) provides that a committee shall not submit the names of persons who have not attended a course of education or training prescribed by the Minister.  This provision will have a number of undesirable consequences given that the primary purpose of the legislation is ensure that the most suitable candidates are appointed.  If this provision goes through the board will be lucky if it can submit the names of any candidates to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> It is unlikely in the extreme that senior members of the legal profession will be willing to put their names forward for consideration if this means they will have to make a public declaration of their application by taking time out from their practices to attend training courses even though they may not ultimately be successful in their application. To put it bluntly it is unlikely that busy practitioners will set themselves up for public exposure by trotting off to attend these training courses in advance as, if their application is rejected, everyone would know they had attended them.  This requirement will generate damaging gossip and speculation which would undermine the authority and standing of members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the progress in appointing women to senior judicial positions may not be maintained under the new system.  In general, politicians know what is politically correct and this Minister's remarks and recent appointments have shown there is a widespread understanding of the need and sympathy for the appointment of women to the Bench when the opportunity arises. The public welcome such appointments. The advisory committees of the board, however, which unlike politicians, will not be answerable to the public and which will for the moment consist exclusively of men who are well past middle age may not care whether women are appointed to the Bench.  It would be worth including a clause in the terms of reference of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to ensure that it reflects on and considers the desirability of appointing women to judicial positions.  It is clear from the progress of women in public life that nothing happens by chance.  If the board is not required to be mindful of the need for gender balance in the Judiciary in keeping with the Government's policy on State boards, members of the board may well forget about the need to appoint women to the Bench.</P>
    <P>Section 37 which deals with the further powers of the Superior Courts <Col N="1419" /> Rules Committee introduces various changes to pre-trial procedures, curiously in personal injury cases only.  If these changes are necessary in the interests of justice surely they are necessary in all cases.  Again, they read like an insurance company's wish list.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice asking how we dealt with allegations of bias against judges.  Recently such an allegation was made against a High Court judge and I was seeking to find out how many such allegations of bias were made.  Of the two recent cases, one referred to the abortion information case, Dublin Well Woman Centre Ltd and others <i>v.</i>  Ireland, the Attorney General and SPUC.  An allegation of bias was made as to the competence and independence of the judge who was scheduled to hear the case and the matter is now on appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>We need criteria to adjudicate on allegations of bias.  In a previous case, an application was made because the barrister was a daughter of the judge and it was held that he should have withdrawn because he would have been biased in the matter.  If this practice proliferates we will be on the slippery slope.  I could imagine that barristers who are aware that a judge has a pro-pensity to being a liberal or conservative on social matters would allege that he was either liberal or conservative and therefore did not want his case heard by him.</P>
    <P>In many cases judges withdraw from cases because they have personal knowledge of the circumstances or know one of the parties to the case but where the case is a matter of public concern and a constitutional issue we would be going down the slippery slope if barristers and solicitors cherry-picked the judges on the basis of his or her personal views. My question on this matter was disallowed and I was told it was a matter for the courts.  As we are discussing the Courts and Court Officers Bill, will the Minister reply to this issue?  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, or some independent body, would be the body to <Col N="1420" /> consider allegations of bias against the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>A judge can be disciplined or dismissed for whatever reason only by a motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not sure that a judge has ever been removed from office but if we are seeking to depoliticise the appointment of judges perhaps we could depoliticise their removal from office.  Perhaps the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board could be charged with hearing complaints against judges. I do not see any reason that judges. should be above a complaints procedure. If the need arose to dismiss a judge the matter could be discussed by the board before going to Government. These matters could be addressed in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Courts and Court Officers Bill is pertinent.  The depoliticisation of judicial appointments is welcome but it is sad that this very laudable principle will not take effect in the current controversial appointment of the incumbent Attorney General to the Presidency of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill is the text of the Labour Party's surrender to Fianna Fáil.  This is the treaty of Tinakilly.</P>
      <P>This Bill is what Labour gets in return for Fianna Fáil making Harry Whelehan President of the High Court.  It is a Bill born prematurely in a political crisis. New courts legislation was on the way, but as the half considered poorly prepared content of this Bill betrays, it was not due to be introduced for quite some time.  On the Government's own admission, this Bill was brought forward as part of the solution to a political problem &mdash; the long-distance clash between the Taoiseach in Australia and the Tánaiste in America which almost landed Ireland in a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is shotgun legislation &mdash; the progeny of the one-night-stand at Baldonnel. Its early appearance on the Dáil Order Paper owes more to politics than to legislative consideration.  So any consideration of this Bill, has to examine <Col N="1421" /> not just its legislative, but its political content as well.</P>
    <P>This Bill has to be read in the context of the political controversy over the proposed appointment of the Attorney General as President of the High Court. And since that was the issue on which the Labour Party chose to test its mettle against Fianna Fáil, it is the most recent and reliable measurement of Labour's influence in this so-called partnership Government.  There is very little in this Bill to comfort the Labour Party, not even the rank and file who sold out their Leader on the RTE &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme.  As a surrender document this is virtually unconditional.  This Bill is all white feather and no red rose.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not resolve the controversy over the appointment of a new High Court President.  It does not take politics out of judicial appointments and does very little to reform the courts. This proposed appointment of the Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan SC, as President of the High Court, is the proximate reason this Bill is before us today.  I appreciate that this House does not normally discuss individual appointments but it would be meaningless to debate this Bill without reference to the issues already in the public domain which relate to Mr. Whelehan's performance as Attorney General and his prospective appointment as president of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The most remarkable feature of the Bill before us is that although it emerges from the row over the Presidency of the High Court, and ostensibly it is to provide for new procedures for judicial appointments.  It expressly excludes from its terms of reference the High Court Presidency.  Section 22 defines judicial offices which will be subject to the proposed judical Appointments Advisory Board but omits among others the Presidency of the High Court, the very office which caused the publication of the Bill in the first place.  That is an omission which this House might hope to correct and certainly I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to include the High Court Presidency and <Col N="1422" /> the other missing judicial offices in the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether the new procedures for judicial appointments are to apply to the office of President of the High Court is now a matter for decision by the Oireachtas, as is the date from which the new procedures will apply. This Bill is now before the Dáil.  The issue of judicial appointments is now under consideration by the Oireachtas, and, therefore, it is now no longer open to the Government to make an individual appointment, until the Oireachtas has decided how such appointments are to be made.</P>
    <P>The Government should not now proceed to appoint a new President of the High Court until this Bill has been enacted in whatever amended form is eventually decided by the Oireachtas. To do otherwise &mdash; that is, to proceed to appoint a new President of the High Court without awaiting the outcome of the Dáil and Seanad's consideration of this Bill &mdash; is to presume what the Oireachtas may eventually decide.  Even with a diminishing 30 seat majority, such a presumption on the part of the Government is possibly unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It would certainly undermine the role of Parliament if the Government were now to proceed with an appointment, but according to press reports the deal has already been done.  Mr. Whelehan is apparently to be appointed President of the High Court, and the Tánaiste apparently has some say as to when he can commence his duties.  Some press reports state that the formal decision is to be made today at a Cabinet meeting while we are debating a Bill which is designed to give the public the impression that something is changing.</P>
    <P>So far in this House there has been no clarity as to the appointment of the President of the High Court.  This morning the Taoiseach was most reluctant to indicate when an appointment would be made or if he would do the House the <Col N="1423" /> courtesy of awaiting the Dáil's consideration of the Bill before us before proceeding with an appointment.  We cannot proceed to debate the Bill until this matter is cleared up.  Surely it is a mockery that, while the Dáil is debating a Bill to change the method of judicial appointments, the Government is meeting in private to formally make the most controversial judicial appointment in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to assure the House that no decision will be made on the appointment to the presidency of the High Court until the Oireachtas has disposed of this Bill.  Unless the Minister can give that assurance before the completion of Second Stage, my party will oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  I will propose that the House declines to give a Second Reading to this Bill because of the failure of the Government to assure the House that no further judicial appointments will be made pending consideration by the Oireachtas of this Bill.  We cannot be party to a pretence that something is changing when all that is happening is that the Taoiseach is getting his way and the Tánaiste is getting this face-saver.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a legislative device to stitch the Government back together. All the king's horses and the four wise men have put Humpty Dumpty together again, or at least have managed to reassemble the shell.  It is not so easy, however, to pour back in the core issue once it has been released into the public domain.</P>
    <P>The people know there was serious disagreement between the parties in Government over who should occupy one of the most senior judicial posts in the country &mdash; a position of enormous power, possibly more powerful than a Government Ministry.  The President of the High Court, for example, decides which High Court hears individual cases and, as anybody who is reasonably familiar with the courts knows, marginal cases often turn on the choice of a judge.</P>
    <P>We know the broad outline of the <Col N="1424" /> nature of the Government's disagreement. Its essence has not been denied or disputed by either Government party.  Fianna Fáil takes the view that the Attorney General has an automatic right to first refusal on judical appointments, even though there is no constitutional or legislative basis for such an assumption, and the precedent on which it is claimed is wobbly, to say the least. If appears the Taoiseach promised him the job and, unlike promises made to the electorate or job security promised to TEAM workers, a promise made to the &ldquo;exclusive jobs club&rdquo; is of a much stronger currency.</P>
    <P>On the other land, the Tánaiste has clearly questioned the Attorney General's suitability for this important appointment.  The collective relief in political circles at the avoidance of a general election has helped to defuse the very important issues which caused such fundamental disagreement between the Government parties.  It is too simplistic and somewhat unfair to the Labour Party to assume that its concerns over this appointment were motivated by purely party political considerations.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Whelehan's appointment to the presidency of the High Court was so unacceptable to the Labour Party that it boycotted a Cabinet meeting, that the row was leaked to the press and that the Tánaiste was apparently prepared to countenance a general election on the issue, then we need to know why he was so unacceptable.  The Labour Party owes the House and the public an explanation for its unease about this promised appointment.  It owes us an explanation also as to why, if it was so unacceptable in September, the appointment is acceptable in November.</P>
    <P>This House has a difficulty in discussing matters relating to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General does not report to the House and we have no satisfactory means of questioning his decisions and actions.  Until Mr. Whelehan's appointment, there did not seem to be a great demand for Oireachtas <Col N="1425" /> scrutiny of the Attorney General's work and role.  Previous Attorneys General managed to keep a relatively low profile and little was publicly heard or understood about their work.  Mr. Whelehan has certainly managed to bring the Office of the Attorney General to the centre of the political stage.  His decision to deny the parents of a 14 year old girl the right to take their child out of the country in the famous &ldquo;X&rdquo; case caused a constitutional crisis which resulted in three constitutional referenda, the need for new legislation and calls for further constitutional change. In his handling of the beef tribunal, he behaved more like the private lawyer of Fianna Fáil Ministers than the protector of the public interest.  His recent refusal to defend the integrity of High Court Judge Mella Carroll raised eyebrows. No doubt these were among the matters which caused the Tánaiste to question his suitabily for the post of President of the High Court.  Certainly they are concerns which I would share.</P>
    <P>The only previous occasion when the Office of the Attorney General was at the centre of public attention was in 1987 when the then Government introduced the Extradition (Amendment) Bill which gave the Attorney General additional and somewhat quasi-judicial powers.  It is somewhat ironic that the most recent controversy involving the Attorney General has centred on his tardiness in exercising those powers. This, his previous record and the Tánaiste's concerns about him have combined to raise a wider public concern about his imminent elevation to the High Court presidency.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how the same Attorney General, who could act within hours in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case and who was razor sharp during the beef tribunal on issues such as Cabinet confidentiality, could have failed to act for seven months on the extradition of a paedophile priest at a time when further extradition legislation was before the Oireachtas and when many sex abuse cases were under public consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has asked <Col N="1426" /> this House to accept that for seven months the extradition warrant for the convicted paedophile priest, Fr. Smyth, lay in the Attorney General's office, that the Attorney General himself was never informed of it and did not know about it and that somewhere down the line attempts of some undefined kind were being made to persuade Fr. Smyth to return voluntarily to the North. Meanwhile children in this jurisdiction were exposed to continuing risk from this repeated sex offender.  It is an explanation which I find neither credible nor acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's functions in relation to extradition cases are unusual and were the subject of special extradition legislation in 1987.  So unusual were the new functions of the Attorney General that the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, took the unusual step of himself introducting the legislation in the House on 27 November 1987.  I quote from column 2126, volume 375 of the Official Report of Mr. Haughey's Second Stage speech where he refers to the functions being given to the Attorney General:</P>
    <P>This important new procedural step will mean that the Attorney General will have to form an opinion himself as to these matters.  The Attorney General will be required to exercise his function and form his opinion about the existence of, and the foundation for, the intention to prosecute in each and every case.</P>
    <P>That leaves no doubt about the intention of the 1987 legislation.  Warrants for extradition are to be examined not by some functionary in the Attorney General's office but by the Attorney General himself and that the system of safeguards inherent in the 1987 legislation depended on the personal scrutiny of each and every case by the Attorney General.  Surely the present Attorney General was aware of the public debate which surrounded the 1987 Act and which concerned the role the Attorney General was expected to perform?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> In attempting to justify the seven months delay the Minister suggested that this was one of the first requests made under the 1987 procedures and that extra care was being taken.  If that is so, is it not all the more remarkable that the Attorney General was not informed of the case?  Are we seriously being asked to believe that six or seven years after the controversial 1987 Act, the operation of extradition procedures in the Attorney General's office had become so loose that the Attorney General himself was no longer being informed of extradition requests, especially in a case which the Minister claims was the first of its kind and was, therefore, possibly precedential?</P>
    <P>If we accept that the Attorney General was not told of the Fr. Smyth extradition request are we also to believe that for seven months the Attorney General did not ask his officials the kind of questions that might have prompted them to tell him?  Even in normal circumstances, it is hard to imagine that an Attorney General would not, over a period of seven months, ask his officials about what extradition requests were coming in, what they were about and what was being done about them. However, it is simply incredible that over this particular seven months, from late April 1993 onwards, the Attorney General would not have asked his officials about extradition cases which should have caused the Fr. Smyth case to have been brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>During that period the Attorney General was examining new amending extradition legislation for the Government. The House will recall that the Government had undertaken to amend the extradition Acts to address the socalled political offence loophole.  The introduction of the legislation was delayed because of legal and constitutional worries and these were examined by the Attorney General.  The legislation was subsequently introduced and passed by the Oireachtas over the seven months period while the Fr. <Col N="1428" /> Smyth case was with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>There are three possible explanations &mdash; first, the Attorney General knew of the Fr. Smyth case and was a participant in its delay; second, he did not know, had no system to monitor extradition requests and did not ask the kind of questions that would have brought it to his attention; third, it was concealed from him in which case he did not have control over his own office.  No matter which option one selects the Attorney General is responsible.  He did not exercise his statutory functions satisfactorily and this, taken with his record on other issues, does not recommend him for a senior judicial post.</P>
    <P>It is invidious that we should be here in a public forum discussing the suitability of an individual candidate for an important judicial post but the matter was brought into the public domain by the Government who failed to explain or resolve the issue and it is now a matter of unprecedented public discussion.</P>
    <P>The post itself is extremely important. Mr. Whelehan is a young man and, if appointed, will hold this and possibly even more senior judicial posts for most of the next quarter century.  Even the younger Members will be drawing the old age pension by the time Mr. Whelehan will be finished on the Irish Bench, interpreting our laws and Constitution and making critical legal decisions that will help shape the future of society into the early part of the next century.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the controversy are more important than one man's career and whether the Government lasts for two or five years.  Never before has a judicial appointment attracted so much public attention.  The public has an interest in and opinion on the outcome of this issue.  Public confidence in the courts and the Judiciary is at stake. The issue cannot be wished away by a political compromise and will not be resolved by the Bill before us.  The substantive issue now is: does the Attorney General become President of the High Court?  At a minimum, the Government must pull back from making a decision, <Col N="1429" /> allow the Oireachtas consider what procedures are appropriate and apply them to the appointment of President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Even before the row over the appointment of the Attorney General as President of the High Court there was considerable concern and a demand for reform of the manner in which judges are appointed.  The present system of appointment is essentially a form of political patronage.  Governments appoint to the Bench lawyers who are either members or supporters of their political party.  Apart from the issue of patronage, that method of appointment means the people appointed to the Bench are not necessarily the best available. I agree that by and large the State has been well served by those appointed to the Bench and it is a testament to their integrity that they have performed their functions with great independence. However, the system of appointment needs to be radically altered.  Apart from the suitability of those appointed there is the question that many lawyers who might make very fine judges are not considered because they do not kick with the right political foot.</P>
    <P>I suggested earlier this summer that the Council of State be given a role in this area and make a recommendation on the appointment of judges.  I also suggested it was a role which could be considered if the Government was extending the role of the Presidency of the State.  I appreciate those ideas might require constitutional change but because of the urgency of the issue I am keen that some legislative way be found to address it.</P>
    <P>The concept of a judicial appointments advisory board contained in the Bill is acceptable in principle provided three criteria are met &mdash; first, that it covers all judicial appointments without exception; second, that the Government is prepared to abide by it and, third, that it is structured in a democratic way and is empowered to make specific recommendations to the Government, not a panel of three or five prospective judges given to the Minister who, in the time <Col N="1430" /> honoured tradition, may pick from it the person who is closest to the political party in power at the time.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not fulfil those criteria. It omits from the terms of the judicial appointments board the most senior, and arguably the most powerful, appointments, the Chief Justice and Presidencies of the High Court, District Court and Circuit Court.  The second question is whether the Government is committed to accept the recommendations made.  That area was commented on by practitioners in the legal field. The gazette of the Incorporated Law Society in its current edition makes the point:</P>
    <P>We would suggest that inherent in any new arrangement would be the principle that the Government and all successive Governments would undertake to abide by the recommendations of the Commission and appoint judges on that basis.</P>
    <P>The third criterion relates to the composition of the Judicial Appointments Board.  The Minister said she was open to suggestions on this issue, that she had no fixed views on its composition.  I am very glad to hear this as the Bill proposes the establishment of a Judicial Appointments Board composed of members of an elite club, senior people in the legal profession.  This would give rise to a very elitist board and needs to be changed.  We need to widen its scope to include people other than lawyers. For example, there should be some way of involving members of the Garda Síochána, the Probation and Welfare Service and bodies representing consumer interests.  Consideration must be given to the inclusion of these people on the Judicial Appointments Board, and I will put down amendments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed retirement age of judges.  This has given rise to a concern that at the end of the day judges will be appointed by the Government from a panel, that their continuation in office, at least in some of the courts, on a year to year basis will also <Col N="1431" /> be determined by the Government and that factors such as political allegiance and the handling by a judge of a case in which the State or individual Ministers may be involved will influence appointments. I have a difficulty with the concept of a retirement age.  The concept of telling people that their working life is finished when they reach 60 or 65 years is fundamentally wrong and discriminates against elderly people in our society.  As a general rule, and not merely in relation to the appointment of judges, this issue will have to be looked at again in the context of employment legislation.  Some people may be past it, so to speak, at 65 years or younger but many people of that age are very capable and have a major contribution to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The way to draw a distinction is to appoint judges for a fixed term.  The problem with judicial appointments is not the age at which judges retire, but rather the length of time they sit on the Bench.  The principle of seven year terms which is now acceptable for senior appointments in the public service needs to be looked at as it would have the additional advantage of providing for a turnover of judges, allow younger people to sit on the Bench and given that the question of gender balance has been introduced into the debate, might also allow a greater proportion of women to sit on the Bench.  There is nothing necessarily wrong with a person being a judge for seven years and then returning to legal <Col N="1432" /> practice.  On Committee Stage I will propose that instead of dealing with the question of retirement we should deal with the introduction of fixed term contracts for judicial appointments.</P>
      <P>Reform of the courts is long overdue but, unfortunately, the Bill will not introduce the necessary reforms.  I welcome the proposed establishment of a Court of Appeal and the announcement by the Minister of an increase in the number of judges.  I disagree fundamentally with the points made by Deputy Gay Mitchell on this issue, although I agree that the productivity of judges might well bear a certain amount of examination.  Given the volume of litigation and the expanding role of the courts, there is a case for increasing the number of judges.  However, given the amount of work with which courts have to deal and the inordinate delays at every level of the courts system, a total of 100 judges is not excessive.  I welcome the appointment of additional judges.</P>
      <P>The proposed Courts Commission &mdash; promised in the Programme for Government &mdash; is inadequate to deal with the urgent reform of the courts. We do not need a commission to establish what is wrong in the courts system as this is obvious already and should have been dealt with in the Bill.  The proposed formula for the appointment of a Courts Commission betrays the speed with which, for political reasons, this Bill was put together and brought before the House.  If the legislation had been allowed to develop to full term it might well have contained specific proposals in regard to court reform.  Given that the Minister referred to a type of rolling over commission to which new members will be appointed etc., the establishment of a commission is a recipe for delay.</P>
      <P>This delay was anticipated in the submission by the Incorporated Law Society and Bar Council last September. In dealing with the appointment of a Judical Commission, they said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would have serious reservations that the establishment of such <Col N="1433" /> a commission &mdash; if it is to be confined solely to members of the judiciary &mdash; is the proper way to proceed.</P>
    <P>They also stated:</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, question at this stage the need for a Judicial Commission or, indeed, any Commission to outline what needs to be done.  It is difficult not to have doubts that this proposal amounts to yet another stalling tactic and an &ldquo;escape hatch&rdquo; for inactivity.</P>
    <P>They were in no doubt that there was no need for a commission to establish what needed to be done in the courts. The joint submission by the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council contains a very good agenda which she might address and highlights the problems in our courts system.  For example, it highlights the delays of up to two years in the High Court and up to three years in the Circuit Court, the extent to which those delays are prolonged by the addition of family law cases and the need to deal with such cases quickly.</P>
    <P>They also quote from the report of the Review Body of Civil Jurisdiction in England published in 1988. I will not read the full report but basically it states that delay undermines justice and outlines how it results in a reduction in the availability of evidence, erodes the reliability of evidence, tends to legitimise inefficiency in the office of lawyers and the courts, undermines public confidence in the capacity of the courts to dispense justice and causes continuing personal stress and anxiety.  I recently came across a criminal case involving a murder charge where the family of the victim was extremely distressed that a full two years after the crime those charged were still on bail and had not been brought to trial because of delays in the courts.  This is not acceptable and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to courthouse accommodation.  The condition of many courthouses is a scandal.  It is extremely <Col N="1434" /> difficult for judges and officers to work in them, while legal practitioners have to consult their clients in the most unsuitable conditions.  Clearly, it is a scandal from the point of view of people who appear in the courts on a charge, as witnesses or simply to deal with a civil matter and should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It does require capital expenditure but the need for people to obtain justice, to feel they are getting justice and to have an opportunity to discuss matters with their lawyers is so important that the condition of our courthouses needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The submission from the Law Society and the Bar Council also dealt at some length with the need to rationalise court venues, to provide special venues for family cases and to apply the new information technology is now widely available. They go on to describe the very primitive conditions in some courts, where even word processing is not in operation.  They point out that senior judges have to operate without secretarial assistance.  All these areas need to be addressed to make the courts more efficient.</P>
    <P>Efficiency is only one aspect of the problem.  There is also the question of access to the courts.  I am pleased that the Minister made provision in the Bill for the abolition of barristers' wigs although I suspect that what puts most people off going to court is not the sight of the barrister's wig but the size of the bill.  I realise some provisions in the Bill attempt to address the whole area of the prohibitive cost of court cases.  The people who do not have to worry about the cost of court cases are those who are so well off that it will not bother them or people who are so poor that they qualify for free legal aid.  Very often those who qualify for free legal aid are charged with offences.  For the ordinary taxpayer in difficulty who wants to prosecute a particular case the cost of going to court is prohibitive.  For many civil actions it literally means that somebody has to put their house at risk to go to court.  Even for simple matters, such as <Col N="1435" /> judicial separations, costs range between £3,000 and £5,000, a prohibitive cost for many people.  The law is for those who can afford it, or who get it for nothing and that will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>Access to our courts, the right to legal aid, the way in which charges are made and the cost of the legal process will have to be brought within the means of the average citizen.  Until that is done, the operation of the law will be based on wealth, class, discrimination and inequality.  That is fundamentally wrong and undermines fairness and public confidence in our legal system.  I had hoped this Bill would have gone further in the area of addressing legal costs but on Committee and remaining Stages we may have an opportunity to deal with that issue in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the large increase in litigation in recent years the courts have come under increasing pressure. Long delays have built up with parties having to wait a number of years before their case can be dealt with.  In the High Court the delay can be over three years while in the Dublin Circuit Court a case set down for trial today will not get a hearing until 1996.  The appeal system is similarly afflicted with long delays.  The Supreme Court must give priority to urgent constitutional matters while a longer and longer list of new and strightforward appeals builds up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its attempt to grapple with the increase in litigation and to relieve the congestion of court waiting lists I strongly support parts of this Bill.  The additional judges are badly needed and the Court of Appeal will relieve the Supreme Court of much of its more routine appellate work.  It has long been recognised that the absence of a Court of Appeal to deal with appeals in civil cases from the High Court has been a major contributory factor to the long delays which attach to hearings in the Supreme Court.  It must also be said that the Bill seeks to remove a number of anomalies in previous legislation.  For <Col N="1436" /> example, if a plaintiff, seeking judgment in default of a defence for a debt, wished to claim interest he had to bring his application in the High Court itself rather than before the Master of the High Court &mdash; an unintended and ludicrous effect of section 22 of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>A number of more contentious issues will be dealt with in this Bill, the proposals in respect of which, unfortunately, appear to reflect the haste with which it was published.  One would also be forgiven for suspecting that many of the specific proposals reflect the political necessity of producing any proposals and promote any change rather than reflecting the type of wide-ranging and informed debate which should precede fundamental changes of the type proposed. I am not referring to the Minister in this matter as she has shown herself to be in favour of reform.  I know she has been working for many months on a courts Bill and it is unfortunate that the circumstances meant that it had to be introduced in a hurry.  I congratulate the Minister on the parts of the Bill I imagine are her own.</P>
    <P>The separation of powers is fundamental to the Constitution under which there is a Legislature, an Executive and a Judiciary.  The Legislature is elected by the people and is answerable to them.  The Executive is elected by the Legislature and can be turned out of office by Dáil Éireann.  The ultimate vindication of the rights acknowledged or created by the Constitution falls to a Judiciary whose independence is fundamental to the whole operation of our rule or constitutional law as provided in Article 35.2 of the Constitution which states that all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.</P>
    <P>Judges, under the Constitution, are appointed by the President but as observed by the then President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay subsequently Chief Justice, in the State <i>v.</i> Murphy, the appointment of a judge is <Col N="1437" /> an act &ldquo;requiring the President's intervention for its effectiveness and law&rdquo; but, in fact, it is the decision and act of the Executive.  At first glance it might appear unsatisfactory that the appointment of the independent guardians of our rights under the Constitution should be left to an Executive, given that on many occasions it is the Executive itself which has to be restrained by those very same judges from breaching the provisions of the Constitution.  In reality, the appointment of judges has to be left either to the Executive or to the Legislature. The Executive is ultimately answerable to the Legislature.  When one considers the spectacle which attends the appointment of judges in the US where the Executive nominations have to be ratified by the Legislature, one can readily appreciate why the framers of our Constitution, in their wisdom, left the matter solely to the Executive. Furthermore, this system has worked well, there has never been a judicial scandal or an allegation of one, let alone an example of judicial corruption. This is a remarkable achievement in the light of experience in other countries and the best justification of the system provided for under the Constitution. Party political affiliations have not played the role, which they so frequently are alleged to have played, in the appointment of judges.  The people are very politically aware and politically active.</P>
    <P>As is common in most jurisdictions, the practice of law has traditionally resulted in both barristers and solicitors having political views and not being shy about expressing them.  It is inevitable that many of those appointed to the Bench will have had open political affiliations and there is nothing wrong with this.  It is also inevitable that the lawyers with an interest in politics will be more likely to be known to members of the Executive than their colleagues without such an interest.  However, down through the years, lawyers without political affiliations have been appointed to the Bench.  There are also numerous <Col N="1438" /> examples of lawyers of one political persuasion being appointed to judicial office by an Executive of the opposite political persuasion.</P>
    <P>There has been a protracted campaign in recent years to denigrate the present system, the suitability of the Executive appointing judges and the calibre and personalities of those appointed.  Many of those &mdash; the politically correct in our society &mdash; engaged in this campaign do not confine their cynicism or begrudgery to this issue alone.  Can it not be argued that proposals for such radical change to a system which has operated successfully since the foundation of the State should be the subject of wide-ranging debate and the most detailed and democratic consultation?  Changes of this type should not be open to the suggestion that they result from backroom negotiations necessitated by a political squabble between political parties.</P>
    <P>No Member of this House wanted a general election and neither did the people.  The Constitution and the Judiciary who uphold it are far too fundamental to the well-being of all our lives to be left open to use as political pawns.  Our Constitution belongs to the people.  When were the people told that in voting for one party or another they were voting for changes of the type now proposed?  At the very least many of the proposed changes should not be implemented without there having been a sufficient period for the views of interested members of the public and interested groups to be developed and heard.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a judical appointments advisory board be established, the members of which would vary depending on the judicial appointments being considered.  The board would be charged with identifying and informing the Government of the names of persons the board considers suitable for appointment to ordinary judgeships in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  While in theory the Government or the Minister <Col N="1439" /> might not accept any of the names submitted by the judicial appointments advisory board, in practice it is difficult to see how or why the Government could reject the advice of the board. During the beef tribunal Ministers and former Ministers spent months defending themselves against no less a charge than that they did not accept the advice of the most junior of civil servants. Some of those who made the charges are now in Government.</P>
    <P>The reality of the proposals is that the Government will be unable to reject the advice of the board and will be confined to the names submitted by the board. As there is not even a requirement that submissions by the board to the Minister are to be confidential, it does not require great imagination to envisage the political fall-out if a Government decided to appoint a person to a judicial office other than one of those nominated by the board.  Even if such a confidentiality requirement existed, would it be observed?</P>
    <P>The proposal raises a fundamental constitutional issue, the resolution of which ironically would ultimately fall on the courts themselves.  It is not self-contradictory that the constitutionality of a proposal conferring <i>de facto</i> Executive powers on members of the Judiciary should fall to be decided by members of the Judiciary?  Apart from the legal issues involved, the question of political abdication of responsibility by the Executive is also inherent in the proposal.</P>
    <P>If the Government submits to the Oireachtas a proposal, the effective implication of which is that the Government cannot be trusted with the appointment of members of the Judiciary, on what basis can it be argued that the Government should retain the right to appoint, for example, members of the Revenue Commissioners, chairpersons of State boards and so on?  At least those appointed to the Judiciary must be legally qualified and have practised for the length of time specified in law.  The Government is not at large <Col N="1440" /> when dealing with such appointments.  If it cannot be trusted with the power to make judicial appointments in such circumstances, on what basis is it fit to appoint, for example, the chairperson of Aer Lingus, an operation with large diverse commercial and technical aspects?</P>
    <P>If the proposal in section 27 (4) is passed into law, who is likely to seek judicial appointments in the future?  To be eligible for consideration it is provided that a person must have completed a course in education or training. Who will decide on admission to such a course?  How many will be admitted? Will participation be confidential or how will it be kept confidential?  One can readily imagine the type of media interest that would immediately focus on a person participating in such a course.  One can also readily imagine the difficulties for people participating in such a course without a guarantee of appointment.  I fail to understand why a person must attend the course before nomination to a judicial appointment as opposed to afterwards.  Will the Minister consider that matter before Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>For many years one constant complaint about the management of legal education and admission to the practice of law was that the profession of barristers was governed by a self-perpetuating body, the benchers of the King's Inns, vacancies in whose august body were filled by the surviving members of the club.  It is now proposed to insert an element of self-perpetuation into the entire Judiciary and, moreover, it is specifically provided that those on the board shall have regard to the probity, character and temperament of would-be nominees to judicial office.  Are barristers and solicitors who tend to stand up to the Judiciary when in practice to be excluded from judicial office?  It would not be surprising if such a temperament did not win favour with the existing Bench and future advisers in regard to who should be appointed.  When one considers that a member of the Bench has from time to time expressed such <Col N="1441" /> esoteric views on character and temperament by saying that a young woman who would drink Guinness in a public bar is defamatory, one wonders what precise character and temperament criteria will be applied by the proposed body.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other anomalies and oddities in the proposed measure with which I do not have time to deal. At a time when the number of quangos is a matter of concern, this board is being established and will have such staff as it may reasonably require.  Do the taxpayers need another board and another new wages bill to implement a change in a system which has served this country honourably and well since the foundation of this State?</P>
    <P>On the appointment of solicitors as Circuit Court judges, it has long been a matter of contention as to whether appointments to judicial posts in the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court should be confined, as heretofore, to members of the Bar or whether such appointments should be open to solicitors.  The proposal that solicitors will be eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court but not to the High or Supreme Courts, is obviously intended as a compromise.  In its present form it is an unsatisfactory proposal for a number of reasons.  For more than 20 years solicitors have had a right of audience in all courts established under the Constitution and have had a right of access to our Superior Courts long before their colleagues in England acquired such a right.  With few exceptions solicitors have not exercised that right in the High or Supreme Courts.  In Dublin the right of audience of solicitors in the Circuit Court is rarely used except in non-contentious matters.  Outside Dublin solicitors have traditionally played a much greater role in the Circuit Court although mostly in the context of appeals from the District Court.</P>
    <P>There is no reason solicitors should not be eligible for appointment to judicial office in every court provided they have practised as advocates in the court to which they seek appointment <Col N="1442" /> for the same length of time barristers are required to practise before they become eligible.  If, for example, the President of the High Court is willing to certify that a solicitor has practised in the High Court for whatever period is required by law, that solicitor should be eligible for appointment to the High Court Bench.  A similar rule should apply to barristers.  As matters stand, a barrister in practice for whatever length of time is required is eligible for judicial appointments to courts in which he may never have appeared.</P>
    <P>Not all barristers practise as advocates or earn their living in the courts. It would appear entirely sensible and appropriate that, before one could become eligible for appointment to the bench of any particular court, one should have had to practise before that court and gained practical, everyday experience of how that court operates and is conducted.  Once they have practised in the courts as advocates, one can see no reason solicitors should not be eligible for appointment as judges to any court in this land and the same should apply to barristers.  I would ask the Minister to examine that point before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Courts Commission is proposed under section 29 in addition to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Is this Courts Commission to be another quango?  Section 29 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The Courts Commission shall have the function of advising the Government and the Minister for Justice on the organisation and management of the courts and court service and on such matters as in the opinion of the Minister or the Commission have a bearing on the capacity of the courts to discharge their functions.</P>
    <P>Why on earth do we need another quango when we have already very effective, efficient sections within the Department of Justice dealing with courts administration and the separate <Col N="1443" /> offices of various courts?  If the Government wants advice it can obtain it from civil servants, court officers or judges.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of advice on the running of the courts but I know from painful experience, having been Minister for Justice, that we are short of resources.  Who is to serve on this Courts Commission?  In her introductory remarks the Minister mentioned a wide range of people.  Whomsoever the Minister is advised to appoint, presumably by her civil servants, what type of commission will emerge?  Who is to staff that commission?  Unlike the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, no staff is expressly provided for although the expenses of this commission are to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Presumably any such staff will be drawn either from the Department of Justice or the various court offices.  I do not foresee this Courts Commission presenting any advice on the running of the courts that is not already available.  The imposition of another layer of bureaucracy is much more likely to interfere with the running of the courts than to improve them.  The likely outcome is a further waste of public moneys.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Bill is to tackle the problem of delays.  I congratulate the Minister on these provisions which represent very much her own input.  The new Court of Appeal is to be warmly welcomed.  Nonetheless this Judicial Appointments Advisory Board whose function it will be to decide who will serve on the Bench in the future needs radical re-examination.  I hope we can engage in such re-examination on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome in principle the general thrust of this Bill on the basis that some changes are undoubtedly necessary.  I am not saying that changes should be effected merely for the sake of change.  The Bill contains some constructive changes very similar to the proposals put forward by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, a couple <Col N="1444" /> of weeks ago when he introduced his Bill.  The Minister is to be complimented on having incorporated many of the provisions of Deputy Mitchell's Bill in this one, illustrating the manner in which Government takes account of what the Opposition is doing despite the fact that, on most occasions, they would reject such proposals.</P>
      <P>Anything I have to say should not be taken as directed personally at any Member on the opposite side of the House, but there is a certain doubt in people's minds as to the timing of this Bill's introduction.  It is introduced at a time when it is convenient for the Government to talk seriously about the proposed Court of Appeal, which is progressive and useful, and its timing is absolutely perfect.  When did it arise?  It arose at a time when the two Government parties were in serious difficulty in relation to a particular appointment. The four wise men who met in committee to advise the Taoiseach and Tánaiste obviously thought this proposal was a good idea.  Let us examine the proposal for what it is.  The introduction of this Bill, notwithstanding its inherent merit, happens to coincide with an urgent, immediate need within the Government parties to ensure that they do not fall out of the political bed in open hostility because of failure to reach agreement on the particular judicial appointment.</P>
      <P>While I do not believe one should change everything merely for the sake of change, I do believe in accountability, in the first instance, to this House.  I welcome the appointment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and note the points made by several other speakers.  On the one hand I agree with its establishment but on the other I would have to question how accountable it will be and to whom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume it will be accountable to Government.  Will it operate in the same manner as many other advisory boards?  For example, will a list of suitable candidates for appointment to the Bench be submitted to Government? How will the Government decide to <Col N="1445" /> appoint persons from that list?  How large will that list be?  Will it contain the names of say, ten, 15 or 20 candidates as in the case of many other appointments by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission, and will they remain until that list has been exhausted?  Will the names of two or three possible candidates be submitted to Government and discretion remain with the Minister or Government of the day to appoint one? That is the oldest trick in the book.  The Department of Health engages in that practice all the time.  While not reflecting on a particular Minister, it is a tradition that, in the appointment of boards, be they hospital boards or anything else, the Minister requests the names of two, three or four suitable candidates for appointment, when he or she will appoint one or perhaps two.  It amounts to tossing the penny &mdash; heads, I win; tails, you lose.  Because the Government always has the upper hand, it always wins.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what will happen in the case of this Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  How accountable will that board be?  Will it be like a number of other boards in that, whenever we ask a question about it, we will be told that the Minister is not responsible to the House in relation to it?  That is a reply frequently trotted out.  It is a worrying feature.  While the old system may not have been great, at least we could ask questions in this House of the people responsible.  While we might not receive answers certainly we could pursue the relevant issues.  I have fundamental worries about the manner in which this Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will operate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would take note of the points I have made already.  The most fundamental issue is whether we, as Opposition Members, can ask a member of the Government a question in relation to an appointment suggested or recommended by the board.  The Government will make appointments on the basis of a submission received <Col N="1446" /> from this new board.  Can we ask questions about the activities of the board? Can we ask about the recommendations of the board?  I doubt that we will be allowed ask such questions.  I have serious worries about that.  In the absence of the facility to raise those issues and receive answers I would have to contend that change for the sake of change will be of no benefit whatsoever to this House.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I refer is the row that has erupted in Government which has necessitated the introduction of this Bill at this time.  We are always anxious to resolve whatever difficulties Government parties might encounter. One should always try to assist in whatever way one can and should never endeavour to bring about circumstances in which a general election would take place or anything like that.</P>

      <P>Since 19 October 1993, when I replied to a similar question, the Tánaiste and I were out of the country simultaneously on Government business on 12 occasions.</P>
      <P>These included three meetings in London with the British Prime Minister, three European Council meetings in Brussels and one in Corfu.</P>
      <P>Throughout these periods, both the Tánaiste and I remained in charge of, and in direct contact with, our Departments at all times.  In accordance with long standing practice, it was not necessary to assign our duties and functions during our absence to other members of the Government.</P>
      <P>As I stated when I took office, and reiterated in this House only last week, I intend, along with the Tánaiste and other Ministers, to promote increased trade, expand inward tourism and encourage international investment in Ireland by actively seeking out and addressing potential investors, on a personal basis where necessary.  The year 1994 will be one of our most successful years for tourism, exports and inward investment, bringing with it 30,000 more people at work in the 12 months up to April 1994.  There are now more people at work than at any time in the past 40 years.  Getting foreign businesses to set up here cannot be achieved by a small peripheral nation like ours by simply sitting at home and waiting for the world to knock on our door.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of aircraft as ministerial transport is subject to my authorisation, taking into account several factors such as the necessity to undertake the engagement and the amount of notice received, the demands of the particular schedule, the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements, overall cost considerations, the numbers in the delegation, security considerations etc.  The service is provided for the President, members of the Government, Ministers of State and authorised officials of the public service.  In addition, husbands and wives may use the service if they are accompanying their spouses in a representative capacity on Government business.  The use of the Government jet has been as follows.  In 1993 there were 193 missions and to date in 1994 there have been 114 missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the Government jet from Zurich on 13 October 1994 was approved by me in advance.  The particular circumstances in this case were fully outlined by the Minister for Defence in reply to the Adjournment debate on 27 October 1994.  Deputy Joan Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, and her <Col N="1450" /> husband travelled, at the request of the Government, with the President and Mr. Robinson on the State visit to Tanzania. It is customary for spouses to accompany Ministers on State visits, if possible.  The dates of the President's state visit were from 6 October 1994 to 13 October 1994.</P>
    <P>The return date as scheduled was 13 October 1994 and originally the whole party was to return from Dar-es-Salaam on that date.  The arrangements for the President changed and she went to Rwanda &mdash; a visit which was unconfirmed until a very late date.  The rest of the party of nine returned to Europe as arranged.  The ministerial air transport service was used to bring the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the other members of the presidential party home from Zurich on the evening of 13 October as previously arranged.</P>
    <P>I might add that the jet was provided to facilitate the presidential delegation, many of whom had spent more than three weeks in Africa accompanying the President on what were both State visits and lengthy and comprehensive visits to Irish development aid projects throughout Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the use of the aircraft on that occasion was entirely appropriate and in accordance with long standing practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Would it not have been appropriate on that occasion, since the President had decided to continue to Rwanda, for the remainder of the presidential group to return to Dublin by scheduled flights?  Surely the cancellation by the President of her return flight to Ireland was not such a last minute event that it could not have been arranged to leave the Government jet in Ireland.  Presumably the jet flew empty to Zurich and returned with passengers on board.  Will the Taoiseach indicate not only the cost of the fuel but the allin cost of that trip?</P>

      <P>The latter part of the Deputy's question should be directed to the Minister for Defence.

That decision was made when all circumstances were taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have such information available on the file.  That is a separate operational question which the Deputy should put down to the Minister for Defence.  The purpose of these questions seems to be to create the impression that too many Government missions took place in 1993-94. For comparison purposes I will tell Members what happened in 1990-92.  In 1992, 195 missions were flown; 281 were flown in 1991 and 341 were flown in 1993 1990.  The 193 missions flown in 1993 and 114 flown to date in 1994 compare very favourably.  Rather than supporting the case the Opposition is trying to prove because of the forthcoming Cork by-election, the figures for previous years discount its argument.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is simply setting up aunt sallies to knock them down.  The purpose of my question is to elicit whether a cost effective use is made of the jet in terms of whether a Minister of State and spouse returning to Ireland should be enabled to summon the jet to Zurich to return at their convenience.  It seems the cost to the taxpayer of that journey is not set out in the Taoiseach's brief.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Bruton, did not summon the Government jet to Zurich as misrepresented by Deputy De Rossa.  It is incorrect to create the impression that the Government is overusing the jet, I gave the figures for missions flown in the years 1991 to 1994.

I have been criticised for travelling abroad for a fortnight, but I notice that the former leader, Deputy FitzGerald, when Leader of Fine Gael, travelled abroad for a fortnight mainly in a private capacity to attend the Bilderberg conference, then travelled to see Cardinal O'Connor in New York and later visited Governor Dukakis.

    <P>The use of aircraft as ministerial transport is subject to my authorisation taking into account several factors, such as the necessity to undertake the engagement, the amount of notice received, the demands of the particular schedule, the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements, overall <Col N="1454" /> cost considerations, the numbers in the delegation and security considerations etc.  That service is provided for the President, members of the Government, Ministers of State and authorised officials of the public service.

The Taoiseach must know the cost to the State of the return trip to Zurich. Will he indicate if it is in the region of £30,000 as estimated by some in the media?

      <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, Ministers are informed on taking office of the general principle that they should not engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatable with the duties of their offices.  Ministers are required to draw the attention of the Government to any matter before Government in which they or their family have a material interest and not to participate in decision-making in the matter unless the Government decides otherwise. These guidelines have been applied by successive administrations over a long number of years and continue to apply.</P>
      <P>The Government is satisfied that between these existing guidelines and the proposals contained in the Ethics in Public Office Bill, which is currently before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the provisions to prevent conflicts of interests are more than adequate.</P>

Will he indicate whether he intends to respond to the allegations contained in a book about to be published which indicates that he was in breach of Government ethical standards when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1982?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed publicly regarding the accuracy of the 1993 trade statistics and economic growth, particularly the export figures.  Specific questions have been raised in regard to the accuracy of the new INTRASTAT survey system, which was introduced following the abolition of intra-EU customs controls, and on the possible effects of transfer pricing on the valuation of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to these concerns, the Government established an interdepartmental group at the end of July to examine the issues raised including the effect of transfer pricing.  The report of <Col N="1466" /> this group is expected shortly.  In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for collecting the data, and the Central Statistics Office have been checking the returns of the most important traders. To date no evidence has been found which would justify significant revisions being made to the overall published figures.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to national income statistics, I am satisfied that the figures for economic growth published by the Central Statistics Office are accurate.  These statistics are compiled in strict conformity with international methodology and standards and are the best available estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothwithstanding his comment that there is no significant disparity, is the Minister of State aware that several leading economists, including the senior economist at the Ulster Bank, have said publicly there is a glaring disparity between the official economic statistics and economic performance and that talk about imports and exports has serious consequences in assessing our economic performance and making accurate predictions as to future growth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what was said but, from the information available to me, I am also aware that some of the information on which the criticisms were based was incorrect.  I note that when this was pointed out to them some of the commentators did not correct their various statements.  Some commentators attempted to estimate annual price trends on the basis of monthly data up to October 1993 and in doing so failed to take account of the differing price trends in 1992 and 1993; towards the end of 1992 prices were falling but rising towards the end of 1993.  I have examined the criticisms expressed by the commentators and I am satisfied that very few can be substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State finds it necessary <Col N="1467" /> to defend all the statistics to defend the Government's claims of massive growth but he must be aware there are significant discrepancies in the trade figures and in those for domestic spending, manufacturing output, bank lending, economic growth and GNP.  This gives cause for concern given that future European Union funding will be dependent on a growth rate of less than 75 per cent of the EU average.  Is the Minister of State taking these concerns seriously and does he intend to implement whatever recommendations are made by the working group he established to ensure that our figures reflect the real world and not some statistical wonderland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is trying to imply that the Central Statistics Office is gathering information to suit the Government; during the debate on the Statistics Bill all Members of the House made it clear they were happy that the Central Statistics Office was independent.  The points raised were serious and I treated them as such.  I sought information from the Central Statistics Office about the views of commentators.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned some of them.  If he wishes I can attempt to give an explanation of where the commentators went wrong.  I mentioned the figures for export growth.  In that case they got it wrong by using the monthly rather than the annual figures, not taking into account the differing price trends at the end of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criticism is the inconsistency with other economic statistics, most notably the industrial turnover index; the inconsistency between the increase in the exports of hi-tech products and the turnover of hi-tech industries; the impact of transfer pricing on exports artificially inflating the level of national income and the growth rate; the high export surplus resulting in a current account surplus in the balance of payments inconsistent with reserves; the unacceptably high increase in trade with non-EU countries in the year 1992-93.  I <Col N="1468" /> can refute each and every criticism but I do not want to be accused of wasting the time of the House.  Nevertheless, it is important to try to answer each one individually.</P>
    <P>On the question of inconsistencies with other economic statistics, notably the industrial turnover index, that point was raised initially on the industrial turnover and export figures.  Ideally data collected from different sources at different times should be consistent, but is rarely consistent because of information from different sources, different survey approaches and so on.  For example, in the industrial turnover and the merchandised exports statistics differences can arise for a number of reasons: specifically turnover as surveyed in the monthly industrial inquiry is defined as turnover of manufactured goods and goods purchased and resold without further processing are not included.  That would lead to some distortions. There may be some slight difference if companies based in Ireland import goods, perform services on them and then re-export them without taking ownership, when the turnover recorded in the monthly industrial turnover is the service fee charged to the owners of the goods.  If Irish companies take goods back for repairs and then return them, the turnover records note only the repair charges whereas the full value is recorded in the merchandised import and export statistics.  In addition, the industrial turnover index will incorporate rebates to companies which are not always reflected in export figures. Exports are also recorded at market prices whereas the turnover reported in the monthly production statistics is valued at factor costs.  Significant differences in timing can occur between the time produce is sold into intervention and sold some years later.  The above are some of the reasons the figures may not be consistent.</P>
    <P>If one considers the inconsistencies between the increase in exports and turnover of hi-tech products &mdash; and this was particularly criticised &mdash; in addition to all the other reasons I outlined to <Col N="1469" /> explain the differences between the two series at an aggregate level, comparisons at a sectoral level are less likely to produce comparable results because of differences between the industrial classifications used in the industrial turnover index and commodity classifications. For example, a computer manual may be produced in the computer or printing sector and recorded in the turnover of that sector but is exported with the computer and included in the export of computers. There was a criticism that transfer pricing on exports was artificially inflating the level of national income and growth rate.  Everybody would agree that there is an element of transfer pricing that is difficult to quantify, because it is an internal practice of multinational organisations and, by definition, a hidden activity.  It is almost impossible, therefore, to determine its extent.  However, on discussing this matter a number of factors suggest that it might not be as widespread now as previously.  The increase in export sales relief from zero to 10 per cent tax rate reduces the attraction of engaging in that practice. As well, most capital exporting countries have become more vigorous in policing it, the US being one example.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with some of these matters in detail but it would be fairer to respond to the Deputies more fully by letter.  There are explanations as to why various statistics are not consistent but they are reliable and whatever differences exist are small.  The statistics are checked and rechecked and the checks carried out by the CSO and the Revenue Commissioners have not indicated a huge need for their revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the interdepartmental group will report within the next few weeks.  I do not know whether its report will be published but I will certainly consider it.  To my knowledge the group has not visited other countries.  There are difficulties with the INTRASTAT system because there is a change from a system where everything was documented and all the documents were available to a survey system.  There are difficulties throughout the European Union with the new system.  Some countries have adapted to it extremely well but others have not.  The problems are caused in the main by slow responses to the questionnaires and in some cases the quality of the returns is not very high.  The problems are being ironed out.  The INTRASTAT system is under review in all countries in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in that I am not attempting to claim that the CSO is producing statistics to suit the Government but my point is that the Government, naturally enough, is reluctant to question the statistics because they paint such a rosy picture of the economy.  He has given some explanation for that, but will he circulate the information he has on the various questions raised?  Does it address the question of different levels of productivity as between the multinational sector and the indigenous sector where there are respectable increases in productivity in designated sectors but the productivity levels of the multinational sector have gone virtually into outer space, they have risen so high?  There is a suspicion that this is not related necessarily to what is being produced but to the practice of transfer pricing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make available as much information as possible on the various criticisms and responses to them.  I attempted to skim through it <Col N="1471" /> earlier but I have no information in relation to the specific question concerning different productivity levels and I am not sure if any such study has been undertaken.  In relation to transfer pricing, all the indicators seem to suggest that whatever level it was at &mdash; and it is not easy to quantify &mdash; it is less attractive for people to continue with the practice. The evidence is that the practice is in decline but I will endeavour to obtain the information the Deputy is seeking.</P>

      <P>The Department of Defence has no role in determining entitlement to the use of the ministerial air transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ministerial air transport service was first introduced in 1979 and has provided the following advantages over the years: (a) the service has proved to be extremely flexible where changes in departure times can be made to meet Ministers' changing timetables; (b) the availability of the aircraft for special tasks in times of crisis ensures independence of movement for Ministers and helps to guarantee national integrity.  Its value has been proved during EMS, fishery and CAP negotiations and emergencies when scheduled air services could not be availed of due to Minister's unsettled schedules; (c) security is enhanced; (d) the service is less likely to be affected by industrial disputes and can operate from military bases using military navigational aids. Casement Aerodrome, which I am pleased to say has been updated in terms of infrastructure, is available should industrial action close all or any of the three State airports and (e) the special Customs arrangements usually <Col N="1472" /> afforded to the aircraft at foreign airports permit the speedy clearance of passengers from the airport.</P>

      <P>I give the Minister ten out of ten for answering a question I did not even ask.  I take it from what the Minister has said and from the Taoiseach's earlier reply that the buck stops with the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In my responsibilities the buck stops with me but there is a shared stopping of the buck between myself and the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Air Corps transport, the Minister's Department is paying the piper although the Taoiseach appears to be calling the tune.  Is the Minister concerned that the use of the Government jet and the consumption of fuel, etc., might have a negative effect on routine training and other operational matters within the Air Corps?  That fear would appear to exist among certain members of the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking whether the use of the Government jet interferes with regular training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it interfere to an excessive degree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the reverse was the reality.  We are talking about a state of the art Government jet representing this country's international interests being flown by members of the Air Corps of the highest calibre who are doing a magnificent job on behalf of the country.  I would think that this would add to the quality of their knowledge of flying.  I cannot understand the source of the complaints. Speaking to the officers who fly the Government jet &mdash; I have not had the opportunity of flying in it in the recent past but it is a very pleasant experience and I consider it a privilege &mdash; they see it as a significant part of their professional life.  I would <Col N="1473" /> have thought it better to be in the air in the Government jet than on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise that the Air Corps operates on a limited fixed budget?  Will the Minister agree that the amount of the budget currently being used on Government travel is excessive and that it results in cutbacks in other sections of the Air Corps?  I recognise and fully agree with what the Minister said about the luxury of the Government jet.  I had an opportunity of seeing it but, unfortunately, was unable to travel in it.  I concur with the Minister's comments that it is most luxurious and I am sure is being put to good use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government jet is an essential part of the Air Corps fleet and to suggest that in some way its use results in cutbacks in other areas is wrong.  In the unlikely event of the Deputy's party being in power, would it abandon the use of the Government jet?  That is the final test.  I would like to think it would not because I see it as an essential part of the international image of the nation.  It is also an essential part of the professionalism of the Air Corps because the higher the quality of the technology available to the Air Corps, the greater the capacity of the individuals concerned to achieve a high standard.  The aerial wing of the Defence Forces is dealt with under a specific subhead which would not impinge on another subhead.  In no circumstances do the Government jet or our helicopters and fixed wing aircraft interfere with other areas of the Defence Forces budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The development of a national strategy for coastal zone management is under way and is being progressed jointly by the Departments of the Marine, the Environment and the Office of Public Works.  This will be a fully consultative process involving all relevant local authorities, agencies and concerned interests.  The initiative is also fully in line with commitments given in the context of overall EU policy objectives for the integrated management of coastal zones.</P>
      <P>The Departments concerned are currently commissioning an independent study in order to inform and assist the review process.  The study will evaluate relevant developments internationally and within the EU in particular.  It will also assess existing national strategies of relevance to managing the coastal resource and will identify key future issues.</P>
      <P>Integrated coastal zone management is an important but relatively new concept in terms of physical planning and environmental protection.  The need for such a strategy derives from the special environmental significance and vulnerability of our coastline.  Our strategic objective is to ensure the sustainable development of the coastal zone and to balance the multiple, often competing, demands on the resource from landbased and sea-based activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-operative initiative now under way is an important first step in formulating a comprehensive coastal zone management policy.  An interacting policy approach is essential if coastal zone management is to work.  This is <Col N="1475" /> especially so when one considers the multiplicity of Government Departments and agencies at national, regional and local level, involved in coastal resource utilisation and management. The first step is to acknowledge and define the multiplicity of roles and to develop, from there, an integrated framework of future strategic planning for the coastal resource.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought information on the Minister's proposals to ensure the Department of the Marine is not bypassed by the Department of the Environment in putting a coastal zone plan together.  What measures will the Department take to ensure it plays a key role in an integrated coastal zone management plan?  The Minister would have to concede that the Department of the Marine should play a greater role than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and appreciate his concerns. However, the question is premature. Final decisions have to be taken, as I stated in my substantive answer, based on consultancy reports or a report.  If the Deputy tables a question in six months time I will have more information for him.  The idea of coastal zone management is a good one.  It involves many agencies, for example, local authorities, Departments and so on.  There are many elements to be considered &mdash; recreation facilities, sewage treatment etc.  It is a complex problem and I am aware of the Deputy's concern.  I can give him more up to date information by way of correspondence, if requested.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, at present the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps and Naval Service, are being reviewed by the efficiency audit group.  As this exercise is not yet complete it would be premature of me to engage in discussion on the desirability or otherwise of specific issues which fall within the remit of the review.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, there has been considerable investment in new ships, aircraft and other equipment. There has been major growth in the capabilities of both the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  I assure the Deputy when any proposals for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces are being considered by the Government, the important and distinctive roles of the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be fully considered before any decisions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to announce an initiative I took in the recent past which will shortly be brought to fruition.  As the <Col N="1477" /> Deputy is aware, I have given blue uniforms to the Air Corps which will distinguish them from other divisions of the Defence Forces.  That is an important psychological break through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the efficiency audit group.  Do I take it he had a preliminary look at the report before the group at present and examined the Price Waterhouse proposals regarding the future of the Naval Service and the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be less than honest if I said I did not have a preliminary look at the Price Waterhouse report.  The report is with the efficiency audit group which comes within the purview of the Taoiseach's Department. The group has yet to report to the Taoiseach who will then seek the views of other Departments and bring a memorandum to the Cabinet.  In addition to that lengthy process RACO, PDFORRA and other groups will be consulted before any action is taken. The Price Waterhouse report is one document in a series of initiatives that may be taken.  It is a lengthy process but it is my intention to ensure the best for the Defence Forces, the Army, Navy and Air Corps.  They have a Minister who is very supportive of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure us that he will be the arbitrator in matters of policy regarding the future of the Defence Forces, that he alone and not the Taoiseach will decide whether Collins Barracks in Cork is closed down?  I note what the Minister said about the reports going to the Taoiseach's office but can he reassure us that defence policy and installations will be decided on by his Department without taking into account outside consideration, for example, from the Department of Finance or the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan an aquaculture development programme is being put in place to cover the period 1994-99.  It is envisaged that total investment under the programme will comprise up to 50 per cent EU funding and at least 5 per cent national aid with the balance provided through private investment.  The planned investment has the potential to generate more than 1,000 new permanent jobs in the aquaculture sector.  A significant number of jobs will also be created downstream in added value processing and marketing and in the supplies and services area.  Growth in output of the shellfish sector is the major objective of the programme.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for aquaculture is awaiting the approval of the EU Commission which is expected very shortly.  Pending that approval I am not in a position to give details of the grant aid available for the remainder of this and future years.  The amount of grant aid will also, critically, depend on the number of eligible projects submitted and approved in each year of the plan.</P>
      <P>The role of Exchequer funding is primarily to support and stimulate the pace of private investment as well as to maximise the drawdown of EU funding for the aquaculture sector.  An acceleration of development will bring forward job creation and help us to meet the considerable market opportunities which exist for Irish aquaculture production. Support will also be geared to meeting the policy objectives of better quality and improved environmental and management practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I can advise the Deputy that capital investment by the <Col N="1484" /> salmon farming industry in fallowing sites and other alternative sites and technologies will also be eligible for funding.  Any such proposals put forward by the industry for support will be duly and sympathetically considered under the programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the sea trout task force have been fully implemented and should be given an opportunity to take their course.  In fairness to them, salmon farm owners have responded to these recommendations in a very positive fashion.  Two years ago a major controversy arose about the possible extinction of the white trout or sea trout.  I addressed that issue head on and have gone a long way towards solving it.  The proper approach is to strike a balance which ensures that the white trout or sea trout survive and that salmon farms, which preferably are not located near the estuaries or rivers, are given a chance to survive.  If they respond to the regime in place in relation to hygiene, water management and fallowing it would be beneficial to improving the quality and quantity of our farm salmon and ensure the survival of sea trout, which is part of our heritage, not for this generation but for future generations.  As an example of what has been achieved one had only to look at Waterville this year where we <Col N="1485" /> had the highest ever inflow of sea trout in 60 years.  That in itself tells a tale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been clearly established that notwithstanding their political pedigree, the various appointments to the Bench over the years dispensed justice with absolute impartiality.  It could never be said that they had in any way acted in a political fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that due to the undignified brawl between the two Government <Col N="1587" /> parties the Judiciary has been drawn into politics in a way that was never done before.  Irreparable damage has been done to the position of the Judiciary and those who will be appointed to the Bench.  The basis for this argument derives from the recent controversy.  For example, the two Government parties obviously could not agree on who should be appointed President of the High Court.  A most unusual situation developed and a discussion took place on whether the people available for such an appointment were of one political persuasion or another.  That raises a very serious question. It is not a reflection on the Judiciary, it is simply a sad reflection on the Government.</P>
    <P>For the first time before an appointment is made it is suggested that, perhaps, one of several of the people who may be available for appointment may be of one political persuasion or another.  That is a serious and sad moment in our society and it has brought the Bench into disrepute.  The Judiciary was used by the two parties in Government to justify their positions and their existence.  That is a sad day for this country.</P>
    <P>I worry about what will happen in the future.  Will people be nominated on the basis of whether they are of the political left, right or centre?  If so it will lend itself to endless complications in the future.  No matter what happens in the future there will always be the possibility of somebody pointing the finger, in the aftermath of a particular appointment, and suggesting that those who sat on the Bench at a particular time were on one or other side of the political divide. I do not recall that happening before.  The Government has set the scene and the agenda for this and it will have to live with it.  The Government should apologise to the Judiciary for the damage it has done.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue that has been the subject of animated discussion in the past week or so, the suitability or otherwise of the Attorney General for <Col N="1588" /> appointment to be President of the High Court.  I have no knowledge of him being anything other than a decent man.  In the few dealings I had with him he seemed to be an honourable and upright person.  However, it has been suggested that he might have acted more speedily in a case involving a paedophile. The only information the Opposition can obtain is through the graciousness of Government Ministers when answering questions.  That is not the hallmark of the Government, although there are one or two notable exceptions.</P>
    <P>If the information available is correct then we have a serious problem.  I strongly support the call by my party leader this morning not to proceed with the appointment until such time as this matter has been cleared up, both from the point of view of the individual concerned and the fact that it will affect all other such appointments in the future.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.  There appears to be confusion in certain quarters, as the Committee of Public Accounts learned recently, as to his position.  He is not legal adviser to the State but rather the legal adviser to the Government and that is his official responsibility.  Legal advice proffered on various issues is fine but it is not within his statutory function.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to illustrate clearly what happened to the request for a warrant for the extradition of a paedophile in recent times. Was there an unnecessary delay?  Who was contacted?  Did the British authorities contact anybody other than the Attorney General's office?  Were any Ministers involved?  Were any Ministers alerted?  When there was no response was any other Department involved or alerted and, if so, what was the response?  These questions must be answered in the near future or otherwise the office will fall into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The Government has already fallen into disrepute.  A political scrum takes place between the two parties every <Col N="1589" /> time a political appointment has to be made and if a heel against the head can be achieved, so be it.  Those appointments were normally made without any reference to politics.  The scrum will take place, one way or another somebody will win and everybody will know about it.  That has not been the tradition and there is no evidence to suggest the system did not work well in the past. The Minister should reply to some of the questions raised in the debate.  Failure to do so would cast a shadow over the method and manner of proposed appointments and the office of various officeholders which would not be in anybody's interest.</P>
    <P>Having regard to requests for the processing of an extradition warrant, we cannot afford to deal with the Office of the Attorney General in anything other than an exemplary fashion, particularly as two jurisdictions are involved.  There must be trust between the jurisdictions. I hope the matter will be resolved before the debate concludes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the suitability of lawyers for appointment to the Bench.  What type of assessment will take place?  I hope the Government does not propose introducing a FÁS scheme to train people before they are deemed suitable for appointment.  The standards applied are very high.  In endeavouring to achieve the highest possible qualifications for such appointments the Government has decided to introduce a system for assessing people's suitability.  On what basis will suitability be assessed?  Will people affiliated to Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Democratic Left be excluded and those affiliated to the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil be included?  This is a dangerous and peculiar development and one wonders what will be its effects.  To be fair, perhaps the system will include those affiliated to Opposition parties and exclude Government-supporting members of the legal profession.  That would not be fair either.  I would like to know more about the proposed screening process.  I am sure the legal profession will not be <Col N="1590" /> impressed by it, but no doubt the Government has its reasons for going down that road.</P>
    <P>We support certain aspects of the legislation.  Obviously, inspiration for it was drawn from a Private Member's Bill introduced by my colleague.  Deputy Gay Mitchell, and we compliment the Government in that regard.  I hope the questions which I and other Members on this side raised will be answered. Failure to answer them will only exacerbate further the cloud that hangs over the Government's power to appoint, the Office of the Attorney General and other offices filled by the Government. Unless and until those points are cleared up many questions will remain unanswered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill contains many worthwhile provisions, reflecting considerable credit on the Minister and Minister of State.  There are, however, certain provisions which I perceive to be a Labour Party input with which I have some difficulty because their constitutionality may be called into question. In our Constitution the doctrine of the separation of powers underpins the Government of the State and there are good reasons for that.  The Judiciary may not interfere with the Executive and the Executive may not interfere with the Judiciary.  The late Deputy and former Minister, John Kelly, was blessed with one of the finest minds elected to this House.  When contemplating the role of the Judiciary in modern society he said it had been beneficial, rational, progressive and fair. That sums up the role of the Judiciary since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to a quotation from Mr. Finlay, the former President of the High Court, in the case of the State and Walsh <i>v.</i> Murphy reported on page 275 of <i>Irish Reports.</i>  On that occasion Mr. Finlay stated that the appointment of a judge is an act requiring the President's intervention for its effectiveness in law but, in fact, it is the decision and act of the Executive.  The Bill proposes the appointment of a <Col N="1591" /> Judicial Appointments Advisory Board comprising mainly judges.  It has been stated in the print media and on television and radio that the Government, having received at least three but not more than five names from the advisory board, will appoint a judge from that list and that it would be unusual for the Government to do otherwise.  That represents a sea change in the appointment of the Judiciary.  Are we coming perilously close to the Government's role in the appointment of the Judiciary becoming interventionist in its scope? That raises the question of the extent to which the sovereign duty of the Government or the Executive is circumscribed. The Supreme Court may hold that, as the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will exercise only an advisory function and as the Government can make appointments of people other than those whose names are submitted by the board, the constitutional prerogative of the Government would be upheld.  When does a convention become a custom and a custom become a law?</P>
    <P>If it should become the convention or custom that the Executive appoints the Judiciary from the names supplied by the advisory board, one could then argue that the process of selection is in direct contravention with Article 13 of the Constitution which provides that the powers and functions conferred on the President by the Constitution shall be exercisable and performable by him only on the advice of the Government, unless otherwise stated.</P>
    <P>Clearly this includes Article 35 which provides that judges will be appointed by the President.  There is a difficulty here which needs to be cleared up, something that must be given weighty and serious consideration.  I foresee a further difficulty with this provision.  It is anticipated judges will be appointed by Government from the list for the most part submitted by judges.  This means the Judiciary will have the majority vote on whom their next colleague should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> My argument on the blurring of the distinction between the Judiciary and the executive is reinforced by the Judiciary now being given an opportunity to interfere in the executive process by deciding who should be their next colleague or next judge.  That is not desirable, for many reasons other than the blurring of the distinction.  One such reason could relate to a barrister who would like to become a High Court judge but would have to appear before the judge to fight a hard case and advance a strong argument, disagreeing fundamentally with the judge in court while looking forward to his interview the following week for a place on the High Court?  That type of procedure is undeniably undesirable in theory.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the Judiciary becoming a self-perpetuating elite.  The Judiciary is not a members' club and must never become one.  Its absolute independence from the Executive is of paramount importance under the Constitution.  The independence of the Judiciary must be seen to be transparent and, of necessity, must be seen to be independent of the Executive.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in a recent newspaper article that in 1782 the Irish Parliament passed an Act to secure the independence of judges and the impartial administration of justice.  From that year onwards judges could no longer be swept from office at the whim of Government, as apparently the whole bench had been in 1714 when Queen Anne died.  Since the enactment of the Irish Constitution of 1937 judges can be removed from office only for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, then only upon resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The independence of the Judiciary is fundamental to the proper operation of the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The question of what forces might be anticipated as likely to threaten judicial independence was considered by the Supreme Court in O'Byrne <i>v.</i> the Minister for Finance, when the answer given was that obviously the danger of interference with independence arises from <Col N="1593" /> the executive and legislative organs of State.  Everybody would agree that, as much as it is crucial for judicial independence that such appointments be independent and be seen to be independent it is essential also that, once appointed, a judge should know that he or she is secure in office until he or she dies or reaches a specific age.  However, the question of what that age should be is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that judges retire at the age of 65, although, happily, the Minister has seen fit to extend that to 68 years.  It must be remembered that a judge is like a very fine craftsman; it takes years of experience, learning and wisdom to become a wise judge.  Some of the finest judgments delivered in this State have been delivered by judges who were well over the age of 65. Indeed some of the most enduring judgments internationally have been delivered by judges who were well over the age of 65.  One thing that would not be acceptable would be a year to year renewal of the appointment of a judge because that would clearly interfere with the independence of the Judiciary. Any act, even in good faith, which can be seen by the public as an interference with the independence, must be avoided.  That is of crucial importance because the doctrine of separation of powers underpins the Constitution and the Constitution decides the governance of the State.</P>
    <P>On the training of judges, it is proposed that judges be trained by some body, some group or educational establishment. Of fundamental importance here is who is to train judges, who is to shape and mould their minds in such a way that they will be able to deliver coherent, clear-thinking judgments? Such a programme of training would interfer with the independence of the Judiciary.  Men and women appointed as judges, the judicial arm of this State, are people of considerable, practical experience and must have practised before the courts over a period of several years. They are in daily contact with the plight of ordinary human beings and learn <Col N="1594" /> from this experience, which gives them an insight into people and into the law, which no amount of training by any educational establishment or group of people can give.  Judges cannot be trained, they evolve over a period.  Their training is not in the interests of the integrity of independence of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty also &mdash; and it is well that such difficulties be pointed out at this stage &mdash; with section 4 (2) (a).  This Bill purports to transfer the powers of the Supreme Court in appeals, not being constitutional appeals and not being matters of public importance, to the Court of Civil Appeal.  While the Court of Civil Appeal is welcome, where does that leave a litigant whose case has been heard in the High Court, who this very day has the right of appeal to the allembracing Supreme Court?  That litigant is not to be told that his case must be heard in the Court of Civil Appeal. The problem is that the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> as it operates in our Supreme Court binds all courts below it and only the Supreme Court can reverse a decision of the Supreme Court.  It is clear that the Court of Civil Appeal will be bound by <i>stare decisis</i> laid down previously by the Supreme Court.  To this extent the law is being circumscribed. The ability to move to change and to evolve with changing patterns is certainly inhibited.  I accept that the Supreme Court will still have power to decide issues of public importance and constitutional matters but the fundamental rule of <i>stare decisis</i> remains.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable public debate in recent years on the question of disgracefully high insurance premia. It has been suggested that the problem would be resolved by capping compensation payments.  Not too many insurance companies go out of business, and insurance companies which claim they are running motor insurance at a loss are more than compensated by their other ventures.  It would not be right of this House to interfere with the concept of bodily integrity any more than a person should be penalised for <Col N="1595" /> being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Capping would interfere with the judicial process.</P>
    <P>On the well worn question of wearing wigs, this practice was inherited from the British empire and should have been dispensed with years ago.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on doing so.  There is no penalty clause in relation to wearing a wig.  I must assume, therefore, that the court would hold a barrister in contempt under the provisions of this Bill if he or she were to arrive in court wearing a wig.  However, the person holding the barrister in contempt would, in all probability, be wearing a wig.  There is a need to reconsider that provision with a view to ensuring that it can be enforced.</P>
    <P>In general terms I welcome the vast majority of the Bill's provisions and congratulate the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State.  I have outlined matters which are of concern to me.  To put the issue beyond doubt I urge the President to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the last speaker who spoke about the status of judges and felt they should go on, like Moses, striking rocks into old age, I think 65 is well past the time for many of these judges to retire. They should be treated as human beings.  If civil servants, advisers to Government Ministers, Government Ministers and teachers are supposed to be old at 65, it is time judges were treated in the same way and 65, as far as I am concerned, is a grand time for <Col N="1596" /> them to go out to grass and think of all the mistakes they made when they set up with arrogance profound.</P>
    <P>I had to listen to a High Court judge one day looking for a yes or no answer to the question &ldquo;did you brake when you met oncoming cars?&rdquo; That is something a driver does automatically &mdash; if one is chauffeur-driven one does not know the experience.  The event in question had taken place three years before that and I think the judge was prepared to have the fellow up for contempt of court because he hesitated in answering. That attitude of being out-of-touch with reality has shattered my confidence in judges, apart from what a solicitor told me once about an occasion when a child came flying out of a side road on a bicycle into the side of a car.  When I asked the solicitor if he would appeal the case he said that every judge in Ireland will give compensation to a child as long as there is insurance on a car, regardless of whether the child has dropped out of the sky in front of the car.  I wonder at times if justice is administered in court.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that 72 years will no longer be the age at which judges must retire.  I am not sure whether it is 65 or 68 now but it is still too old; judges should be retired before that.  If I have a chance to vote against that, I will; although I may not bring down the Government I will have expressed my view.</P>
    <P>I am not too pushed about the wearing of wigs.  If people want to wear wigs and are happy in that awful garb, that is fair enough.  It has no impact on speeding up the court process.</P>
    <P>I worry about delays in court.  This Bill deals mainly with the upper levels of court.  I will not deal with that because several people have spoken about the appointment of judges, the advisory group, etc.  The vast majority of people deal in the Circuit Court and I find it difficult to understand why it cannot be dealt with in this Bill.  The Review Body of Civil Jurisdiction in England, published in 1988 said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Delay undermines justice.  It reduces the availability of evidence and erodes a reliability of that which is available.  It denies compensation to those who are entitled to it until long after it is most needed.  Delay causes continual personal stress, anxiety and financial hardship to ordinary people and their families.  It may induce economically weaker parties to accept unfair settlements.  It also frustrates the efficient conduct of commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>For that reason we should do everything possible to avoid delay.</P>
    <P>I note that solicitors can now be appointed to the Circuit Court and I welcome that.  Solicitors have a practical down to earth experience of living in the real world and would bring sanity to the position of judge of the Circuit Court. County registrars are appointed from the ranks of solicitors and they look after the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 31 allows the Master of the High Court to exercise limited functions and powers of a judicial nature.  I would like similar powers to be granted to registrars in the Circuit Court.  Given that a review on that has been undertaken, it is disappointing that such powers are not provided in the Bill.  Registrars must have eight years practical experience.  While their work could be compared to that of clerical officers their salaries are on the level of an assistant secretary in a Department and that is only correct.  I cannot understand why those people who are qualified in legal matters are not given appropriate responsibility.  A clerical officer could nearly do the work of a registrar.  Like the Master of the High Court the powers of registrars should be extended.</P>
    <P>There is a pile up of cases in the Circuit Court at present.  An article on my county was published in the SeptemberOctober 1994 edition of the <i>Law Society Gazette.</i>  It states:</P>
    <P>According to Carlow Bar Association, criminal matters are receiving a disproportionate share in the Circuit <Col N="1598" /> Court and the number of criminal trials pending would prevent the Court from dealing with District Court civil appeals, civil and matrimonial cases in forthcoming sessions [this actually happened].  The Bar Association estimates that cases that were ready for hearing in June 1993 are unlikely to be reached until February 1995 at the earliest.  [It will probably be June 1995, almost a two year delay, before new cases are dealt with.]  The Circuit Court sits in Carlow for four weeks each year but only one week is allocated to non criminal business. </P>
    <P>At the request of Carlow Bar Association the society made representations to the Department of Justice to point out that a delay of this magnitude was unacceptable.  The society reiterated the call by Carlow Bar Association for greater time to be allocated to civil businesses or for an alternative solution such as the allocation of an additional Judge to the Carlow Circuit to deal with the backlog of civil work.  They welcomed the announcement that the Department review of activity levels in the Circuit Court has been completed but, again, they asked the Department to take urgent action to deal with the situation in Carlow.</P>
    <P>Given that a review of the activities of the Circuit Court, its efficiency and level of work has been completed why does the Bill not address the needs of the Circuit Court where the limit on claims dealt with has been increased fron £15,000 to £30,000?  That has resulted in the work load of the Circuit Court being nearly doubled and resources have not been provided to deal with the additional work.  Prior to that change cases in the Circuit Court were not up to date but there is a big backlog now.  Delays result in additional costs.  Sometimes cases are postponed and solicitors are delayed in dealing with other cases.  Perhaps a stricter line should be taken on appeals and petitions to postpone court cases and rigid rules should be set allowing the postponement of cases only when people <Col N="1599" /> are ill in hospital and so on.  Perhaps too many frivolous reasons are given for postponing court cases, leading to delays and increased costs.</P>
    <P>There are problems also in Laois, part of the midlands circuit.  A study carried out there compared the number of cases dealt with in 1983 to those dealt with in 1993.  There was a general increase, but I was flabbergasted to discover that appeals from the District Court increased from 100 in 1983 to 973 in 1993.  The appointment of an additional judge would be required to deal adequately with the increased work load.  The Circuit Court also has responsibility for family law cases which have contributed to the increased work load.  If we do not address the problem of the backlog of cases in the Circuit Court there will be increased delays.  A review body in England has said that delay undermines justice.  In Laois it is estimated that the minimum time a litigant must wait for his or her case to be heard is 12 months.</P>
    <P>Under the ground rents Act registrars are allowed to be arbitrators and their legal skills are recognised under it.  Why is it not possible for them to deal in other quasi-legal affairs, such as claims in respect of car accidents?  Claims are often increased to justify their being heard in the Circuit Court and they far exceed a realistic figure.  More often than not, a barter system is in operation. Registrars, who are qualified solicitors, could deal with a good deal of work which causes delays in the Circuit Court.  I would not envisage it would cause a problem as long as people have the right to appeal.</P>
    <P>The talents of our registrars should not be wasted.  Judges should be like surgeons; they should do their job and leave the administration work to registrars who are officials of the Circuit Court.  To address the problem of the delay in dealing with cases in the Circuit Court it is necessary to either appoint additional Circuit Court judges and provide the required back-up staff or <Col N="1600" /> increase the number of seessions.  A Circuit Court judge in the midlands circuit sits longer hours than his predecessor, yet that has not had any great effect in reducing the backlog of cases.  The power of registrars should be increased and they should be given additional work of which they are capable.  New circuits should be set up and others should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>It is an archaic system that a judge appears once a term in an area to deal with a backlog of cases.  If the Master of the High Court can be given new powers to administer his or her court, registrars in the Circuit Court should also be allowed administer the court under their jurisdiction.  That change could be achieved without involving additional costs.  Registrars are being paid a high salary but they are being asked to use their talents to less than 25 per cent of full potential.  It is time that position was addressed.  I would like to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute, albeit briefly, to this important debate.  The question of the performance of the courts is an important one and deserves the most detailed scrutiny.  Courts and individual judges are rightly independent in the performance of their duty, yet we must square their independence with some degree of accountability.  I do not mean accountability in terms of decisions or judgments made.  Judgments, except in the case of the Supreme Court, can always be appealed upwards.  In the case of the Supreme Court a single judge does not make a decision; it is a collegial court.  Since my brief tenure as Minister for Justice I have been concerned that there is not a way to measure, criticise or improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the courts.  Will the Courts Commission have a role in that respect to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of courts in general and individual <Col N="1601" /> courts in particular?  I know of cases that were delayed in court because a judge misled papers or had forgotten the facts of the case.  Nobody, not even the Chief Justice, has a role in dealing with such judges.  This is an important debate and we should be seeking, perhaps through the vehicle of the Courts Commission, to bring about accountability in the performance of the courts.</P>
      <P>We should go much further in distancing from the political process appointments to the courts.  This Bill is a step in the right direction though I criticise it in one respect &mdash; that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is a completely in-house body composed of judges and people from the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council. The Law Library and the legal profession generally is very incestuous, a very powerful lobby whose interests are not always coincidental with those of the public and whose views of what is appropriate are not always what the public see as appropriate.  I ask the Minister to consider appointing to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board experts other than lawyers, for instance, people with senior management and personnel experience who understand management matters.  That would ensure efficiency as well as judicial jurisprudence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the proposals in the Bill, the words of the Constitution should be given much more consideration. The Constitution provides that judges shall be appointed by the President. It provides also that all functions of the President granted by the Constitution shall, except where it is specified it should be at that office holder's absolute discretion, be exercised on the advice of the Government.  I accept that, but in practice it has been taken to mean that the Government has the initiative in nominating judges and the President can only appoint the person whose nomination has been initiated by the Government.  If this Bill is enacted the Government's initiative will be confined to the Chief Justice, the President <Col N="1602" /> of the Court of Appeal and the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court.  I do not know why the Government is retaining that initiative. My party made a proposal in this regard before the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>A law consistent with the Constitution could be drafted to give the initiative of nomination to the President in consultation with an advisory board along the lines I suggested.  The President could go to the Government for its advice on the person she believes should be appointed and at that point the Government could give its advice.  It is very clear from the recent coincidence of the Beef Tribunal report and the appointment of the Chief Justice that these matters are open to misinterpretation. It is much better for all concerned that there be a greater distance between the Executive and the Judiciary.  The initiative should be given to the President, who could also be chairperson of the Courts Commission.  The Constitution states that the President can be assigned, by law, to such other functions as the Legislature sees fit.</P>
    <P>Recently we granted substantial increases to judges, in line with the substantial increase given to Ministers. While we are giving judges of the Supreme Court much higher salaries, in this Bill we seem to be taking from the Supreme Court a great bulk of its functions. What will be the role of Supreme Court judges?  How busy will they be? Will they work full time or part time? One of my concerns, particularly in my roll as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is that we seem to be creating three new bodies: a Court of Appeal, which I accept will supplant the Court of Criminal Appeal; a Courts Commission and a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  This will involve additional cost to the Exchequer.  Have these bodies been measured for efficiency, effectiveness and value for public money?</P>
    <P>The independence of the courts can be squared with proper accountability in a democracy.  For instance, in the UK the Lord Chancellor who is a member <Col N="1603" /> of the Cabinet also has a role in terms of the performance of judges.  He can reprimand and censure individual judges for poor performance or behaviour. Even if this Bill is enacted there will be nobody here with such a role. While such a person should not be in the Executive or political field, because of the need to separate the executive from the Judiciary, that role could be granted to the President.  The presidency is an office that is under-utilised. The President &mdash; not only the present incumbent &mdash; would be a particularly apt person to oversee the performance of the courts and make recommendations on judicial appointments.</P>
    <P>I carried out surveys in my constituency about two years ago on people's perception of crime on the ground, the findings were interesting.  It was clear that most people who are concerned about and want action on crime do not favour a hang-'em, flog-'em policy.  It was surprising that while the Garda get huge support from the public, the courts are held in poor regard by many people. I take no satisfaction in making that point, but it highlights the fact that there would be great support among the public for any steps that would be taken to make the courts more efficient, effective and realistic in making decisions.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill is not carved in stone and that the Minister will be willing to accept amendments.  I hope she will be prepared to accept amendments to the make-up of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It would be an important improvement if the board was not comprised of lawyers, as proposed, and management and personnel expertise was imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The major change envisaged in creating a new intermediate appellate court is long overdue and meets with universal approval.  This Bill will ensure that citizens with personal injury claims in the High Court can look forward to an early resolution of their cases where the outcome is appealed. For too long the legal system has been <Col N="1604" /> open to the criticism by aggrieved citizens that justice delayed has resulted in justice being denied.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court, as we are constantly reminded, is greatly overburdened by the vast array of major constitutional, commercial and common law cases which are becoming a feature of our increasingly litigious society.  The removal of private citizen personal injury claims from the Supreme Court is welcome.  This new court, with the powers given in section 37, which should result in full disclosure of all the pertinent medical and technical evidence in these cases, can only oil the wheels of justice and ensure a speedy resolution of them.</P>
      <P>The benefits are twofold.  The Supreme Court should now be free to tackle the major cases on which it is increasingly being asked to adjudicate, the outcome of which can and very often does touch upon the life of every citizen.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Courts Act increased the civil jurisdiction of all courts and the amount of damages such courts could award by way of civil remedy.  The practical consequence of this Act has been a huge increase in the volume of litigation conducted in the Circuit Court.  In County Donegal there are currently 157 civil cases to be dealt with, the majority of which relate to the claims of ordinary people for damages resulting from injuries received in road traffic accidents. These cases cannot be heard in the immediate future and to this extent I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to give urgent consideration to increasing the number of Circuit Court judges and reducing the size of the circuits. Many circuits cover as many as four counties to be dealt with by one judge.  My circuit, the northern circuit, stretches from Buncrana in Inishowen to Castleblaney in County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill which deals with the proposed Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is also welcome.  Transparency in the manner of appointment of judges is something with which we, as <Col N="1605" /> legislators, should be rightly concerned. The practical workings of the board and its proposed constituent members cause me some concern based on a consideration of our Constitution.  It is envisaged that a committee of the board will recommend candidates for judicial appointment by the Government.  The Bill states, that the Government shall first consider the names submitted but need not necessarily be bound by them. Where a Government proposes to appoint a person not recommended by the board a degree of constitutional friction may arise.  The Judiciary is, by constitutional ordinance, distinct, separate and wholly independent of either the Oireachtas or the Executive.  This solemn constitutional separateness has served this country well and the independence and integrity of the Judiciary is testament to that constitutional prerogative.</P>
    <P>The senior judges who will constitute the majority of this board may be drawn into unnecessary conflict with the Government if their nominee is not accepted.  One thinks immediately of the column inches in the media &mdash; who could blame them &mdash; in the event of the Government seeing fit to overlook the considered choice of the most senior judges in the land, especially when that choice is supported by reasons as it must by virtue of section 25 (1).</P>

      <P>As regards section 25 (1) in the event of the Government seeing fit to overlook the considered choice of the most senior judges in the land especially when it is supported by reasons, would this be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in them?  The potential for conflict is obvious and its consequences, given the constitutional separateness about which I have spoken are alarming.  However, on the contrary, if a future Government felt compelled by way of some unwritten constitutional consciousness in all instances to appoint a judge from the list provided by the board, the consequences would be equally imperfect.</P>
      <P>Judges are not constitutionally envisaged or intended to be the Government's recruiting agents.  Furthermore, six of the intended eight members are judges and they are being asked to recruit for the Government from among their own ranks their potential successors. I ask the Minister to consider the points made by other Members on appointing additional people to the board, if it is to continue.  It is a potentially invidious and unfair to ask independent judges to adjudicate on those who, in many instances, are their friends and former colleagues.  A lawyer considering judicial appointment may well wonder whether to give his all in a courtroom battle which may be presided over by a member of the interview board.  Article 6.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people, through their elected representatives, are excluded from their constitutionally given right to designate their rulers of the State and, therefore, <Col N="1607" /> ultimately to determine who shall exercise all powers of government, legislative, executive and in this instance judicial.  I have solemn constitutional concerns about the potential practical workings of such a board and its constituent members in close proximity to the Government, touching on such constitutional sacred territory.</P>
    <P>There are incidental provisions relating to the workings of the board which also appears to be unusual.  The board may, for instance, consult the Attorney General about the suitability of a person to hold judicial office but should they consult him or her about one or all of the nominees?  If the Attorney General is to be consulted in what circumstances should he be consulted and why not make him a member of the board in the first place?</P>
    <P>Section 25 (4) states: &ldquo;A committee shall not submit to the Minister the name of any person under subsection (1) of this section unless the person has attended a course of education or training...&rdquo; It is apparent, therefore, that all nominees intending to seek judicial office should attend such a course, but who will pay for it, what will it entail, how long will it take to complete, who will evaluate the nominees during their time on the course, will there be a written or oral examination at its conclusion and who will evaluate the results of same?  All these questions have to be firmly teased out before such structures are put in place.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill which has two sections, 29 and 30 deals with the establishment of the Courts Commission but the composition of its members is not dealt with.  Will they be judges, civil servants, lawyers or lay people?  Will they report weekly, monthly or annually and are they to comment on the administration, funding and condition of courthouses?  Will it be their brief to extend to individual judges their judgement, legal policy, the legal system, particular advocates or lawyers?</P>
    <P>The organisation and management of the courts and court service are matters <Col N="1608" /> almost wholly within the remit of the Department of Justice in consultation with the various judicial presidents.  Do we really need another group?</P>
    <P>The intended extension of the powers of the Master of the High Court is undoubtedly commendable but is it permissible under our Constitution?  The proposed powers to be given to the Taxing Master of the High Court on legal fees is universally welcome.  The public has read, with a mixture of awe and wonderment, about the legal fees which some lawyers are capable of commanding. By and large these fees were fixed under a scale fee structure but by virtue of the Competition Act, 1991, and the express overtures of the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, the lawyers abolished the scale fees and the cost of the Beef Tribunal is one of the results of that single minded pursuance of this policy.  The market dictates all &mdash; a <i>laissez faire</i> policy, beloved of that Deputy's party, may well frustrate the Minister's very laudable intentions in this regard.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes its appearance now as a direct result of an extraordinarily unseemly row between the two Government parties, and more particularly the two Government party leaders on the question of whom to appoint to the Presidency of the High Court.  This row has dragged the <Col N="1609" /> Judiciary and the judicial process into unnecessary disrepute.  It is a scandalous and petty squabble for which the two parties and the two party leaders rightly deserve the contempt of the country. The people of Cork will soon have the opportunity to express that contempt and I certainly hope they will.</P>
      <P>As far as they go most of the provisions of this Bill are welcome but none is new.  As far back as 1987 I recommended the establishment of a Court of Appeal and Deputy McDowell recommended it on several occasions since then.  We included it in the Programme for Government in 1989 but we could not get the Fianna Fáil Party to take it up and implement it.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill, which are far from revolutionary and only of limited value are the small price that Labour asks to be paid to take itself off the hook, of its own making, in the Whelehan affair.  Tactically, the Labour Party was wrong from the start.  It handled the matter extremely badly.  Bad and all as its tactics and wrong as its motives may have been I believe it is right in its objections to the appointment of Mr. Whelehan, the Attorney General, as President of the High Court.  The question arises as to whether he is suitable for appointment to any senior judicial post or office.</P>
      <P>The first thing that must be said about the Attorney General and his attitude to the present controversy is that he must want the job extraordinarily badly if he is prepared to endure the open contempt of more than one-third of the Government he serves.  Any senior lawyer endowed with a less thick skin would long since have declared that he had no interest in the post and would have preserved his dignity and that of the Judiciary generally.</P>

His handling of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case was, frankly, grotesque if viewed from the point of view of either humanity or common sense.  By way of contrast to the speed with which he pursued that unfortunate child, we had his unwillingness, over a very long period, to do anything to allow the extradition of the paedophile priest, Fr. Brendan Smyth, to Northern Ireland to answer very serious charges.  This deliberate prolonged delay by the Attorney General had the effect of protecting the priest at the potential expense of innocent young people.  His failure to deal with the matter over a prolonged period was in spite of repeated requests from the gardaí&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The deliberate prolonged inaction was bad enough but what is even worse is the way in which some of his Fianna Fáil colleagues such as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in particular, were copied in hiding behind and blaming civil servants for his own shortcomings and for his unwillingness to be accountable for what happens in his own office.  It is remarkable, but clearly part of a pattern, that on the very day the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was wheeling out a civil servant to take the blame for the alteration of an official document in relation to Galmoy, the Attorney General, in this House, through the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, was blaming civil servants for allegedly not showing him papers.  It may or may not be true that the Attorney General did not see these papers but I find it impossible to believe he was not aware of the fact that an application had been made for the extradition of this priest and that he was not aware of the need for him to deal with the matter under the Extradition Act, 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I am entitled to comment on some of the events.  In particular, the doubts I expressed are compounded by the manner in which a certain matter was investigated early last year and I am familiar with all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>When I made a complaint to a certain constitutional officer, as we shall call him, about the conduct and activities of a certain barrister employed by the State in the beef tribunal based, I might add, on that barrister's own admissions, I was told there would be an investigation of the matter by the constitutional officer concerned.  He purportedly carried out some form of rapid investigation by speaking only to the barrister concerned and to some others on the State team and, having heard their version of the matter, he purported to make a finding which he published at lunch time that day to the effect that the barrister concerned had acted properly and that there was no foundation for my complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seemed to me to be akin to a judge acquitting a defendant without <Col N="1614" /> hearing the case or the evidence for the prosecution.  Even when that evidence was given to him later that day &mdash; and it was abundantly clear what the import and effect of it was &mdash; he refused to withdraw his purported finding.  Subsequently, the barrister's own professional body held an inquiry into the matter where it found the barrister concerned to be seriously at fault and it imposed a substantial fine on him.  That body could scarcely be described as being biased in my favour.  Its findings cut the ground from under the constitutional officer concerned and the whole episode raises serious doubts about his ability to take an open and judicial approach to disputed facts.</P>
    <P>The proposal to appoint the present Attorney General prior to the passage of this Bill by the Oireachtas flies in the face of the spirit of section 28 which makes it clear that the Government should first have regard to the suitability of existing High Court judges. Section 28 is right so far as it goes except that it should make it obligatory on them to do so and appoint one of their number to the post.  When this controversy first erupted in September the Taoiseach put out the story that there was a binding convention that the Attorney General of the day would be appointed President of the High Court if such a vacancy arose.  There is no such convention.  I cannot recall any such appointment in recent years but if at some time in the past 72 years there was such an appointment, there does not appear to have been more than one and that cannot be regarded as a binding tradition.  Few, if any, Attorneys' General were appointed President of the High Court and that such a story can be put out without challenge is a reflection on our commentators who take so much of what is dished out to them by the Government as gospel.</P>
    <P>The costs provisions in section 36 are welcome.  The present position is intolerable. That section and others connected to it deserve close scrutiny on Committee Stage to ensure they achieve the necessary objective of bringing costs <Col N="1615" /> under control and preventing them being determined by judges.</P>
    <P>One of the least important sections, although it gets a great deal of coverage, is section 41 which deals with the question of wigs.  It applies only to barristers and solicitors.  Why should judges wear wigs?  That should be looked at on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The proposal to appoint solicitors as judges of the Circuit Court is welcome but I do not understand why the same provision does not apply to High Court and Supreme Court judges.  It is an indication of how slowly things move and change in the law that a provision along these lines was inserted by me in the Courts Bill, 1971 as Minister for Justice but it had to be removed from that Bill under &ldquo;superior pressure&rdquo;.  I was young then and less able to stand up for my rights than I am now.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of the Court of Appeal and the terms of employment of the president of that court, section 3 (2) (a) states: &ldquo;a President who shall be an ordinary judge of the High Court designated by the Government...&rdquo; Does that mean designated for good or from time to time? The ordinary judges who would serve there will be designated by the Chief Justice from time to time.  If the president is to be designated from time to time it is most unsatisfactory because he can be removed from office if he gives a decision that does not appeal to the Government.  That needs to be clarified. The subsection is unclear.</P>
    <P>Another matter that needs to be clarified is what happens to a judge currently serving who may be appointed to the presidency?  Will he continue to serve as president until age 72 or, under the other provisions will he retire at 65 years even though he can continue to serve as an ordinary judge of the High Court until he is 72?</P>
    <P>I look forward to raising other matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a significant reform of the system.  The <Col N="1616" /> court system is central to our democracy and touches on the lives of more and more people as years go by.</P>
      <P>There is provision here for a Court of Appeal as laid down in the Programme for Government.  Throughout the courts system but particularly at Supreme Court level there is a huge backlog of cases to be heard.  Many of these are appeals from the High Court.  Important constitutional cases are heard before appeals with the result that many appeals are not heard for years.  The Court of Appeal should help reduce the backlog of cases awaiting Supreme Court hearing.</P>
      <P>Why are there different retirement ages for different judges?  The general age for retirement in the public service is 65 years.  The Minister is proposing change but almost reluctantly, and more or less suggests that the retirement age may not be 65 and there could be a compromise.  I do not see why judges should be treated differently from other grades in the public or private sector. Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about great judgements given by judges in their seventies. Perhaps that is so, but I do not understand why genius should suddenly hit a judge in his later years of life any more than it should any other worker. A person is something of a rarity if he is still employed in the public sector at 65.  I was employed in a semi-State body and early retirement was offered to anyone who wished to avail of it.  I do not understand why it should be considered that a judge's best years lie ahead of him when other people must retire at 65.  They should have to retire at 65 also. Naturally those who were appointed would continue to serve under the rules governing their appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 39 which deals with solicitors being eligible for appointment as circuit court judges.  Why does the Bill not go further and say they could be eligible for appointment to the High Court and Supreme Court?  I do not see any logical reason why this should not be done.  Those who wished to be appointed would be assessed as to their <Col N="1617" /> suitability, experience and knowledge of the law.</P>
    <P>Since 1971 solicitors have the right of audience in all courts.  However, very few solicitors have taken it up because they believe judges, ex-barristers, frown on it on the basis that their profession will be done out of a fee.  Naturally, a solicitor wants to be on the right side of a judge and does not want to step on his toes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to appoint solicitors as judges of the Circuit Court. Obviously this will encourage more solicitors to take cases to the Circuit Court. I would like to think solicitors could aspire to being appointed judges of any court so that there would be a fundamental change in the system and solicitors would take cases to all courts.  This would give people a much greater choice and reduce the staggering cost of taking a case to court.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that the final appointment to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, will be made by the President.  While recommendations made to the Government can only be taken as advice, obviously it will find it difficult to veer away from these.  During debates on legislation reference is made to the need to make the system more transparent.  This is fine in theory but may not be so in practice. There seems to be a demand to take the decision making powers away from the Government and give them to an independent board.  This is merely sucking power away from the Government and politicians, and I question this.  Many of these boards are so independent that they are almost not answerable to anybody. Decisions made by such bodies outside the political system may not be better than those made by Government.</P>
    <P>The system for appointing judges has served us very well up to now.  The independence and integrity of judges is of the highest standard and judges are very well respected.  Odd decisions have been made by judges from time to time but the same can be said of some of the decisions made in other walks of life. Most people regard the Judiciary as <Col N="1618" /> knowledgeable, learned, good and fair minded interpreters of the law. However, recent events may have damaged this reputation.  Some judges were appointed on the basis of services to or past relationship with a political party, but no payback was ever suggested, promised, expected or demanded. There was certainly no question of a judicial payback or that the point of view of a particular party would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the political system may have shot itself in the foot by dragging judges into the political system, labelling them one way or the other and denying them the right to express views outside their employment.  In recent years some judges have been labelled and cast aside while others have been almost hero worshipped.  Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon was almost hounded out of his position by some liberal minded people because he expressed some views outside his job.  Yet no one could point to any of his judgments and say they were not professional, well reasoned or logically argued.</P>

      <P>The person to whom I am referring had views and might have been a member of groups regarded as conservative or pro-life, but he never allowed his views to interfere with a judgement.  He was targeted and hounded out of his job by people who did not regard him as &ldquo;in tune&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could refer to more recent cases in which the Government was involved. There has to be give and take in a partnership Government and it is not a case of waiting until something is demanded of one party.  As in any partnership, one partner has to anticipate the needs of the other.  In a recent case my party made a nomination which it anticipated the other party would support given the person's past membership of that party. <Col N="1619" /> However, it was reluctant to support his nomination and he was seen as somewhat &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; because he had not delivered, so to speak, in the case of a recent tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to a recent case which politicised, the Judiciary. This labelling of members of the Judiciary is a disgrace &mdash; if someone throws enough mud obviously some of it will stick.  These people have their own careers.  Like actors, they have been cast in a role for so long they cannot get out of it.</P>

This is very sad and no group should have to make such a suggestion to a judge.  Obviously we have damaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not mention names.  We have politicised some members of the Judiciary giving them labels of left or right.  People will be unhappy to have their cases heard by some of the judges around whom we have built a certain image.  We have done a great disservice to the judicial system by politicising it, and we have a great deal of work to do to get back to the position where judges were not judged on the basis of where they came from, who appointed them or their past membership of parties and where no one questioned their judgement from an ideological point of view or felt that they had any kind of political hangups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be aware of the limitations of our powers.  There are the politicians <Col N="1620" /> who make the laws, those who enforce it and those who interpret it.  The divide must be kept rigidly between those groups.  Of late I get the impression that some politicians would like to encroach on the area of enforcement or interpretation. Politics or political power is, for some parties, of a short term nature. Perhaps some politicans look on the Civil Service as long term.  Some politicians try to place their eggs in certain nests, like the cuckoo, so that if they go out of power certain things will continue to grow for a long time and their form of ideology will develop and prosper.</P>
    <P>The membership of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will be from the legal profession.  While that makes sense there should be a few people on the board from other administrations, general business or the commercial world.  The legal profession should not control the board because it does not give a good image if one group has the whole market cornered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative to ban the wearing of wigs by barristers in court. There has been an ongoing policy to restrict the wearing of wigs in various courts as people who go to the courts on an occasional basis can be put off by it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to appoint extra judges, I hope it will eliminate delays and provide a better system.</P>
    <P>I hope the new section dealing with court officers will be beneficial and that it will reduce costs, as suggested.  We continue to hear various suggestions to reduce the cost of court cases but, unfortunately, they are never implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of a Courts Commission as the courts system is cumbersome.  Obviously there are more judges than heretofore and, increasingly, the public have recourse to the courts.  It is the biggest growth business in the country and I do not expect this Bill will prevent that growth.  I am frightened at the manner in which the interpretation of law is growing.  It would be beneficial to reduce the cost of court cases.  As a member of a local <Col N="1621" /> authority for many years I am aware that many playgrounds, etc., have had to be closed because of the cost of court cases.  I would like to think that this Bill is one small step towards getting a grip on the legal system and helping to make it transparent.  I hope that the people who drafted the Bill see it as valuable, that they respect it and see the courts as a place to get a fair minded, independent decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will not reiterate what has been said earlier as to the reason it is in the House.  I have advocated, for many years, reform of our courts system and the formation of a court of civil appeal which could reduce the backlog in the courts in dealing with appeals which currently snarl up the High Court and result in many cases having to go to the Supreme Court which could be resolved more speedily at a court of civil appeal level.  The structure the Minister proposed for a new court of appeal, involving the Court of Criminal Appeal, as it currently stands, and the new civil court all in one court of appeal is correct.</P>
      <P>I should preface any remarks, be they praiseworthy or critical, by declaring an interest, which will not come as any great surprise to anyone here.  As well as wearing my political hat, as everyone knows, I am still a practising solicitor and do some legal work which I regard, to some extent, as a sanity preserver.  If I did nothing but spend my day in this House speaking to an empty Chamber I would have been carried out many years ago in a strait-jacket.  It is no harm to reflect that this is probably the only place in Ireland where people are expected to stand up and deliver a lengthy address to a normally empty Chamber.  Indeed, if the practices in which we engage in this House were engaged in outside it, most of us would, long ago, have been certified and be inpatients in a mental establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In declaring an interest I know people in this House have a view of me which is sometimes complimentary and at other times uncomplimentary but within the <Col N="1622" /> legal profession I am something of a legal hybrid.  I regard myself as one of Dessie's children.  When I was qualifying as a lawyer Deputy O'Malley, fortunately, was Minister for Justice.  His Courts Act, 1971, granted solicitors a right of audience in the superior courts and was designed as one step along the road to providing a unified legal profession. When I say I am something of a legal hybrid, I mean that apart from delivering occasional addresses to Members or absent Members of this House, one of the things I have been doing, going back to 1978, is acting as an advocate in the High Court and in the Supreme Court in a variety of different cases &mdash; some of which have been cases of importance and some which have affected not merely constitutional changes, in the sense of helping in the development of constitutional rights &mdash; but which also on occasions required this Chamber to introduce emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>I speak about the courts not as someone from the outside looking in but as a person who has been inside the courts and inside this House.  Something which has added to the gaiety of our nation has been the attachment which members of the Law Library have to wearing horsehair on their heads.  As a person who has appeared in the courts in many cases over the years I always regarded it as a cause of personal amusement that lawyers acting opposite me, acting as advocates, felt the necessity to wear 17th century garb before appearing in court.  As we have been told recently in quotes emanating from the Law Library they feel it provides some degree of sexual equality and anonymity and ensures that barristers are neuter gender.  Whether that means that barristers have been legally or physically neutered &mdash; or perhaps the neuter gender is confined to their appearance in court &mdash; escapes me. During the past 18 years or so it has not been a legal impediment not to have been able to wear pieces of horsehair on my head in the courts.  That I have not balanced a piece of horsehair on my <Col N="1623" /> head in the way my forefathers did 300 years ago has not taken from the solemnity of the occasion or the seriousness with which judges treat either legal submissions or my attempts to cross examine witnesses.  That view of life was the catalyst for the inclusion of a provision in the Judicial Separation Act, 1989 which abolished the wearing of wigs and gowns by barristers and judges in family law cases, the first legislation to deal with the issue of horsehair.  Since 1989 both senior and junior counsel have regularly appeared before the courts in major family law cases wearing neither wigs nor gowns but, nevertheless, they were taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea &mdash; who shares my prejudices on this matter &mdash; and I, have gone on the airwaves about this issue.  In a vote held in the Law Library, we are told, a majority voted in favour of wearing wigs, but I am not sure if we have an accurate report of what took place.  It would be interesting to request the chairman of the Bar Council, not merely to tell us the result, but to publish the questionnaire which was distributed to members of the Law Library which I understand was much more obtuse than merely asking barristers if they wished to wear wigs.</P>
    <P>In modernising our courts, we need to blow the cobwebs out of the system, including the earlobes of the legal profession. I am somewhat confused by section 41 which states that a barrister or a solicitor shall not wear, in any court established under the Constitution, a wig of the kind heretofore worn.  Does that mean they can wear a different type of wig?  Does it mean that barristers who feel a sentimental attachment to their wigs &mdash; which are usually a dirty looking grey colour and have not been washed since the year dot &mdash; can have them dyed black, pink or blue and continue to wear them in court?  Would that constitute wearing a wig of a different kind to that heretofore worn?</P>
    <P>Senior counsel tend to wear more <Col N="1624" /> elaborate and interesting wigs than junior counsel in that some have tassels floating behind.  Will they be perceived as wearing wigs of a kind not heretofore worn if they take a shears to the tassels but appear in the court still adorned in horsehair?  I fail to understand the need for &ldquo;a wig of the kind heretofore worn&rdquo;. Such phraseology was not necessary in the Judicial Separation Act which ensures that judges and barristers do not wear wigs.  I am conscious that many bald headed people like to wear hairpieces and the Minister may wish to ensure those who wish to wear hairpieces do not have to shove them in their pockets as they enter court.  That might cause recognition difficulties for colleagues, clients or instructing solicitors used to seeing them wearing hairpieces. It may be necessary to tease out in the legislation how we can allow people wear a hairpiece but not the type of wig that represents the 17th century in all its glory.  However, the phraseology in the Bill is rather odd and if recalcitrant members of the Bar Library, who have as much legal ingenuity in this matter as I or any other Member of this House, wish to retain their wigs, it will guarantee that the horsehair, slightly altered, will be used following the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Why does the legislation not refer to the wearing of wigs by judges?  It requires barristers to appear in court naked from the neck up, but judges will sit in court, frazzled from wearing horsehair particularly on hot summer days.  While some judges dote on their wigs and resent taking them off for family law cases, many are happy not to wear them.  Has a survey been carried out on the members of the Circuit, High and Supreme Courts to ascertain if they are taken more seriously by the public because they wear wigs?  Members of the Supreme Court in the United States do not deem it necessary to wear wigs. If barristers do not have to wear wigs, why should judges have to wear them? District justices do not wear wigs.  While some might suggest it would interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, <Col N="1625" /> the 1989 Act has worked well.  Are we to have barristers who will appear in court naked from the neck up until they become judges when once again they will reach for the horsehair?  What will that add to the judicial system?  The Minister did not explain the need for judges to continue to wear wigs.  Will they wear them in the new Court of Appeal?  Will this be a brand new, whiter than white court in which people will not wear wigs?  Will new rules of court be drawn up requiring the wearing of wigs in the Court of Appeal?  Would that not be odd at a time when we are abolishing the wearing of them by barristers? Will some Minister explain why it is deemed necessary for judges to wear wigs?</P>
    <P>While welcoming the establishment of a court of civil appeal, it is extraordinary that despite everything said about the incapacity and inadequacy of our current court system to deal with family law cases, there is no suggestion of establishing a new structure of family courts.  A working document published by the Law Reform Commission last spring described our family law courts as a sad parody of justice and recommended the formation of eight regional family courts.</P>
    <P>That report was a damning indictment of the current court system in that it claimed the system cannot cope with the volume of cases before it, the courts do not structurally provide proper facilities for dealing with family and marriage breakdown cases and an unacceptable burden is imposed on judges.  Delays of up to three years in having a judicial separation case determined for couples whose marriages have collapsed is totally unacceptable.  It may take up to three years for a battered wife to have her case heard. Judges under pressure feel the need to short circuit the hearing of cases and in some cases a system of conveyor belt justice operates in which insufficient consideration is given to difficult family problems and decisions made affecting the future welfare, not just of wives and husbands but of children, are hastily <Col N="1626" /> reached without adequate consideration. That is not acceptable.  Since taking up office the Government has been accident prone in dealing with divorce. As a prerequisite to a divorce referendum, legislation should be introduced to provide for the establishment of proper family courts with adequate back up services.  Despite all the crocodile tears shed for the plight of the victims of broken marriages it is a scandal that there is at present no back-up service provided by the welfare services to the courts system to produce family assessments when required to judges.  There is one welfare officer with the Dublin district court which deals with thousands of custody, barring and maintenance applications every year.  If at present a district judge wants a family assessment carried out to determine which parent should have custody of children in the event of a conflict, or an application for a barring order or where there is an allegation of violence, it can take a minimum of 12 months for such reports to be prepared and recommendations made to the court.  I raised that issue through questions in the past 12 months.  I was told by the Minister that she is aware of the problems and will give consideration to them.  We should not shed crocodile tears in public about these issues when we have the capacity to take action to deal with them.  The back-up service that the Judiciary want to deal with family cases should be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister said she would appoint additional judges which would help clear the backlog. It will not unless there are adequate court facilities for the hearing of cases.  It will not resolve the problem unless the judges appointed have some understanding of marriage breakdown, family law and the needs of children.  Lawyers who have appeared in criminal or personal injury cases cannot be appointed to the family courts and be expected to have an understanding or a background in social training to deal with these issues properly. This Bill should have been the <Col N="1627" /> vehicle for addressing this issue but the Government did not avail of the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Another issue I wish to raise &mdash; it is as well I made a declaration of interest &mdash; concerns a widening of the type of people from whom judicial appointments can be made.  The Bill proposes &mdash; I welcome this aspect &mdash; that it should be possible that a solicitor be appointed to the Circuit Court.  There are approximately 1,500 barristers in this State and 5,500 solicitors.  Solicitors are appointed to conduct multi-million pound arbitrations and take decisions on them.  Solicitors are appointed to preside over employment appeals tribunals and a variety of other bodies that take fundamental decisions affecting the rights of individuals.  If the Minister is finally grasping the nettle she should grasp it in full and not by halves.  The monopoly of the Law Library in the appointment of the Judiciary should not simply be dented, it should be broken. The Law Library has been operating a cartel on judicial appointments, with the support of barristers operating within one area of our Civil Service, who have a vested interest in assisting the Law Library to maintain that cartel.</P>
    <P>There is no reason it should not be possible to allow for the appointment of a solicitor as a judge, not merely to the Circuit Court but to the High Court and Supreme Court.  Obviously, people should not be appointed unless they have the ability but we should dramatically widen the pool of experienced lawyers from whom our Judiciary can be selected.  The Minister is not doing that and, if it is not done in this Bill, it will not be done for the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain a provision in the Bill I do not understand. She said there will be special training for judges.  I expressed the view many times that those who wish to practise in marital and family cases should have some background expertise and training.  Where will the Minister provide this training?  Will it be provided in the universities?  Are aspirant barristers <Col N="1628" /> to be asked to indicate if they would like to be judges and be sent off to participate in courses?  Who will conduct the courses?  Where will they take place? What will be their duration?  In what areas of law will they be conducted? None of those questions was answered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The final issue I wish to mention briefly concerns the Attorney General's office.  I am unhappy at the level of political vitriol and character assassination that has formed part of our politics over the past few weeks.  It seems it is open season at present to assassinate the characters of individuals.  Perhaps the need to do so is heightened by by-election fever.  It seems there have been problems in regard to the Attorney General's office that did not begin with the incumbent but go back a long way. That office is yet another Law Library monopoly, is unwieldy in the manner in which it operates and too slow in dealing with matters.  There is no reason recruitment of legal personnel to that office should also be confined to qualified barristers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a radical overhaul of the Office of the Attorney General regardless of what person happens to be its incumbent.  There is a need, as happens in other countries, to ensure that a forum is provided, so that whoever happens to be the incumbent must give an account of the running of that office to Members of this House to whom he or she should be politically responsible. The way that office operates at present is not satisfactory.  Many years ago when Declan Costello, now a High Court judge, was a Member of this House the position was different.  We need to ensure that if the Attorney General is not a Member of this House there is a mechanism which allows him or her to account to this House for the functioning of the Office of the Attorney General.  The way we deal with this at present is undemocratic and entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin where Deputy Shatter left off by referring to <Col N="1629" /> the Office of the Attorney General.  I share with him a certain disgust at the manner in which the present holder of that office has been subjected to unfair attacks in this House by Members who should know better.  They have been Members of this House long enough to know the rules of fair behaviour, especially when people are not present to defend themselves.  I was disappointed, but not surprised, by Deputy O'Malley's attack on the holder of that office.</P>
      <P>It is easy to state that were the Attorney General to do what certain people asked, to resign from office, he would be letting down future holders of that office.</P>
      <P>He has been very courageous in remaining in office.  He must have been tempted many times to say to his wife and family that he has had enough of this and decide to return to general practice.  He has not done so because he realised that whatever he might do would set a precedent.  I have nothing but the highest praise for the manner in which he courageously withstood many unfair attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill may well be one lawyers will feel happy debating since its provisions fall within their bailiwick.  I speak as a layman reflecting what I believe to be the views of the ordinary people about the legal profession.  Some years ago I took part in a debate with law students. The former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, then the President of the High Court, also participated.  In my naïvety I contended that the law should be subservient to justice, that justice was the most important thing but Mr. Justice Finlay suggested that justice always must be subservient to the law, that it was a matter for the legislators to draft the laws which the Judiciary could implement.  Citizens of any State want justice to be seen to be done.  Something that disgusted the people of this entire nation, including many within the legal profession, was the size of the fees &mdash; far in excess of what the State expected it would have to pay out &mdash; accepted by certain members of the legal profession, <Col N="1630" /> people engaged in deciding what those in other areas of public service should be getting.  I refer specifically to the beef tribunal.  Had I been a lawyer entitled, under the arrangement I had made, to accept £1 million, it would not have cost me very much from the point of view of being a credit to my profession to say that £.5 million would be sufficient and to forgo the other half.  People who accepted those fees did not do themselves or their profession any good.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a member of the legal profession not so long ago who said that years ago, when the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was in office he had suggested to him that the State should pay lawyers' fees and that the litigants should pay their fees to the State.  I felt this was something that the public would welcome and I mentioned it recently to the Minister for Justice in the course of a brief conversation which was not a specific approach to her about this.  Her answer was that this would probably cost the State more.  I do not think so.  If generous fees were set by the State it would still be nothing like the fees which certain top members of the profession expect as their right. Private citizens have no protection when it comes to legal fees.  A company which is involved in a legal action can treat fees as part of its overheads. However, a private citizen who is caught up in litigation has no such relief and this is something that should be addressed, particularly where a private citizen cannot come up with the fees expected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that solicitors might be appointed as judges in the Circuit Court and possibly in higher courts.  The late Arthur Cox was renowned throughout Ireland as the expert in company law.  What a judge that man would have made.  There are other solicitors at the top of their profession who would make excellent judges, particularly if they were to concentrate on their area of expertise.  This is something the Minister should examine in greater detail.  She should not <Col N="1631" /> necessarily confine solicitors to being appointed to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>We need courts that sit at night, particularly District Courts to deal with motoring offences.  We are all aware of the danger on our roads from motorists. I am a motorist and drive probably in excess of 400 miles a week so I know what it is like to have one's life constantly put at risk by people who break the speed limits.  In order to have such cases heard quickly we should have night courts as they do in the United States.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the conduct of some district justices.  Not everyone appeals a district justice's verdict; people very often accept the result. However, where someone feels he should take it further he can appeal and the verdict may be overturned.  There have been district justices who have had a record number of their judgments overturned &mdash; I have in mind a particular individual who is no longer a district justice.  Such justices should be dismissed, having shown themselves to be incompetent.  Perhaps there is something quietly happening in this regard that we do not know about.</P>
    <P>I was amused by Deputy Shatter's comments about wigs.  He wondered if a lawyer who removes the tassels from his wig might be deemed not to be wearing the wig he had been wearing heretofore. I am sorry I did not interrupt to suggest that a wig without tassels might be called a &ldquo;tasstrated&rdquo; wig.  However, I agree with what he said about the horsehair.  We should go the whole way and have judges also dispense with the wearing of wigs.  We are a republic. People have respect for the law and I do not think that dispensing with wigs will make people less fearful of the judge's verdict.  There should be more to justice than formality.</P>
    <P>We have a reasonably good Judiciary but the public perception is that they are somewhat over-protected by the Garda and otherwise and do not really know the depredations the ordinary person has to suffer because of lack of <Col N="1632" /> security.  People often feel that criminals are treated leniently.  Perhaps there is some way in which the judges could be more in touch with people.  If people feel they are not getting justice they will take the law into their own hands.  That is something I have always feared.  It is one of the worst things that can happen to a society.  We have seen the beginnings of this in some flats complexes in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will speed up the process of the law.  I am glad there is to be an appeal court.  At present it takes far too long to deal with the cases of people who feel they have been wrongly convicted.  This new appeal court system will be welcomed. It is a good idea to have people, not necessarily lawyers, on the judicial commission which is to play a role in the appointment of judges.  That removes a good deal of onus from the Government of the day.  The system has served us well.  We do not have so many deviant judges, although I am sure there are a few.  A society cannot be without some and judges would not claim they do not exist.  Generally, the standard of person appointed has been very high and we can be proud of that.  It is evident when members of Bar associations from other countries visit.  Members of the Irish Bar always turn out in good numbers to greet them and acquit themselves well. They are held in high esteem by lawyers abroad.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.  It is important that matters like this are discussed in the House and Deputies who represent the ordinary people are given an opportunity to express their opinions.  I hope they will be considered before the Bill is enacted. This Bill would not have been introduced at this time but for the difficulties the Government encountered a few weeks ago in regard to the appointment of the President of the High Court and the role of the Attorney General in that. I am annoyed and disappointed about what happened.  I am sure 90 per cent <Col N="1633" /> of the people, have a high regard for the Judiciary.  That standard can only be maintained as long as there is respect for the system and the people who operate it.  Ninety per cent of people will never see the inside of a courthouse nor would they wish to, but problems must be dealt with.  People must go to court to have matters which may not be related to law and order decided on by a judge.  Most people are happy with the hearing they get in court and the decisions handed down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has caused a great deal of annoyance and disappointment and it casts a reflection on the people involved.  It is proper that reference should be made to this, it is going to give rise to a case.  I accept the Chair's ruling on the matter, but I am not alone in my disappointment on how this controversial matter was handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judicial system has worked well and, by and large, people are happy with it, but the cost of going to court is <Col N="1634" /> prohibitive.  People may feel they must go to court to have matters resolved but the cost may be prohibitive.  Some in the middle to higher income groups are well off and can afford to pay and those in the lower income group are entitled to free legal aid.  However, the majority of taxpayers do not qualify for free legal aid and they are afraid to go to court to settle matters they and their families consider important because of the enormous costs involved.  A standard fee should be set.  People who go to their solicitor may be advised that the services of a barrister were necessary and that may cost a four figure sum.  One wonders whether the high costs awarded in some cases arise because of fees charged by barristers or from researching the background of the case. The setting of standard fees would allay the fears of many.</P>
    <P>The costs involved in the beef tribunal would scare people seeking redress in the courts into settling.  That is not good enough.  Access to the judicial system should be available to everyone, but that is not the position at present.  However, it could be easily rectified. My salary is well known as is the Minister's and the recent increase awarded to Members were widely discussed. The issue of whether they were justified is a matter for another debate. A standard fee should be set for barristers so that people would be aware of the expenses they are likely to incur. They should not have to mortgage their houses to pay such fees.</P>
    <P>I understand that initially wigs were worn to protect the identity of barristers and judges who defended or acted on behalf of people who might take revenge.  In the present climate of peace I hope that day is long past.  It is not necessary for barristers to wear a wig to protect their identity when defending or prosecuting.  It is time to move forward and recognise that legal practitioners are ordinary people who should mix with the general public.  The perception among the public is that legal practitioners are aloof and removed from the reality of life.  The banner headlines <Col N="1635" /> in the media given to high awards, may lead people to think that the judge in question was not familiar with the case and that he was out of touch with reality, but that is not true.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the courthouses in County Cavan.  Some are used as meeting places or by politicians to hold clinics. They are cold buildings and people do not spend much time in them.  The small courthouses in towns and villages of rural Ireland are not suitable for holding court hearings.  Many do not have toilet facilities or heating and the paint is peeling off the walls.  It is time that position was rectified and it would not cost an enormous sum of money.  If we are serious about providing a suitable place for a judge, practitioners and witnesses it is time this was brought to the attention of the Minister.  Given the small outlay involved courthouses should be properly maintained.  I get the impression they are being allowed deteriorate like other rural businesses, such as post offices and so on.  Judges have refused to sit in some courthouses with the result that the system of justice is being moved from people who must pay the cost of travelling to larger towns.  Courts should be held in local courthouses.  It is time that matter was addressed.  The vast majority of people have a high regard for the Judiciary and for law and order.  Only a small number is involved in crime and there should be an adequate legal system to deal with the problem.  There should be institutions where these people are trained and rehabilitated in preparation for their return to society.  The reason many people are regularly involved in crime is that they have no job and are at a loss as to where to turn to make a decent start in life again.  The judicial system should provide proper training centres and places of detention for these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely legislation. The Bill covers three main areas: the courts, the Judiciary and legal costs. <Col N="1636" /> As has been well ventilated by previous speakers, these matters need to be addressed.  The appointment of a judicial commission, promised in the Programme for Government, is a necessary move.  The purpose of the commission will be to advise the Minister and the Government on the organisation and management of courts and court services and such other matters which, in the opinion of the Minister or the commission, have a bearing on the capacity of the courts to discharge their functions.</P>
      <P>Every Member knows there are areas which need urgent attention by the Minister.  For example, in the area of court accommodation &mdash; I am sure every Member has experience of lack of accommodation in their constituencies &mdash; most accommodation is appalling.  In some areas there are no proper consultation rooms for litigants.  With the volume of family law cases coming before the courts, bearing in mind the upcoming divorce referendum, there is great pressure on our courts and court facilities. The traditional courtroom atmosphere is not appropriate to deal with family law matters.  Privacy is necessary, but this is not provided in many courthouses built early this century or in the middle of the last.  A major investment is needed by the Department of Justice to upgrade facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the 1935 Act the maintenance and provision of courthouse accommodation was the responsibility of local government, but that position was changed in the 1990 Act.  I am concerned about the lack of investment in this area by the Department of Justice. Certainly the commitment is there but a huge capital investment is necessary to bring courthouse accommodation in most rural areas up to an acceptable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for the major investment in Carlow courthouse. It was needed for a long time and is very welcome.  I compliment the Department of Justice on ensuring that facilities are put in place for disabled people.  I am sure we all recall courthouses with steps <Col N="1637" /> up to the front door, to which people with disabilities were unable to gain access.</P>
    <P>Since the removal of rates in the mid-1970s expenditure on courthouses has been almost exclusively provided by the Department of Justice and central funds rather than by local authorities.  Confusion about who is responsible for this matter has resulted in it not being a priority at central or local government. Legal personnel who practise in our courts, members of the Judiciary and the Garda Síochána who attend court, frequently make complaints, not only to me but to other Members of the House, about the lack of accommodation and back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>There is a great case to be made for training judges &mdash; I compliment the President of the District Court in this regard.  Judges appointed to the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court may have specialised in a particular area of law and it is important that they have a broad view of the problems experienced in all areas of court work.  The Minister for Justice has acknowledged that she will address the matter of training and I hope she will have the cooperation of the Judiciary in that regard.</P>
    <P>Civil litigation is an extremely slow process, one normally has to wait two to three years before one can bring proceedings to the High Court.  I know of cases where individuals died while awaiting hearing of their case by the High Court, and that is unacceptable.  In the Bill the Minister proposes to appoint extra judges.  This is timely and will go some way towards reducing the backlog of cases pending.  Sometimes cases are delayed because judges are not immediately available to hear them and in other instances cases have to be postponed due to lack of courtroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the judicial system in one area, that is the discrepancies in sentencing.  Legal representatives sometimes advise clients of the sentences they may expect from particular judges. There are considerable inconsistencies <Col N="1638" /> in the sentences imposed by different judges of the same court.  It is obvious that circumstances differ from case to case, but if there is no general consistency or uniformity in sentencing the system will be brought into disrepute.  This problem may be addressed by training judges.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider introducing greater flexibility regarding the location of court hearings.  During renovation of the courthouse in Carlow the District Court was transferred to a local hotel and compliments were paid by all concerned in this move.  Under existing law, court cases need not be heard in courthouses.  This matter should be considered by the Minister in her overall review of the courts system.  Flexibility should be shown by the Judiciary in the location of family law hearings in particular, which may be heard in any reasonable accommodation.  The important thing is that justice is done.</P>
    <P>Legislation may be introduced to provide for divorce and this would result in a large increase in the number of family law cases.  Family courts should be made more user friendly given that at some stage children would be involved.  A court of law may sit in any room and in any type of accommodation, provided that the law is administered properly by the right personnel.  Our paramount interest should be to facilitate citizens so that justice can be meted out in any type of reasonable accommodation without all the trappings.</P>
    <P>A little common sense might be usefully employed in regard to the Special Criminal Court.  I note that a figure of £500,000 was included in the Department's Vote for last year and the year before to meet the cost of transferring prisoners from Portlaoise to Dublin.  In many instances this causes disruption for motorists and many hearings end in an adjournment.  I fail to see why the courthouse in Portlaoise cannot be used.  It might be better to bring the judges and counsel to Portlaoise to hear these cases.  We could make better use of the time and money involved.</P>
    <P>At present cases heard in the Circuit <Col N="1639" /> Court can be appealed to the High Court.  We will have to address this matter as it does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We should re-examine the system we have inherited from the British.  We should introduce a new court structure which should be informal and accessible 24 hours a day in urban centres &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Galway and, perhaps, Limerick &mdash; to deal with cases involving serious crime, without any of the trappings lawyers and judges have sought to add to the system during the years.  My colleague, Deputy Briscoe, raised this matter earlier and it should be seriously considered by the Department.  This new court structure should be far simpler and more easily understood by the public.</P>
    <P>On the question of the backlog of cases the appointment of extra judges will be of help in alleviating this problem. In some areas there is a delay of two to three years.  This is not good enough.  The Department has indicated that the reason for the backlog is the huge number of personal injury claims. An interesting statistic is that 93 per cent of such cases never end up in court as many claims are settled on the steps of the courthouse.  We must tackle this problem as many genuine cases cannot be heard because of the backlog.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed the question of legal costs in the Bill in the provisions dealing with the Taxing Master. The beef tribunal may have diverted attention from the courts in this regard but there is no harm in the Minister providing for some control over costs.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that a little common sense might be usefully employed in reforming the court system. I welcome the Minister's announcement that barristers will no longer be permitted to wear wigs in court.  This is common sense.  In this regard court facilities should be made more user friendly.  This is but one step and much more needs to be done.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this <Col N="1640" /> opportunity to address the House on the Courts and Court Officers Bill which I hope will reform the legal system. It is beyond doubt that the time has come to reshape our court structure.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Shatter, I should make a declaration of interest as I am a member of the Law Library.  I have listened carefully to comments about the mode of dress.  I have no problem with section 41 which prohibits barristers and solicitors from wearing wigs.  In a recent survey carried out by the Bar Council I indicated that I was in favour of the removal of wigs and the retention of the gown.  Under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 wigs are not worn in family law proceedings and under section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 judges, barristers and solicitors are not allowed to wear either wigs or gowns in the examination of witnesses, particularly by television link.</P>
      <P>In all the years I have been practising at the Bar not one plaintiff or defendant has mentioned the mode of dress.  I always thought that some reference would be made to the anachronistic horse hair which bedecked a barrister's head.  I am amused therefore that such attention is being paid to court dress by Members, given that there are other more important and far reaching provisions which will make a major contribution in the development of our legal system and court structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the new Court of Appeal which embraces both criminal and civil jurisdictions is an important development since it will go some way to lighten the heavy workload of the Supreme Court.  The large number of appeals to the Supreme Court has led to the list being clogged.  A large number of the appeals concern personal injury cases.  A corollary of the large increase in the number of appeals to the Supreme Court has been considerable delays in hearing cases.  Some Members referred to the possibility of an infringement of the right of final appeal to the Supreme Court.  From my reading of the <Col N="1641" /> Bill it is clear that the appellant jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is derived from the Constitution and its status on matters of law under the provisions of the Constitution is maintained.  I do not see a constitutional attack on its jurisdiction. The right of appeal to the Supreme Court on matters of exceptional public importance will be retained.</P>
    <P>Section 29 permits the Minister to set up on a statutory basis a judicial commission to be known as the Courts Commission and I hope this will effectively manage and organise the courts. Because of the primacy in our Constitution of the right of access to our courts, it is important that every effort be made to ensure the people have an uninhibited right of access to the courts. Has the Minister given any thought to the composition of the commission as it will have a very important role?</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan referred to the standard of courthouse accommodation and I hope the Courts Commission will examine this.  Some of the available accommodation is certainly substandard. Nowhere is this more evident than when the number of family law cases heard in the Circuit Court increases. Should certain other events take place in 1995 there will be a further increase in the number of family court cases.  It is important that the Courts Commission pay particular attention to the provision of proper accommodation. That right is as important to the litigant as any other aspect of access to the courts.  Very often in family law cases the consultation takes place outside the building in the rain or in a crowded hallway. Couples who have already been through the mediation and conciliation process arrive in an environment where privacy should be the prime factor, yet husband and wife are within feet of each other with their respective solicitors and counsel trying to take instructions on custody, property rights and the judicial separation itself.  That will have to be tackled and adequate provision made to improve and increase the number of courthouses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is anachronistic that the responsibility for courthouses still rests with local authorities.  The local authority is expected to raise money by means of commercial rates, service charges or other means to try to repair and maintain courthouses.  It is time the Department of Justice took full responsibility in that regard, and not leave this matter in the hands of local authorities who are strapped for cash.  The Minister is aware that orders of <i>mandamus</i> have been sought and given on the standard of courthouses to force repaires of same. Some judges have refused to sit in substandard courthouses and I certainly do not blame them for that.  The public is entitled to proper surroundings to ventilate a case.</P>
    <P>I hope the membership of the Courts Commission will reflect the make up of society and not be confined to members of the legal profession.  The expertise of other professions is important to ensure the effective functioning of the commission. The Minister's commitment to flexibility, and to reflecting the widest spectrum of society is welcome. Members have spoken of their desire to divorce the operation of the courts from the function of the Department of Justice and vest them in an independent administrative commission and it will be interesting to see the proposals the Courts Commission bring forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board cannot and should not interfere with the appointment process in so far as the Government is obliged by Article 35.1 of the Constitution to put forward the names of persons to the President.  The brouhaha surrounding recent proposed appointments give impetus to finding an acceptable method of selecting candidates for appointment to judical office. The setting up of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board introduces a new and transparent procedure to appointments to judicial office.  The present system for selecting persons for appointment to judicial office has served us well <Col N="1643" /> and the integrity, fairness and independence of the Judiciary is above reproach.  The board will identify suitable candidates for appointment to the Judiciary and make recommendations to the Government on such appointments. This ensures that the formal act of appointing judges remains in the hands of the Executive as decreed by the Constitution but removes from the Executive the task of identifying candidates for appointment.  In order that this provision has effect the Government will have to undertake to abide by the recommendations of the board.  This is not the first time a committee has been established to put forward names of suitable candidates for appointment as there is a very clear procedure set out in section 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which establishes a committee to select suitable candidates for appointment as Director of Public Prosecutions. There is already a clear precedent in this regard.  Article 6 of the Constitution sets out the separation of powers and I have heard various references to this important cornerstone of our democracy.  The appointment of judges is based on merit and the removal of any basis for allegations, however spurious, that political affiliation is the sole determinant of appointment represents an important advance and reinforces the separation of powers.</P>

    <P>Claims by the Taoiseach that he had no involvement in his family business during a period when £1.1 million was invested in the company in exchange for two Irish passports by a mother and son from the Middle East are at the heart of <Col N="1644" /> the cause of this Bill being brought before the House by Fine Gael.</P>

    <P> (a)  corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to the affairs or business of his Department, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour in relation to such affairs or business; or</P>
    <P>(b)  corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to the affairs or business of the State, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the affairs or business of the State;</P>
    <P>(c)  knowingly uses with intent to <Col N="1645" />  deceive the Head of his Department any receipt, account or other document in respect of which his Department is interested, and which contains any statement which is false or erroneous or defective in any material particular, and which to his knowledge is intended to mislead.  </P>
    <P>Where it is proved that any money, gift, or other consideration has been received by a person holding an office remunerated out of the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas, from a person or agent of a person, holding or seeking to obtain a contract from a Government Department, the same shall be deemed to have been received corruptly as such inducement or reward as is mentioned in the Acts, unless the contrary is proved. </P>
    <P>The penalties under the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act, 1889, are as follows:</P>
    <P>Any person on conviction for offending as aforesaid shall, at the discretion of the court before which he is convicted, (a) be liable to be imprisoned for any period not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour, or to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds, or to both such imprisonment and such fine, and (b) in addition be liable to be ordered to pay to such body, and in such manner as the court directs, the amount or value of any gift, loan fee or reward received by him or any part thereof; and (c) be liable to be adjudged incapable of being elected or appointed to any public office for seven years from the date of his conviction, and to forfeit any such office held by him at the time of his conviction; and (d) in the event of a second conviction for a like offence shall, in addition to the foregoing penalties, be liable to be adjudged to be forever incapable of holding any public office and to be incapable for seven years of being registered as an elector, or <Col N="1646" /> voting at an election either of members to serve in Parliament or of members of any public body, and the enactments for preventing the voting and registration of persons declared by reason of corrupt practices to be incapable of voting shall apply to a person adjudged in pursuance of this section to be incapable of voting, and (e) if such person is an officer or servant in the employ of any public body upon such conviction he shall, at the discretion of the court, be liable to forfeit his right and claim to any compensation or pension to which he would otherwise have been entitled.</P>
    <P>It might be noted, in passing, that section 4 (1) states that a prosecution for an offence under this Act shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I make no allegation of criminal activity by anybody but I bring this law to the attention of the House to illustrate the seriousness of the situation. It is not a matter to be considered lightly.</P>
    <P>I wish to give a hypothetical set of circumstances as an example.  A future Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach could be a major shareholder in a private company and his friend and colleague, a future Secretary of the Department of the Environment, could write to the Secretary of the Department of Justice stating that he intimately knows a Middle Eastern woman and her son who, it turns out, are investing £1.1 million in the aforementioned private company.  As a result the applicants are granted passports.</P>
    <P>What would happen when those facts became known?  The three departmental secretaries would immediately be dismissed and brought before the courts under the legislation to which I referred earlier.  Why should Ministers receive a pat on the back, immediate exoneration and allowed to continue on their merry way?  Are some citizens above the law by virtue of their Dáil majority while everybody else must comply with it? This is the nub of the question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> The Bill being given a Second Reading contains proposals which provide that: (a) the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice to grant citizenship in return for financial investment would be ended; (b) any person aggrieved by a decision of the Minister for Justice would have the right of appeal to an appeals tribunal who could (i) affirm the decision of the Minister, (ii) set aside the decision and refer the matter back for the Minister's consideration, (iii) set aside the decision of the Minister and grant the application or revoke the certificate of naturalisation as the case may be; (c) the Minister would lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas rules, criteria and forms for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation and (d) the Public Offices Commission (as proposed by the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994) would (i) annually in arrears review the granting of certificates of naturalisation for investment and report its finding to Dáil Éireann and (ii) report to Dáil Éireann on every decision made by the Minister under the business migration scheme to grant a certificate of naturalisation at any time over the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>I will highlight public concerns in relation to granting passports to &ldquo;investors&rdquo; in a company owned by the Taoiseach and close relatives of the Taoiseach and in which he had an ongoing interest while he was a Minister.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the up-to-date accounts for C &amp; D Foods Ltd., have not been lodged with the Companies Office.  The last accounts lodged there are for the year ended 31 December 1991.  This is a significant point since any &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in the company during 1992 would be shown in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 1992 and future years.</P>
    <P>Also, the up-to-date accounts would show whether a £300,000 shareholders' loan shown in the previous accounts had been refunded in full or in part.  What is <Col N="1648" /> being concealed by the non-lodgement of these accounts?  On two different dates the company made lodgements at the Companies Office and had the opportunity to lodge its accounts on the same dates.  On 30 May 1994 an amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of Association was lodged and on 13 July 1994 a change of address of a director was lodged yet no accounts were lodged on either occasion even though stiff penalties now apply to the non-lodgement of accounts.  What is in the accounts for year ended 31 December 1992 and following years that cannot be lodged at this time?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the directors' report with the accounts for the year ended 31 December 1991 which was lodged is in compliance with the law.  The report was signed on 28 April 1992 and any significant events since the end of the financial year should have been referred to in the directors' report.  There was no mention of the £1.1 million received from the Masris in that directors' report even though, the &ldquo;investment&rdquo; was advanced in March 1992, according to the Minister for Justice, and the Masris were introduced in September 1991, according to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 June 1994.  Why has a company in which the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, has 164,000 ordinary shares, as per the Companies Office file, not lodged accounts for year ended 31 December 1992 and year ended 31 December 1993?  I am advised that these should have been lodged, by law, by 31 July 1993 and 28 June 1994 respectively. What does the Minister for Enterprise and Employment have to say about this situation?</P>
    <P>Why did the Masris, good citizens one presumes, invest in a company which does not file its accounts?  In 1992 some 5,607 companies were struck off for failure to return their accounts.  In 1993 the figure was 7,465.  Why was no action taken against C &amp; D Foods Ltd?  In <Col N="1649" /> November 1993 there were over 40 prosecutions of directors for overdue returns.</P>
    <P>Until 19 December 1991 when there were changes in the ownership of the ordinary shares in C &amp; D Foods Ltd., 80 per cent were held by the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and 20 per cent by Mrs. Kathleen Reynolds, that is 100 per cent between them.  Thereafter the shareholding was Albert Reynolds Senior, 41 per cent, Kathleen Reynolds, 10 per cent &mdash; between them 51 per cent &mdash; Albert Reynolds Junior, 10 per cent and Philip Reynolds, 39 per cent.  It is clear from this that the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, continued to have a controlling interest in C &amp; D Foods Ltd. There is no record in the Companies Office that stamp duty was ever paid on these share transfers, if due.  It could be reasonably claimed that Deputy Reynolds, Minister and Taoiseach, remained a shadow director of the company.</P>
    <P>Shadow director is defined in section 27 of the Companies Act, 1990 which states: &ldquo;a person in accordance with whose direction or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;a shadow director&rdquo;) shall be treated for the purposes of this Part as a director of the company unless the directors are accustomed so to act by reason only that they do so on advice given by him in a professional capacity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>According to Mr. Maalouf, a spokesman for the Masris, quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 4 June 1994, the company would not agree to give the Masris equity so the family had to lend the money on the basis of an interest, i.e. dividend, of about 5 per cent each year and an option to take shares in 1997 if the money cannot be repaid.  The members or shareholders are the company. I have already illustrated who they are &mdash; the Taoiseach and his family. That statement by Mr. Maalouf has <Col N="1650" /> not been refuted &mdash; and I know the Taoiseach's propensity for writs.</P>
    <P>A sterling investment of £1.1 million at the end of February 1992 would have attracted quoted interest rates of 11.75 per cent to 12 per cent.  An insurance company might have given a high rate return bond of 13 per cent.  C &amp; D Foods Ltd., not only received a loan of £1.1 million at a rate of 5 per cent which it could invest in its business to make profits but it also received a subsidy on interest rates at that time in excess of 7 per cent.  This subsidy was worth about £77,000 per year each year for five years, on top of the use of the capital at 5 per cent.  It is clear who benefited from these transactions &mdash; the owners of the company.  Yet what we have received so far, to paraphrase Disraeli, are lies, damn lies and no current statistics.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, absolved those involved before he saw the files.  He was then put under pressure and sent for the files in early June 1994, again absolving all those involved. Did the Tánaiste look at the Companies Office files?  These are available to the public in an office under the aegis of his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  What do that Minister and the Tánaiste have to say about the state of the company's file and the absence of information which the public are entitled to and which directly relates to the passports purchased by the Masris?</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions which need to be answered.  Did the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, know of the &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in his business of £1.1 million in exchange for two passports?  When did he find out?  Did he, while Minister, involve himself in the affairs of C &amp; D Foods Ltd?  If he did, would a fair and reasonable assessment be that he behaved at all times as the proprietor and as a &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo;? Did Ministers take the decision without knowing the name of the company in which the investment was to be made?  If they knew the name of the <Col N="1651" /> company, what steps did they take to ensure that the whole procedure was done at arms length and with transparency? Why was the IDA not asked to assess this investment?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, stated that he knew the applicants &ldquo;intimately&rdquo;.  How long did he know them and how was he in a position to make such a statement?  Did they tell him the good news of their investment in his colleague's company, C &amp; D Foods Ltd?  Did the Minister for the Environment, or any Minister involved, foresee the possible conflict of interest and controversy that this decision would cause if found out and what steps did they take to ensure that the transaction was transparent, at arms length and seen to be at arms length?  Were any laws broken?  Were any guidelines or procedures broken which were laid down by the Department of Finance or other Departments?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach, as the major shareholder in C &amp; D Foods Ltd. direct that the accounts for the years ended 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1993, and up to date accounts, and any version of these accounts prepared but not made public so far, be made public so that the company law requirements are met and this matter can be independently examined?</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is awaiting his long promised appointment to the High Court.  All gardaí from the rank of superintendent upwards depend on the Government for promotion in their careers.  What we have before us is a politically sensitive issue which involves the Head of Government.</P>
    <P>In the next jurisdiction, a senior police officer from an outside region can be called in, as happened when Mr. John Stalker was appointed to investigate certain matters in Northern Ireland.  It is not acceptable for the Government or any member of it to say from a cursory examination of one file that all is well. What did the Tánaiste expect to find on the file?  I make no allegation of criminal offence nor do I convict anybody of <Col N="1652" /> wrongdoing, but the Opposition must seek answers to questions which are properly in the public realm.  We must continue to do our duty in seeking a full and frank explanation of these transactions.</P>
    <P>A Stalker-type examiner must be found, one who is above any question as to his or her ability, probity and independence. Perhaps Mr. Stalker, the recently retired Chief Justice or the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General would be a good choice.  Someone of that stature must make an independent and fair assessment of these transactions to assist the Public Offices Commission referred to earlier and make their findings public.  If the Opposition cannot find the Government guilty, the Government equally cannot find itself innocent.  We must have an independent examination of these facts.  Fine Gael does not accept that a member or members of Government should be allowed, behind closed doors, to absolve a colleague whose family business gained substantially from a decision, also taken behind closed doors, to grant citizenship to persons who clearly have no other connection with this country.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the rules for granting citizenship to investors were softened at some stage over recent years.  It was up to the Department of Justice to check with other State agencies, such as the IDA, as to the appropriateness of any investment made.  This was not done in the case of C &amp; D Foods Ltd.  The Minister was merely made aware of the fact that &ldquo;the overall project in C &amp; D Foods Ltd. was IDA granted&rdquo; according to &ldquo;inquiries made through the consultant who submitted the application&rdquo;, as stated in reply to a parliamentary question in my name on 15 June, 1994.  What competent authority decided independently that this investment was in the public interest? This is a central question which has not been replied to.</P>
    <P>In the cases in question, the passports were issued for payment of £600,000 and £500,000 respectively despite the Minister for Justice in several interviews <Col N="1653" /> and in replies to parliamentary questions on 9 March 1994 stating that the investment required for a passport was of the order of £1 million.  The address of the applicants given in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was simply &ldquo;Haddington Road&rdquo;&mdash; not even a number was given.  The Minister had already informed the Dáil, in reply to a parliamentary question on 9 March 1994, that &ldquo;purchasing a home and living here&rdquo; were criteria which had to be observed if a passport were to be granted under this scheme.  On 15 June 1994 she told the Dáil in response to a parliamentary question that &ldquo;an investment of about £500,000 would be required and that the applicants would demonstrate an intention of residing in the State by purchasing a residence&rdquo;. Why were procedures &ldquo;softened&rdquo; and when?  Why were passports awarded to Mrs. Masri and her son as stated by the Minister for Justice when, as reported at columns 854 and 855 of the Official Report of 31 May 1994, &ldquo;the husband of the woman and father of the man who had made the aforementioned investments had purchased a residence in Dublin&rdquo;?  Not only did those who were granted the passports not live here, they did not even own a residence here, if this reply is correct.</P>
    <P>On 31 May 1994 the Minister told the House &mdash; column 857 of the Official Report &mdash; that the owner of the residence had subsequently invested £1.5 million in forestry and on that basis she was prepared to grant him naturalisation. At the time of granting naturalisation on 15 December 1992 it would appear that Mrs. Masri and her son did not meet the criterion of owning a home here let alone residing here.  On 31 May 1994 the Minister told the Dáil &mdash; column 856 &mdash; that the owner of the house, Mr. Masri senior, had applied for naturalisation, again through Minister Smith, in October 1993 but was routinely turned down on the basis that he would not meet the criterion as he would have to make a separate investment, which he later did.  He could have sold the apartment at any time without consulting his wife or son.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> In addition, the public is entitled to know how the Minister for the Environment intimately knew a family who do not live here and why he recommended them for citizenship.  I have tried to raise this matter in the Dáil but the Ceann Comhairle, by way of letter to me, ruled the question out of order since it contains argument.  I have the opportunity tonight to put my questions. Why was Minister Smith, a Deputy from North Tipperary, involved in an investment in Longford?  How well and for how long did he know these investors?  Did he make any further representations, verbal or otherwise, to the Minister who made the decision?  Was he asked to do so by a colleague, the then Minister and later Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, or any member of his family?  Minister Smith has been a close ally and friend of the Taoiseach for many years.  Are we to understand that he recommended these investors in the Taoiseach's family business without mentioning to him that he had done so? Minister Smith owes this House a detailed explanation.  It is scandalous that he has not come into the House to explain himself.  Has the Tánaiste interviewed him as part of his examination &ldquo;of the procedures followed&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The investors in C &amp; D Foods Limited do not appear to have received shares in the company.  How then can this money be described as an investment? Do they have representation on the board of the company?  If not, how do they protect their interests?  Did the Tánaiste ask the Taoiseach if he knew the application was being made given that he owned the company?  Did the Tánaiste ask him if he stood to benefit from this investment now or in future? These questions must be answered and the matter impartially investigated given that the decision appears to have been made by Ministers only.  The role played in this process by the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Justice, Commissioner Flynn, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, must <Col N="1655" /> be examined and reported on by an acceptable independent source.</P>
    <P>In May 1994 the Minister for Justice stated on television that the investment was made in 1990.  The Dáil has been told that the financial controller of the Taoiseach's family firm stated that the investment was made in 1992, after the Taoiseach's appointment.  The Minister for Justice stated that this matter was not dealt with in Cabinet.  At the end of May 1994 the former Minister for Justice, Commissioner Flynn, was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as suggesting that the matter was dealt with by Cabinet and, on radio on 30 May 1994 the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, relied on Commissioner Flynn's assertion, and said the Dáil had already been informed.</P>
    <P>In a document read in the record of the House on 31 May 1994 &mdash; columns 881 and 882 &mdash; which exposed the contents of a document circulated to international &ldquo;investors&rdquo; by an international lawyer seeking &ldquo;investors&rdquo; it was made clear that: &ldquo;The project is so structured that it is for the Government's economic advisers, and not the investors, to source and select a suitable investment that conforms to the Government's job creation criteria&rdquo;.  If the criteria stated in this document are correct, which Government economic adviser examined this &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in C &amp; D Foods Ltd?  These questions must be answered and investigated by an independent and impartial source.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is proposing that the Public Offices Commission be empowered by law to review this decision to grant passports, and every other decision over the past 15 years.  However, the political sensitivity of this particular case is such that the Commission should be assisted by an independent examiner in determining the facts.  Given Labour Party claims to stand for high standards in public office, I feel certain that it will support these proposals and the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste examined the <Col N="1656" /> Masri file he will not have found details of the following extract from a book written by Mr. Tim Ryan, a biographer of the Taoiseach.  This extract is not only relevant but alarming and, if its contents are sustained, it has the most serious consequences for the continuation in office of the Taoiseach.  The following extract is from pages 64, 65 and 66 of that book:</P>
    <P>In the summer of 1982 Spence finally initiated legal action against C &amp; D for his shares.</P>
    <P>A lot of correspondence was exchanged between both sides, although Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach claimed on 30 May 1994 that he &ldquo;had not been involved in any way in the running of the company for up to fourteen years&rdquo;.  (In his evidence to the Beef Tribunal, Albert Reynolds said he came back to government in 1987 &ldquo;having spent four years in opposition, having spent four years developing my own business, which is very allied to this business that we are talking about...&rdquo; (<i>Tribunal Report</i>, Chapter 6 page 206-207.)</P>
    <P>In a speech in Portlaoise in June 1994 the now Taoiseach said he had &ldquo;as required an arm's length relationship with that company (C &amp; D), since I took up ministerial office, so I cannot be accountable for and have no knowledge of its day-to-day business&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 28 June 1982, while Minister for Industry and Commerce, Albert Reynolds, however, wrote to Spence telling him he had &ldquo;not produced the sales needed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a detailed letter he pointed out that capacity would increase two or three fold when a new factory &mdash; to be grant-aided by the IDA &mdash; was completed.</P>
    <P>He added that it was necessary to introduce a new management structure reporting to Michael Difley, and to set budgets and targets for all management. </P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I must point out,&rdquo; he said, <Col N="1657" />&ldquo;that there was never any mention or question of your being paid 10 per cent of the profits, or receiving 10 per cent of the proceeds of the sale if I sell the company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(During the 1983-87 Coalition, Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald replaced a Junior Minister, Eddie Collins, when it was revealed that he had attended the board meeting of a family company from which he had resigned on his appointment to office. Collins was present at such a meeting when an application for assistance to a State financial institution was discussed.)</P>
    <P>On 12 July 1982 Albert Reynolds, as Industry Minister, publicly rejected reports in a British retail magazine <i>The Grocer</i> that two giant British supermarket chains, Sainbury's and Tesco, were pulling out of deals with C &amp; D because of Ireland's stand during the Falklands crisis.  Later Reynolds personally telephoned a Mr. Hatch at Sainbury's on 16 July to reassure him.  On 28 August Minister Reynolds attended a meeting at C &amp; D along with the company's auditor Bernard Carroll, P. Gillen, head of Kinnear Consultants, and Padraig Groarke, C &amp; D's solicitor.</P>
    <P>Article 26 of Government Procedure Instructions states that &ldquo;in so far as business interests to membership of other organisations are concerned, the underlying principle is that no Minister or Minister of State should engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 27 April 1983 Albert Reynolds was again asked by Sainbury's to come to London to discuss ongoing difficulties with the product.  He refused to allow Norman Spence accompany him to the meeting, but agreed to meet him later in the Tara Hotel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" />&ldquo;There he told me that due to further economies at the plant I was not needed any more.  He handed me a letter which he told me to bring home and read, and to put my feet up for a while.  The letter was a note of dismissal on the grounds that I had not generated enough business.  They offered me something like four weeks' redundancy pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the letter sent from Mount Carmel House, Dublin Road, Longford on 28 June 1982 to Norman Spence, Esq., Mountain House, Llanteg, Norberth, Pembrokeshire, Wales, regarding C &amp; D Foods Limited:</P>
    <P>Dear Norman</P>
    <P>I regret the delay in formally replying to your letter of 27th March, but no doubt you will appreciate how busy I have been since then, and in any event, I dealt with all the matters you raised in my last telephone conversation with you.</P>
    <P>You say that some misunderstandings may have arisen between members of the company management in the past, but as I have said before, it is results that count and you just have not produced the sales needed.</P>
    <P> 1.  For several years now, the company has not increased its sales volume or gained any significant new customers, and the price increases obtained for its products have been far lower than the increased costs of production, per case, and this despite the huge devaluation of the Irish pound against the British pound.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Production management&rdquo; has increased the capacity of the factory from about 15,000 cases per week to nearly 25,000 cases per week in the last few years at a cost extending into six figures.  Production management has also made several innovations to improve efficiency and keep costs down. The capacity will increase 2 or 3 <Col N="1659" /> fold more when the new factory is completed later this year.</P>
    <P>3.  The necessary borrowings and grants have been organised by our accountants internal and external and management consultants employed from January 1981 to advise and support the general management function.</P>
    <P>4.  Yet sales are now running at only 13,000 cases per week and the company is now making a serious loss.</P>
    <P>5.  Clearly, irrespective of the minor day to day hiccups of the type discussed in your letter, </P>
    <P> (a)  Production management has done its job.</P>
    <P>(b)  Financial and general management has done its job.</P>
    <P>(c)  Sales management &mdash; i.e. you &mdash; have <i>not</i> done your job. </P>
    <P>Accordingly, it has been necessary to</P>
    <P> (i)  Introduce a new management structure reporting to Michael Diffley.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Employ sales and marketing consultants to ensure the proper and planned marketing of our products.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Set budgets and targets for all management. </P>
    <P>As I have said before, the company cannot afford to keep you on the team in circumstances where you do not obtain the sales we need for survival and profitability.</P>
    <P>In relation to your final paragraph, I must point out that there never was any mention or question of your being paid 10 per cent of the profits, or receiving 10 per cent of the proceeds of sale if I sell the company. Back in 1974, you had agreed to subscribe for 2,500 shares but the High Court declared this invalid.  However, it was subsequently agreed with you <Col N="1660" /> that the company would make pension and life assurance contributions for you and this was done.</P>
    <P>I trust this clears the matter and that all management matters can in future be handled in the normal way through the Chief Executive, Michael Diffley.</P>
    <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P>Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>The signature on that letter is that of Albert Reynolds, now Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nealon's current guide to the Dáil and Seanad shows that Deputy Albert Reynolds was Minister for Finance from November 1988 to November 1991; Minister for Industry and Commerce from March 1987 to November 1988; Minister for Industry and Energy from March to December 1982; Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Transport 1979-81.  It will be seen from these dates that Minister Reynolds clearly involved himself in the day-to-day business affairs of C &amp; D Foods Limited while a Minister, a role which he will now try to have us believe he relinquished.</P>
      <P>Given this clear evidence I ask the Tánaiste to state publicly and categorically if he still believes that the issuing of passports to the Masri's in exchange for £1.1 million &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in C &amp; D Foods Limited was a proper, ethical and arms length transaction.  I ask that he urgently address these matters and issue a public reply in the national interest and in the interest of restoring credibility to public life.</P>

    <P>There is little further to add.  The accounts given by Ministers have been inconsistent, guileful and partial.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, has given no explanation.  This House must now direct that this affair be independently inquired into and reported on.  Passing this Bill this evening will help prevent a recurrence <Col N="1661" /> of events of this kind.  However, there remains the question of confidence in the accounts given by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  To any fair observer it would be self-evident that the accounts given so far cannot be accepted.  Ministers cannot act as defence, judge and jury in their own cause.</P>
    <P>The Government Chief Whip, Deputy Dempsey, became Chief Whip as many of these Ministers became Ministers deploring the climate of sleaze that surrounded the Greencore and Telecom scandals.  They are the very people who seek to deplore criticism of questionable practices.  Writing of this sleaze in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Friday last, Mr. Fintan O'Toole stated:</P>
    <P>Does anyone now remember that what brought Brian Cowen to the Cabinet, and Albert Reynolds to the office of Taoiseach, was public disgust at apparent conflicts of interest in the Greencore and Telecom scandals? Does anyone remember the public statement by four Fianna Fail backbenchers, among them Albert's blueeyed boy, Noel Dempsey, deploring the climate of sleaze that surrounded those scandals?</P>
    <P>That it was that affair which initiated Albert Reynolds's coup against his leader?  That Albert Reynolds and his faction bought shares at that time in the idea that public life must be conducted according to the principle that no perceived conflict between private gain and the public good could be tolerated?</P>
    <P>In this House the Minister for Justice made veiled threats against any Member of the House who seeks to raise this matter.  She has suggested that other embarrassing details will be brought out.</P>
    <P>If this is the price of ensuring clean Government then let that be done.  This House must not cower under such threats, which are unworthy of a parliamentarian.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party can no longer wash its hands of these practices.  It is time for it to cross the floor of the House and <Col N="1662" /> join with the Opposition and other Members of this House who will not allow behaviour of this kind to go unexplained and unquestioned.</P>
    <P>I do not indulge in character assassination. I doubt if any Member of this House can find an occasion when I have sought to do so.  What I place before the House this evening are the cold facts. Let those facts be replied to truthfully and without any attempt at further smokescreens.  Let them be examined openly, fairly, independently and impartially. If that is done then this House will have done its duty and we can await the findings of that independent investigation. We must pass this Bill to allow that to happen.  Members of the Government stand indicted; they cannot exonerate themselves of guilt and their guilt or innocence must be established by an independent source.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>In the course of my reply to a parliamentary question about the possible extradition of Fr. Brendan Smyth I indicated that provisions relating to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 had been used for the first time in the context of this case.  It is outrageous of the Deputy to continue to suggest that I said it was the first time this Act had been used in connection with an extradition case.  He knows as well as I do that this Act has been used in numerous cases since 1987. Given the controversial nature of some of these cases, it is a well documented and reported fact that this Act was used previously.  Why then would I suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now seems that Deputy Mitchell is unconcerned about the truth, that he <Col N="1666" /> will use any device at his disposal to twist the meaning of remarks made here so that they suit his base political purposes. I will not allow my integrity to be denigrated in this fashion by cheap shot stunts from the Sunday soundbite man.</P>
    <P>The Government is opposing this Bill. During my tenure as Minister for Justice, I have always kept an open mind on Opposition Bills in my area of responsibility debated in Private Members' time.  If there has been merit in an Opposition Bill, I have not been afraid to say so, as in the case of Deputy Shatter's tenancy Bill.  If a Bill could be amended to improve it, I have suggested that.  As the Minister in this Government who has probably brought most legislation before the House, I have always adopted a positive and serious attitude to legislative proposals brought forward by the Opposition and I have accepted numerous Opposition amendments to Bills.  The record of the House is proof of that, if proof is needed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is different.  It is not a serious effort to amend the law governing our treatment of non-nationals.  I will deal with specific points in that regard later.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of this legislation now is nothing more than a shallow, cynical exercise by Fine Gael to reopen in advance of the Cork by-elections the controversy about investment-based naturalisations on the spurious grounds that it will damage the Government candidates.  For 40 minutes I listened to Deputy Mitchell and he did not talk about the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is an abuse of a Dáil facility by the Deputy and his party.  It is all the more sickening when one considers the non-stop lecturing and hectoring of Deputy Mitchell about the duties and obligations of this House to discuss the issues of the day in a serious and wellinformed debate.  Who does he think he is fooling?  He should forget about the sleaze by the Lee and concentrate on the real issues about which the people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The economic shape of the country has not been as good for many years. <Col N="1667" /> We have peace in the land, and what does Fine Gael make of this?  It ignores these issues because it knows this is a good Government which will see out its term of office having transformed this island.  Compare that with the paralysis which affected the administration of this State when Fine Gael was last in power. How can we ever forget those days when we lurched from one economic crisis to the next.  At the end of it all, what had we?  We had a country teetering on the edge of bankruptcy which had been mortgaged to our children's children.  That is Fine Gael's record in Government.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland will not forgive or forget this gross mismanagement and incompetency and Fine Gael knows this.  That is why it is going down the road of dishing out the dirt in this byelection campaign.  This debate is just another chapter in this squalid affair.  It almost bankrupted this country and it has now bankrupted itself.  It makes scurrilous, unfounded and ill-judged remarks about members of this Government on the basis that the more of these it makes, the greater the possibility some of them will stick.</P>
    <P>I have been in Cork over the past two weekends and I have seen the glossy leaflets and the slick shots paid for, no doubt, by the merchant princes and their &ldquo;yachtie&rdquo; friends.  I have also seen these same sleaze type tactics used to attempt to scuttle the campaign of that great friend of Ireland, Senator Ted Kennedy, in Massachusetts.</P>
    <P>There is agreement on all sides of the House about the most challenging problem facing the country.  We all want to see unemployment reduced and sufficient job opportunities created for all our citizens.  Nobody disagrees with that.  Can somebody in Opposition explain why is it so wrong to exchange Irish citizenship for investment in companies where additional jobs are maintained or new ones created?</P>
    <P>At least there are some people on the Opposition benches who have the imagination to support this concept.  I <Col N="1668" /> am speaking here of four very prominent members of the Opposition parties who contacted my Department to support this scheme in its present format. In a particular case a significant number of jobs were on the line and of course it suited members of the Opposition to support the means by which these would be retained.  To the credit of some of those people, at least they had the good sense to keep their counsel when all manner of outrageous allegations were being hurled about this scheme.  One may well ask where does this leave Fine Gael in relation to investment naturalisations.  Are they speaking in forked tongues?  The answer is a resounding yes.  When it suits, it is for it and, conversely, when it appears to be politically opportunistic, we get histrionics from Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>How cheap and how squalid can he get?  What has happened to the once proud Fine Gael Party who served this country without fear or favour?</P>

      <P>It has become the party of instant political gratification &mdash; no tactic is too base, no rumour, however outrageous, should not be spread far and wide and no effort should be spared in doing down one's opponents.  Do not get me wrong, I can mix it with the best of them but please spare me the hypocrisy and the righteous indignation which by now is a common occurrence from some quarters opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of instant gratification Fine Gael is prepared to add to the not inconsiderable public cynicism to which all of us here are subject.  Is it any wonder that significant numbers of the <Col N="1669" /> population are bewildered by what happens here when they see the play-acting of Members opposite?  They should stop debasing the currency for all of us, grow up and help restore public confidence in the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell for this opportunity to set out once again the Government's policy in the area of applications for naturalisation linked to investments in the State.  It is clear from what he said that there is some misunderstanding, or at least a lack of awareness in this area despite the fact that in reply to a number of parliamentary questions on 25 October last I set out, in a very comprehensive manner, the developments which have taken place over the past few months.  Deputy Mitchell's Bill does not take any account of those developments, which include major initiatives, such as the establishment of an advisory group of officials to advise the Minister on each application, as well as definitive terms of reference for that group to include strict criteria by which each application for naturalisation linked to investments will be examined.  For those and other reasons which I will outline later, this side of the House will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile outlining the developments which have taken place in recent times on the issue of investment-linked naturalisation.  There are, of course, two broad naturalisation categories which, for the sake of convenience, I will describe as general naturalisation and investment-based naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The majority of naturalisations granted fall into the general category. These are best described as naturalisation certificates which can be granted by the Minister for Justice to persons who have a certain period of residence in the State.  They are also required to fulfil certain other specific conditions which are set out in the Irish nationality and citizenship legislation.  While I have certain ideas concerning these naturalisations, all I want to say at this point is that these cases have not been central to the developments which have taken <Col N="1670" /> place in regard to investment-linked naturalisation.</P>
    <P>Certain suggestions have been made outside the House and, regrettably, inside the House, that the Department of Justice, or at least some of its officials who deal with naturalisation, apply discriminatory or racist policies when dealing with applications, irrespective of the category in which the particular application falls.  A national daily newspaper, <i>The Irish Times</i>, in a recent article on immigration and refugees, reported that no persons from Africa or Asia had been naturalised in recent years, but that several thousand Americans and Europeans had been naturalised.  The implication is that there is a deliberate policy of refusing naturalisation to persons of African and Asian origin.  The implication is not only untrue but is deeply offensive, not only to me and the officials of my Department who process applications but to the many thousands of non-nationals who have settled here and who would wish to integrate fully into our society by way of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The article, as it turned out, was based on a misinterpretation of statistics &mdash; I hope not deliberately misinterpreted by <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; produced by the European Commission on non-nationals resident in Ireland, as opposed to persons who had been naturalised here.  In pointing out the error to <i>The Irish Times</i>, my Department took the opportunity of underlining, for example, that more than 130 persons from more than 30 different countries of origin, such as China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam and Ethiopia to name a few, had been naturalised last year.</P>
    <P>I have already rejected these extremely serious allegations and I have given opportunities to Deputies who have made such allegations to provide the evidence on which they are based.  It is interesting that no Deputy has come forward with any evidence of this type. This is simply too serious a matter to be the subject of wild allocations which may give rise to offence to become the <Col N="1671" /> subject of concern to nationals of any country and to which there is simply no basis.  If anybody, inside or outside the House, has evidence of discrimination in a case of naturalisation, I urge that they supply me with the facts.</P>
    <P>Turning to naturalisation applications granted on the basis of investments, as a result of my experience in dealing with such applications, I decided earlier this year that the Minister for Justice should have available the ongoing advice of an appropriately qualified group of people to assist in arriving at a decision on individual applications.  On my recommendation, the Government agreed last April to establish such an advisory group consisting of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Enterprise and Employment and the Government agency engaged in the support and development of indigenous industry, Forbairt.  This advisory group was established with the functions of examining each application for naturalisation on the basis of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; linked to investment in the State and making a recommendation in each instance to the Minister for Justice.  In establishing the group, the Government also decided that the Minister for Justice should bring its terms of reference to Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>In June, I informed the House that a Cabinet subcommittee consisting of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Tourism and Trade and the Minister for Justice had been formed specially to advise the Government on the terms of reference for the advisory group.  While the flexibility of the whole scheme initially had its advantages, there is now a clear view that more formal, and indeed more transparent arrangements are called for. The Government fully agrees with this view and has already acted in this regard.  The Government, therefore, has approved the terms of reference for the <Col N="1672" /> group and they are as follows: 1. to consider applications for naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the group's assessment of the job-creating or job-maintenance capacity of the investment; 2. the group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation-advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations, will apply the following criteria:</P>
    <P>(a)  substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least five years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the two years following naturalisation; (b) the level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant; (c) where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least seven years at an interest rate not greater than 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by an applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.  The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made; (d) as ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period: at the very least five years; (e) the number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only; (f) audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with <Col N="1673" /> the rules of the scheme for naturalisation' (g) the investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship; (h) police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in the country of origin &mdash; and, if required, from the police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments &mdash; together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to inquire behind it, and (i) annual certification by the established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the criteria which the advisory group will address in assessing every application before making a recommendation to the Minister for Justice who, I will emphasise, will not even consider an application without it being assessed by the group.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided that the scheme of investment-based naturalisation should be put on a statutory basis.  The task of examining this proposed legislation was given in June to the interdepartmental committee established in 1993 to examine policy an practice generally with regard to non-nationals. The committee has been asked to consider the Government decision in the context of its comprehensive review of legislation in this area generally and will report on the matter when it has reviewed all aspects of it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, and to ensure valuable job-creating investment opportunities are not lost to the State, the Government has agreed that the Minister for Justice may continue to make decisions on investment-based naturalisation applications, acting on the recommendations of the advisory group which will operate on the basis of the terms of reference to which I have just referred and which, of course have the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> The position, then, is that the Government has already decided that the scheme of investment-based naturalisation will be on a statutory basis. The best method of giving effect to this decision is being examined by the interdepartmental committee to which I referred.  I do not want to prejudge the recommendations of that committee which is examining the question of naturalisation and citizenship in the broader context.  It would be unwise to do that, especially having regard to the fact that the committee canvassed the views of concerned individuals and organisations and will be giving deliberate consideration to all views and proposals in the formation of its comprehensive recommendations.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill, there are a few comments which I would like to make on the provisions of the Bill which are somewhat unusual in certain respects.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, prior to taking any decision under the relevant provisions of the citizenship legislation, the Minister for Justice shall make all relevant information available to the Public Offices Commission as provided for in the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994. To put it mildly, this is a rather unusual proposal quite apart from the fact that the Bill has yet to be enacted.  As I understand it, the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, contains certain provisions for the establishment, membership and functions of an independent standing commission to deal with complaints and to investigate possible contraventions of the Act by office holders, special advisers, designated directors and those holding designated position of employment in public bodies.  The commission will comprise the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The commission is intended to be a specific investigatory body in response to complaints or, indeed, acting on its own initiative.  The role which Deputy Gay Mitchell wants to provide for it in <Col N="1675" /> relation to applications for naturalisation is particularly unclear.  Section 4 of his Bill, as I said, provides that the Minister shall make all relevant information available to the commission prior to taking any decision of substance under the Nationality Act of 1956 as amended.  The section also provides that the commission will report thereon but is silent on what the report will embrace or to whom the report will be made. The proposal also overlooks the fact that an application for naturalisation is generally expected by an applicant to be processed in confidence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 goes on to provide that the commission will present a report to Dáil Éireann on every similar decision taken for a period of 15 years prior to the Act. Apart from the fact that the proposal is particularly insulting to me and to every Minister for Justice in the last 15 years, I remind the Deputy that the numbers of persons naturalised over the past 15 years would be in the order of several thousands.  While it would be singularly inappropriate for the Public Offices Commission to be involved as a matter of course in every decision on applications for naturalisation, the suggestion that they should examine every such decision over such a long period of time is not only wholly impractical but ludicrous having regard to the costs and time consumed by such an exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill provides that any person aggrieved by a decision of the Minister for Justice in relation to naturalisation should have a right of appeal to the Refugee Appeal Tribunal which is proposed in the Refugee Bill, 1994.  I emphasise, again, that while I am optimistic that progress will be made in enacting the Refugee Bill, the position is that it is still before the House on Committee Stage and there is, therefore, no refugee Act, 1994.  Again, this is a somewhat unusual provision as <Col N="1676" /> envisaged by Deputy Gay Mitchell in that the function of the Appeal Tribunal as proposed by the Refugee Bill, 1994, is to deal solely with appeals where applications for recognition as refugee have been refused.  The Deputy envisages a number of functions for the Refugee Appeal Tribunal which, the Deputy would have us believe, will obviously have lots of spare time left over from dealing with appeals against negative decisions in asylum cases.</P>
      <P>I should re-emphasise, that the Refugee Appeal Tribunal is intended to have a specific and limited function.  Therefore, it is a singularly inappropriate body to be involved in processing appeals against decisions by Ministers for Justice under the nationality legislation. As well as that, the provisions envisaged by the Deputy provide that the tribunal will have certain powers, including the power to set aside a decision of the Minister for Justice and grant a certificate of naturalisation in accordance with sections 15 and 16 of the 1956 Act.  Apart from other misgivings about the provision, I could not possibly agree to such an all-embracing proposal which, on the face of it, would appear to attempt to delegate a statutory function of the Minister for Justice to another person outside Government while, at the same time, the proposal itself is contradicted specifically by the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the 1956 Act to which it refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also proposes to remove, in section 2 of his Bill, the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice to grant a certificate of naturalisation.  The result of this, like the rest of Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill, is unclear, given that the Minister would also be empowered to make regulations containing the rules and criteria for the granting of certificates of naturalisation.  On the one hand, the Bill attempts to remove the discretion of the Minister for Justice in this area and, on the other, sets out that the Minister shall establish the general rules by which applications will be assessed.  The Deputy's Bill appears to be a mixture of everything, without the <Col N="1677" /> overall thrust being immediately apparent. I suppose I should be grateful that it at least stops short of abolishing the office of the Minister for Justice altogether.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred in his Bill to executive roles in the assessment of applications for naturalisation for bodies which will be established by virtue of other legislation.  I have indicated that these bodies are singularly inappropriate to be involved in such executive functions.  I can only assume that the fact that these bodies have no obvious role in naturalisation is simply a technical device availed of by the Deputy to get over possible difficulties which his Bill would face if it included proposals for substantial costs on the Exchequer by the establishment of new bodies. That is probably a reflection of the lack of thought which has gone into this Bill and the lack of substance which has emerged as a result.  If what the Deputy is primarily arriving at in his Bill is transparency in the operation of the scheme of investment-linked naturalisation, then I am afraid he is already several steps behind the rest of us.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, the Government fully accepts that more formal arrangements in the operation of the scheme are needed now and positive steps have already been taken in that direction, as I outlined.  The scheme which we have had up to recently is, of course, the scheme which has existed since the Government decided some years ago that inward-based investment should constitute grounds for deeming the investor to have qualified for naturalisation on the basis of what the legislation describes as &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. The scheme had always operated by way of informal arrangements on the basis of a Government decision that the question of granting or refusing naturalisation in individual cases should be left at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The strength of the scheme's informality was that it enabled favourable decisions to be made quickly, where necessary, but nobody could deny, with <Col N="1678" /> the benefit of hindsight, that the informality of the scheme, while in one way an asset, was in other ways a feature which left it wide open to criticism.  That had lead to the clear view, shared by the Government, that more formal and more transparent arrangements are called for and that is why we have taken the initiatives I have already outlined. Therefore, I oppose this Bill for the reasons stated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said &ldquo;I make no allegation of criminal activity by anybody&rdquo;. His tone did more than suggest corruption in relation to one company and two Government Ministers.  His allegation is a wild one, to put it mildly, and abuses the privileges of the House. The naming of the Masri family is particularly unfair.  There is a policy in this House that people who are not here to answer for themselves should not be named.  For 40 minutes the Deputy gave us a lecture about a company, C &amp; D Petfoods Ltd., and did not address the Bill.  That confirms that bringing the Bill before the House is nothing but a political stunt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that questions need to be answered.  All the questions put to me have been answered in June 1994 and on 25 October 1994.  The flexibility of the scheme as it then operated was explained in response to a parliamentary question in June 1994.  There never were formal rules until now.  The Deputy is alleging that the Masri file was tampered with.  I am not sure whether he is suggesting that the tampering was done by a civil servant in my Department, by a former Minister in the Department or by me since I became Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the residence, I already <Col N="1679" /> explained in the House that there was a clerical error in my Department in putting the details in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  As Minister I accept full responsibility for that clerical error.  Six months before the issue of certificates to the Masri family the details of the address in Dublin were provided to the Department.  The applications were not a matter for the Cabinet. I hope Deputy Mitchell, in suggesting that the recollection of a former Minister for Justice was that it went to Government, is not suggesting that I misled the House in June when I said it did not go to Cabinet.  None of these cases went to Cabinet.  I presume Deputy Mitchell accepts my word on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the document he mentioned which was circulated by consultants, I cannot be held responsible for erroneous or misleading information which is circulated by a third party.  I have already condemned the racist references which are said to have been in that document.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that this is nothing short of a shallow and cynical exercise by Fine Gael to reopen on spurious grounds the controversy about investment-based naturalisations in advance of the by-elections.  I believe it is abuse of a Dáil facility.  We have seen the glossy leaflets, the slick shots paid for by the merchant princes and their yachting friends.  We have seen the sleaze-type tactics called OPPO which have suddenly been imported into the two Cork constituencies from Massachusetts where they were used in the campaign to bring down that great friend and supporter of Ireland, Senator Edward Kennedy.  They have not worked there, and I do not believe they will work by the Lee.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to be asked a question last week about the investment-based naturalisation scheme nbecause every picture tells a story.  The greatest pressure I have come under since I became Minister for Justice 21 months ago was during the summer when, for some strange reason, some <Col N="1680" /> Deputies at a very senior level in both the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael not alone rang my office and spoke to me personally and to my officials but also put on paper very strong recommendations and representations under the old scheme in relation to a company that had found itself in financial difficulties and whose only hope of surviving and maintaining 100 jobs was by having this type of inward investment-based naturalisation for a person.</P>

      <P>One of the strongest representations was from the former leader of the Progressive Democrats who assured me that there would be no difficulties made by his party if I decided to grant the naturalisation in this case.  Either we are going to be fair and honest in operating this scheme or we are not.  When it suits certain individuals they are in favour of the scheme. All of a sudden, when it does not suit those same individuals, they are against the scheme.  I informed Deputy O'Donnell at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security that it would be grossly unfair if, for example, a company in which she or Deputy McDowell happened to have been a partner was debarred from getting support from a Government agency or Department because those Deputies happened to be in Government.  I would not support that in Opposition.  It should not matter whether a Deputy is on this or the other side of the House.  If he or she is no longer actively involved in the management, shareholding or partnership, that company should be free to work in the same competitive environment as every other company and should not be put at a competitive disadvantage by virtue of the fact that the Deputy in question has been lucky enough to be appointed a member of the Government.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Mitchell for 40 minutes.  I heard nothing about the Bill but I felt that in keeping with the tradition in relation to debates on Justice matters in the House I should say why I was not in a position as Minister for Justice to accept this Bill.  It has its flaws.  I have difficulties with it but I have been prepared in the past to accept Private Members' Bills, either in total or by including some of their provisions in my own legislation. When Opposition amendments have been tabled to legislation introduced by me, I have been open to accepting those where I felt the legislation would benefit and we would have a better Act passed by the Oireachtas.  However, I am not in a position, for all the reasons set out in detail, to accept this Private Members' Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for raising a number of issues which have to be thrashed out in the course of these discussions, particularly in relation to the recent operation of the citizenship and nationality legislation and the behaviour of her own Department in respect of the Masri case.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that she is willing to answer questions about this matter and it is true that we should have accountability in relation to the conferring of Irish citizenship on any person, no matter who they are or how they come to be on our soil and in the position of applying for Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>I have on many occasions been asked by spouses of Irish citizens about their right to become citizens themselves.  In all those cases I encountered huge difficulties with the Department of Justice and I note a total difference between the approach of the Department to those who come bearing gifts and those who have merit, family ties etc.  The operation of the 1956 Act is discretionary against those who have genuine connections with this country and in favour of those who have produced money in order to sustain their application to become citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> Becoming an Irish citizen is not just a matter of purchasing a passport.  A passport is one thing.  Becoming a member of our political, economic and civil community is another.  On occasions the Minister has tended to reduce the sale of citizenship to a mere formality which can be justified by reference to the capacity of the person in question to bring goodies to the Irish people, either individually or collectively.  I do not accept the proposition that anybody can buy Irish citizenship.  It has always been the consensus among parties in this House that there is a scheme for genuine business migration, for someone who intends to invest in Ireland, to become part of our community and an Irish citizen entitled to live here.  That is reasonable, especially in a society which depended on the willingness on countries like America, England, Australia, New Zealand and other immigrant societies to accept into their ranks Irish people who were willing to play a part in their communities.  As the Minister will appreciate, although she will not admit it, it is different for the Government to sell European Union passports to foreigners who do not have tangible links with this country.  On the sale of citizenship to people without tangible links with this country.  I am alarmed it has taken the debate in which Deputy Rabbitte and I played a leading part to bring before the Irish people the existence of a scheme whereby non-EU nationals could, by presenting a large sum of money &mdash; an indeterminate amount &mdash; effectively obtain Irish citizenship without proving a real intention to become part of Ireland's civil community. Citizenship was an honour to be bestowed on those who intended to become part of our society.  In the Masri case, in particular, there was abundant proof that was not a requirement.  I will refer later to the remarks about Diamond Engineering made by the Minister because they deserve special attention.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Taoiseach's company in which he is a 41 per cent shareholder, the ordinary shares and all the effective <Col N="1683" /> directorships are held by members of his family, the protest I made which I still make &mdash; and on which I believe every decent Irish person must take a stand &mdash; is that there was not an intention on the part of the investors to become part of the Irish community. They bought a disused derelict flat in Ballsbridge and used it as a point of convenience for the acquisition of Irish citizenship.  There was not an element of additionality to the Irish economy, a point to which I will refer later.  There was not an intention on their part to become part of the Irish community as was shown by the fact that none of them have ever resided in Ireland since giving the Taoiseach's firm a loan of £1.1 million. Those are the facts and I challenge the Minister to gainsay what I said, namely, that the people involved do not reside in Ireland, that none of them intend to become members of the Irish political community and that none of them in a real sense made an investment in Ireland.  They did something dramatically different.  They lent money at a subsidised rate of interest of 5 per cent over a five year period to a company in which the Taoiseach was a 41 per cent shareholder.  The Government justified that as an investment in Ireland by saying it produced an Irish association between those people and this country.  They did not come to live here, they know nothing of our society, they were strangers to the Ministers who introduced them to our society and the most peculiar fact of all &mdash; and one to which the Minister might apply her attention &mdash; is that the Taoiseach said in the House that he did not know these people, he never met them and knew nothing about them.  Is it not strange that people have Irish associations by investing in a firm in our community in which the majority shareholder knows nothing about them and apparently could not care less and the Minister failed to explain the circumstances in which that investment took place?  All the beneficial shareholding in C &amp; D Foods Limited is vested in members of <Col N="1684" /> the Reynolds family, the largest single shareholding of 41 per cent is vested in the Taoiseach, he and his wife own more than 50 per cent of the shares in that company and they at all material times have had effective control of that company.  They are clinical cold facts. We are asked by the financial controller of that company who was interviewed on radio by Rodney Rice to believe that in September 1991 there was an approach by two people who were unknown to the management of that company offering an investment.  Will the Minister indicate in the context of this Bill if it is normal for a company to be approached&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring it to the attention of the Deputy and other Members that Members should not under privilege comment on people outside the House and the Deputy has done that.  I caution him against doing that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by people out of the blue who offer to invest £1.1. million in it?  It is not normal.  If they were to offer a £1.1.  million loan at 5 per cent which at that time was less than 40 per cent of the commercial rate of interest, the annual value of that investment accumulated over five years would be well over £250,000 because it bore a low interest aspect which effectively meant that it was money given as a gift.</P>
      <P>I was careful to critically analyse and parse every line of the Minister's statement to the House about the circumstances in which in future such money would be given by people seeking investment in Ireland to secure Irish citizenship.  One of its features, repeated this evening by the Minister was that if one lends money to an Irish company rather than purchase a shareholding, one must take out some security over the assets of the company.  In other words a soft loan is not permissible. One cannot give someone money and say it is withdrawable without a time period attached to it and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must be in a position to prove to <Col N="1685" /> the Department of Justice under the new regime to which the Minister referred, that the loan is secured on the assets of that company.  That is necessary because it suggests that people are engaging in arm's length transactions. Normally, nobody lends money to a limited liability company without security unless they are closely connected to the principals of that company.  Nobody lends money to another for five years at a low rate of interest without asking for security.  Regarding the investment of which I spoke previously, why would two strangers in September 1991 offer money at 5 per cent to a company of which the then Minister for Finance was a 41 per cent shareholder, and say they do not want security?  Both the managing director and the financial controller of that company have claimed that the advance of moneys to their company was not predicated on conferring Irish citizenship.  We are left with the question, which reasonable people must ask, namely why would people invest in a company by way of a soft loan at 5 per cent if they did not know the proprietor, the main shareholder of the company, and they were not taking security for their investment?  The Minister's speech is of particular relevance to this point. She said there must be security in future in respect of loans.  In the transaction, as it was publicly known to exist in the company mentioned, why was no security sought for the loan?  Why, when I checked the company's office today, did I find no security in favour of the lenders of the £1.1 million?  Why would somebody lend £1.1 million to a company at preferential rates and say they do not care if they are at the tail end of the queue of creditors in the event that the company goes bankrupt?  The question that immediately arises is why somebody would be so improvident.  If they retained an Irish solicitor, why would that person tell a foreigner to invest in a company in those circumstances without requiring security, to give the money below commercial rates without asking questions?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> Two views may be taken of this matter, and I admit I took the darker view at the beginning, that these people simply flung their money at an Irish company and had so much of it that they did not mind whether they got security for it.  However, I have recently received information, which I believe the Minister is also in possession of and which I challenge her to deny, that the lenders to the company in question were offered security which was provided by a semi-State company in Ireland.  I challenge the Minister to deny to this House that the soft loan to C &amp; D Foods was guaranteed by a semi-State bank in this country.  I challenge her to deny that, from the records in the Department of Justice, it was at all times apparent to the Minister for Justice that the loan to C &amp; D Foods was backed up by a guarantee by a semi-State company to the lenders.</P>
    <P>These people were either profligate with their money or they obtained security which does not appear on the company's office file, and I was mystified as to why they would choose the former option.  However, on the basis of information furnished to me the question arises as to whether a semi-State commercial banking company provided a guarantee to the Masri family that the money lent to the Taoiseach's company would be repaid.  The Minister knows full well that is what happened and the Tánaiste, at the time he is said to have inspected the file, knows likewise. These people got security but a decision was made that the loan would not be secured on the assets of the company. That explains in part why the new regime requires that a loan must be secured on the assets of a company rather than by the guarantee of a third party.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate whether I am right on these matters.  If the information supplied to me is correct, that a semi-State body furnished a guarantee to lenders to the Taoiseach's company that the moneys they were lending at 5 per cent, or whatever the rate, over five years would be repaid regardless of <Col N="1687" /> what happened, that company should answer in public the grave question as to why that offer was made and the security provided.  I ask the Minister to indicate whether departmental records show what security was offered to the Masri family for the loan they made to C &amp; D Foods.  I believe security was offered and it was kept off the balance sheet of the company to conceal the fact of the loan.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, as an expert in company law, will appreciate that if you do not register your security on the assets of a company within a short period provided by statute of the creation of the security, you lose priority in any subsequent winding up.  A lender to a company under Irish law who does not register a debenture, mortgage or security of some form over the assets of the company stands as an unsecured creditor in the context of a liquidation.  Anybody acting as adviser to a lender in those circumstances would tell them they must secure their position, that they must obtain security over the assets of the company or alternatively obtain a personal guarantee from the directors of the company or from a person or body of worth.  Was the information supplied to me to the effect that a semi-State company provided the security in the context of the investment in C &amp; D Foods correct?  Was that known to the Department of Justice at all times?  Was it known to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that a semi-State company lent its name in the form of a guarantee of repayment to the investment in the Taoiseach's firm?</P>
    <P>If I am right there are major implications, because this House has been starved of information on this issue. Deputy Mitchell was perfectly right to introduce a Bill for the purpose of raising this matter in the House.  It is a fortuitous opportunity to inquire whether security was furnished by a semi-State bank in respect of the Masri loan to the Taoiseach's company.  If that is the case I want to know about it.  If the Department of Justice has at all times known <Col N="1688" /> about this and if it was known to anyone who investigated the affairs of the company in the context of making the investment, I want to know about it.  I challenge the Minister to indicate what security was offered to the Masris for their loan to this company.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to raise &mdash; I know my time is nearly up but I will come back to this point at the next available opportunity.  It has been suggested that the Taoiseach might have been unaware of the circumstances of the investment in question.  As I understand it, the financial controller of C &amp; D Foods indicated that the investment in question was first proffered in September 1991.  On 5 November subsequently the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, was dismissed for supporting a no confidence motion in the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and he remained out of office as Minister for three months, until 5 February 1992.  In a radio interview given by the financial controller of the company in question, he stated that it was only in March 1992 that the deal was finally concluded after negotiation.  If that is so it implies, without contradiction, that from September 1991 to March 1992, during the majority of the period under which the loan in question was under negotiation, the chief owner of the largest shareholding in the company was out of office and in a position to take a personal interest in his own affairs.</P>
    <P>I demanded an explanation from the Government on how, in circumstances where the chief shareholder of a company was out of office and a back-bencher in this House and had no interest in maintaining a dual personality, it could possibly be stated with any credibility that he was left unaware by close members of his family and fellow directors of an offer of £1.1 million at a time when, according to the financial details registered in the Companies Office, it owed £1.4 million.  I demand an explanation from the Government as to how this utterly incredible proposition can be sustained.  Ordinary <Col N="1689" /> people apply their common sense to facts unveiled to them.</P>

It is unacceptable that insufficient funds are allocated by the Government to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal to enable it make payments of compensation it has already determined should be made to the victims of crime. It is particularly unacceptable that the funds allocated to the tribunal for 1994 do not allow it to make payments awarded by it during 1993.  In agreeing the Estimates for 1994 the Government must have been fully aware of the outstanding moneys due and payable by the tribunal to the victims of crime as a result of adjudications made by it the previous year.  The Government is not only blatantly ignoring the tribunal's adjudications but is treating with contempt the victims of crime to whom the tribunal has deemed it appropriate to make awards.</P>
      <P>In recent years much lip service and concern has been expressed and many crocodile tears shed by Ministers for the victims of rape and sexual assault.  In this area action speaks louder than words.  It is clear that the action taken is, sadly, at variance with the honeyed words of concern regularly expressed.  I will illustrate my point by giving an example.  I will furnish the Minister of State with the name of the person concerned on the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1986 a young woman was attacked and raped in her home in Adare, County Limerick.  The rape took place at approximatley 2 a.m. when she woke up with a man's hands around her throat.  She was raped as she lay in bed. The perpetrator had a previous criminal record and the incident occurred on the day he was released from prison.  Subsequently he was apprehended by the <Col N="1690" /> Garda and sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The tragic victim of this horrific incident claimed compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal as she was entitled.  On 16 July 1993 she was advised that the tribunal had made an award in her favour in the sum of £20,205.  It is now almost 17 months since the award was made.  To date no payment has been made in accordance with the award to the victim of this rape.  Upon payment being sought the tribunal informed her &ldquo;the funds available to the tribunal this year for the payment of compensation are insufficient to enable it to pay the award in 1994&rdquo;.  She was assured, however, that it would be paid &ldquo;as soon as sufficient funds are available&rdquo;.  This is unacceptable.  When a tribunal established by the State to make awards of this nature determines that a payment of compensation should be made to a woman who has been the victim of rape the award should be paid without unreasonable delay.  The delay in this instance is not merely unreasonable, it is scandalous and unacceptable.  It is eight years since this rape took place. Not only will the compensation award not be paid this year it is not known whether a payment will be made to her in either 1995 or 1996.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to ensure that sufficient funds are provided to the tribunal during the course of the next two weeks to enable it not only to comply with its obligation to make the payment due to the woman whose case I have illustrated but also to enable it to make all payments due in respect of all other awards made by it to date.  It undermines confidence in the institutions of this State and the credibility of this Government when it expresses concern for the victims of crime when those who have been affected in this way by a horrendous crime find themselves abandoned by the Government and compensation remains unpaid 17 months after a tribunal established by the State has determined a compensation payment should be made.  It is also unacceptable <Col N="1691" /> that they can be given no indication of the time span within which the payment will be made.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will deal with all the people to whom awards have been made but have not been paid. I will furnish him with the name of the person concerned.  I am sure he will understand that I have good reason for not naming her in the House.  I ask him to respond as rapidly as possible and give me an assurance that the award made to her will be paid, preferably before the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy furnishes me with the name of the person concerned on the conclusion of this debate I will communicate tomorrow with the secretary of the tribunal and do all I can to help.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the delay in the payment of awards made under the criminal injuries compensation scheme and I share the Deputy's anxiety that additional funds be made available to eliminate this delay.  Both the Minister and I have tried during the past two years to secure extra funding for the tribunal but, unfortunately, despite all our representations we have not been successful although we have secured extra funding for other items.  Briefly, the history of the scheme is that it was set up on a non-statutory basis in 1974 to provide <i>ex-gratia</i> compensation (a) in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence, or (b) in circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting or attempting to assist the prevention of crime or the saving of human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An independent tribunal, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, was established under the scheme to adjudicate on applications for compensation and to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded.  The tribunal consists of a chairman and six ordinary members appointed by the <Col N="1692" /> Minister for Justice.  Members of the tribunal must be either practising barristers or solicitors to be eligible for appointment.  The scheme requires that the tribunal when determining the nature and amount of compensation shall fix the amount on the basis of damages awarded under the Civil Liability Acts.</P>
    <P>In 1985, it was considered that the scheme was proving too costly and it was decided that the then Minister for Justice should review the scheme with a view to reducing its impact on the Exchequer.  Following this review, the then Coalition Government approved a revised scheme in January 1986.  Under the revised scheme, compensation may not be paid in respect of pain and suffering attributable to injuries sustained on or after 1 April 1986.  Compensation for injuries sustained before that date is paid in accordance with the terms of the original scheme and it is the residue of such cases which continues to put the greatest demands on funding.</P>
    <P>I understand that the time taken to pay awards made under the scheme varies from case to case and that priority as regards payment is determined by the date of acceptance of the award.  In this context, the last persons to have their awards paid accepted those awards in December 1992.</P>
    <P>Since her appointment, the Minister for Justice has been conscious of the need to reduce delays in the making of payments under the scheme.  In this regard she indicated, when publishing the policy document entitled <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i>, that she intended to seek an additional sum of £7.5 million over a period of time to clear arrears of awards made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  She has since taken this matter up with the Minister for Finance in the context of the Department's Estimates for 1995 and subsequent years and is hopeful that sufficient funding can be made available to eliminate the delay problem.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy gives me the details of the case to which he referred I hope to have a reply for him tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The live cattle trade has been paralysed for the past four weeks because of the embargo placed by the shipping companies.  One of the main sources of income for hauliers and farmers and a considerable revenue earner for this country has been brought to a halt.  In such circumstances one would assume that an imaginative initiative designed to relieve the logjam of live animals and to maintain healthy competition between the factory and live trade would be encouraged and welcomed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Yet, the northern businessman who proposed the transport of live cattle from Knock Airport was not facilitated but seems to have been thwarted and frustrated in every way by officialdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Sam Smyth, a northern businessman with a sound and long reputation in the export of live animals, took the specially adpated Balkan Airlines Atenoff 12 plane to Knock on Thursday, 20 October.  The aircraft was inspected by the Department's veterinary section and 210 cattle were airlifted to Rennes in France on Friday 21 October.  The flight went well and the animals arrived in peak condition.  The Department's veterinary officer was on board during the flight to inspect the operation at first hand.  Mr. Smyth brought the plane back to Knock on Monday, 24 October to collect a second consignment of animals but the Department failed to give him the go ahead.  He rang the Department on several occasions and according to him officials refused to take his calls.  The plane sat on the tarmacadam for three days and finally on Wednesday at 3 p.m. the plane and the livestock <Col N="1694" /> were taken to Aldergrove Airport in Belfast and within three hours sanction for the flight on foot of minor changes was given by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  The animals were flown out on Thursday morning and further flights took place on Friday and Saturday mornings.</P>
    <P>What has happened in this case is an utter disgrace.  If the veterinary officer who travelled on the first flight was satisfied, why was immediate sanction not given for further flights?  If he was not satisfied, why were modifications and improvements not recommended? Why did departmental officials not take Mr. Smyth's calls and why was he kept waiting for three days, placing him in a loss making position?  Why was it possible for the authorities in Northern Ireland, who I am sure are just as rigorous as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to give almost immediate sanction?  Why do the UK authorities sanction four flights from Humberside each week in Balkan Airlines Atenoff 12 planes?  Why has an operation that has huge commercial potential for our agricultural sector, with quick, efficient and comfortable air transport arrangements and considerable economic potential for Knock Airport, been sabotaged by departmental ineptitude and bureaucratic madness?</P>
    <P>The publicity given to this sad episode and the treatment meted out by the Department to Mr. Smyth has done considerable damage.  One would almost think there is a hidden agenda.  I have asked legitimate questions in order to ensure there is no repeat of this and that everything possible will be done to facilitate such enterprise and initiative as displayed by Mr. Smyth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, for sharing time with me.  I was very disappointed to learn about the experience of this northern businessman, Mr. Sam Smyth, whom I thank publicly for making every effort to transport weanlings from the west.  Concerned farmers had contacted <Col N="1695" /> me but when I raised this with the Minister he told me two weeks ago in the House that the withdrawal of the main carrier from the carriage of livestock had not affected the sale of weanlings at the marts.  That is incorrect.  Farmers were telling me they could not sell their weanlings.  On that occasion I pleaded with the Minister to hire ships and if the Government had to buy a ship to export the cattle, that should have been done. Instead the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry put every obstacle in the way of Mr. Smyth.</P>
      <P>Farmers in the west had been encouraged to go into this business but now they have very serious problems in exporting their cattle.  I compliment the staff of Horan International Airport. Mr. Smyth has also complimented them on the way they treated him.  He had promised that he would be exporting pigs, lambs and other livestock from the west from Horan International Airport. This airport would have been his main hub and we are sorry to have lost that business.  I ask the Minister to apologise to Mr. Smyth for not taking his calls.  If there was a problem with the consignment that travelled from Knock somebody should have explained the position to Mr. Smyth and sought ways to resolve it.</P>
      <P>If the Government is not prepared to take action it should not put obstacles in the way of other people.  If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste stayed in the country they would know the problems facing people in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position.  Since the withdrawal of Pandoro from the carriage of livestock by roll-on, roll-off transport from Rosslare to the Continent my Department has been in regular contact with livestock exporters and shippers in the matter of alternative transport arrangements.  The organisation of alternative routes of supply is a matter <Col N="1696" /> for the commercial interests involved. My Department concerns itself with guaranteeing that the health and welfare of the animals are adequately safeguarded. This involves prior inspection of the means of transport and very often provisional approval for a trial journey. A veterinary inspector from my Department usually travels on the initial journey, especially if a new type of transport is involved.</P>
      <P>In this context an application was received on 18 October for the use of air transport to carry a consignment of calves from Knock to Rennes in France. Clarification of certain issues was immediately requested and this was provided by the exporters' agent and by Balkan Airlines on 19 October.  An inspection was then arranged on 20 October and a trial flight, accompanied by a veterinary inspector, was sanctioned for 21 October.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that the carriage of calves by air from Ireland was last effected in the early 1970s and the penning arrangements in the planes used at that time were considerably different from the two-tiered penning system presented in this plane.</P>
      <P>The trial consignment consisted of 210 calves from Northern Ireland and the flight took place on Friday, 21 October.  A report was compiled by the veterinary inspector which drew attention to certain problems.  Having examined the report, the veterinary authorities of the Department decided that a second trial flight was necessary and this decision was conveyed to the parties concerned on Wednesday 26 October.  There was no undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is still the situation and it is a matter for the commercial interests involved to arrange the second trial flight before a final decision can be taken on the plane's suitability for the transport of calves.  My Department has to be satisfied about the welfare of these calves while being transported to the Continent, otherwise serious repercussions could ensue.  I make no apology for ensuring that a high standard of <Col N="1697" /> welfare prevails and that is the over-riding factor that has governed all my Department's actions in this affair.  Considerable numbers of live animals are exported and it is in our interest to ensure that the highest possible standards are observed.  We have to be absolutely satisfied with the type of transport.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion recently about the decision of the ferry companies and about animal welfare generally.  We have a very large and well developed beef processing sector in which a great deal of public investment has been made.  That industry also provides valuable employment.  The export of live animals to the Continent has continued and progress has been made in getting alternative transport arrangements. There has been no adverse effect on the price of cattle.  We should avoid talking ourselves into a crisis where one does not exist.</P>

Is é sin go mbeidh cúraimí sláinte curtha ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga féin agus go mbeadh rialacha nó cód cleachtais leagtha síos ag an Aire do na boird sláinte a dheimhneodh go gcuirfí na cúraimí seo ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i nGaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar is eol do gach duine is mionlach iad lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sa tír seo agus mar mhionlach tábhachtach ba cheart go dtabharfaí a gceartanna dóibh.  Níl sé sin ag tarlú i láthair na huaire.  Duine ar bith a théann isteach go dtí Ospidéal Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe, is minic a fheiceann sé seandaoine agus gasraí nach bhfuil aon Bhéarla acu. Bhí mé féin istigh san ospidéal faoi dhó agus tharla go raibh daoine ann nach raibh aon Bhéarla acu.  I gcás amháin bhí duine ag fanacht sa gcasualty le haghaidh seirbhíse agus fágadh ann é ar <Col N="1698" /> feadh cúpla uair a chloig.  Bhí an duine seo ag iarraidh dul go dtí an leithreas. Rinne sé a mhíle dhícheall é seo a chur in iúl do na banaltrí agus do na dochtúirí a bhí i láthair ach ní raibh duine ná deoraí san áit a thuig céard a bhí á rá aige.  Bá mhór an náire é sin i gcúrsaí sláinte.</P>
    <P>I gcás eile a chonaic mé bhí duine istigh i gceann de na bardaí san ospidéal céanna ar feadh cúpla seachtain agus gan focal Béarla aige.  Sa chás sin bhí sé d'ádh ar an duine sin go raibh duine sa leaba taobh leis gurb as an Ghaeltacht dó freisin.  Bhí ar an duine sin an t-aistriúchán a dhéanamh le go dtuigfeadh na dochtúirí agus na banaltraí cad a bhí á iarraidh ag an duine gan Béarla.  Nuair a bhíodh deoch uisce fiú á iarraidh, chaithfí aistriuchán a dhéanamh.  Ní chreidfeadh duine go bhféadfadh a leithéid a tharlú in Éirinn sa lá atá inniu ann ach tá sé ag tarlú.  Is scannal eile é an chaoi a gcaitear le seandaoine as Gaeltacht Chonamara a chuirtear soir go dtí an tospidéal i mBaile Locha Riach, áit nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge ag bunáite na foirne.  Tá sé do-chreite smaoineamh sa lá seo go gcuirtear daoine atá ar bheagán Bhéarla &mdash; agus tá go leor de sheandaoine Chonamara ar bheagán Bhéarla, agus cuid acu gan aon Bhéarla acu &mdash; go gcuirtear soir iad go dtí áit stráinséartha nach bhfuil a dteanga féin le fáil ann agus cuirtear cúram orthu trí mhéan an Bhéarla.  Ar bhonn chearta daonna níl sé seo sásúil.  Caithfear deireadh a chur leis.  Caithfear féachaint chuige go bhfuil an fhoireann curtha ar fáil chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na seirbhísí seo ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i dteanga na Gaeilge.  Caithfear a chinntiú freisin go bhfuil dóthain soláthair déanta go mbeadh cúram do sheandaoine curtha ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht trí Ghaeilge.  Ní ceart go mbeadh lucht na Gaeltachta nó lucht na Gaeilge mar mhionlach gan cearta in a dtír féin.  Tugtar go leor ómóis bhéil don Ghaeilge ach go minic ní dhéantar aon fhreastal ar an dream is boichte agus ar an dream is sine agus ar an dream is óige gurb í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga acu.  Iarraim ar an Aire a chinntiú go leagfar síos cód <Col N="1699" /> cleachtais do na boird sláinte a dheimhneódh go bhfuil a gcearta teanga tugtha do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus a chinnteodh go bhfuil an fhoireann curtha ar fáil a bheadh in ann na seirbhísí seo a chur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge do na daoine seo agus nach leanfaidh an scannal seo níos faide.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House.  The failure of the Minister to implement in full the Child Care Act, 1991, initiated in 1988, is bordering on criminal negligence.  The need for the legislation was recognised by the Minister when, as Opposition spokesman, he contributed to the Second Stage debate of the Bill on 14 June 1988, columns 184, 185 and 186 of the Official Report of 14 June 1988 refer.</P>
      <P>The need for the legislation was obvious to everybody in this House. The legislation initiated in 1988 was dealt with by a number of Governments in its course through the House and eventually became available for passing into law.  I do not wish to be personal but it is a sad reflection on the Minister for Health that after two years in office, during which time it was his prerogative to implement or enact in full the provisions of the Bill, that has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of serious incidents throughout the country in the past number of years have come to light and with which the Minister and everybody in this House is familiar.  The Minister has failed to recognise that the delay in <Col N="1701" /> implementing those main provisions of the Bill has obviously put a number of children at risk.</P>
    <P>The mere appointment of additional social workers, while welcome, does not address the serious problems such as ensuring that children are put in a place of safety or the removal of the person or persons likely to pose a threat to the safety or well-being of the child concerned. A supervision order would enable health boards to carry out as many visits as necessary to safeguard a child's safety.  The need for regular supervision and inspection of residential centres must be obvious to everyone, particularly in view of several recent tragic events which time does not allow me to go into in detail.  Suffice to say, without referring to the particular cases, that the Minister is well aware of the need to ensure that the provisions which would eliminate the situations that have arisen could be implemented without further delay.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the Minister is a deeply caring and conscientious person &mdash; I have no reason to disbelieve that and will not make any allegation to the contrary &mdash; who genuinely wishes to ensure the maximum protection of children as envisaged under the Act.  Unfortunately, by his procrastination in this instance, he is prolonging the threat to children at risk throughout the country in residential centres or in their homes. Any further delay in the enactment of the remaining important sections of the Act may put the health of certain children at risk at best and, at worst, their lives may be in danger.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to act now because tomorrow may be too late.  I refer him to the debate on 14 June 1988 where, as reported at column 184 of the Official Report he stated: &ldquo;Parts III and IV contain the core issues&rdquo;.  If I were talking to a Minister who did not understand the situation or was not familiar with the health portfolio or did not have a good track record of highlighting health issues in the House, I would say <Col N="1702" /> there was some excuse but I am speaking to a Minister who is familiar with the urgent need to implement the provisions of the Act in full.  All 77 sections were deemed necessary at the time as is patently obvious to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>At the publication of the Kilkenny incest report, I announced that the Child Care Act, 1991, would be brought into operation in its entirety by the end of 1996.  I am advised that this is the shortest possible timeframe required to have the necessary infrastructure in place to give real meaning and substance to the legislative provisions.  The circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Kelly Fitzgerald have reinforced my resolve to ensure that this is achieved.</P>
      <P>The full and proper implementation of the Child Care Act is the single most important contribution that can be made towards promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  I am disappointed at the criticism expressed about the timeframe for implementation of the legislation.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not prepared to sign orders bringing further sections of the Act into force until I know that the structures, services and staffing required to operate them are in place and effective on the ground.  Such a knee-jerk reaction would completely undermine the enormous efforts we are making to build up the child care and family support services, to recruit the best personnel and to build the physical infrastructure to respond effectively to the new demands that will be placed on health boards under this wide-ranging legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase in the programme for the implementation of the Act involves the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to <Col N="1703" /> children in their care.  These provisions will strengthen the powers of the health boards, the gardaí and the courts to intervene in cases of child abuse and neglect.  The neeed for the early implementation of these priority provisions has been underlined in the Kilkenny report.</P>
    <P>I explained to the House previously that these are complex provisions.  Various sets of new regulations, as well as rules of court, are required to give full effect to them.  I am determined that the parts in question will be brought into operation in the shortest possible timeframe and extensive preparatory work is under way in my Department to ensure that this is achieved.  Two working groups were established to assist my Department in the preparation of the initial drafts of the new regulations relating to foster and residential care. The foster care working group has completed its task and yesterday I circulated the draft regulations prepared by it to the various interest groups.  The residential care working group is at an advanced stage in its deliberations and it is my intention that its draft will also be the subject of widespread consultations.</P>
    <P>When I took up office I was determined to find real resources to implement this Act.  I have secured unprecedented levels of funding for the child care services to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is put in place to support the Child Care Act and that the health boards will be in a position to discharge the additional statutory responsibilities assigned to them under the legislation.  I have approved a range of new child care and family support services, the full year cost of which is an additional £20 million.  The scale of these developments demonstrate in the most tangible and concrete way possible my determination to ensure that the Act is not simply implemented on paper but is backed up by a sustained programme of investment.</P>
    <P>Among the important new measures <Col N="1704" /> I have sanctioned are the creation of over 370 new posts for the child care services throughout the country; the provision of additional hostel places for homeless children; the establishment of new family resource centres and community support projects to assist disadvantaged children; the expansion of the homemaker and home help services to help families in difficulty and the establishment of community mother programmes in a number of health board areas; increased financial support to pre-school services in areas of social deprivation and the provision of additional places; the development of foster care and other alternative family placement services.</P>
    <P>In approving the various new child care initiatives I have outlined, I placed special emphasis on strengthening the health boards multidisciplinary child protection teams.  A significant proportion of the 370 new social worker, child care worker, child psychiatrist, psychologist and other specialist posts that I approved have been created specifically to enhance the capacity of the health boards to combat the horrendous problem of child abuse and to provide a range of supports to the unfortunate victims of such abuse and their families.</P>
    <P>It is my firm intention and that of the Government to implement the Child Care Act in the shortest possible timeframe and to put in place a comprehensive framework of support services for children.</P>

      <P>The Air Corps flew a total of 9,854 hours in 1993 and not 4,936 as stated by the Deputy.  Based on the correct figures (1,035 out of 9,854) the percentage of time spent on ministerial transport was 10 per cent as against the 21 per cent claimed by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy objective with regard to the licensing of aquaculture and mariculture development is to ensure that <Col N="1490" /> such developments take place in an orderly and well regulated manner, with full respect for other interests and in harmony with the environment while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy, in terms of jobs and revenue.</P>
    <P>All applications for licences to engage in fish farming are subject to comprehensive evaluation by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together all relevant expertise from within the Department and from the Central Fisheries Board. Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals.  This evaluation is further informed by public consultative procedures which are fully comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The timescale, and the outcome, of the decision making process in individual cases inevitably varies depending on the technical considerations and particular local circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in mussel cultivation in Bantry Bay.  Some 30 applications for licensing are outstanding.  The Department is most anxious to finalise the licensing of the mussel industry in Bantry.</P>
    <P>For navigational safety reasons among others it is necessary to confine aquaculture development to certain well defined areas within Bantry Bay. However the Department's efforts to date to regularise mussel culture in the bay have been hampered by unresolved difficulties at local level and the absence of a local consensus.</P>
    <P>At my direction, senior technical staff of the Department met in Bantry earlier this week with representatives of the local mussel farming co-operative and other local interests with a view to getting consensus on the areas to be considered for licensing for aquaculture purposes in Bantry Bay.</P>
    <P>The Department will continue to work with the Bantry mussel farmers and other local interest to finalise these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> The Department is processing a large number of applicants for Dunmanus Bay and Roaringwater Bay.  These applications still have to undergo the evaluation process to which all aquaculture licensing proposals are subject.</P>
    <P>A significant number of applications for shellfish cultivation in both of these bays have been recently cleared for advertising by the Aquaculture Licensing Vetting Committee.  The applicants in question are being notified by the Department and arrangements are being agreed for publication of the proposals in the press at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>The very positive contribution of aquaculture to jobs and exports has been fully recognised under the National Development Plan.  Investment under the plan has the potential to generate significant new jobs directly in the sector over the period.  Jobs will also be created in the added value processing and marketing sectors.</P>
    <P>Reflecting the continued growth potential of aquaculture, particularly shellfish cultivation, a substantial number of applications (including those for the bays I have already mentioned) are with the Department.  Every effort is being made to expedite the assesementevaluation processes and bring licensing applications to finality.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine has examined the Convention on the <Col N="1492" /> Law of the Sea from the perspective of: sea fisheries policy; marine research; maritime safety; search and rescue arrangements; marine environmental matters; shipping policy and State foreshore jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Department has concluded that the present statutory, administrative and international co-operative framework within the areas for which it is responsible fulfils the requirements of the Convention.  No initiatives are called for, therefore, on my part when the Convention comes into force on 16 November next or upon ratification of the Convention by Ireland.</P>
      <P>This is the position, moreover, in relation to Article 123 of the Convention which the Deputy has focused on in particular in her question.  The Article deals with co-operation between States bordering enclosed or semi-enclosed seas and provides that States bordering such seas should co-operate with each other in the exercise of their rights and in the performance of their duties under the Convention.  The Article focuses, in particular, on living resources, the marine environment, scientific research and the role of international organisations. In each of these areas there is detailed and thoroughgoing co-operation with the United Kingdom and I am glad to advise the Deputy that this operates on a North/South basis as well as on an Ireland/UK basis.  I would instance the following by way of example:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Irish Sea Science Co-ordination Group, an Irish/UK group which advises on the potential for better research and monitoring of environmental issues</P>
      <P>&mdash;the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) an international body in which Ireland, the UK and other States co-operate on marine matters generally, including those related to the Irish Sea</P>

    <P>&mdash;the finalisation of a Memorandum of Understanding at present <Col N="1493" /> between Ireland and the UK on mutual co-operation and assistance in search and rescue and pollution control matters in the Irish Sea. </P>
    <P>There are many other examples; in aggregate they more than satisfy the aspirations of Article 123.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concerns in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea has been used for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium to and from Sellafield for several years.  Up to now the route for transporting materials from Europe for reprocessing at Sellafield has been by rail and ferry.  While British Nuclear Fuel's transport arrangements are not subject to public consultation, they have disclosed their intention to use an irradiated fuel carrier to transport materials direct from European ports.  It is claimed that the rerouted European business will not increase the throughput at Barrow because the bulk of spent fuel from Japan for reprocessing has already arrived at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat, but not greatly, reassured by the fact that before direct shipments from European ports at Barrow-on-Furness can begin, the relevant requirements of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels (the INF Code) must be met and registerd as such with the United Kingdom's Marine Safety Agency.  Advance notification of voyages through territorial waters of coastal states will also have to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's stated opposition to the <Col N="1494" /> reprocessing facility at Sellafield.  Our concerns about the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea are fundamental ones.  The implications of an accident or collision need no spelling out by me to this House.</P>
    <P>At a very minimum, we want to have advance notification of the transiting of a ship carrying nuclear fuel through the Irish Sea.  This is being pursued with the UK authorities.  In ongoing discussions at international level on the INF Code the Department has consistently argued for the following additional requirements to be put in place</P>
    <P>&mdash;decisive route planning and notification and consultation with coastal states while in transit</P>
    <P>&mdash;the restriction and exclusion of certain routes</P>
    <P>&mdash;an emergency response plan in the voyage plan in respect of the ship and cargo</P>
    <P>&mdash;a compulsory requirement to salvage radioactive material and predetermination of responsibility for this in the voyage plan. </P>
    <P>Our efforts in this respect, for which we have some support from other states, will continue.</P>
    <P>We are also pushing to have the Irradiated Nuclear Fuels Code incorporated into two EU Directives dealing with reporting arrangements for ships visiting Community ports or transiting Community waters.  This would at least ensure that all types of radioactive wastes being carried on ships would have to be notified in advance and would allow for &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; systems to be put in place.  As I have said, these are our minimum requirements given the prospect of continuing traffic on the high seas of radioactive materials.  Our overall concerns about the hazards arising from discharges and operations at Sellafield will continue to be articulated at the highest level.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends taking to deal with the potential hazard to the health of the communities living along the west and southwest coasts as a result of two dumps of chemical weapons, including nerve and mustard gas, seized from the Nazis at the end of the Second World War and dumped by the British Navy between 1945 and 1957 off the Atlantic shelf; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the dumping of chemical munitions in the North Atlantic by the UK authorities between 1945 and 1957 first came into the public <Col N="1496" /> domain in 1986.  Details furnished by the UK authorities at that time showed the nearest dump site to be approximately 65 miles off the Donegal coast at a depth of 3,000 feet of water.  The weapons were disposed of by scuttling loaded ships in depths of water from 3,000 down to 8,000 feet.</P>
      <P>Scientific assessments then and now on foot of the renewed concerns expressed in recent weeks, indicate that, given the properties of the chemicals (being either quickly soluble in, or heavier than, water), the sea depth at which they were dumped and the considerable number of years which have elapsed, the weapons are not considered to pose a hazard to the health or fishing activities of our coastal communities.</P>

      <P>Trials have been under way in consultation with fishermen into possible alternative fishing techniques in the tuna fishery.  The methods tested were:</P>
      <P> (a) trolling &mdash; the use of a number of surface towed lines, towed from two large poles from either side of a boat;</P>
      <P>(b) pair pelagic trawling &mdash; this involves two boats towing a pelagic net close to the surface.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on the results of the trials is being completed and the results will be published shortly.  I understand that valuable experience has been gained in the course of these trials which showed that, in reasonable weather conditions, pair trawling produced very encouraging catch results.

      <P>The main works contract for the ferry terminal development project in Dún Laoghaire was placed at the end of July 1994.  The main contractor for the project has informed me that some 127 people are at present directly employed on site.  It is expected that direct employment will rise to 350 people after Christmas 1994.</P>
      <P>A similar number are employed off site by suppliers and sub-contractors fabricating items for scheduled delivery to the site.  Of the current workforce both on and off the site it is estimated that about 50 per cent live within a 30 mile radius of the works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current work on site is of a specialist nature including piling, marine craft operations and plant operations.  Many of the operatives involved are long term skilled employees who are generally deployed from site to site as required, usually staying in local accommodation. It is usually in a contractor's financial <Col N="1498" /> interest to employ casual labour from the locality.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the schedule prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence, my wife and I left Ireland with President and Mr. Robinson on a State visit to Poland on 20 June.  We travelled from Tralee to Dublin Airport by Air Corps transport where we joined the President's party.  From Dublin Airport we travelled to Frankfurt on a scheduled Aer Lingus flight, EI 658, and connected to Warsaw on a scheduled Lot Airlines fight, LO 380.</P>
      <P>In participating in the State visit to Poland, my wife and I fulfilled a responsibility which falls to all Foreign Ministers and their spouses under international practice governing State visits.</P>
      <P>Our responsibilities in this area have previously included joining the President and Mr. Robinson on State visits to Spain and to New Zealand.  Despite the demands which a young family of three make on her time, my wife has made arrangements to accompany me on each of these occasions.</P>
      <P>Where other business has prevented us from participating in State visit, as in the case of the State visit to India last year and the visits in Africa this year, the President has been accompanied by another Minister and spouse.</P>
      <P>Official talks between host and visiting Ministers covering trade, economic and political matters from an important component of all such visits.  In addition to talks with the Polish Foreign Minister, Andrzej Olechowski, I participated in talks with President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister, Waldemar Pawlak, the Marshall of the Sejm (lower House of Parliament) Josef Oleski, the Marshall of the Senate, Adam Struzik, members of the Polish-Irish Parliamentary group, and a broad cross-section of Polish business leaders and representatives of Irish business interests in Poland.  My wife and I attended a State dinner hosted by President Walesa and attended by Foreign Minister Olechowski and Mrs. Olechowski.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of my official commitments at Corfu my wife and I, as previously arranged, left the President's party, two days before the conclusion of the State visit, on Wednesday afternoon, 22 June. The Government jet left Baldonnel on Wednesday morning, bearing Minister Joan Burton and her spouse who were to accompany President Robinson for <Col N="1501" /> the remainder of the State visit to Poland.  The jet also carried three officials who were due to attend the European Council in Corfu.</P>
    <P>My wife and I joined the flight at Warsaw with two further officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Government jet arrived in Corfu at 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>My wife remained on the jet which was in any event scheduled to return to Dublin to bring the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, and 11 officials to Corfu.  It arrived at Baldonnel at 10.45 p.m. on Wednesday evening.</P>
    <P>At Baldonnel, an Air Corps Beechcraft was provided to return my wife to Farranfore Airport.  She arrived there at midnight and returned home to Tralee, arriving at her ultimate point of departure at 12.30 a.m.</P>

    <P>The gain to the Exchequer from confining these reliefs to the standard rate of 27 per cent is estimated to be of the order of £390 million.  This estimate is tentative and is subject to a margin of error.</P>
    <P>The estimate of yield does not include any yield from confining medical insurance relief to the standard rate as provision has already been made in the 1994 Finance Act for this change to take effect on a phased basis from 6 April, 1995.</P>

      <i>Notes on table</i>
    </P>
    <P>  (1) The figure for PAYE covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of self-employed individuals, including farmers.</P>
    <P>(2) Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of deposit interest retention tax referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(3) This heading includes tax paid on income from trades and professions &mdash; including farming &mdash; together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified.  It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.</P>
    <P>The figures also take into account tax repayments made to exempt individuals and bodies, such as charities and pension funds, in respect of tax deducted at source, such as income paid under covenants, or of tax credits attaching to company distributions.</P>
    <P>Figures of tax attributable to income assessed under the various case headings of Schedule D are included under the appropriate headings in the table. Statistics are not available which would <Col N="1510" /> enable these figures to be separately identified.</P>
    <P>The estimated additional yield to income tax in 1994 under the tax amnesty is not included in the figures supplied.  The tax amnesty is a separate category in the budget tables and it accounted for an estimated yield of £242 million in the budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>In considering the table, it should be borne in mind that the PAYE sector accounts for the vast majority of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by section 4 of the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973, provided for the reinstatement in the Civil Service of women who had resigned their positions for the purposes of, on or following marriage in certain limited circumstances,<i>viz.</i> if they were widowed, if they did not marry or if it was established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that they were not being supported by their husbands.  I should clarify the position in relation to the Labour Court Determination to which the Deputy refers.  Far from finding that the reinstatement provisions are discriminatory against women, the Labours Court found that these provisions discriminate in favour of certain women and against other women and all men. Having considered the arguments put forward by the parties, the Labour Court concluded that the whole scheme for the reinstatement of some women in the Civil Service is discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment. Having regard to the changes in relation to the employment of women since the provisions were enacted, the court took the view that there is now no justification in making special provision to enable some women to be readmitted to the Civil Service through exceptional procedures and that all recruitment to the service should be open competition through the Civil Service Commission. They recommended that the reinstatement provisions should be replaced.</P>

      <Col N="1517" /> In replying to a question on 27 October 1993, I informed the House that, having taken legal advice on the matter.

In answer to a further question on 3 March last, I informed the House that a Bill had been drafted to give effect to the Labour Court Determination but that further action in relation to it had been deferred pending the outcome to a challenge to the determination which had been initiated in the High Court by the complaint in the case.  That case is still pending and the matter will be given further consideration when the views of the High Court are to hand.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, women who resigned for marriage related reasons have the opportunity to re-enter the Civil Service through open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners. A development of some relevance in this regard is the raising of the upper age limit for most competitions to 50 years of age.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 93 to 98 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As part of a package aimed at creating and maintaining employment, a series of reforms in the PRSI system were introduced in this year's budget, including (i) a two-tier employers' PRSI contribution structure, with a new lower rate of 9 per cent applying in respect of employees earning less that £173 per week, (ii) exemption from paying the health contribution and youth training levy for employees, self-employed and occupational pensioners earning less than £173 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined cost of these concessions estimated at budget time, was £89 million in a full year.  This cost also included the cost of exempting. <Col N="1520" /> employers from paying levies in respect of those employees who are holders of medical cards.  In order to partly offset the cost of the reduction in employers' PRSI, the ceiling on the employers' PRSI contribution was raised to £25,800.</P>
    <P>It was estimated that up to 400,000 employees and occupational pensioners and 60,000 self-employed will benefit from one or more elements of this package.</P>
    <P>The current estimated full year yield to the Exchequer in 1994-95 terms from employee PRSI, health contribution levy and youth employment levy is £760 million.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer of a 1 per cent reduction in Class A employees' PRSI is £89 million and the estimated cost of a 1 per cent reduction in Class A employer's PRSI is £96 million in 1995-96 terms.</P>
    <P>It is estimated, in 1995-96 terms, that a uniform rate of 4.3 per cent employees' PRSI would have to be applied to all employees in all payment classes in order to achieve the current estimated employee PRSI yield.  If a uniform rate of 5.5 per cent was applied to all employees it is estimated that the additional full year yield to the Exchequer would be in the region of £150 million.</P>

      <P>The deserted wives benefit scheme was introduced as a response to a particular need which arose for some married women whose husbands had left them, many of whom had given up paid employment on marriage.  This need still exists.  There is to my knowledge, no comparable insurance scheme relating to desertion in any other EU country.</P>
      <P>To avoid a sudden withdrawal of benefit the income limit for the scheme is tapered and entitlement is graduated from £10,000 to £14,000.  As a result those who qualify for a reduced entitlement, i.e. with income of between £10,000 and £14,000, still receive a full allowance for each child dependant.  A small number of women is affected by this income limit.</P>

    <P>There is no figures available regarding the percentage of general practitioners who refuse to issue final medical certificates on the basis of unfitness for work.  However, of the number of cases medically certified as unfit for work, over 21 per cent of these examined by medical referees in 1993 were found capable.</P>
    <P>These person concerned was examined on 15 August 1994 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was not incapable of work.  A deciding officer then decided that he was not entitled to disability benefit.  He appealed against this decision and was examined again on 7 October 1994 by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was not incapable of work.  The social welfare appeals office is at present reviewing this case and an oral hearing of the appeal is being arranged.  All the relevant medical evidence will be available to the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is one of a number of increases of social welfare pensions which may be payable with the personal rate of pension depending on the circumstances of the pensioner.  The other increases which can be payable are increases for an adult dependant, increases for a child <Col N="1527" /> dependant and increases where the pensioner has attained the age of 80 years. These increases are an integral part of the social welfare pension.  The question of paying them independently or with social security pensions from other countries, which are often calculated on quite different bases, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy objectives for the Defence Forces are quite clear.  The revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which were published last year take full account of the changes which have occurred in the international environment.  A major review of the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces is at present being conducted under the auspices of the Efficiency Audit Group.  The objective of the review is to ensure that the Defence Forces are staffed, trained, accommodated and equipped to meet their assigned roles as effectively as possible.  There are no plans at present to publish a White Paper on Defence.</P>

      <P>The efficiency audit group has completed two studies of administration in the Defence area; the first dealt with the Department of Defence; the second with military administration.  When these reports were considered together by Government in April 1993, it was decided to delegate substantial budgetary authority to the military authorities in line with one of the options identified by the group.  Control over approximately £46 million from the Defence Vote has now been delegated to the military authorities in the areas of procurement and allowances.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Operational Programme provides for a comprehensive fisheries development plan designed to maintain and strengthen the fishing industry's contribution to the national economy.</P>
      <P>The planned investment of over £140 million over the programme's six year period from 1994 to 1999 will be carefully targeted to maintain and strengthen the contribution of the fisheries sector to the national economy and in particular its contribution to the generation of growth and employment in the coastal communities.</P>
      <P>This investment will underpin an integrated programme of development in the fisheries sector, which covers the following areas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" />&mdash;the fishing fleet</P>
    <P>&mdash;fish processing and marketing</P>
    <P>&mdash;aquaculture</P>
    <P>&mdash;fishery harbours and</P>
    <P>&mdash;training. </P>
    <P>The details of the operational programme and, in particular, the allocations of funding between the various areas, the eligibility criteria for the measures and the procedures for applying for grant-aid have not yet been finalised.  These details will be part of the detailed Operational Programme for the fisheries sector, which is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>As regards the fishing fleet in particular, the main aim of the proposed investment is to modernise and restructure the fleet in order to develop it to its maximum potential.</P>
    <P>The general objective of the fleet development programme is to bring about a sustainable balance between the fleet and available fish resources.  Particular aims will be to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;improve and modernise the fleet</P>
    <P>&mdash;to enhance operational safety</P>
    <P>&mdash;to improve the handling and hygiene standards</P>
    <P>&mdash;to maximise the quantity, value and quality of landings by increasing take up of currently underutilised quota and non-quota stocks</P>
    <P>&mdash;to maintain maximum employment consistent with long term viability. </P>
    <P>The implementation of this development programme will be pursued through a wide range of specific measures including grants for modernisation, the introduction of a decommissioning scheme and steps to facilitate the selective entry of new modern vessels in the white fish sector.</P>
    <P>The details of this programme are at present being finalised with the European Commission and I expect to be in a position to publish a comprehensive programme in due course.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan a sum of some £5 million is being made available over the period to 1999 towards the undertaking of priority coastal protection works.  In order to achieve the best mix of projects coastal local authorities have been asked to submit details of their top four priority projects to the Department along with a cost-benefit appraisal for each project.  Consideration will be given by the Department to each project submitted having regard to the benefits arising and available funding. Ballycotton will be duly considered in the event that Cork County Council submit it as one of their priority projects.</P>

      <P>The shares in this commonage are vested in the shareholders and registered on their folios as undivided shares.  The Land Commission formulated a scheme to divide the commonage at the request of the shareholders and in 1987 all of the shareholders signed agreements consenting to the scheme.  The commonage was divided on the ground and the next step was to vest the shareholders as owners of the defined plots in place of the undivided shares.  Subsequently a dispute arose between the shareholders. As the scheme is a voluntary scheme the resolution of this dispute was left to the shareholders.  Earlier this year the Land <Col N="1559" /> Commission was informed that the dispute had been resolved and it is, at present, working on the scheme with a view to registering the division as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In the three year transition period which terminates at end February 1995, and follows from the revision of eligibility arrangements in 1991, my Department has centrally agreed with the VHI Board a level of total reimbursement for public health agencies in respect of all VHI subscribers availing of private facilities in public hospitals.  This global figure has been allocated among the individual agencies concerned by my Department having regard to their income generation potential.

      <P>In the context of my Department's new regulatory role in the operation of the EU Single Market in health insurance it is no longer possible to continue this centralised system with one insurer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>I informed the House on 12 October &mdash; Official Report Volume 445 No. 7, Columns 1551-1552 &mdash; that my Department had issued to the health agencies a health services waste policy and a strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy document states that disposal methods should be appropriate, safe and hygenic and should be in accordance with the principle of best practicable environmental option.  A group in my Department has been researching the options and has concluded that the options are incineration to a high environmental standard or use of the new technologies such as shredding and disinfection by microwaves, steam or chemicals.  Whichever method is chosen the cost of equipment is such <Col N="1567" /> that a small number of plants is the best economic solution.  Computer modelling of the problem indicates four treatment centres, two in Dublin and one each in Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>The precise option adopted for any health board area will be a matter for agreement with the health agencies in that area.  My Department has written to the health boards and major hospitals proposing a strategic plan which will be the subject of discussion.  The plan envisages four treatment centres, as stated above, employing one of the new treatment technologies, some operated by health boards and some by private contractor.  This represents my preferred option, but, as I have said, the ultimate configuration of disposal facilities which will emerge from the process will be a matter for negotiation and agreement with the health agencies.</P>
    <P>A company named Waste to Energy Ltd. has applied for planning permission and a licence for an incineration plant to deal with health care and confidential paper waste.  The position as far as my Department is concerned is that this is a commercial undertaking and there is no commitment by the Department to send health care waste to it at this stage.</P>
    <P>Health care waste, by definition, is waste which arises as a result of the provision of health care.  As such it arises in every hospital in the country, in greater or lesser quantities depending on the nature and level of health care being provided.  The detailed information requested by Deputy Durkan is not readily available in my Department. The general current practice is that the part of health care waste which requires special treatment is incinerated.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the present generation of hospital incinerators would not fully meet the stringent requirements of emerging EU Directives but I am determined that a successful outcome will be achieved in relation to the process which is currently taking place to solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 183 to 186, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Inspections are carried out by officials of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as well as by officers from my Department and comprehensive statistics of inspections are not held centrally.  Such inspections take place with no advance warning to the animal house involved.  No infringements were reported to my Department for the year 1992.</P>
      <P>Directive 86/609EEC on the Protection of Animals used for Scientific and other Experimental Purposes was implemented here by statutory regulation. Persons wishing to engage in experiments on living animals must be licensed by the Minister for Health under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, as amended to take account of Directive 86/609EEC.  Applicants must submit detailed application forms which are scrutinised by inspectors appointed under the Act.  The experiment or procedure on live animals for which a licence is being sought must be certified as being essential and that no alternative technique to the use of animals is available.  There are also strict controls on the sources of supply of animals.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to keep the level of experimentation on live animals to the absolute minimum and to ensure that no pain, suffering distress or lasting harm are inflicted unnecessarily. However, the balance of medical and scientific opinion at present is that properly controlled animal experimentation does contribute to advances which lead to the saving of human life and the alleviation of human suffering.  Some experimentation will therefore continue to be necessary in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for licences to conduct experiments on living animals are advised that the information contained in their licence applications will be <Col N="1570" /> treated in confidence by the licensing authority and the inspectors.  I am satisfied that the degree of confidentiality allowed to licence holders and institutions in this regard is reasonable. Directive 86/609 recognises that in exchanging information between member states in this area the requirements of confidentiality be respected.</P>
    <P>Funding for mediccal research is allocated by the Health Research Board on the basis of proposals submitted by individual agencies such as teaching hospitals and universities.  The board has not to date received any proposals for projects to develop alternative methods of research not involving painful experiments on living animals.  The European Commission has recently approved the establishment of a European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods.  This centre is being set up to encourage the development and validation of alternative techniques which would involve fewer animals and less painful procedures and ultimately to replace animal testing with reliable non-animal methods.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Commission in this area.</P>

      <P>The organisation of hospital services in a region is, in the first instance, a matter for the health board concerned.  In turn, health boards allocate resources to hospitals having regard to the level of services which are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the decision referred <Col N="1571" /> to by the Deputy concerns the delivery of orthopaedic services in the south-eastern region.  The position is that the South-Eastern Health Board decided to centralise orthopaedic trauma at Waterford Regional Hospital and elective orthopaedic work for the south-eastern region at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>In the case of Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital, considerable additional resources have been made available under the waiting list initiatives of 1993 and 1994.  These funds will enable the hospital perform an extra 719 orthopaedic operations, including an additional 133 hip replacement operations during this period.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a programme of refurbishment commenced with a grant from my Department of £100,000.  It is intended that this programme of upgrading will be ongoing for some time and in this regard I have approved a further capital grant of £100,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>There are no plans in my Department to close Kilcreene and I am satisfied that the hospital will continue to discharge a very important role in the delivery of hospital services in the south-eastern region.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's current personnel policy, each agency has responsibility for identifying manpower requirements. Proposals for the filling of new and replacement permanent posts are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.  While <Col N="1573" /> these arrangements require agencies to submit all proposed permanent appointments to my Department, there has been no delay in clearing appointments in agencies which are operating within their approved financial and employment parameters.</P>
      <P>Within these parameters, agencies are permitted to employ staff including nursing staff on a temporary or locum basis without applying to my Department. My Department's Health Service Personnel Census indicates that there were a total of 26,303 nurses expressed in wholetime equivalence employed in the health service at the end of 1993. This represents an increase of 437 w.t.e. over the comparable end 1992 figure.</P>
      <P>Over £40 million extra has been provided this year to further develop <i>inter alia</i> acute hospital and mental handicap services and to implement the EC directive on nurse training on a phased basis. A significant part of this increased funding is being invested in additional nursing posts which will give rise to a further increase in overall nursing numbers this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  Arrangements for the collation of statistical data from the health boards relating to the reporting and investigation of alleged child abuse and neglect, including child sexual abuse, are currently being reviewed by my Department in the context of obtaining more comprehensive information from the <Col N="1574" /> boards regarding the incidence and outcome of cases.  This process has of necessity given rise to some delay in the compilation of information in respect of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The dramatic increase in recent years in the number of suspected cases of child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, being reported to the health boards is a matter of grave concern to all of us.  I am committed to ensuring, as far as is humanly possible, that children are protected from abuse of all kinds.  I want to reiterate that the full and proper implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, is the single most important contribution that can be made towards promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  This is fully recognised by the Government which is committed to bringing the Act into operation in its entirety by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>The next phase in the programme for the implementation of the Act involves the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will strengthen the powers of the health boards, the Garda and the courts to intervene in cases of child abuse and neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained to the House on previous occasions, these are the most complex provisions of the Act.  Various sets of new regulations, as well as rules of court, are required to be made in order to give full effect to them.  I am determined that the Parts in question will be brought into operation next year.  Extensive preparatory work is currently under way in my Department to ensure that this is achieved.  Two working groups were established to assist my Department in the preparation of the initial drafts of the new regulations relating to foster care and residential care.  The foster care working group has completed its task and yesterday I circulated the draft regulations prepared by <Col N="1575" /> it to the various interest groups for comment. The residential care working group is at an advanced stage in its deliberations and it is my intention that its draft will also be the subject of widespread consultations with interested parties.</P>
    <P>Since I took up office, I have secured unprecedented levels of funding for the child care services to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is put in place to support the Child Care Act and that the health boards will be in a position to discharge the additional statutory responsibilities being assigned to them under the legislation.  I have approved a range of new child care and family support services, the full year cost of which is in the region of £20 million.  The scale of these developments demonstrates my determination to ensure that the Act is not simply implemented on paper but is backed up by a sustained programme of investment.</P>
    <P>In approving the various new child care initiatives, I have placed a special emphasis on strengthening the health boards' multi-disciplinary child protection teams.  A significant proportion of the 370 new social worker, child care worker, child psychiatrist, psychologist and other specialist posts that I approved have been created specifically to enhance the capacity of the health boards to combat the horrendous problem of child abuse and to provide a range of supports to the unfortunate victims of such abuse and their families. It is my firm intention that further progress will be made next year in the development of additional measures to deal with child abuse and for the care and protection of children generally.</P>

      <P>I explained that the grant would be paid at the end of the school-year, on receipt of a certificate of attendance from the school authorities.

      <P>In general, to be eligible for transport under the scheme a pupil must live at least three miles from their appropriate post-primary centre and may be transported to that centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live.

In either case, pupils must satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  A service is established only where there is a minimum of seven eligible pupils living within an area which can be reasonably and economically served by a bus route.</P>

      <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators.  Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the primary school transport scheme that there must be sufficient number of eligible children residing in a distinct locality who are available for transport in order to maintain a school transport service.  Currently, nine eligible children are available for transport from the areas mentioned to Knockavilla national school, but this number is expected to drop to seven by Christmas, 1994.  As this is below the minimum number of ten required for the establishment, or maintenance, of a service under the school transport scheme, the question of the continuance of the service must be kept under review, on a quarterly basis. The service will be carefully monitored by my officials between November 1994 and Easter, 1995, to see if the required number of pupils will become available by that time.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a Tipperary rural and business institute is an issue which is appropriate for consideration in the context of the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.  I have asked a steering committee, established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, to advise me on the needs of the sector to the year 2015.  The committee is due to submit an interim report to me later this month.  When I receive the report I will be giving it my urgent attention.</P>

      <P>My Department received an application from the club in question. In excess of 1,400 applications nationally were received under the recreational facilities scheme and in view of the limit on the funds available for the scheme this year it was possible to assist only a proportion of the projects. A grant allocation will be considered in the event of funds being made available for the scheme in 1995.</P>

      <P>Primary schools operate under the Rules for National Schools, which are made by the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The manager of a school is the person, or in the case of a board the body of persons, nominated by the patron and recognised as manager by the Minister for Education.  A manager or board of management duly recognised is charged with the direct governance of the school.  In the discharge of this governance, the board must in some specific instances, e.g. appointment of teachers, obtain the approval of the patron and the Minister. In the general conduct of its affairs, the board is, of course, obliged to comply with the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>Among the sanctions available to me as Minister is the withdrawal of recognition from a board if it fails to observe the rules or if it should appear that the educational interests of the district require it.  The rules provide that such recognition will not be withdrawn without consultation with the patron, board and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>The rules also give the Minister the power to withdraw recognition from a school in certain circumstances.  This provision, which in effect means the termination of grant aid, also affords the Minister control over any board whose governance is not in compliance with the rules.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and managed institutions and the question of forming a board of management in any school is a matter for the management authority of that school; my Department has no function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational schools and community colleges are schools established and operated by vocational education committees, vocational education committees, under the provisions of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Boards of management of these schools are <Col N="1585" /> sub-committees of the vocational education committees and are appointed by the vocational education committees in accordance with section 21 of the Act. The composition, procedure and functions of the boards are set out in the appendix to circular letter No. 73/74, a copy of which I will forward to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the management arrangements provided for in the deeds and indentures of community and comprehensive schools, such schools are administered by boards of managements. The composition, procedure and functions relating to boards of management of community schools are set out in the model deed of trust, a copy of which I will also forward to the Deputy. The corresponding particulars of comprehensive schools are contained in the individual school indentures.</P>
