      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 1, 14 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 13 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m.; (2) the proceedings on No. 1 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice and (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 18 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with No. 13 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 1 satisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals are not satisfactory.  I am concerned about two sections of the Bill.  The Bill provides that it will be a criminal offence to carry an insulting poster.  I asked the Minister many times if she would substitute the word &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;. <Col N="402" /> It is quite possible that the Bill will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court.  I ask the Minister if she will accept an amendment to the Bill at this stage to ensure that it is not referred to the Supreme Court?  Certain sections of the Bill are badly needed to deal with the type of people who stole the hubcaps off my car this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am serious about the matter I raised whatever about being upset about the stealing of my hubcaps. The provision in the Bill which states that it will be a criminal offence to carry an insulting poster goes too far and may be unconstitutional.  Is it possible at this stage to accept amendments to the legislation?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Finance make a personal statement in regard to what she said in the House on 23 November when she clearly stated there was no truth in reports that there were queries from the EU about EU funding for the building of Tallaght hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Members at this time but I expect that matters raised will be relevant to the Order of Business.  The matter being raised by the Deputy is clearly not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more we are hearing <Col N="404" /> more from Tommy Gorman than we hear in this House about the so-called national plan.  It is a hoax of a plan.  It is not only the Minister of State who spoke about EC funding for Tallaght Hospital. On 14 October &mdash; columns 1126 of the Official Report &mdash; the Taoiseach told us that the money was in the plan for Tallaght hospital.  The money is not in the plan and the contract has been signed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the figure £6 billion, £7 billion or £8 billion?  The Taoiseach should tell the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the current questioning, a revised plan is inevitable considering that we are not getting the £8 billion as claimed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations on the plan have been taking place for three months, as is normal in the case of all plans, and Deputy Bruton knows that. Deputy Harney should know it too, and <Col N="405" /> I am sure that Deputy De Rossa, from the time he spent in Europe, knows it. The money for Tallaght Hospital is provided for in the national plan and Deputies need not worry.  Tallaght Hospital will be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 November I asked very detailed and specific questions about Tallaght Hospital and the record shows that the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, told clear untruths in the answers she gave.</P>

      <P>In other jurisdictions when a Minister misleads Parliament, that Minister resigns but in this jurisdiction when a Minister misleads Parliament there is no way of questioning him or her.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to invite the Minister of State to make a statement in the House clarifying exactly why she misled the House in this way.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned yesterday evening I had spoken about the extent to which right wing politicians in Britain and Northern Ireland had exploited the fact that there is a loophole in our extradition laws by claiming unfairly that this country is in some way soft on terrorism.  I suggested they might usefully take a look at this State's effectiveness in dealing with the problem of terrorism.  I expressed the view that, despite the excitement raised in the UK and here by the issue of extradition, it is surprising that there have been so few applications.  It is also surprising that the promised annual report on extradition applications has not been published since 1991.</P>
      <P>I referred also to the difficulty the public has, a public absolutely opposed to the use of violence for political purposes and who strongly abhors what has been happening on this island in the past 25 years, in understanding how this House could have, in 1986, debated and passed legislation which effectively classifies as a political offence the possession of an automatic weapon.  The public also finds it difficult to understand why the Judiciary could have interpreted the laws in such a way as to allow what most decent people would regard as an act of violence or terrorism to be in some way cloaked in respectability by defining it as a political offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that what we have inherited in our extradition laws is an approach to the concept of political offences which, while it was legitimate at the time it evolved, is no longer appropriate.  I pointed out that the tradition of defining a political offence has a long and honourable history, one initiated by the British, which refers to protecting people who <Col N="410" /> have found themselves over the years working under oppressive regimes of one kind or other &mdash; when people who opposed oppressive regimes in their own countries had to take refuge in another state where they were given political asylum.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and we now live in an era of deadly international terrorism. The political exemption clause originated at a time when there was less movement of people between states and when travel was more difficult.  It originated at a time when it was not possible for a person to plant a bomb and then be on a plane to another country before it exploded, a time when the death penalty was much more common, when court procedures were often primitive and when the rights of the accused received scant attention. It was also a time when there were great variations between the standards of justice available in different countries.  Now there are a number of international agreements which, even if not always fully respected, set certain minimum standards for court procedures and the treatment of accused persons.  All of these developments, together with the rise of international terrorism, means that a broad definition of a political offence is a luxury we cannot afford if we are serious about protecting our citizens and those of other countries from the murderous activities of paramilitary gangs.</P>
    <P>For extradition to work successfully between two countries it must be based on mutual respect for each other's laws and judicial procedures.  While the British have been quick to criticise what they regard as shortcomings in our procedures, there has been repeated evidence that their procedures leave much to be desired.  In a number of cases warrants have been received with incorrect names or details, or the British authorities have been unable to satisfactorily identify the people sought.  There has also been the problem of prejudicial comment in the British media &mdash; and in the Ryan case right up to the level of the British Prime Minister &mdash; which raise doubts about the ability of a person to receive a <Col N="411" /> fair trial.  In the Ellis case the charge on which he was extradited was dropped and a different charge substituted, a move which was in breach of all the normal procedures regarding extradition.</P>
    <P>It seems that many of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to the operation of extradition arise not only from the loophole which exists in our legislation, and which we propose to close, but also from the hamfisted way in which the British authorities have operated the extradition procedures, such as they are. Despite these reservations, Democratic Left welcomes this Bill and will not oppose its Second Reading.  The Bill will only close off the loophole identified in the 1987 Act and make a number of procedural changes.  It does not deal with the broader issues involved in extradition and these need to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that many of the problems about extradition could be avoided if we had a requirement that the authorities seeking extradition would have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in an Irish court against the person sought. This would not require a full hearing with witnesses giving evidence in court. It could be done in the same way as persons charged with indictable offences here are dealt with.  A book of evidence is produced for a district judge, who has to satisfy himself that the accused person has a case to answer.  Why can a similar procedure not be operated in extradition cases?  Other countries apply this requirement. Ireland has an extradition treaty with the United States, signed in 1986. Under this treaty a person in this country can be extradited to the US merely on the basis of a valid warrant produced by the US authorities.  However, if the Irish authorities wish to seek the extradition of a person from the US it has to effectively establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in an American court.</P>
    <P>When the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act was going through the Dáil in 1986, Fianna Fáil supported the principle that there should be a requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case.  In December 1987, when the <Col N="412" /> Extradition (Amendment) Act was going through the House, the Labour Party, including Deputies Spring, Stagg and Taylor, voted for an amendment tabled by my former colleague, the then Deputy Pat McCartan, which would have required the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  The question has to be asked: why have Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government changed their position in regard to the requirement to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in court?</P>
    <P>A question also arises in regard to the quasi-judicial functions given to the Attorney General under the 1987 Extradition (Amendment) Act.  Under the 1987 Act the Attorney General has to satisfy himself in the case of a warrant that there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecution of the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offence specified and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  This is a quasi-judicial function and I do not consider it to be an appropriate one for the Attorney General. The Attorney General is the law officer of the Government and he is a political appointee.  On occasions in the past the Attorney General has been a Member of this House, and there is nothing to prevent this happening again. Therefore, it is inappropriate that an officer who is essentially the legal adviser to the Government and who is a political appointee should have quasi-judicial functions.</P>
    <P>The allocation of these functions to the Attorney General was widely criticised in 1987 by, among others, the Labour Party.  This issue needs to be looked at again.  Because so few extraditions have been sought, the Attorney General has not been called into action very often. However, that could change in the future and there is a clear potential for a conflict of interest between the political and legal roles of the Attorney General.  If the Government is determined to resist demands for a <i>prima facie</i> case in an Irish court, there is a case for giving the functions now carried out by the Attorney General to some other figure. <Col N="413" /> Why not create a totally new position &mdash; for example, that of judicial examiner or scrutineer of extradition cases?  Why not ask the President of the High Court to nominate a High Court judge to carry out the functions now given to the Attorney General?  As long as the Attorney General carries out these functions extradition will be more of a political process and less of a judicial one.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been published and is being debated against the background of an unprecedented demand for peace and for the terrorist groups to lay down their arms.  The initial optimism generated by the Downing Street Declaration has been dissipated somewhat by the continuing campaign of violence by Loyalist and Nationalist paramilitaries.  I have never believed that extradition should be used as a bargaining counter in the current peace process.  This Bill stands on its own merits and will be needed irrespective of the outcome of the current process. However, its timing may prove to be useful.  I hope it will reassure those in Northern Ireland and Britain who may have been concerned that the Government decision to lift the ministerial order under section 31 represented some sort of weakening in the resolve of the people of this State to combat terrorism that this is not the case.  I hope it will also deliver a very clear message to Mr. Adams and his colleagues that if they renounce violence there will be a place for them in the democratic process, but that if they continue with their murderous campaign all of the legal and political resources of this State will be used to ensure their defeat.</P>
    <P>At the time when concern was expressed about the various cases which exposed the loopholes in the existing extradition procedure many people commented on what was required.  One of the commentators at that time was an eminent Senior Counsel, whom I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will not allow me to name in the House because of her elevation to higher office in the meantime. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 April 1990 that Senior Counsel drew attention to the judgment in the Finucane <Col N="414" /> case.  I want to quote one or two of the points made in that article which raise issues of a constitutional nature to which the Minister may wish to respond in her reply.  She stated:</P>
    <P>Also a further issue has emerged from the decision of the Supreme Court in the Finucane case, which was a unanimous decision clarifying the basic principles underlying our extradition law.</P>
    <P>She went on to quote a section from Mr. Justice Walsh's judgment in which he stated:</P>
    <P>It is thus clear that the use of violence does not in itself take an act out of the political exemption . . .</P>
    <P>. . . I am of the opinion that the court cannot draw the inference that it was the intention of the Oireachtas that the provisions relating to the political exemption in the Act of 1965 should not apply to persons charged with politically motivated offences of violence when the object of such offences was to secure the ultimate unity of the country.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Robinson, Senior Counsel, commenting on that in the article of April 1990 stated:</P>
    <P>This carries the necessary implication that the Supreme Court does not regard the Constitution as it stands as having outlawed or ruled out violence in the pursuit of unification of the country.</P>
    <P>That is a serious conclusion to draw from that case.  She went on to argue in the article that closing off the extradition loophole and the loophole to which references to political offences gave rise might require not simply legislation but an amendment to our Constitution.  In the Article of our Constitution dealing with fundamental rights she expressly recommended that there should be an additional clause along the following lines:</P>
    <P>The State shall, as far as practicable, <Col N="415" /> protect the life and property of every person from interference or threat by violence, notwithstanding such violence arises from or is connected with a political motive or object.</P>
    <P>That was a very clear recommendation to deal with the ambiguity that exists about what constitutes a political offence and whether violence, as it has been understood on this island for the past 25 years, can be, by any stretch of the imagination, construed as political; that in order to deal with that ambiguity legislation and, perhaps an amendment to the Constitution, is required.</P>
    <P>In the context of the discussions taking place on the Downing Street Declaration, particularly as we are now closing off the legislative loophole in the extradition laws, it would be worthwhile to have another examination of this issue. It is unfortunate that because of the historical experience of the people of this country we have inherited an ambiguity as to whether violence is a legitimate means of pursuing a political objective.  I take the view &mdash; I believe it is shared not only by Members but by the public &mdash; that violent means are not a legitimate method of pursuing a political objective. It is not acceptable that in our legal process, our legislation and possibly, as was referred to in that article, in the Constitution, there may be an implication which suggests some legitimacy in pursuing political objectives by violent means.  However and wherever this is to be done, whether by legislation as we are doing or in the Constitution, we must ensure that any such ambiguity is clearly addressed.</P>
    <P>I intend to table a number of amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage one of which will require the Minister to produce the annual report on extradition within a specified time.  Another amendment will seek to give Members an opportunity to express views expressed in the past on the requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case being presented before a court and the question of whether the Attorney General is the appropriate person to <Col N="416" /> whom applications for extradition should be submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I met with a number of people who were particularly concerned about remarks made recently by a senior British MP in a newspaper. That MP is reported to have said that well known terrorists were walking the streets of named towns in this State. I was astounded by the comment so much so that I raised the issue with the Minister for Justice and I thank her for her helpful response.  It was my intention not to publicise that fact that these comments had been made because I felt it would add to the publicity but in view of what has happened today in this Chamber, those comments should go on the record.  I do not wish to name the person but the Minister, in her reply, stated that while there may be people in both jurisdictions, North and South, and indeed in Britain, whom we might suspect of involvement in terrorist activities, the reality is that if we have insufficient evidence to prosecute these people we cannot proceed. Many of our British colleagues do not appreciate the way justice is meted out in this State and in Britain.</P>
      <P>Some speakers criticised the delay in bringing forward this Bill.  When the 1987 legislation was going through the House, a number of speakers referred to this loophole.  The case was made at the time, and rightly so, that the Bill should be passed and put onto the Statute Book quickly and that the whole issue of its provisions had not been tested by the courts.  In the Supreme Court recently this issue was fully tested.  The Government could not have introduced legislation in advance of the Supreme Court deciding on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for the reluctance of the State over the years to go so far was the suspicions we have of the system of justice in Britain.  Far be it from us to criticise another State on the way it dispenses justice &mdash; that is a matter for the citizens of the State &mdash; but every Deputy has spoken about the well publicised cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six which highlighted an <Col N="417" /> obvious problem in relation to their conviction.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the case of Patrick Murphy, formerly of Keady which did not get much of the limelight; it arose following the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four cases.  Very few people spoke out on this man's behalf.  I was contacted by his brother, a priest, who lived not far from me and who was extremely concerned about the way his brother's case was being handled.  The man was incarcerated for more than three months awaiting trial.  Representations were made on his behalf to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The matter eventually came up for hearing and the charges were dropped without any declaration that the man was innocent.  The reason was that he had been at an AA meeting on the night of the crime.  Due to the anonymity attached to AA, he was unable to get people to speak on his behalf.  However, 22 people who were at the meeting eventually came forward and gave sworn statements to the effect that at the time the offence was committed this man had been in their company.  That case highlighted the way British courts deal with Irish people.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who spoke very strongly for the safeguards inserted in the 1987 Bill.  I felt at the time, and still feel, that if we are to extradite anyone to the United Kingdom it is necessary to insert safeguards to protect our citizens for the very reason I gave earlier.  Most people would accept that without being overcritical of the foreign jurisdiction.  I consider the 1987 Act was a good one which, once it had gone on the Statute Book, worked very well.  I take the point Deputy Gilmore made.  Very few extradition cases of a political nature come before our courts.  Any time they do, they engender a lot of publicity, leaving aside all the other cases dealt with daily without any such publicity, the latter being of a more non-political nature.</P>
    <P>The role of the Attorney General was incorporated in the 1987 Act rather than inserting a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  It was felt at the time that rather than become involved from District Court <Col N="418" /> level right up to Supreme Court level in every case, it would be preferable for somebody like the Attorney General to satisfy himself whether there was sufficient evidence to convict somebody once extradited; whether there was any intention on the part of the British authorities to pursue those particular offences.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at some of the comments made on radio this morning in relation to the role of the Attorney General.  Had those remarks been made in this House, I have no doubt that you, a Cheann Comhairle, would have been on your feet requesting that they be withdrawn.  Anybody who is not there to defend himself, anyone who has an independent role in this regard, a quasi-judicial role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that the comments were made on the radio this morning.  Even in the House this morning we had a Member querying the role of the Attorney General, which Members are entitled to do, but I object to the inference that the Attorney General will be his political master's voice in this regard.  Under the legislation he has a quasi-judicial role.  Whether it be the present incumbent of that office, or whoever else may be appointed to that post, it must be said that we have always reaped tremendous service from our Attorneys General.  Therefore, I contend it is wrong for people to suggest that Attorneys General in some way would have political intentions in the manner in which they decide these issues.  Stipulated in the legislation are the parameters within which he must decide whether he should back any given warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions in this Bill on which I might compliment the Minister.  The first is in relation to the <Col N="419" /> court venue, transferring all cases to the Dublin Metropolitan District.  I agree fully with that decision because over the years &mdash; not necessarily in recent times but in the early seventies when the Northern problems began and many people were coming across the Border &mdash; there were many highly publicised cases which invariably happened just south of the Border in places like Dundalk, causing all sorts of problems in the locality.  It is preferable that court cases be dealt with in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The other issue on which the Minister should be complimented is the hand-over point &mdash; this has been a great source of complaint in my constituency &mdash; where people under extradition warrants are handed over to the Northern authorities. I remember occasions when the entire town of Dundalk had to be closed down because of the security operation needed to hand over a person across the Border. The whole Dublin-Belfast road had to be closed, traffic diverted all over the place, and people going about their ordinary daily activities could not get to work or elsewhere because of the manner in which that operation had to be handled because of the security position.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 have not been properly implemented.  There has been a complete reluctance on the part of the British authorities to use the provisions of that Act, yet any time its provisions have been implemented they have been incredibly effective.  It is an Act that does not cause us any problems in this State. Obviously, because of the history between the two countries, we have encountered problems about extradition, we cannot get away from that fact, but that Act was put in place with the specific purpose of dealing with people in this State for offences committed outside this State.  Its provisions worked in the vast majority of cases brought under that Act but for one reason or another there was a reluctance on the part of the United Kingdom authorities to implement them.</P>
    <P>That Act constituted yet another arm of the legislative code we have put in <Col N="420" /> place in the State for which we have not been given sufficient credit by our British counterparts.  It is very rigid legislation to ensure that this State is not used as a haven for terrorists.  I do not accept for one moment that this State is used as a haven for terrorists.  It must be remembered that we spend a huge amount of our State resources to ensure that people do not roam our streets, despite what that British MP held.</P>
    <P>I had a conversation yesterday with an inspector of the Garda Síochána.  The reality is that the general public have confidence in our security forces.  The same cannot be said for the Northern side of the Border or for the vast majority of areas in the North.  Indeed, within five miles of the Border, there is virtually a &ldquo;no go&rdquo; area where one would never ever see an RUC or British army officer on patrol; that may be because it is too dangerous.  The reality is that British Members of Parliament should not complain about what they would perceive to be a lack of commitment on the part of the Garda Síochána on the southern side of the Border.  How can our Garda and security forces guard the Border if it is not guarded on the Northern side?  These are all misconceptions, perhaps deliberate on the part of some people, whereas the reality is that we are a lot stricter in our legislative code in relation to terrorism and people suspected of terrorism.</P>
    <P>This Bill fits into the jigsaw put in place over the years to suit the needs of our State, to ensure that our citizens are protected as much as possible.  I compliment the Minister for ensuring that its provisions in regard to political offences will not be implemented until such time as the British authorities insert the rule of speciality.</P>
    <P>When Dessie Ellis was taken across the Border, the British authorities made charges against him which were completely different from those for which he had been extradited, this ran completely counter to the whole concept of extradition. We have been criticised by the British for not ratifying the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism <Col N="421" /> whereas the British authorities only recently ratified the convention on extradition of the early fifties; yet they were haranguing us because we had not put in place proper extradition facilities. The whole concept of that 1957 convention on extradition was to insert the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Whenever somebody comes before the British courts for serious offences they must produce a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>This Bill fits in the last pieces the jigsaw required.  It is necessary legislation and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Ahern reads the 1965 Act he will see that the procedure provided for between Ireland and the UK which was sponsored by the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Haughey, is not an extradition system but a system of mutual backing of warrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not widely recognised in this country.  I remind Deputy Ahern and others in his party it is not true that the 1957 convention on extradition was designed to put in place a <i>prima facie</i> requirement but the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that this Bill proposes amendments and additions to our extraditions law it is to be supported and welcomed but the time has come for us to review the whole notion of what constitutes a political offence.  This is really the argument that bedevils debate on all these issues.  What crime of violence constitutes a political crime in a parliamentary democracy?  Perhaps the Minister will give her views?  By what right can anyone in a parliamentary democracy commit a crime of violence and claim to be immune from the sanctions of the law because of a political objective?  What crime of violence constitutes a political offence in a European Union where the Maastricht Treaty provides for co-operation on justice, when the union is based on democratic principles, parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, includes 12 member states <Col N="422" /> and will shortly, we hope, include Austria, the three Nordic states, the Baltic states and the newly emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe? What can constitute a political crime and avoid the sanctions of extradition in the framework of a European Unon?  The continent of Europe is different from that of 1957 when the convention on extradition was adopted and from 1977 when the convention on the suppression of terrorism was accepted.  Some of the changes were good, others were bad but they all retained the old romantic notion of protecting political activists against dictatorial emperors and tsar even if they shot or bombed them &mdash; a complete anachronism among the member states of the Council of Europe.  The very notion of a political offence has utterly changed since it was first conceived and has changed enormously since the 1957 and 1977 conventions were put in place.</P>
    <P>Those questions are not aimed at this Bill, which is useful in itself but at the international framework in which the Bill is set and which determines the difficulty in dealing with the whole idea of a political offence.  What crime of violence can now be regarded as a political offence in Ireland or the UK when the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement has been in force for over eight years and when the two Governments in Dublin and London jointly issued the Downing Street Declaration a short time ago with the support of the vast majority of their people and the overwhelming support of their political systems?  Can those Governments accept the idea that some violent offences can be regarded as political against the background of all the intentions and aims set out in that declaration?  The whole idea of a political offence on which all the legislation we are talking about and these conventions have been based is an anachronism and needs to be fundamentally reviewed, if not abolished.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of this Bill is to restrict still further the scope of the political offence exception.  This Bill, like the one in 1987, proceeds by exclusion, by defining offences which shall not be regarded as political.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="423" /> will agree that conceptually this is an awkward and unsatisfactory procedure. The failure of Governments to agree on a clear definition of what constitutes a political offence is due more to ambivalence on the part of Governments than to anything else.  On the other hand, I recognise, like the drafters of this Bill, that the range of criminal offences and the nature of international conventions dictate that we proceed in the manner set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the exclusion of a further range of offences involving explosives and firearms from the political offence exception provided for in the Bill.  I took the same view in December 1986 when what is now the 1987 Act was before the House.  I had the privilege to be the sponsoring Minister at that time. This is a long overdue move and one I would dearly have liked to sponsor in 1986 but it was not possible to do so for a number of specific reasons which Members would do well to remember, particularly those in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Bill did not go as far as this one.  However, it was opposed at every Stage by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister had the honour and privilege of being a Fianna Fáil Deputy at that time and went through the lobby with the others.  One of the principal speakers on the Fianna Fáil side at that time was the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.  During the debate he did his usual act of loudly thumping his republican craw.  He found a number of conceivable, and a good number of inconceivable, reasons for opposing the Bill.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, in the days before he assumed the smiling reasonable face of Fianna Fáil republicanism, was also a vigorous opponent of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats adopted a most extraordinary position.  Last night, Deputy O'Donnell gave us a homily on what she regarded as the flaws in the 1987 Act, the difficulties of aligning domestic law with international conventions and the failure, as she saw it, of the Irish <Col N="424" /> Government to live up to its obligations on extradition under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.  She complained that the 1987 Act was never examined in detail.  She was not a Member of the House at the time nor indeed was she a member of the Progressive Democrats. We had a detailed and lengthy Second Stage debate on that Bill and the Deputy would do well to read the debates and stir the memory of her colleagues in that party who were Members of the Dáil at that time.  A colleague of hers, Deputy McDowell, had an external association with the Progressive Democrats but I do not think he was a member.  However, he was loud in his denunciation of the flaws in the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>What really happened in December 1986?  The Progressive Democrats and some members of Fianna Fáil wanted us to introduce a <i>prima facie</i> requirement to our extradition law, something which would have required us to denounce the 1957 convention.</P>
    <P>It is true that Deputy O'Malley proposed something he regarded as being a half-way house between denunciation and the Bill as it was then proposed.  His proposal at that stage had no merit and it is obvious he now believes that because the Progressive Democrats do not seem to propose that anymore.  He went further and proposed to me that we should look on an Irish extradition Bill as an instrument to change the legal map of Europe.  He proposed that we should use a Bill in the Dáil to get the French, Germans, Italians, Belgians, Spanish, Portuguese, and God knows who else, to abandon their inquisitorial legal systems and adopt instead the adversarial legal system which exists here and in the UK and which Deputy O'Malley, on other occasions, and, indeed, Deputy Michael McDowell, both love to criticise.  That was some ambition.  That was their position on the 1986 Bill and that was their position on what turned into the 1987 Act which they now say was flawed for different reasons.</P>
    <P>The <i>prima facie</i> requirement appeals, apparently, to glib politicians, particularly on the other side of the House and <Col N="425" /> even Deputy Ahern referred to it today. It goes totally against the principle that a charge should be tried in the jurisdiction in which it is made.  I object strenuously to the fact that the United States makes requirement of this kind with the result that we have people in the United States charged with offences committed here who are kept in the United States by an endless succession of Noraid supporters who keep bringing cases back into the courts in the United States when they know perfectly well that those people should be made amenable to justice here and should answer the charges against them before our courts.  We are not the only ones.  We criticise legal systems in other countries.  I do not know whether Members are aware that the Dutch will not extradite to this country people who are wanted here for terrorist offences because their law provides that they will not extradite people who will not have a trial before a jury.  As most of those people would be tried in our Special Criminal Court the Dutch say they do not like our legal system, they consider it unfair, oppressive and undemocratic and will not extradite to this country people who are charged with terrorist offences.  I find that objectionable also, because I do not think anybody has ever been able to sustain a case that our Special Criminal Court deserves that kind of criticism, whether it is implied or explicit.</P>
    <P>When we debated the Bill in 1986 there were mutterings in the Labour Party.  The current Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, confessed to being uneasy about the whole thing and yet he is a member of a Government that is now proposing a Bill that goes further than I was able to go in 1986.  He sees flaws in the 1987 Act because it did not go far enough.  That is another interesting reversal although when the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil turn themselves inside out I do not find their interior aspect any more agreeable than their exterior aspect.  These people do not remember that in order to get that Bill passed in December 1986 the Government, and I in particular, had to decide that the only <Col N="426" /> way we could safely rely on getting it through was to stick as closely to the terms of the relevant convention as we could.  That was finally what happened.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out to Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; who, unhappily is not present &mdash; that in order to avoid a major upset on that Bill we had to adopt that approach.  Even then the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil &mdash; we are used to that kind of thing from Fianna Fáil &mdash; voted against the Bill on every crucial vote on Committee and Report Stages.  Those crucial votes on that Bill, which they now criticise as being flawed, were carried only by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle of the day.  You will understand, Chairman, when I say I am more than a little amused and sometimes a little nauseated by the criticisms of the 1987 Act that I hear from these people.</P>
    <P>In a very real sense, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats were responsible for the fact that the Minister has had to come back into this House to make the sensible provisions that are included in this Bill and no amount of posturing or ghost-writing of speeches by Deputy McDowell can obscure that fact.  While I do not like being contentious with the Minister, I must point out that no amount of smug or earnest self-congratulation by the Minister for Justice can cover up the fact that in 1986 Fianna Fáil played its usual dishonest game and cultivated a continuation of the cult of the sneaking regard, little bits of which we have seen emerge during the course of this debate. My words of congratulations to the Minister and to the Progressive Democrats for having seen the light on these issues will be a little less than warm and enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>I agree with the changes proposed in section 2 and in the fist Schedule in relation to offences involving explosives and firearms as far as they go, but they do not go far enough.  For example, the Minister has not explained why she felt it necessary to provide what she called: &ldquo;mere possession of firearms&rdquo; to be the political offence exception.  I agree with <Col N="427" /> the Minister's proposals that possession of firearms, where there is serious criminal intent and, in particular intent to endanger life, will no longer be regarded as a political offence.  If my understanding is correct, what the Minister has called the &ldquo;mere possession of firearms&rdquo;, where it is not possible to prove serious criminal intent, can be classified as a political offence even if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>If I read the Bill correctly the situation is different with regard to explosives.  It seems to me that this Bill proposes that the simple possession of explosive substances, even where intent to cause injury or harm cannot be proven, will no longer qualify as a political offence.  I approve whole-heartedly of that but I would like to know why the Bill makes a difference between firearms and explosives in this regard.  In view of all that has taken place in this island in the past 25 years, and in view of the efforts now being made to find a way through these appalling problems, it is surely time for us to be unambiguous in saying that if a person is charged in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland or Wales with possession of firearms and is found in our jurisdiction then that person should be extradited without being able to plead that the offence was a political one.  There is no defensible reason for any qualification to that statement.  What in God's name would anybody be doing in the possession of firearms &mdash; licensed firearms are always excluded?  If we found somebody driving around Belfast with a couple of Kalashnikovs and several hundred rounds of ammunition in the back of a van, do we have to worry about his intent?  That person may have been taking the arms from one place to another but it was clearly being done with a criminal intent; it was certainly not being done for the good of the health of anybody on this island.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there are clearly good and sufficient security and convenience reasons for centralising the handling of extradition cases in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  Will the Minister explain in more detail why <Col N="428" /> she feels it necessary to propose a nominated panel of judges for doing this?  I agree also with the proposal that the competent court should no longer have to specify the point at which a person to be extradited should be handed over to the requesting jurisdiction.  Deputy Ahern has already referred to the problems in that regard.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the person to be handed over seemed to have the choice as to the method of conveyance from the court to the point of handing over.  I may be wrong, but I seem to remember that people were allowed to object to being brought by helicopter and were able to insist on being brought by road so that they could be waved to by their fans, admirers and terrorist manqué on the streets of Balbriggan, Drogheda and Dundalk when they were on their way. Is that still the case and, if so, can the Minister do something to change it?</P>
    <P>I generally approve of the provisions of this Bill, which are long overdue.  We could have had them in 1987 had it not been for the obduracy and ambivalence of Fianna Fáil at the time and the culpable naiveté of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this long overdue Bill.  It is better late than never. Extradition has been a difficult and sensitive issue not only for Ministers for Justice but for this House and for many politicians.  As Deputy Dukes said, there has been far too much ambivalance and ambiguity on the question of extradition and there has been far too much double think among people who have campaigned for decades against any form of extradition here.  People who have campaigned against extradition want to have their loaf and eat it, but extradition must be confronted in an honest, open and just way.  I approve of what the Minister has done in this Bill and I commend her for bringing this matter before the House. No matter how controversial it is and no matter how much it can be misrepresented inside and outside the House, extradition must be tackled now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes it no longer possible to <Col N="429" /> regard the possession of explosives or firearms, where there is evidence of criminal intent, as a political offence. Neither is it possible to regard the use of non-authorised firearms as a political offence in order to evade extradition. I approve of these measures.  The Bill further provides a number of amendments to the 1965 Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of hypocrisy about extradition in our society.  Extradition must be part and parcel of the law of every civilised democratic country. People who have campaigned inside and outside this House against any form of extradition here have adopted a blinkered, selective attitude to the question.  If one considers statements, posters, letters and campaign methods it shows that they are invariably concerned with paramilitary people who are members of the IRA or who support the IRA and people who are charged with possessing explosives or guns in Northern Ireland and Britain.  These people are not concerned with ordinary criminals, people charged with petty crimes in Britain who are extradited to Britain every month.  They are not concerned about how such people are treated when they are extradited and tried in British courts.</P>
    <P>I have put down questions to successive Ministers for Justice seeking extradition statistics with regard to ordinary criminals. Nobody has cared very much about these people and people have not asked questions about whether they were being extradited legally or illegally or whether justice dispensed in Britain is fair.  They could not care less about how such criminals are treated.  Paramilitaries are considered to have a higher status than the ordinary criminal.  That is nonsense.  It is hypocrisy to regard one criminal as being somewhat better than another.  It is hypocrisy to regard someone who has planted a bomb in London or in some other British city as being somewhat better than a person who steals in Britain and then flees to Ireland and is extradited to face justice in Britain.  That is the attitude of many people here and it underpins the attitude of people who oppose extradition.  I reject that notion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> It is unfortunate that last night and this morning we heard remarks in the House about backwoods Tories in Britain.  It is true that some members of the Tory party in the House of Commons are insensitive, are ignorant about Ireland and are guilty of anti-Irish remarks.  I lived in Britain and studied the media there and I can say that that is true about some of them, but only a minority.  Such people should not be debated here to confuse the issue or to give the impression that that represents the general run of politicians in Britain or the British people.  It is true that the tabloids in Britain are guilty of sexist, anti-Irish and racist remarks, and I do not approve of that.</P>
    <P>It is also true that sometimes in Britain they compare the best people in their society with the worst people in our society.  They do not compare like with like.  That is a common fallacy, and it is wrong of Britain not to exercise a sense of fair play where Ireland is concerned. Some British people still have a hang up about their empire and consider other people as being lesser beings and British people as being somewhat superior to other nations.  That is often reflected in the tabloids and in some of the utterances in the House of Commons, although not so much in the House of Lords.  We should not elevate that attitude to a central platform in this debate, because that attitude is a minority attitude in Britain and is not typical of the majority of British parliamentarians and the British people.  For the purpose of obscuring debate and introducing emotion into the issue these matters are brought forward as being the main platform of British politics, which they are not.  We should not get bogged down in a debate like that because it would be foolish of us to imitate some of the British and engage in anti-British remarks which would achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was right to take the debate into the European context.  We are 12 democratic countries and the sooner we have democratic laws in common, the better.  There is no reason why extradition should not apply across the 12 member states.  There are different <Col N="431" /> ways of looking at justice and the law in some of the countries concerned &mdash; Deputy Dukes gave an example of what happens in Holland &mdash; but that is no reason why we should not work towards having common laws for the 12 member states, especially in relation to extradition. I support that concept.</P>
    <P>I will take the matter outside of the Irish-British relationship and outside of the European context by referring to the Lockerbie bombing.  It stayed in our minds as being a terrible atrocity that somebody could plant a bomb in a plane and blow all the passengers sky high and kill not only the passengers in the plane but also the unfortunate people who lived below in small houses.  That incident seared my mind because many people who had lived in the houses were never found again &mdash; no part of their remains was ever found.  Do the people who oppose the Bill believe that those who planted that bomb should be allowed to get away scot-free because extradition laws do not apply between the countries concerned?  That is a travesty of justice. How can anybody say that those who plant a bomb on a plane can do so with impunity?  Are those who plant bombs in British cities such as London, Birmingham and Nottingham helping the cause of freedom and liberty?  Anybody who plants a bomb in a city cannot be defended because no cause can justify taking innocent lives.  It is an act of terrorism to set off a bomb in the middle of London and we should say that clearly regardless of whether it causes offence. We should not flunk the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes cited the attitude prevailing in America among some Irish-Americans and he mentioned Noraid in particular.  I agree with him.  They have a narrow selective attitude which is not grounded in the realities of Irish history. Indeed their understanding of Irish history is flawed.  I had occasion, as Mayor of Limerick, to visit America during the debate on the proposed deportation of Joseph O'Doherty.  It was a celebrated case and a big campaign was undertaken in America, Britain and Ireland to stop <Col N="432" /> his deportation.  Some of the people concerned were interviewed on radio which I heard when in New York.  Indeed when I was addressing the Limerick Association I was interrupted by one of their supporters who rushed forward just as I finished speaking and took the microphone to raise this issue with the Irish Consul, Mr. Delaney, which momentarily disrupted the proceedings of the dinner.  However, I was aware that no attempt was being made to deal with the central issue of what Mr. O'Doherty had done.  A great many people involved in anti-extradition campaigns seem to evade the issue of the offences with which the person is being charged.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of a common European network of law embracing extradition as that is the only way we can deal with it on a broad basis.  In any agreement there has to be give and take as it is not always possible to do everything on one's own terms.  There is no reason we cannot move towards a common agreement and I hope this Bill is a step towards a common network of European law that embraces extradition. Unless there is a common approach, piecemeal action will be taken by individual countries, which is not good enough.  It is important that people who commit terrorist crimes are brought to justice and, therefore, it is also important to have international co-operation to bring them to book.  That is the only way to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Bill will be criticised by powerful vested interests but we should not be deflected by that criticism.  I welcome this long overdue Bill and I hope it will not be held up by petty thinkering.  I also hope we will have greater co-operation with the British legal authorities. In the past some cases presented by the British authorities were rejected because of faulty paperwork and delays.  I hope these matters will be ironed out.  The perception in Britain, as mentioned previously, is that in this country too many people will not co-operate with them in the fight against terrorist crime.  I hope the message will go out from this House today that my party is not ambivalent on <Col N="433" /> this issue.  Let us go forward on the basis that we can have a common law across Europe on extradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A person charged with offences of violence against the person or offences relating to firearms or explosives should not be entitled to hide behind the political offences exemption in the extradition Acts.  I have been preaching that gospel for many a long year and I am very glad that the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government now accepts it. God knows, no nation in Europe has a greater interest in dealing effectively with terrorists as no nation in Europe has suffered more over the past 25 years in terms of loss of life, damage to property and to the economy in both parts of this island. I advocated watertight legislation and pointed out the loopholes in our extradition legislation for the past four to five years.  There was clearly a degree of ambivalence by Fianna Fáil on this issue and I am very glad that the Bill brings it to an end.  As the Bill largely meets the requirements in relation to extradition, I welcome it and I compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House, even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>We should put this Bill in perspective. From time to time the Fianna Fáil Party adopts the views advocated effectively by the Fine Gael Party as if they were its own policies.  In this case, the Fine Gael policy on this issue has been adopted &mdash; belatedly &mdash; by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister referred to the delay but rather coyly said:</P>
      <P>... we are dealing with a very sensitive and complicated area of law.  It was necessary, therefore, to give careful and detailed consideration to any possible changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister was a little coy in referring to this but even more coy in referring only to the Magee, McKee and Sloan v. Culligan 1992 case.  She seems to have forgotten the Finucane decision in 1990 as it did not merit a reference in her speech.  Neither did she note the fact that following the Finucane decision in 1990, an extradition Bill to close the then glaringly apparent loopholes in our extradition <Col N="434" /> laws was circulated by me.  The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1990, was specifically designed to amend the extradition Acts and deal with loopholes. I do not want to harp unduly on the subject but, even as late as 1991, I was pressing the then Minister for Justice on this issue and in reply to a question I tabled on the need to amend the Extradition (European Covention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 he said:</P>
    <P>I remain of the view that such a course should not be followed unless and until the need for amendment is established and would certainly be premature until the existing legislation in this area &mdash; the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 &mdash; has been further tested before the courts.</P>
    <P>With all due respect, Fianna Fáil was hiding behind legalisms at the time.  Be that as it may, four years later, arising from the decision in the Finucane case, the Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>What was that decision?  It is important to outline what the position was at that time.  On the question of whether a person charged with an offence should be extradited, the test was whether that person at the relevant time &ldquo;was engaged either directly or indirectly in what reasonable, civilised people would regard as political activity&rdquo;.  That was the position since the Shannon and Fanning case in 1984 and the McGlinchey and Wren case in 1982.  What impact did the decision in the Finucane case in 1990 have?  It clearly showed that the courts were no longer prepared to adopt the test propounded in the Shannon and Fanning case.  As the House will recall, Mr. Justice Walsh said at the time that the section 50 exemption could be applied to politically motivated offences of violence.  That was the clear judgment given by Mr. Justice Walsh and it pointed to the need to close the loopholes in the legislation.  I do not intend to dwell any further on this point except to put the record straight.  From now on we will have to make sure that legislation is watertight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The Minister has said that certain offences may not now be regarded as political irrespective of the circumstances and, accordingly, that &ldquo;offences such as possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and use of non-automatic firearms to resist arrest are clearly placed outside the political offence exception&rdquo;. In case the Minister rounds on me and says that I provided for this in the Schedule which I included in my own Bill in 1990, I should point out that there are some differences.  I note that the First Schedule of the Minister's Bill follows the Schedule I included in my Bill in 1990 to a considerable degree.  There are, however, some exclusions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any accusations on this issue but I would like the Minister to confirm &mdash; this is the basic test which I propounded at the outset &mdash; that no person charged with offences of violence against a person or with offences relating to firearms and explosives will be entitled to hide behind the political offence exemption.  There may be reasons the Minister decided not to follow fully the Schedule I included in my Bill in 1990. On the question of firearms, I note she has included offences covered by section 15 of the 1925 Act.  In relation to the 1964 Act, the Schedule follows my prototype except on one point.  I provided that the political offence exemption would not be applied to the offences covered by section 26, possession of firearms while taking a vehicle without authority, and section 27, the use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape.  These have been included in the Schedule to this Bill, but it appears that the offence of possession of firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances covered by section 27 A has been omitted.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept the general test I propounded in relation to extradition that the political offence exemption should not be applied to any offences of violence against a person or offences relating to firearms and explosives? Second, will she explain the reason some of the offences I outlined in my Bill in 1990 have been omitted?  I accept that the terms of this Bill are broader and that <Col N="436" /> it is a plus that it deals with narcotics, which were not covered by my Bill.  I ask the Minister to clarify that matter and deal with the question raised by my colleague, Deputy Dukes, relating to the possession of firearms.  Will it be necessary to prove intent, or will mere possession be sufficient?  This is a very important point and the Minister would set our minds at ease if she clarifies that matter.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably happy with the Bill as it marks a considerable improvement, but we have to adopt a broader vision in examining the question of extradition. Much attention has been focused on the position in Northern Ireland and the problems associated with the violence there.  It is right that we should focus initially on that problem and on how best we can cope with it; but, given recent developments in Europe, we have to move one stage further.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is committed to building a Europe without frontiers as quickly as possible.  Changes have been made following the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and there have been tentative developments in relation to the Schengen.  I hope we will reach the stage where we will have a Europe without frontiers, but this will raise serious issues in relation to the pursuit of the battle against crime and terrorism.  This battle must form part of the single European economic and social entity.  We cannot allow the relaxation of frontier controls to work to the benefit of those involved in international crime and terrorism.  In that context I am glad the Minister is making provision for the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.  While this marks an improvement, we have to establish what it is we are seeking in relation to extradition in a Europe without frontiers.</P>
    <P>There must be open borders for those concerned with law enforcement; otherwise the creation of the Single Market will work to the benefit of those involved in crime, who will use it in their antisocial activities.  Therefore we should be talking at this stage about common European <Col N="437" /> standards of law enforcement through the promulgation and ratification of conventions in the Council of Europe and through development of the justice and security elements in the post-Maastricht Treaty area.  I appreciate however that we are moving into a <i>terra incognita,</i> a difficult era.</P>
    <P>However, this is now essentially forced upon us because of our full acceptance of the Single Market and the Maastricht Treaty.  The best way to combat international terrorism and crime is through a framework of laws that provides effective enforcement across European national boundaries combined with a system of European rights to protect the innocent.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to the sensitive issue of hot pursuit, and I would like to know where the Minister stands on that.  I appreciate that in European terms it should not pose a problem.  We are moving into an era where, when law enforcement officers are actively in pursuit of criminals or terrorists, those officers should be able to continue across boundaries to complete the capture of those criminals or terrorists.  However, we must relate that to the situation that applies at home.  If such a system came into effect Europe-wide, how would the Minister feel about it in the context of the Border within our own country?  That is when the shoe might begin to pinch.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question. We must consider whether we are prepared to cross the bridge and apply a Europe-wide system in our Border area. In the context of the co-operation which has applied since the Anglo-Irish Agreement and with which the Minister is involved at the moment, this subject must be actively addressed.  I appreciate that there is a down side and that there are emotional aspects to it, but it should be looked at carefully and the practicalities and modalities worked out.  I am not asking the Minister to rush into establishing <Col N="438" /> such a system.  However, in the context of a Europe-wide system this issue cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>There are some other points I should deal with.  I am glad the Minister has not followed the Progressive Democrats proposal that nothing should be done without a comprehensive consolidating Act.  There has been a long delay in getting this Bill before the House and that proposal would not have allowed it to see the light of day for another ten years. Because of the continuing commission of brutal crimes, we cannot afford the luxury of waiting for such legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad also that the Minister did not adopt the Progressive Democrats' proposal that extradition proceedings should commence only in the High Court.  I was opposed to it as because 95 per cent of all extradition matters are disposed of satisfactorily in the District Court.</P>
      <P>The other major proposal in the Progressive Democrats document related to &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo;.  Although it was superficially appealing, I was not in favour of it because it would have resulted in lengthy delays in the extradition process. As Deputy Dukes said, the reaction of the Progressive Democrats to the 1987 Bill was very unhelpful indeed.</P>
      <P>I sincerely welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I have expressed my reservations about the delay, but that is water under the bridge and Fine Gael will co-operate fully to ensure that this Bill passes into legislation with the minimum of delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>From some of the contributions to this debate yesterday and this morning one would imagine that successive Irish Government had set out deliberately to hinder the extradition process or to protect men and women of violence.  That is not correct.  This State has never been a haven for terrorists under any Government since Independence. The truth is that extradition is an extremely complicated area of law. There is a considerable body of case law, and now legislation, dealing with the most fundamental rights a human being <Col N="439" /> has, namely, the right to liberty and the right to a fair trial.  Extradition from one's own country is a serious business and must never be taken lightly.  All reasonable people utterly condemn violence, but that in no way takes from the sovereign duty of a sovereign Government to its sovereign people.  A Government must ensure that its people are not unnecessarily put at risk or unjustifiably placed in a position where their liberty might be taken from them.  In short, it is the duty of a Government to protect its citizens unless it is clear that a citizen has transgressed the bounds of normal behaviour and committed a crime.</P>
      <P>The 1965 Extradition Act was subsequently found to have certain loopholes, but as violence in the North got worse the Supreme Court progressively narrowed down the political offence exemption, culminating in the McGlinchey judgment, which found that an individual guilty of a gross terrorist act could be extradited.  In 1987 the Government ratified the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and enacted a law, namely the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism Act, 1987.  It is important to note that at that time Ireland was one of only eight countries to ratify the convention without reservation.  That was not the act of a country or a Government which had a vested interest in, or a coy nod and wink attitude to, assisting terrorism.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that, protective legislation was enacted in order to ensure that an individual extradited for an offence would be tried for the offence for which he or she was extradited.  It had to be established also that there was an intention to prosecute and that there was sufficient evidence to enable the Attorney General to decide it was justifiable for the Commissioner to back the warrant. Was there anything wrong with the enactment of such legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from statements in this House that there is a considerable objection to the inclusion of those safeguards in Irish extradition law.  I ask what country in the civilised world extradites <Col N="440" /> its citizens willy nilly without providing any protective measures to ensure they have a case to answer.  Any sovereign Government guilty of doing that would be guilty of a grave dereliction of duty towards its people.</P>
    <P>In this respect it should be noted that some European countries will not extradite their citizens for any reason and some countries have far more restrictive extradition measures than we have.  For example, in America it can take 12 to 14 years before an individual is extradited out of the American legal system to another country.  That has been the experience in respect of one famous Irish case in the past two decades.  We should not draw any incorrect conclusions that our extradition law is in some way assisting terrorism.  Our extradition law is carefully balanced between the rights of a citizen to his or her liberty and the duty of the Government to ensure that an individual who has a case to answer in a foreign jurisdiction answers it.</P>
    <P>It might be a fair observation that extradition should not be the first option. The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 which provides that people who commit offences or are wanted for offences in Northern Ireland can be tried in this jurisdiction is a preferable first option.  It provides that an individual is tried within his or her jurisdiction.  In cases where that is not possible and it has been established that there is sufficient evidence for an individual to have a case to answer I accept extradition is the next option.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate one would imagine one could have foreseen all the Supreme Court judgments at the time of the passing of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism Act, 1987.  The greatest prophet born could not have foreseen the Supreme Court's decision in relation to the offences specified in the Convention.  In this respect there were some eminent people who believed that possession and intend were covered by the 1987 Act.  The Supreme Court in the Sloane, Magee and McKee case decided this was not the position and <Col N="441" /> that decision has resulted in the debate today.</P>
    <P>If defects were discovered by the Supreme Court in relation to extradition law it should be put on the record that the failure of many extradition cases here was not the fault of the Irish authorities but of the British authorities.  There have been serious defects in respect of warrants which have been sent to this country from Great Britain.  That is a truism and cases can be quoted to support it.</P>
    <P>That argument did not suit the British establishment who did not want to know the true position.  It wants the Irish Government to export its citizens irrespective of the fact that those people may not have a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer. That would be unacceptable in any civilised society and, if it came to pass, would mean that the Government of this State would be in dereliction of its duty to its citizens.  That would not be acceptable to the Irish people.  There is a propagation in this House of a new type of <i>laissezfaire</i> which does not relate to goods but to persons.  That is something I could not support.  I have always condemned violence and I recognise the urgent need for an individual to face a charge in a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>The British Government's view on extradition and the case in respect of which it has introduced extradition legislation between Northern Ireland and this country has not been dealt with as expeditiously as it might have been.  I will leave the general public to decide what the motives for this may be.  I will refer to one example.  The rule of specialty, which means that an individual who is extradited must be tried for the offence for which he or she is extradited, has existed as a gentleman's agreement between the Irish and British Governments for many years, but it has only recently been put on the British Statute Book.  Because of the rule of reciprocity the Irish Government could if it so wished have told the British Government at any time that it will cease to extradite its citizens from this country because the rule of specialty was not on a statutory footing.  The Irish Government never <Col N="442" /> took that step.  It has been more than fair and has bent over backwards more than once in order to facilitate extradition in respect of serious offences.  There have been occasions when simple mistakes, which would not be made by a solicitor's apprentice, have been made.  I question why that has happened.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on the record that the British media has been less than helpful.  Across the front pages of their newspapers they have printed provocative statements and reported accusations, stated as facts, in relation to known individuals.  In the case of Fr. Paddy Ryan it has ensured that he will never be extradited.  If an individual is tainted by reports in a newspaper, irrespective of whether the individual has links with paramilitary organisations, as having committed a crime and is guilty of an offence, that individual cannot obtain a fair trial before a jury in any jurisdiction, whether in Great Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These sorts of problems have led to a great deal of ignorant comment about Irish extradition law.  If there were defects in our extradition law which were discovered by the Supreme Court they were more than matched by those found in the British judicial system.  There are good reasons for existing safeguards in our extradition law.  They were not dreamt up overnight for the sheer fun of it.  In certain cases in Great Britain Irish men and women have been convicted of offences of which they were not guilty. Irish men and women have been convicted in British courts by British juries when the evidence against them was derisory.  They have been incarcerated in British jails, some for many years, and it was clear to the general public and to certain sections of the media that they were innocent.  No Government in those circumstances, recognising that it is extraditing its citizens to what may be a very hostile jurisdiction, can rid itself of all the protections to which its citizens have not only a constitutional but a fundamental human right.</P>
    <P>We should examine other aspects of Anglo-Irish relations in this context.  The <Col N="443" /> application of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Great Britain to Irish citizens is disgraceful.  Chief among the concerns in this regard are the singling out of Irish people under the Act; the provision of detention for up to seven days; lack of early notification of relatives; access to legal advice for those detained; the discriminatory use of exclusion orders; insensitive methods of questioning travellers at ports and airports and the low rate of charging persons arrested and detained under the legislation, as evidenced by the quarterly Home Office statistics.  There is concern about the way these powers are being exercised.</P>
    <P>In November 1988, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the seven day maximum period of detention permitted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act was excessive and in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The British Government entered a derogation to the convention in regard to Northern Ireland-related terrorism only and accepted the court's decision on international terrorism.</P>
    <P>As we get our house in order today, it is only fair that we ask the British Government to get its house in order in terms of its treatment of Irish citizens. We have gone all the way down the road on extradition; we have gone as far as any civilised government could possibly go.  We have tried to balance the rights of our citizens; we have tried to protect them while at the same time recognising that they must be tried for offences where it is clear they have a case to answer.  No reasonable person objects to that, but it is clear that in relation to certain matters affecting Irish citizens in Great Britain there is a need for the British Government to, as it were, look into its own heart and root out the discrimination.</P>
    <P>Just as it was not possible to foresee that the Supreme Court would agree that possession and intent were not covered by the European Convention, neither is it possible to foresee that some of the provisions of this Bill will not be struck down by the Supreme Court.  For <Col N="444" /> example, it is proposed to change the provision on provisional warrants used in urgent cases to allow for the detention of a suspect wanted in the UK pending the physical delivery of the original warrant from the UK to Ireland.  Under the 1965 Act a period of three days is specified as the time in which the necessary papers should be transmitted from the United Kingdom &mdash; I am talking about provisional warrants.  Under this Bill it is proposed to extend the three days to seven days.  In November 1988 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the seven day maximum period of detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act was excessive and in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Is this provision constitutional or in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights?  Other arguments could be made on the constitutionality of the provisions of the Bill but, unfortunately, time does not allow me to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill has closed loopholes in Irish extradition law.  In so far as it assists in the fight against terrorism, I sincerely welcome it.  I hope there will be a greatly changed attitude by the British establishment to its treatment of Irish people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and a greatly improved performance by its judiciary in relation to decisions handed down in connection with offences allegedly committed by Irish people.  The British Government should remember that being Irish does not mean you are guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, Fine Gael supports this measure.  Trust and co-operation is a two-way process.  I often get the impression from the reaction of the British establishment that it is purely one way, that the Irish should stand on their heads to satisfy their needs and requirements, but that is not the case.  I will not deal with the historical background to this matter; suffice to say that the problems that have arisen in regard to terrorism on this island and in Britain stem from mismanagement by the British Government and their puppets in Stormont over a 50 year period, from 1992 to <Col N="445" /> 1972.  They seem not only reluctant to admit that but pretend it is not the case. There has to be a reason people behave like animals and kill and maim people; it is a reaction to a rotten, corrupt system.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to ensure that anybody suspected of such offences stands trial in a court of law.  We have to take it on trust that the court will give them a fair trial, but that is difficult because there have been so many miscarriages of justice, some of which we know about and I imagine there are many about which we do not know.  Many so-called terrorists in Northern Ireland were convicted on less than convincing evidence.  However, we must ensure that the extradition laws are properly implemented.</P>
      <P>The British media, not just the tabloid press, the gutter press, but quite often newspapers which classify themselves as quality newspapers such as <i>The Daily Telegraph, The Times</i> and so on, have had a field day blaming the Irish for not extraditing well known terrorists.  A number of these people were not extradited in the past due to technicalities. The extradition orders have had some technical fault, for example, words have not been spelt properly or the proper Act has not been quoted.  It seems extraordinary that judges are not capable of changing such warrants in court.  It is inconceivable that a person charged with allegedly committing a serious crime such as murder can get off on a very minor technicality.  I hope this legislation will close those avenues which have allowed people who obviously should stand trial to walk free.</P>
      <P>I am not always satisfied that the Judiciary is 100 per cent above board in some of these matters.  I am suspicious &mdash; I think some people are more than suspicious &mdash; that IRA activists or suspects have been let off because a small minority in the Judiciary have a certain sympathy with them.  When these people walk free it is virtually impossible to have them rearrested because they go underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to examine the performance of the judiciary in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is hard <Col N="446" /> to believe that the results of trials such as those involving the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire family could have been achieved without a significant bias on the part of the British judiciary. When I speak about the British establishment I include the judiciary and politicians, particularly an element of the Tory Party.  Most people are above board and genuine but there is a bias and vindictiveness against Irish people by an element of the British establishment which includes politicians, the police, immigration officers and the judiciary. One of the reasons for miscarriages of justice is a bias by the judiciary.</P>
    <P>There is a resistance in this country to extradition because there is a definite feeling &mdash; and evidence &mdash; that people will not get a fair trial.  That is a very strong and very definite statement, but some people have not got a fair trial. Therefore, it behoves the Minister for Justice and the Government to make it clear to the British authorities that they expect the system under which people are extradited or tried to be totally above board.</P>
    <P>I referred to immigration officers and a previous speaker referred to harassment, one of the ongoing problems. As I said, if our two countries are to work in harmony there must be co-operation and trust.  The activities of immigration officers at certain sea and airports on the British mainland are reprehensible. When I raised this matter at Question Time last year, I was told by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would look into them and report back to me.  However, I have not heard anything from him to date.  There is a calculated system of harassing innocent Irish people by immigration officers at various ports of entry to Britain.  It seems to be a case of &ldquo;bash a Paddy&rdquo;; it does not matter whether he or she is guilty of anything but they want to show who is boss.  Obviously that is what happened in the Birmingham Six case &mdash; when the authorities could not get the perpetrators of the crime they picked out six innocent people and said &ldquo;we will get six of them anyway, we will make some of them pay for it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> Obviously that train of thought runs through the British establishment, the police, prison wardens, judges, certain politicians and certainly immigration officers.  The attitude is &ldquo;have a go at them, make them pay&rdquo;.  It is similar to the colonial attitude adopted over the previous 700 years.  This attitude, which still exists, is objectionable, unwarranted and unacceptable.  I should like to see the Minister for Justice and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs taking a very tough line with the British and following up substantiated claims of unnecessary harassment where there was no collusion or involvement with terrorist groups &mdash; it was clear that the people were innocent and that they were harassed merely because they were Irish.  The relevant Ministers and the Government should adopt a very tough line to such matters publicly; they should let it be seen that the Government stands up for innocent people who are being very badly treated on a systematic basis.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of certain flash-points where Irish people are harassed.  I know some of them &mdash; I do a certain amount of travelling &mdash; but not all.  At one time Birmingham Airport was a disgrace &mdash; I do not know if it still is &mdash; where people were bound to be harassed merely because they were Irish.  The position at Heathrow Airport, through which I travel every few weeks, is not quite as bad.  Will the Minister and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs check the position at these airport and report to the Dáil on the number of complaints to the officials in the embassy in London? It should be remembered that many people do not complain about harassment &mdash; they take it for granted that they will be harassed passing through sea and airports.  I should like a list to be drawn up of the particularly bad areas in this respect.  This type of activity only promotes terrorism and makes sympathisers of some law abiding and decent people.</P>
    <P>At Heathrow Airport a person's personal belongings were thrown out on a table in a totally unsympathetic manner <Col N="448" /> in the full view of other passengers.  The security officers would not take the person aside to a cubicle and carry out the search in private.  The whole purpose of the exercise was, and is, to publicly humilate Irish people.  Of course, the reasons for this are historical &mdash; we probably made the English look very bad in the eyes of the world.  Their image of having the best justice system in the world has been destroyed &mdash; it is probably a bit of a mockery nowadays &mdash; because of the court cases to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Within the British establishment there is a detestation of the Irish because of our rebellious nature, the fact that we refused to knuckle under over a period of 700 years and, more recently, because of the troubles in the North which are caused by only a small element who are not representative of us as a nation but which the British look upon as such.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address the problem of the harassment and intimidatory policies of certain elements within the British establishment.  I referred to the Judiciary, police officers and emigration officers and I singled out problems which arose in the past in Birmingham &mdash; perhaps they still exist there &mdash; and at Heathrow airport.  I had an experience also at Glasgow airport and I am sure there are other points of entry to Britain where this type of harassment takes place.  The Minister should indicate where these incidents are taking place and focus on the officers who are engaging in this type of treatment, thereby putting a stop to it.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Council of Europe, specifically a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.  That might seem peculiar in that I am not a member of the legal profession but it does not prevent me from becoming involved in the debate, as recently as yesterday and the day before.  I referred to the terrible treatment of Irish prisoners and people in detention by prison guards and police officers, as was highlighted in the Birmingham Six case.  Those people were savagely beaten both by the police and prison guards and not one of the police officers or prison guards concerned <Col N="449" /> has been convicted of those crimes.  The reason for this is that in the case of the Birmingham Six the officers involved were tried by members of the British Judiciary.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Committee on Human Rights I stated that where there are well founded grounds for suspecting the maltreatment in custody of people from an ethnic group, be it in detention or in prison, the investigation into that alleged mistreatment should be carried out by members of a judiciary from a third country within the Council of Europe, whose number now is approximately 32, involving many of the central and eastern European countries.  It is inconceivable that we allow these people to be tried by the British Judiciary which has been discredited by its performance in a whole series of cases involving Irish people who were innocent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is photographed regularly at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Does the Minister raise such matters at meetings of the conference?  Can she tell the public why police officers and prison wardens, who were involved in savage attacks on Irish people, got away scot free?  They have not been convicted because they have been tried by their own judiciary which will always back up its own law and order system, be it in regard to prison officers or policemen.  That is not right and it further undermines the whole system of fair play.  These issues must be dealt with in an open manner and I am not satisfied that our Government is sufficiently dedicated to ensuring that Irish people are getting a fair deal in Britain.</P>
    <P>We must extradite the criminals and the terrorists, assuming they will be given a fair trial, but we must protect the innocent. We have not been sufficiently strong in that regard; we are too submissive to the British when it comes to protecting the innocent.  A regular report should be presented to this House on intimidatory activities at airports, seaports, in prisons and on court cases involving officers who have violently assaulted Irish people in Britain and who have not been convicted.  The British <Col N="450" /> Judiciary might say this is due to insufficient or unsubstantiated evidence but we know there is this maltreatment and we do not hear a murmur from the Government.  The Minister for Justice should request the European Court to require the judiciary of a third country to investigate the mistreatment of an ethnic group in another country.  That is the only hope we will have of obtaining a fair result.</P>
    <P>Have these people who were wrongly imprisoned been given a pardon by the British authorities?  Has Annie Maguire and her family, who were so shamefully and wrongfully treated and imprisoned, and the Birmingham Six, received an official pardon from the British Government? If we are to make this Act work and have fair play, people who have been wrongfully convicted should be given a pardon or an apology.  If that is not done it is the duty of this Government to ensure that it is done.</P>
    <P>While I support this measure &mdash; I presume most Members of the House will support it &mdash; I must express my reservations as stated.  All is not well in regard to this issue and we are too subservient when it comes to dealing with the British establishment.  We must take a stronger approach and the buck stops with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The last time I contributed to an extradition debate in this House was in 1987 and the atmosphere was rather different from what it is now. We should be thankful at least that the atmosphere has changed, although listening to the last two speeches, I am not sure whether the change of mood which I thought existed generally has percolated into all parts of this House.  There are a few traditionalists remaining who have regaled us with their views this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on the two Bills that preceded this, one at the end of 1986 and the other at the end of 1987, I drew attention to what I considered to be a number of defects in them, particularly in the 1986 Bill which became the Extradition <Col N="451" /> (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act of 1987, passed in January 1987.  I was also critical of the main thrust of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  I am glad that almost every criticism I made of the first of those two Acts has been incorporated in this Bill.  I have been reading my Second Stage contribution in this House on 12 December 1986 on the 1986 Bill, as reported at column 2695 of the Official Report of that day.  Many of the points I made about the Bill have been included in this one and many of the forecasts I made about the unworkability of that Bill, if enacted, have proved to be true.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, in May 1990 published a substantial document entitled, &ldquo;Extradition, Effective and Just&rdquo;&mdash; a position paper of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; which pointed out that the courts were very likely to find defects in the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  It suggested that changes in the law were necessary.  What I predicted in my speech of 1986 and was predicted in the position paper of May 1990 proved to be accurate.  The following year the High Court, first, followed on appeal to the Supreme Court, held, as I forecast in 1986, that there were huge defects in the 1987 Act, that certain people could not be extradited even to answer serious charges involving firearms simply because they were not automatic weapons and it could not be shown they had used the firearms on the date of the alleged offence.  I said in 1987 that that seemed to be a nonsense.  I am glad it has now been recognised and that many years later it is being rectified.  In the meantime, how many people who should have been extradited from this jurisdiction were not, due to a glaring and obvious defect in the law identified as far back as 1986?  I do not know how many but the number would not be insignificant.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>On 12 December, 1986 as reported in columns 2695-2696 of the Official Report of the day, I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> It should be remembered that the offences in Article 1 of the 1977 Convention and those referred in section 3 of the Bill are quite limited in their scope and apply only to a proportion of what we would popularly call terrorist type offences.  The ordinary murder of a citizen or a policeman with, for example, a revolver or pistol is not included in section 3 of this Bill, and it is open to the defendant, because it is an offence under section 4 or Article 2, to argue that the political defence is still open.  I query if it should be left open to the extent that it is, or if a limitation is to be put on it &mdash; and it is defensible that perhaps some limitations should be put on it.  I query whether that limitation should be as vague and subjective as what is set out in section 4.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary, for example, for the State, to prove in order to set aside the political defence that the commission of the offence created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons.  A determined attempt, for example, to shoot one person and nobody else, would not come under that and would allow the political defence still to be pleaded.</P>
    <P>I added, as reported at column 2697 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is a bit ridiculous to seek to distinguish between a murder carried out with an automatic weapon and one carried out with a non-automatic weapon. Is one any more dead because one is shot with a machine gun than if one is shot with a revolver, a pistol or a rifle which is not automatic?  This distinction is pointless and section 4 should be amended.</P>
    <P>I went on to criticise the vagueness, subjectivity and unworkability of section 4 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  What is contained in the Second Schedule to this Bill but the repeal of section 4 of that Act, as it should be.  The section should not have been included in the first place, for the reasons <Col N="453" /> I stated in 1986 and which have been proven to be true.  These reasons were mentioned by the Minister in her remarks in the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>What disturbs me is that this was clear so long ago.  Even if the Minister was not prepared to accept my word, or the word of others, there was a court decision on this issue in 1991.  At that time the Government made it clear that it would be prepared to close off any loopholes. That statement was made after the High Court decision in the Magee case.  The then Minister for Justice said that if the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court the law would be changed.  Why did the Government hesitate for three years?  Have we still got an ambivalent view about such offences and those who perpetrate them?  Having listened to the last two speakers, the answer to my not so rhetorical question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; there are many people in this part of the country who perhaps still do have an ambivalent view in regard to these matters. That is disturbing.</P>
    <P>It appears that the debate on this Bill will not take up its full time and that is a matter of regret and contrasts greatly with what happened before.  The time that is not used on Second Stage could be used on Committee Stage to tease out the large number of amendments to this Bill.  The great mistake, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out last evening, was that in 1987 those Bills were guillotined. It was not possible to have as full a discussion on them as there should have been.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill because either my party or I advocated almost all its provisions.  We did so at different times between five and eight years ago.  We will support the Bill.  However, it contains at least four defects.  It continues the procedure in the second Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, whereby the Attorney General is involved in some kind of secret, quasi-judicial procedure in making judgments on whether people should be extradited.  The Bill does not repeal section 2 of that Act which is the crucial provision.  The Bill's second defect is that it leaves in place section 50 <Col N="454" /> of the Extradition Act, 1965, which has to be unconstitutional because it purports to give the Minister for Justice power to overrule a decision either of the High Court or of the Supreme Court.  I do not think the Minister for Justice can exercise that power because, in purporting to overrule the decision of a court after a full hearing, the exercise of such a power by a member of the Executive is judicial and is not allowed under the Constitution. Indeed, that point was raised yesterday in the case of <i>Brennan v. The Minister for Justice.</i> In that case the Minister's power to remit, by way of petition, a whole range of penalties imposed by a district judge or by any court, has been challenged and a conditional order has been granted to the district judge.  I await with great interest the outcome of that case.  It seems to indicate that there is grave constitutional doubt about this system and according to the evidence given in the affidavit yesterday it is done on an extraordinary wide scale.  Thousands of such cases were referred to.  I do not believe it is desirable or acceptable that this system of constantly overruling the courts should be allowed continue. The petition system exists in order to rectify injustices that could not otherwise be rectified.  It was stated in court yesterday that many of these cases were not even appealed &mdash; they were automatically sent to the Minister following the decision of the district judge.  The order of the court was changed there. What kind of judicial system have we if that is the norm?  That is tied in with section 50 of the 1965 Act, which should now be removed.</P>
    <P>We cannot extradite our citizens to European countries other than Britain. That is indefensible and cannot continue. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Irish terrorists murdered people in Belgium, Holland, Germany and France. Irish citizens were found in possession of a huge quantity of arms within the French jurisdiction.  That event was terrorist related.  Were they to break bail, it is indefensible that we would be unable to extradite them.  We have a very satisfactory extradition system with the <Col N="455" /> United States and Australia under which the court must be satisfied that there is a stateable case against the defendant. That system is preferable to whatever is envisaged, but not used, under the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill is a reasonably complete and objective list of offences which will not be regarded as political offences, but it does not include the offence of membership of an illegal organisation.  It should do so.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of certain illegal organisations is to murder other people and membership of such an organisation should not be an offence to which a political defence can be successfully raised.  It is the only omission I can identify, but it is of considerable importance in the present context.</P>
    <P>We will table a number of amendments and I would like to see a full Committee Stage.  In many respects the Bill is acceptable to most Members and will not be challenged.  But it is important that the detail be thrashed out on Committee Stage, as failure to do this in the past contributed to the mistakes that were made and to the fact that this Bill is before us.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest weaknesses is the procedure in the 1987 Amendment Act relating to the Attorney General making decisions in private.  My recollection is that, on foot of an amendment proposed either by me or a member of my party, there was a section inserted into the Bill which required an Attorney General to make a report to the House in respect of any decisions he made under the Act.  I cannot recall seeing any such report in the intervening years.  That is not to say it did not happen.  Unless a reasonably full report is made, it will not be satisfactory. That is only one of the many aspects of that Act which are unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue was critical of the fact that an attempt was made to extradite Patrick Ryan.  He rejoiced that it did not happen.  Given what some sections of the British media did, it is arguable that the decision was correct.  However, I am <Col N="456" /> not saying it was the correct decision. There are some considerations about how the Attorney General handled that episode.  I do not wish to make any comment of my own in regard to it but I will read the comment of one who is better qualified than I.  Mr. Gerard Hogan of Trinity College, in an article on page 136 of the <i>Irish Criminal Law Journal, 1992,</i> stated:</P>
    <P>... it is by no means clear that the Attorney General acted <i>intra vires</i> in reaching this conclusion.  The 1987 Amendment Act specifies two grounds &mdash; sufficiency of evidence and an intention to prosecute &mdash; on which the Attorney General must satisfy himself with regard to Part III extradition warrants. As the Attorney General was so satisfied with regard to these two statutory grounds, it is accordingly not easy to see how he could refuse to endorse the warrants by reference to non-statutory criteria.  The Attorney General could also be said to have exceeded his jurisdiction by in effect usurping the jurisdiction of the courts. It may well be that the Irish courts would have arrived at precisely the same conclusion with regard to the prejudicial publicity, but they would have only done so following a full hearing, having heard the oral evidence and listened to legal argument from both sides.  In taking the decision the way he did, the Attorney General left himself open to the charge that he privately discharged judicial functions in an <i>ex parte</i> manner.</P>
    <P>If a non-judicial personage &mdash; even the holder of high office such as the Attorney General &mdash; could refuse to perform a statutory function on the ground that this would infringe the constitutional rights of another, where would this stop?  Would it mean, for example, that the Garda Commissioner could refuse to execute an extradition warrant on the ground that he was likewise of opinion that to do so would be to infringe the suspect's constitutional rights?</P>

I would very much like to contribute further but I am precluded from doing so under the strange rules here.  There is nobody else here to offer except the Minister to reply.</P>
      <P>Since I spoke here in 1987 I have had good reason to believe in the truth of what I said then about the unsatisfactory situation in which the Attorney General should act in a quasi judicial function in private.  That happened towards the end of 1992 when I had reason to complain to the Attorney General about a particular matter and he announced he would hold an inquiry into it.  He did so but only interviewed what I might broadly call the defendant in the inquiry and other members of the State team; he did not hear the complaints or any of the complainants' witnesses and he came to a conclusion and announced a decision. That did not seem to me to be an appropriate exercise of quasi judicial function. I have no confidence, therefore, in somebody who exercised his functions in that way, in that matter, under the 1987 Act.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghlachadh leis na hurlabhraithe ar dhlí agus cheart ó na páirtithe sa fhreasúra, agus freisin leis na Teachtaí ar fad a ghlac páirt sa díospóirecht. Beidh deis againn nuair a thiocfaidh muid chuig staid an choiste déileáil leis na leasuithe atá á moladh ag roinnt de na <Col N="458" /> Teachtaí.  I thank Deputies who contributed on the Bill yesterday and today. It is obvious from their statements that they have given careful consideration not only to the Bill but to the topic of extradition generally.  I was very pleased to hear the spokespersons from all the different parties welcoming the Bill.  It is clear there is general agreement with the main principles in the Bill, i.e., the provisions that extend and clarify the political offences exception.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that extradition is a complex topic.  There are three statutes devoted solely to it and a considerable volume of case law.  It is a crucially important topic dealing as it does with the freedom of the individual. It is fitting, therefore, that we give very careful and thorough consideration to the Bill and I was happy to agree to a longer period for our debate.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies criticised the length of time it has taken to bring the Bill before the House.  The position is that following the Supreme Court decision in November 1991 in the Magee, McKee and Sloan v. Culligan case, the Government decided that amending legislation should be prepared.  This was made known to the Dáil in response to a parliamentary question on 26 November 1991.  Work on the preparation of that legislation started almost immediately. The preparation of any legislation requires time to allow full consideration of all the issues involved and the situation in this case was more complex than normal.  The full implications of the Supreme Court decision had to be assessed and various possible solutions considered before any work on drafting a Bill could commence.  Since work started on this Bill the Government has changed twice and there has been one election. Three separate Ministers for Justice have been involved in the preparation of this Bill.  Despite all these changes which took place over a relatively short period it seemed the Bill would be ready for publication last summer but this did not prove possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing a Bill problems can surface even at a relatively late stage in the <Col N="459" /> drafting process and changes can be made on reconsideration of a particular problem. This Bill was no exception.  Great care was taken at all stages of drafting the Bill and that, of necessity, required time.  We are not here to debate that, we are here to debate the Bill as published.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the need to ensure that Ireland should not become a place to which people would come to evade justice.  He referred also to the policy of open borders within the European Union and the dangers this could bring as regards criminals taking refuge in countries other than those in which they had committed crime.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this Bill is a clear indication of the Government's resolve that this should not happen.  As I said it clarifies and extends the range of terrorist type offences that may not be deemed political.  It also paves the way for our ratification of the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that offences listed in the convention cannot be deemed political offences or revenue offences for the purpose of the perpetrators of such offences evading justice.  Accordingly, the Bill is an important weapon against terrorists and those who commit crimes involving drugs.  It will ensure that they will not be able to avoid extradition from here by claiming that their crimes are either political or revenue offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell inquired about the date of coming into operation of the Act and mentioned the reference in my opening statement to the effect that the Act and orders of specialty between Ireland and the United Kingdom would be brought into operation on the same date. I assure the Deputy it is not my intention that this will result in any delay in bringing the Act into operation.  The position about the orders on specialty is that as I said in my opening statement, orders have to be made here and in the United Kingdom.  We gave a copy of our draft order to the UK authorities last November, a few weeks ago the British gave us a copy of their draft order.  Each side <Col N="460" /> is examining the other's order at present to ensure they are compatible.  I intend to ensure that the work of officials here goes ahead as quickly as possible and I am sure there is a similar appreciation on the British side of the need to ensure that the work required on their side is completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made the point that the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, did not provide for certainty as regards which offences were political. This goes back to the history of the political offence concept.  The European Convention on Extradition does not define &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; and neither does the Extradition Act, 1965, which was based on the convention.  All either document says is that the taking or the attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his or her family shall not be deemed a political offence. This approach was continued in the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and in the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  Again, &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; was not defined but both documents list offences which are not to be deemed political.  There was also a group of offences which might be political, depending on the circumstances.  An additional point to remember is that our Act adhered closely to the wording of the convention.</P>
    <P>Any uncertainty stemming from the convention and our 1965 and 1987 Acts is being eliminated by the Bill.  We are retaining the wording of the convention but we are dropping the stipulation about crimes being political depending on the circumstances.  Also, and this is a most important point, we are providing for certainty by listing offences in the First Schedule to the Bill.  This approach will mean that the courts will have a much easier task in deciding a political offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell inquired as to the relationship between the offences in section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, as amended by the 1994 Bill, and the offences in the <Col N="461" /> Schedule.  The position is that all the offences in the amended section 3 are covered by the offences in the Schedule but not all the offences in the Schedule are covered by the terminology of section 3.  In other words, the Schedule is wider than section 3 as regards the offences covered by it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell, Gilmore and O'Malley referred to section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>My question asks if the Taoiseach would consider the establishment of a constitutional commission which could look at the various areas of the Constitution which are currently in conflict with each other.  This was very much highlighted by the recent court case with regard to the Bill which was struck down by the Supreme Court, although it had been agreed unanimously in this House.  Would the Taoiseach not consider the advisability &mdash; the Constitution having been in place for almost 60 years now &mdash; of reformulating the Constitution to match the needs and the values of the people in this State in the 1990s?</P>

Everybody accepts that the activities of the Office of the President have been expanded considerably over the past few years.  This has occurred with the agreement of the Government within existing constitutional and legal parameters. There are long standing conventions that govern the relations between the Office of the President and the Government and they are being adhered to.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that many Irish citizens and companies have in becoming aware of the various programmes, grants and other support structures available to them, provided by the European Union; if he will make it the responsibility of appropriate agencies and Government Departments to ensure that the level of awareness of all potentially available grants is maximised; and if it is desirable that, in practice, this sort of information is available to a lot of smaller companies only if they pay a substantial fee to a private agency specialising in the dissemination of this kind of information.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some criticism from Irish companies and individual citizens on the difficulty they face in obtaining user-friendly information on the range of European Union grants and other support measures available. Indeed this is just a feature of a comprehension deficit which exists in relation to European Union affairs generally and which was particularly highlighted in the European debate on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that I launched the Government's new &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; initiative on Friday last.  This initiative, for which £100,000 was allocated in the recent budget for 1994 will involve a wide ranging programme across a number of headings to raise public awareness and understanding of European issues and in the process to ensure that information on European affairs is made available to the public in clear terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One objective of the initiative to which I specifically referred last Friday is to <Col N="469" /> ensure the preparation of accessible and readable information on European funding. In achieving this objective I intend to rectify the difficulties in the existing information network adverted to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>However, much useful and clear information on grants and other European Union financial supports is currently being provided by various public sector bodies, as well as by the Dublin Office of the European Commission.  No charge is levied for this information and I urge all prospective information seekers to avail of these existing free information outlets. For the future, the task is to ensure a coordinated approach that will, in particular, bring about a situation where information is freely available to those who need it throughout the country.  The Deputy can be assured that as part of the &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; initiative I will be working in conjunction with the relevant Government Departments and agencies to ensure this.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's concern and this is one of the reasons behind the initiative.  Information is available free of charge from many national agencies and Government Departments.  In most cases the grants come through Government Departments and agencies.  User-friendly information will be provided in booklet form in the near future which is part and parcel of the Government's &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; strategy.</P>

      <P>To which State agency would a small company go if it wished to get a grant from the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the programme relevant to the company. There are many programmes, for example if it is a tourism project, it would go to Bord Fáilte.  The company would have to go to the relevant Department, national agency, or in some cases to the IDA, Forbairt or FÁS.  There are many grant supports from Europe and one has to go to the relevant agency.  That is one of the reasons I launched the &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; initiative as I agree there is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The Commission's office provides this information and there are many other outlets.  Under my initiative it will be available in local libraries and in information centres in local authorities.  There are problems in bringing it together but the Government Departments are the basic route to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the network of local authorities is under-utilised in disseminating information?  Does he consider it appropriate that information centres are established in the local authorities which could handle not only information about Europe but other relevant information that should be accessible in every country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that local authorities are under-utilised.  When I was preparing the &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; initiative I went to see the Paris information office, an office put together by the Government and the Commission but it did not meet Irish requirements.  A regional and local based scheme would be more appropriate.  An element of the strategy of &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; will be a series of regional conferences as a way of bringing the process to the people.  I agree that we must involve the local authorities in a more pro-active way in the regions and this is part of our work. We have set up a task force which will report to me in July on this among other issues.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the proposed sale of St. Catherine's Church, Thomas Street; if this is in line with his conservation policy and to the concerns of many individuals about the proposed sale of this church; if he will outline his policy in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Catherine's Church, Thomas Street, Dublin, is owned by Dublin Corporation and I understand that it is currently in very poor condition.  This church was deconsecrated in 1967 and subsequently handed over to Dublin Corporation by the Church of Ireland.  It is listed for preservation in the 1991 Dublin City Development Plan.  I am indeed aware that it has been offered for sale by private treaty subject to a brief requiring that the structure of the building be preserved in its present form and that the building be used for cultural, educational, artistic or civic purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The critical issue in relation to heritage buildings of this kind is to find a contemporary use for them that will ensure their continuance as living buildings.  If the corporation can find a purchaser either in the public sector or the private sector with a proposal for an appropriate use of the building which will respect its <Col N="472" /> architectural features, then this would be a happy outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not ironic, at a time when millions of pounds are being poured into interpretative centres and new cultural quarters, that we cannot secure the future of one of the most important historic buildings in Dublin? As the Minister is aware, St. Catherine's Church is one of the principal historic landmarks in Dublin.  Will we look back in a few years and be sorry that a piecemeal approach was adopted to the preservation of these buildings?  Will the Minister become involved in discussions to secure the future of this building and many other churches?  We need a policy on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that it would be more appropriate to have a policy on heritage within which one looks at church buildings rather than a policy on churches within which one seeks to locate a heritage policy, and there is a difference.  I am aware of the significance of St. Catherine's Church; Robert Emmet was executed in front of the church in 1803.  Far from needing any encouragement to become involved I have been trying to find ways in which the future of the building might be secured.  In that regard my programme manager, with officials of Dublin Corporation, recently visited the church in the context of a tentative proposal from the corporation for a cultural tourism project to be funded by a grant or European Union funding.  I am also aware that the United States ambassador has expressed an interest in an appropriate use of the church.  Following discussions between the ambassador and the corporation different uses and possible sources of funding were investigated. These have been followed up by my programme manager and we are looking at ways in which we can be of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the policy on heritage of which the policy on churches forms part.  There is a gap in this policy.  As the Minister may be aware, the <Col N="473" /> scaffolding at St. George's church on the north side of the city is now so rusty that it is a danger.  It is clear there is a gap in the policy on heritage and it has led to the destruction of old buildings.  What is the Minister's view of the proposal that this church should be transformed into a cultural centre with a link to the Linenhall Library in Belfast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that three proposals are being considered. These include an approach from an association which would use it for office development; another suggests it be used to encourage enterprise and create a link with the local area while the third suggests its use for cultural purposes drawing on its previous usage as a music venue.  It would be wrong of me when proposals are being examined to express a preference.  This church was deconsecrated in 1967 and the difficulty is that it was handed over in a dilapidated condition. All the proposals are being examined and we will try to find a happy resolution.  When the legislation on the Heritage Council is implemented and a new Heritage Council is appointed there will be more coherence.  The scaffolding to which the Deputy referred was erected before my appointment.</P>

      <P>Meabhraím don Teach an freagra mion a thug mé ar cheisteanna maidir le Teilifís na Gaeilge ar an 15 lá de mhí na Nollaig, 1993, agus atá ar fáil i gColúin 626 go dtí 633 den Tuairisc Oifigiúil don dáta sin.</P>
      <P>Leag an Rialtas an cúram ar RTÉ an córas tarchuradóireachta don chainéal nua a thógáil agus táim sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>Maidir le téarmaí tagartha foirmiúla a leagan síos don Choiste Comhairleach atá le bunú de réir Alt 21 den Acht um Údarás Craolacháin, 1960, is cúram é sin d'Údarás RTÉ.  Mar sin féin, tá curtha in iúl agam don Údarás go mbeinn ag súil go mbeadh baint ag an gCoiste Comhairleach le: foireann a earcú ar chonradh agus oiliúint a sholáthar di, cláracha a choimisiúnú agus a thiomsú sula gcuirfí tús leis an gcraolachán, nádúr agus gaois an stáisiúin nua a leagan síos, clár-sceideal a dhréachtadh, agus riachtanais oiliúna na seirbhíse a mheas, i bpáirt leis an earnáil neamhspleách léiriúcháin agus le heagrais eile lena mbaineann an scéal, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Bord na Gaeilge ach go háirithe.</P>

Glacaim leis an méid a dúirt an tAire mar gheall ar theanga a bhrú ar dhaoine ach an aontódh an tAire go bhfuil baol ann, má tá an stáisiún nua chun daoine ar bheagán Gaeilge a fhostú sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeidh Béarla &mdash; mar a tharlaíonn i monarchana áirithe, mar is eol dó féin-á bhrú ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus an nglacann sé leis gur cheart é sin a sheachaint, más féidir.</P>

      <P>An dearcadh atá agam féin ná go mbíonn contúirt ann i gcónaí agus go mbíonn daoine de shíor ag cáineadh faoi seo, ach ní chuireann sin as <Col N="478" /> dom.  An rud is fearr a dhéanamh ná an phleanáil a dhéanamh i gceart agus a bheith oscailte faoin rud.  Beidh daoine ann a úsáidfidh an próiseas oiliúna, ach tá mé i ndáiríre faoi atmasféar an stáisiúin a bheith Gaelach agus caithfimid bheith oscailte inár n-aigne faoin gcaoi ina gcuirfidh daoine feabhas ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus ina n-úsáidfear í.  Níl sé seo éasca ach tá mé féin i bhfad níos dóchasaí b'fhéidir ná an teachta.  Beidh mise ag cur béime ar na háiseanna agus ar na seansanna nua a bheidh ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i bhfoirm nua-aoiseach agus sin é mo dhearcadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Donegal South-West):</i> Tógfaidh mé ceisteana a 7 agus 57 le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfear a rá nach amháin sa Ghaeltacht atá fadhb dhífhostaíochta &mdash; is fadhb náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta í.  Aithním féin agus aithníonn Údarás na Gaeltachta go maith an gá le poist bhreise nua a chruthú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus leis na poist atá ann cheana féin a chaomhnú agus is féidir glacadh leis go bhfuil gach is féidir á dhéanamh chun na críche sin.  Is fadhb mhór í líon na bpost a chailltear sa Ghaeltacht gach bliain.  I dtaca <Col N="479" /> leis sin de tá an tUdarás ag cur go speisialta lena gcuid iarrachtaí ní amháin chun fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú ach freisin chun an fhostaíocht atá ann cheana a chaomhnú oiread agus is féidir.  Is cúis áthais dúinn uile go bhfuil toradh na hoibre sin le feiceáil i gcaoi is go raibh laghdú suntasach i líon na bpost a cailleadh i dtionscail Ghaeltachta a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás anuraidh i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin, i.e. cailleadh 676 phost i 1993 i gcomparáid le 920 post i 1992.</P>
    <P>Maidir le líon na bpost nua a cruthaíodh in 1993 i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis, tuigim uathu gur cruthaíodh 879 bpost nua lánaimseartha ar an bhfód ach gur cailleadh 676 phost, rud a d'fhág glanmhéadú de 203 phost ann ag deireadh na bliana sin.</P>
    <P>Cheadaigh an tÚdarás cúnamh do thionscail anuraidh ina mbeidh breis is 1,000 post nua i gceist ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol.  Ag deireadh 1993 bhí 5,854 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás.  Leanfaidh an tÚdarás go díograsach lena gcuid iarrachtaí leanúnacha i 1994 d'fhonn tionsclóirí a mhealladh chun gnóanna fiúntacha a lonnú sa Ghaeltacht a chuirfidh fostaíocht bhreise ar fáil inti.</P>
    <P>Leis an bhfeabhas a mheastar atá ag teacht ar an aeráid eacnamaíochta i gcoitinne, tá cúis mhaith ann chun dóchas a bheith againn go dtiocfaidh tuilleadh feabhais ar chúrsaí fostaíochta i mbliana agus amach anseo.</P>

De réir na tuarascála is déanaí atá ar fáil, is é sin 1992, iarraim ar an Aire a dheimhniú nár tháinig ach méadú de 63 phost ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe sna ceantair Ghaeltachta an bhliain sin cé gur ceadaíodh £16 mhilliún ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile chun cabhrú le comhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht, de réir na tuarascála sin.  Más fíor sin, agus nuair a chuirtear san áireamh le deich mbliana anuas, go bhfuil céad milliún <Col N="480" /> punt caite ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar fhostaíocht a chruthú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta níor tháinig sa tréimhse sin ach méadú de chéad ar líon na ndaoine a fostaíodh i gcomhlachtaí a fuair cabhair ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  An nglacfadh an tAire leis, ag breathnú ar na figiúirí seo, gur beag dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh maidir le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna ceantair seo, áiteanna ina bhfuil fostaíocht ag teastáil go géar.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Caithfidh mé glacadh leis agus aontaíonn gach duine leis an sprioc níos mó jabanna a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht, ach thar na blianta ó bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 1980, tá siad ag cur jabanna ar fáil.  An fhadhb mhór atá againn ná go bhfuil jabanna á gcailliúint chomh maith, agus sin é an fáth go bhfuilimid ag cur béime ar chaomhnú post chomh maith le breis post a chruthú.  Ar ndóigh, ní fadhb í seo a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht amháin, is fadhb náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta í agus is amhlaidh an scéal maidir leis an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail sa deisceart agus leis an Údarás céanna sa tuaisceart.  Tá mise sásta Bord Údarás na Gaeltachta a chosaint.  Tá siad ag déanamh an-iarracht.  Ar ndóigh tá atmasfear géilleagrach sa tír seo os rud é go bhfuil polasaithe réadúla an Rialtais á gcur i bhfeidhm.  Táimíd ag iarraidh níos mó tionsclóirí a mhealladh chun ineistíocht a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht chun jabanna a chruthú.</P>
      <P>Is annamh a smaoiním ar an nGaeltacht gan smaoineamh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Os rud é go bhfuil na jabanna á gcruthú ansin agus níos mó ná cúig mhíle duine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht tá Údarás na Gaeltachta agus feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis ag déanamh a ndícheall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an tAire agus mé féin thar ceann na Roinne sásta i gcomhnaí soláthar airgid caipitil a chur ar fáil chun jabanna a chruthú.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir a rá go bhfuil easpa airgid ar bith ar an Údarás. Dúirt mé go minic sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de má tá fadhbanna ag an Údarás maidir le easpa tionscail chun tionsclóirí a mhealladh isteach agus jab-anna <Col N="481" /> a chruthú go mbeimid sásta teacht i gcabhair orthu.</P>
    <P>Nílimid ábalta, ar ndóigh jabanna a chur ar fáil do gach uile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht. Ach taimíd agus an tÚdarás ag déanamh ar ndícheall.</P>

Ach an nglacfadh sé leis chomh maith go gcaithfimid ceistiú cad tá ag tarlú nuair nach bhfuil méadú ag teacht ar líon na bpost sna ceantair Ghaeltachta cé go bhfuil an Teach seo sásta na milliúin punt a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
      <P>Tá sé le feiceáil sa tuarascáil seo gur chailleadh 55 jabanna i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall féin sa bhliain sin cé gur chuir an Teach a lán airgid ar fáil chun tuilledh post a chruthú i nDún na nGall.  Tá an cás mar an gcéanna i gContae Mhaigheo. Níor tháinig aon fheabhas ar chor ar bith ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe ansin.

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Ar an gcéad dul síos ba cheart dúinn breathnú ar 1992 agus 1993 le chéile.  I 1992 bhí 2,194 duine fostaithe i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall agus ag deireadh 1993 bhí 2,329 fostaithe ann.  Ag deireadh 1992 bhí 560 fostaithe i nGaeltacht Mhaigheo agus ag deireadh 1993 ansin bhí 637 fostaithe ann.  B'fhéidir nach ardú anmhór é sin ach ardú suntasach 2 ab ea é i gcomparáid le ceantair eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe thit an fhostaíocht <Col N="482" /> ó 1,917 go dtí 1,843 ach bhí fadhbanna ansin agus tiocfaidh feabhas air i 1994.  Ar ndóigh tá líne díreach ag an Teachta Molloy go dtí an Údarás mar tá duine óna pháirtí féin ar an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an Rialtas an t-airgead a chur ar fáil ag déanamh cinnte de go gcuirfidh an tÚdarás polasaí an Rialtais i bhfeidhm agus anois tá siad ag cur béim láidir ag chaomhnú post.  Tá sin fíor-thábhachtach agus ba mhaith liom iad a mholadh as a n-iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir ba mhaith liomsa a rá go bhfuil freagracht againn as na nGaeltachtaí uilig.  Cé go bhfuil an Teachta Molloy ag cur béime ar Ghaeltachtaí Dhún na nGall, Mhaigheo agus na Gaillimhe &mdash; atá taobh istigh de cheantar Connacht/Ulaidh &mdash; tá Gaeltachtaí eile ann.

      <P>Since taking up office I have stressed the need for a Green Paper on broadcasting because of the changes in technology, programming and funding, the changed environment for public service broadcasting and the balance between national and local community, public and private broadcasting. The basic legislation is laid down in the 1960 Act, which was amended in 1976, but it is obvious that we need a new regime.  The Teilifís na Gaeilge project was supported by every party in this House and, following the general election, it was included in the Programme for Government.  Some people may have misgivings about it since and cannot make up their minds whether they are for or against it.  In fairness to Deputy Fitzgerald Young Fine Gael opposes the proposal in respect of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other broadcasting changes I made were eminently sensible.  A provision to lift the cap on advertising in RTE was included in the programme to protect and expand jobs.  Other initiatives I have taken were indicated in the programme. The Green Paper will address the wide-ranging territory I described, namely, technological changes and changes in balance. The broadcasting legislation will be <Col N="485" /> introduced after the Green Paper which I expect to be completed this year.</P>

I have had opportunities to meet officials of the IRTS to hear the views of not only the RTE Authority but those of different individuals, groups, trade unions and others.  Those submissions are available and there is a considerable degree of expertise within my Department.  If I need specialist advice on any aspect or contributions in respect of the territory I described I intend to obtain it as part of the preparatory process.  I am anxious that the Green Paper will address the issues I mentioned as thoroughly as possible so that it will inform the legislation in a proper way.  Existing legislation is out of date and amending legislation is needed to provide for changes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 38 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I have received more than 20 unsolicited applications from various groups seeking support for local arts centres. These submissions are for projects indicating varying degrees of development in terms of costings and feasibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds available to my Department for arts and culture are primarily earmarked for the main cultural institutions such as the National Museum, the National Library and the National Concert Hall.  However, the Structural Funds which have been placed at my disposal under the National Development Plan 1994-99 will enable me to undertake a major investment in these institutions. Funds are also available to me to support new arts and cultural infrastructure and, since the national cultural institutions are all based in Dublin, I am already on record as saying that I intend to ensure a <Col N="490" /> balance of investment between the capital city and the regions.  However, until discussions with the European Commission on the National Development Plan have been completed I am not in a position to say to what extent such arts and cultural centres can be funded from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the community employment schemes does the Minister see potential for the development of arts centres and job creation within these centres?  Will the Minister support existing arts centres?  Will he seek European funding for the development of these centres once he has dealt with the national cultural institutions? Will the arts centres be a central part of the plan under consideration for Structural Funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cultural institutions will have to be assisted by Structural Funds.  Many deserving projects have been put forward for funding and we must be careful to address the issue of the regional balance.  In some parts of the country there is no provision for arts, in others, there are buildings which may be in bad repair and where very little activity takes place while in other areas there is a great deal of activity but the centres are badly funded.  I intend to use the Structural Funds to deal with these deficiencies.  In all 20 projects have been submitted to me for funding and in a great number of these cases no sum of money has been specified.  Some have feasibility plans while others have not and some applied to other agencies for funding.  These applications will be considered in a balanced way to see if the deficiencies can be eliminated.  The Community Enterprise Development Programme will include a cultural component.  I intend to use creativity in the arts and cultural area in an effective, job producing way.</P>

      <P>Question No. 24 requests details of the sums available in my area of responsibility.  The total amount is £240 million of which local authority supported projects will receive £27 million.  When the European negotiations have concluded it will be possible to consider this matter in an orderly way. In mentioning these projects I am not criticising them.  There has been a certain enthusiasm for projects.  There is a requirement that there be a 25 per cent local contribution and applications are usually accompanied by a feasibility plan. It is also possible to integrate projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision for the library service is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment. However, I share the Deputy's view on the importance of libraries.  Over a long period there has been a run down in stocks and in services provided by libraries.  I will communicate the Deputy's views to the Minister for the Environment.  As regards the partnership projects, one of the great advantages of recognition of the arts and cultural area is that it will be represented in terms of the design of projects.  There are many <Col N="492" /> very fine, valuable projects and they will certainly feature.  Before the completion of discussions it would be wrong to give an indication as to where we are going. On the question of library services, one local authority has written to me in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would tell Deputy Quill, whose enthusiasm for the arts I share, that I could have spent twice the figure provided for in the national plan in promoting arts and culture.  The figure is justified and no difficulties have been communicated to me.  It is reasonable to assume that we will know before the summer the amount that will be available. In answer to an earlier question today I gave details of the areas in which money will be spent.  The figures are included in the national plan and will be drawn down from different operational programmes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I very rarely say so, this is to some extent an extension of the question.  Nevertheless, I am anxious to provide as much information as I can.  All I can do at this stage is give my best estimate of the likely European requirements for projects.  It is possible there will be a requirement for a 25 per cent private or local contribution and that State property will not qualify for a local or private contribution.  I will seek to ensure that the requirements are as flexible as possible and it would not be helpful if I indicated at this stage what I <Col N="493" /> believe the final mix will be, for example, some institutions may be in a better position than others to provide the 25 per cent private or local contribution.  Obviously, that is where the national plan comes into play, and we will have to look at the matter then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could this grant aid system be extended to cover heritage houses open to the public?  The Minister will be aware that many heritage houses, a few in particular, are major repositories of works of fine art and art of an historical value.  While these houses are open to the public many of them are very much in need of improvement in terms of preservation as well as the presentation of works of art.  Will the Minister be amenable to accepting applications from this source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that many people will make applications for grant-aid, and I am not here to encourage or discourage such applications.  The large number of applications shows an increased consciousness among people of the value of heritage and the importance of cultural and arts activity.  It is very clear that one should approach this issue in a planned way, with a strategy, rather than approaching it in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. I will look at applications in a planned way and see how projects meet the cultural-arts deficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of transparency in the allocation of funding for these art centres and given the variations in the applications which have been submitted to him, will the Minister consider publishing the criteria on which he will allocate funding for the development of these art centres?  Will other Departments also be involved in their funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question, when agreement has been reached in the discussions about the projects to be funded it would make sense to have uniform procedures, and I will bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> With regard to participation by other Departments, I have responsibility for Arts, Culture, the Gaeltacht and heritage, including waterways, and I am endeavouring to deal with these issues in an integrated way.  For example, it is possible to meet a heritage and an arts provision objective in the same way, getting better value for public money and using it more economically, with greater benefits.  The same is true about possible interaction between the Gaeltacht section and some of the other sections for which I have responsibility.  There are obvious projects where the co-operation of other Departments will be needed and I am not anticipating any difficulty in this regard.  It is very important to recognise that there will be significant gains in employment and training from any contribution in the areas of arts and culture. Many other areas will also benefit from such contributions and there must be positive co-operation between Departments to ensure maximum benefit from the funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to my question about public libraries, the Minister indicated he was prepared to convey my concerns to the Minister for the Environment, which I appreciate. However, when I raised this matter with him on an earlier occasion he undertook to consult the Minister for the Environment about the way in which his Department and the Department of the Environment could combine to ensure that the library service is improved and enhanced.  The service in my area has been very badly hit by lack of funding and in some cases libraries are virtually unable to open for any prolonged length of time.  The library service is essential to the provision of arts services in my area. I appeal to the Minister to actively pursue the question of assisting the public library service.  Will he undertake to look at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the possibility of assisting local organisations, particularly <Col N="495" /> community organisations, in the refurbishment of older buildings which may not necessarily come within the criteria established for heritage style development &mdash; all our built environment was not in place 200 or 300 years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the Deputy raising this matter previously in the House.  There are two dimensions to the library question as it affects my Department; the first relates to the Library Council and the second to buildings, etc. I will continue my discussions with the Department of the Environment about the library service which is of great importance at a time of high unemployment. It is also used by many elderly people.  We must examine how this service can be assisted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, it would be a great pity if genuinely good projects based on artscultural initiatives were lost because they did not come within the criteria of any one scheme.  I have examined the possibility of piloting certain schemes which may be the forerunner of schemes which receive more general provision.  It is very important that there is flexibility to extend initiatives so that people who want to do something are encouraged.  I will look at this matter in a very sympathetic way.</P>

      <Col N="496" /> The funds at my Department's disposal this year would not allow me to include funding for the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork.  Deputies will be aware that Structural Funds have been put at my disposal to provide funding for arts and culture infrastructure under the National Development Plan 1994-1999. However, since the details of the plan are currently under discussion with the European Commission, it will be some time before there will be a final agreement on the plan's components.  When this process has been completed I will be in a position to establish precise criteria for eligibility for assistance under my capital allocations.  I have tried to give some suggestions today.</P>
    <P>The Deputies are no doubt aware that the Crawford Gallery is administered by the County Cork vocational educational committee and that its funding requirements are the responsibility, in the first instance, of that body and my colleague, the Minister for Education.  The chairman of the board of the Crawford Gallery, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, has also been in touch with me on a number of occasions about this matter.  When the criteria for Structural Funds assistance for arts and cultural projects have been determined, I am prepared to consider the eligibility of the proposed development at the Crawford Gallery for such assistance in close consultation with the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that this gallery is not just a fine municipal gallery but is also a major force for artistic activity in the Munster region?  It needs this capital grant of £2.5 million to enable it grow and attain its full potential.  In accordance with the principle of balance between the capital and the region, to which the Minister made many references during Question Time today, would he accept that funding for this gallery must be provided in the context of the Structural Funds?  I ask the Minister to give this matter his immediate attention.</P>

      <P>The Crawford Gallery <Col N="497" /> is of significance not just to Cork but nationally.  It is also of immense importance for teaching purposes.  I visited the Crawford Gallery, as the Deputy may be aware, and it has two problems, one of which is urgent.  There is a problem with the roof, which would require a sum of £0.5 million to repair.  In addition, the board of the gallery has proposed that while repairs are carried out to the roof, an extension should be provided which would increase the amount of work that could be carried on and also increase access to the gallery.  It suggests that rather than proceed with the immediate problem of the roof, it would be more appropriate to see if the extension can be considered at the same time.  Those are the terms on which the proposal has been put to me.</P>
      <P>The Crawford Gallery is administered by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and the local authority may want to indicate to the vocational education committee how it proposes to assist in coming up with mechanisms to meet the 25 per cent requirement.  This is a worthy project and when the exact criteria have been announced I will examine it further.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Gilmore and Deputy O'Malley referred to section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, which requires the Government, as soon as may be after 1 January in each year beginning in 1989, to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, that is, the backing of warrants arrangements which we operate with Britain and the North.  These reports are prepared by the Attorney General and submitted by the Minister for Justice to the Government to approve the text of the reports and authorise their presentation to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report on the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, in 1992 was received recently by my Department and it is now in the process of being submitted by me to Government with a view to its presentation to the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Extradition Act, 1965, provides for two different systems of extradition. Part III of the 1965 Act applies to the <Col N="561" /> United Kingdom and Part II of the 1965 Act, based on the European Convention on Extradition, applies to our extradition arrangements with other states.  The backing of warrants system, applied between Ireland and the United Kingdom under Part III, is in fact more easy to operate as both jurisdictions have a similar legal system.  The vast majority of extradition requests, both incoming and outgoing, dealt with in this jurisdiction relate to the United Kingdom.  This reason alone justifies the maintaining of special procedures with the United Kingdom &mdash; a point raised by Deputy Liz O'Donnell &mdash; and I would not favour moving away from the existing system at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell queried the difference between the two systems as regards the period of remand after arrest on a provisional warrant.  The explanation is quite simple.  Under the simplified system operated under Part III, section 49 of the Act, a person can be arrested here on a provisional warrant provided there is a warrant for his or her arrest in existence in the United Kingdom.  The seven day period envisaged by section 13 of the Bill is to allow time for that warrant to be physically sent to this jurisdiction, examined by the Attorney General and endorsed by the Garda Commissioner.  It should be possible to do that within a seven day period and I see no justification for locking up a possibly innocent person for any period longer than necessary.</P>
    <P>The situation is more complicated under section 27 of the 1965 Act, which applies to countries other than the United Kingdom.  The requesting country, which will have a different type of legal system, has to prepare a number of documents which are set out in section 25 of the 1965 Act.  They then probably have to arrange for their translation and dispatch them through diplomatic channels to this jurisdiction. This process takes longer and for that reason 18 days is allowed.  It is perfectly possible for the UK to meet the seven day requirement under Part III, but it is not possible for other countries to meet the more complicated requirements <Col N="562" /> of Part II in a period as short as seven days.</P>
    <P>We have a special extradition arrangement with the United Kingdom, but the House does not need reminding that there were genuine concerns about the extradition of Irish citizens to the United Kingdom.  Deputy Mitchell asked if there was any need for the safeguards provided for in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, to be maintained.  Deputy O'Donnell seems to be advocating replacing those safeguards with a court based system.  Deputy Gilmore also raised the role of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The role of the Attorney General in the extradition process under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 has been fully debated in this House on at least two occasions &mdash; once during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and again when a resolution was passed in 1988 continuing the operation of the Act.  I see no point in going over the same arguments again.  The provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act have been in force now for six years and have given rise to no major problems.  The existing system works well and I see no reason to change it.</P>
    <P>Although the proposal to restrict bail to the High Court was welcomed, Deputy Mitchell expressed concern that the High Court would feel obliged to grant bail in extradition cases.  The Supreme Court, in the case of the People (Attorney General <i>v.</i> Gilliland, 1986, ILRM 381, decided that the test for the granting of bail in extradition cases should not be different from that in ordinary criminal cases.  I know there are concerns about the existing bail conditions in ordinary criminal cases.  As I announced on 25 January 1994, the issue has been referred to the Law Reform Commission for its advice on options that may be open to bring about a change of the law on bail.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell seemed surprised about certain functions and powers given to the Minister for Justice under the provisions of the 1965 Act.  Those functions and powers have been a matter of public knowledge for practically 30 years and, <Col N="563" /> as far as I am aware, have never given rise to serious concerns regarding the general principle behind them or the manner in which they have been exercised.  In virtually every member state of the European Union, except Ireland, the counterpart of our Minister for Justice takes the final decision as to whether a particular individual will be extradited. There is nothing unusual about my powers in this area.  Indeed, by European standards, my role is minimal.</P>
    <P>The judicial arm of the State is involved in the extradition process to ensure that the rights of the person sought are protected.  However, when that person's rights have been respected, the decision whether to extradite generally would be regarded as an exercise of power appropriate to the executive arm of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of extradition and the death penalty.  The practice in all member states of the European Union, including Ireland, is that extradition for an offence carrying the death penalty will not be permitted unless the requesting State gives an undertaking that the death penalty will not be carried out.</P>
    <P>Extradition of Irish citizens to European countries was also raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  As we know, we extradite Irish citizens to the United Kingdom. Indeed, because of our laws on citizenship, nearly every request from the United Kingdom relates to a person who can claim Irish citizenship.  There is specific provision in our extradition treaties with the United States and Australia for the extradition of own nationals; they will extradite their nationals to us and we will extradite our nationals to them.  The number of requests under these treaties is small and, with one or two notable exceptions, has not given rise to controversy. The legal position regarding extradition of our citizens to countries under the European Convention on Extradition is unclear.  The European convention allows the extradition of own nationals but does not specifically require it.  I do not wish to enter a debate on the subject <Col N="564" /> other than to say that there are conflicting legal opinions.  I am of the view that we should not extradite our nationals to a country if that country will not extradite its nationals to us.  Extradition is based on mutual trust of our respective legal systems.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dermot Ahern and Kemmy referred to irresponsible remarks about well known terrrorists walking about freely in this State.  Such remarks are irresponsible and indeed inflammatory.  I have taken the opportunity on a number of occasions to firmly reject assertions which surface from time to time that this State is not doing all it can to apprehend and convict those responsible for terrorist actions.  I have referred to our substantial commitment of garda and other security resources, our recovery of large quantities of terrorist arms and explosives, our many successful prosecutions of terrorist suspects as clear indications of this commitment to combating terrorism.  There is no ambivalance in our attitude to terrorism. There is not succour or support from this State for those who pursue political ends through violence and no question of the State seeking to harbour any person responsible for an act of terrorism. The authorities here and in Britain acknowledge that persons suspected of involvement in terrorism reside in both parts of Ireland and in Britain and in both jurisdictions they have the resources, powers and commitment to arrest and charge anyone suspected of such involvement.  However, as Deputy Dermot Ahern and other rightly said, the essential element required is evidence; suspicion alone is not enough to obtain a conviction for a criminal offence here, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Dermot Ahern's remarks about the &ldquo;hand over&rdquo; point and the disruption caused in Dundalk. What he said is a good illustration of why the Bill provides for a change on this point.  I listened to a lengthy history lesson from Deputy Dukes.  I do not intend to hazard a guess as to which parties might be paragons of virtue in this House.  He asked what crime of violence <Col N="565" /> can constitute a political offence in a parliamentary democracy.  The answer is &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  This Bill will make it clear that offences involving violence cannot be political.</P>
    <P>Talks are under way at European level between the 12 European Union member states on extradition.  One of the aims of these talks is that acts of violence of the type covered by Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism will never be regarded as political offences by those States.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and Jim O'Keeffe asked why mere possession of firearms has not been included in the Schedule to the Bill.  The reason is straightforward &mdash; the offence is too far removed from the type of offence envisaged by the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  Article 1 of the Convention specifies that an offence involving use of an automatic firearm cannot be political if that use endangers life.  Section 3 of the 1987 Act gives effect to that provision in our law.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we go further by effectively removing any distinction that might be drawn between the use of automatic and non-automatic weapons.  Furthermore, we provide that an offence involving possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, or with other criminal intent, cannot be regarded as a political offence.  However, to include the offence of possession in suspicious circumstances, without the requirement to prove some form of criminal intent, would be going too far.  For example, it would mean that a poacher caught with a shotgun, or a person in possession of an unlicensed handgun for his or her own self defence, would come within the scope of this Bill.  I am concerned that to broaden the Schedule beyond what everybody can agree are serious offences associated with terrorism would undermine public confidence in the provisions of this Bill.  I should emphasise that the non-inclusion of the offence of possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances does not mean that a person found in possession of an assault rifle or machine <Col N="566" /> gun will escape extradition.  In such circumstances the standard charge is possession with intent to endanger life, which is specifically included in the Schedule.  I might remind the House that the charge in the Sloan case was possession of an M60 machine gun and ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, which would, of course, be covered by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked whether persons to be extradited would be able to choose their method of transport.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Under the provisions of the Bill it will be a matter solely for the Garda Síochána to decide the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy suggested that there should be a common network of laws.  Of course, this is how matters have developed as regards extradition over the past 40 years.  In the 1950s we had the European Convention on Extradition, in the 1970s the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and, currently, European Union countries are discussing how extradition can be made more effective.  Things are moving in the direction desired by Deputy Kemmy and I am confident that further progress will be made on an international scale in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the balance in our extradition laws, a very important point.  The Bill deals with circumstances in which extradition would be granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to four defects in the Bill, three of which had already been referred to by other speakers. His fourth point was that membership of an illegal organisation should be included in the First Schedule to the Bill.

      <P>I agree that the section has been improved by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  There should be an objective test as to what constitutes reasonable behaviour and misbehaviour. What might be serious to me might not be serious to another.  In law there is the eggshell rule concept.  Some people have particularly sensitive feelings about what is serious and offensive.  I hope the Garda will implement this legislation in a sensitive and responsible way.  The proof will be how the Bill operates and how judges interpret the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is an improvement. It seems almost as if it were a typographical error to insert the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; before &ldquo;offence&rdquo; and not before &ldquo;annoyance&rdquo;.  The Bill deals with disorderly conduct in a public place.  One person's disorderly conduct might be another's high spirits.  It is important that we have a yardstick to judge it by and so I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore knew the answer to the question he posed.  As Deputy O'Donnell rightly said, this matter will be tested in the <Col N="571" /> courts.  I might have more liberal views on what would cause serious offence or serious annoyance than someone else.  It will depend on the evidence given by the gardaí and the complainant and the view the judge takes.  This is a better way to deal with it rather than set down what decibels music would have to reach before it would cause serious annoyance.</P>

What training will be given to them?  It may be useful for them to have uniform guidelines to help them implement the legislation.</P>
      <P>I support the legislation with reservations. If we give the gardaí extra powers we owe it to them, and the general public in terms of human rights and civil liberties, that implementation of the provision be non-selective.  In other words, that the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place would not have a different standard of application in disadvantaged areas as compared to Dalkey or Foxrock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's reluctance to tell us what is meant by serious annoyance or serious offence.  One of the criticisms of this legislation is that it is subjective.  New offences are being introduced and there is a lack of clarity in what they mean.  Let us take the offence of conduct which may cause serious offence or serious annoyance.  A number of possibilities arise.  First the person who considers it a serious offence or serious annoyance&mdash;something which will vary from individual to individual &mdash; and second, the question of establishing <Col N="572" /> that an offence has been committed if a garda is not present.  I may report to the Garda that someone shouted abuse outside my house at 2 a.m. but if the person is not apprehended &mdash; or if somene walking near my house denies the offence &mdash; it would be very difficult to establish in court that an offence was committed.  Even if a garda is present he may not view the offence seriously.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem referred to by Deputy O'Donnell that the way in which a youngster may look at a garda in one part of the city will be interpreted differently from the way in which a youngster may look at a garda in another part of the city.  There is also the element of class bias in the administration of justice which is palpable both from the policing and from what happens when people get to court.  If you get through all those subjective hurdles you will end up in court at the mercy of the whims of the judge, whether he has been on the town the night before, whether it is early in the morning or late in the evening when he is in a hurry to get to the golf course.  All these things play a part in determining what constitutes serious annoyance or serious offence.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on the Legislature to give guidance.  Obviously, one cannot make a decision for each individual case which ultimately has to be tested and decided in court.  The Minister's reluctance to become involved in that area is worrying because it means we are establishing offences, putting them in legislation and allowing lawyers to make huge sums of money arguing whether something is serious and then leaving it in the hands of the Garda and the Judiciary to make up their minds on the spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For an offence to be committed under this section, not alone does it have to be a serious offence or cause serious offence or serious annoyance it also has to mean it is unreasonable behaviour.  It is not stretching our imagination too far to expect that people living in a housing estate would know if unreasonable <Col N="573" /> behaviour was causing annoyance or offence at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  If we tie ourselves down to deciding what serious offence or serious annoyance will be then we will tie up the legislation so that it can never be interpreted in different ways in the courts.  It is important to give the courts the leeway to make a decision based on the evidence before them.  We do not have that evidence.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a valid point in relation to how the Garda will interpret it.  She is right in saying it can be a subjective matter.  This Bill as it progressed through both Houses, was carefully scrutinised within the existing training facilities at Templemore.  Obviously the Garda training officers would not know the eventual outcome of the Bill but they were very much involved in keeping abreast of the debate here and I am sure listened very carefully to concerns expressed by Members in relation to how individual members of the Garda would implement the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is an inservice training facility in every Garda division.  As each new item of criminal justice legislation is passed it is carefully evaluated and studied within an inservice training group.  The way in which the Garda approach various offences, created by a particular Act, is examined carefully so that, as far as possible, there is uniform implementation. Both the Garda and I want to ensure that our laws are implemented in an equitable way regardless of where one lives or anything else.</P>
      <P>Following its passage through the House, the timescale for the implementation of the Bill before it becomes law is reduced to one month.  The reason for that gap is to ensure that the Garda have an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the Bill passed by this House.</P>

      <P>I move that <Col N="574" /> the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>SECTION 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 36, &ldquo;6, or 7&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;6, 7 or 9&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>I should mention initially that this Seanad amendment and Seanad amendment No. 3 arise from discussions we had in this House on Report Stage.  Section 8 allows a member of the Garda Síochána who suspects that a person is acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 or 7 of the Bill to direct that person from acting in such a manner and to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner.  The section provides that it shall be an offence for any person, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, to fail to comply with such a direction.</P>
      <P>Section 24 provides for a power of arrest without warrant where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that an offence has been committed under any of a number of specified sections, including section 8.  Accordingly, where a person fails to comply with a direction of a member of the Garda Síochána there will be a power of arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage there was an amendment in the name of Progressive Democrats Deputies, the effect of which would have been to include in section 24 a power of arrest without warrant in respect of offences under section 9 which deals with wilful obstruction.  I indicated I saw merit in what was being proposed but Deputy Mitchell expressed concerns about this approach.  In the circumstances, Deputy McDowell withdrew the amendment, having suggested a compromise which I undertook to consider while the Bill was before the Seanad.  I subsequently considered the compromise which was made and I tabled an amendment in the Seanad to give effect to it which was accepted there and is now before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment will be to extend the power of the Garda to issue directions under section 8 to offences of <Col N="575" /> wilful obstruction under section 9.  In these circumstances, it is not proposed to include in section 24 a power of arrest without warrant in relation to offences under section 9.  Where a person is suspected of committing an offence under section 9, and refuses to comply with the direction of a garda to desist, under the powers conferred by section 8, there will be a power of arrest without warrant because an offence will then have been committed under section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for a power of arrest in relation to an offence under section 8.  In practical terms the amendment will mean that a power of arrest without warrant will not arise for the offence of wilful obstruction unless the person committing the offence also refuses to comply with a direction from a member of the Garda Síochána to desist. This is a sensible approach to take as a result of the various views expressed on this matter on Report Stage.  I am grateful for the suggestion Deputy McDowell made at that time and I hope that Deputy Mitchell can accept that the amendment goes a long way to meet the type of concerns he expressed.</P>

      <P>These amendments are an improvement and I appreciate that the Minister has taken into account comments already made.  However, I have very serious reservations about section 7 and section 8 as it applies to section 7. Section 7 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to distribute or display in writing, sign or visible representation which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is going too far to include &ldquo;abusive or <Col N="576" /> insulting&rdquo;.  The section as it relates to the distribution or display of material would make it a criminal offence for someone to stand outside Leinster House or an Ard Fheis with a placard on which insulting words were written.  That goes very close to denying people their constitutional right to free speech.  Section 6 deals with the use of threatening words in a similar way, where it says:</P>
    <P>It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to use or engage in any threatening, abusive or insulting words.</P>
    <P>The principle applies to both sections 6 and 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to delete &ldquo;6 or 7&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;6, 7 or 9&rdquo;.  It is going too far to allow legislation to pass through this House which makes it a criminal offence to carry an insulting placard.  We have overstepped the line in this and unless we are prepared to further amend this Bill there is a possibility that it will be referred to the Supreme Court and found to be unconstitutional.  I have serious misgivings. I made this point on Committee and Report Stages and asked the Minister to look at it in the Seanad.  The changes the Minister has made are appreciated as they improve the Bill, but section 7 as it stands is far too dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are anxious not to delay this Bill. There are many problems and it is not just I who cannot park a car outside my house.  Someone asked about the difference between serious annoyance and <Col N="577" /> annoyance and it is suggested that annoyance is when somebody's hub caps are taken and serious annoyance is when one's own hub caps are taken.  Without losing a sense of humour, we must be careful about this section.  The Bill will be delayed if the President refers the Bill to the Supreme Court.  This Bill goes into grey areas and I am prepared to go along with it because on balance it brings the scales of justice back into equilibrium. Because this Bill deals in grey areas it will be looked at closely as to whether or not it should be submitted to the Supreme Court.  Making the carrying of an insulting poster a criminal offence could give rise to it being referred to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I want to see this Bill being implemented but I criticise it for not ensuring that criminals will feel the pain they are inflicting on others and for impinging on the rights of law-abiding people.  The Bill will be laughed at by criminals.  There is not one criminal who is shaking in his boots because we make the carrying of an insulting placard a criminal offence.  The Minister should even now consider deleting that word from the Bill because otherwise it is likely to be referred to the Supreme Court, which will delay its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am concerned about constitutionality, and not only in relation to this section.  I have qualms generally about many aspects of the Bill. Legislation is necessary but I want to express my doubts about some aspects of the Bill, particularly the aspect of free speech.  For example, people who oppose abortion and who have placards showing pictures of a foetus might offend some people.  I am not at the radical end of the pro-life movement, but I have always spoken out about the right to information and free speech and I would fight for the right of those people to use such placards because they are very much part of free speech as guaranteed in our Constitution. It is important not to go too far and I too have doubts about making the carrying of insulting placards a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 8, I am glad <Col N="578" /> that the Minister has taken up Deputy McDowell's suggestion in a compromise way.  With regard to loitering as detailed in section 8, many people were worried about loitering, but the Bill is clear in that it does not make loitering an offence <i>per se</i> but specifies that it must be loitering which gives rise to a reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons or property.  There is an objectivity there which is desirable.  One aspect of loitering is that there is a growing number of young homeless people in Dublin.  The Eastern Health Board recently produced the first comprehensive report which gives a clear picture of the number involved.  Sadly more and more young people are becoming homeless every day, some of whom are coming out of care and onto the streets and into insecure accommodation. Inevitably this means that young people are loitering.</P>
    <P>Certain young people, by their dress, demeanour and by the fact that they are disadvantaged, homeless and poor and have no money to stand in from the rain and buy a cup of tea or coffee, could give the impression to a reasonable garda that they are about to cause a breach of the peace.  A special direction should be given to the Garda on how to deal with homeless people under 18 years.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that 280 young people under 18 years sought help from the Eastern Health Board between January and June of 1983.  Many of them are in B &amp; B accommodation; 139 of those youngsters were sleeping rough in Dublin and 156 were in insecure accommodation. As the housing authority concerned, Dublin City Council is aware of the problem.  In fact the matter has been raised in this House on a number of occasions and is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  People have expressed their concerns to me as their representative on the city council that these young people might be at risk of being harassed by garda.  I ask the Minister to accept my concerns about homeless young people, as they are truly disadvantaged victims.  I would hate to think that they would be further disadvantaged by the Garda harassing them <Col N="579" /> under the provisions of this Bill.  Section 8 refers to the failure to comply with the directions of members of the Garda Síochána and I am concerned about the selective use of Garda powers.  It is important that the Garda be properly trained to be sympathetic to people without interfering with their constitutional rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of Jimmy Hoffa.  Deputy Mitchell should remember it could be a lot worse &mdash; his hub-caps were only stolen but by all accounts Jimmy Hoffa became a hub-cap.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 to section 8 extends the powers of the garda and I share the concern that has been expressed about provisions of this Bill, especially the provisions of this section.  There has been a public demand for public order legislation. As recently as last week I attended a meeting in my constituency where I was asked again what we in the Dáil were doing to deal with the problem of groups of people congregating in a menancing way, causing disturbance, annoyance and making life a misery for people in their community.  I told them the story of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. There was a great deal of support for a Bill which would make it easier to deal with this problem on the ground.  I subscribe to that and I support the need for this Bill but, as other Members have said, there is a very thin line between giving legislative effect to the measures in this area that are necessary to protect the interests of the public and preventing an abuse of police power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the nervousness that other Members have expressed about certain aspects of the Bill.  Not only am I nervous about the Bill, I am nervous about the <Col N="580" /> quality of the legal advice the Government seem to be getting in recent times. I wonder if some of the concerns we have been expressing about the Bill go back to whether the legal advice available to the Government is sound.  Many provisions in this Bill are written in language that is very general, subjective and could give rise to a field day when it comes to be tested in the court.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with powers of the Garda.  This is a section in which a garda can tell a person to move on and, if one does not do so, one can be arrested without warrant.  When the Bill originally came before the House the powers of the Gartda to deal with people who did not respond to a request were confined to sections 4, 5 and 6.  Section 4 makes perfect sense and is confined to intoxication in public places, it is prudent for our Garda to deal with someone who is drunk by trying to get them home.</P>
    <P>Similarly, section 5 which in its original form banned singing and shouting between midnight and 7 a.m. has been amended to deal with offensive conduct between midnight and 7 a.m.  Again, it is probably a prudent measure that the person is encouraged to go home and only in a situation where they refuse to do so would they be in trouble.  I am very concerned about the use of this provision. Section 6 relates to the offence of threatening, abusive or insulting words and a garda can tell someone to refrain and if he does not do so he can be arrested without warrant.  Section 7 is similar and concerns the display in a public place of a placard which conveys something that is said to be abusive, insulting or obscene &mdash; the anti-abortion campaign is a good example.</P>
    <P>My home was picketed by anti-abortion campaigners at an early stage of the campaign.  I did not particularly like it and some of the visual material displayed outside my home &mdash; and there were a great many young children on the street who saw it &mdash; was vulgar and obscene. The gardaí concerned handled the situation in a very tactful way but nonetheless I would be concerned about the use of section 8 as amended in that scentinise <Col N="581" /> ario.  I would not want a situation where if this were to happen outside my home again the Garda would come along and tell the people that they had to move along and if they did not do so they would start arresting them.  I cannot see how that would contribute a great deal to public order yet that is precisely what we are legislating for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The specific amendment that the Minister is proposing is to extend the provision to section 9, the section that deals with wilful obstruction.  I think I know from the debate on section 9 what was intended.  If, on her way to a community centre, a neighbour's house or a shop, a woman was stopped by even one or two heavies this would constitute wilful obstruction.  On one occasion when driving into a housing estate seven or eight youngsters jumped on my car.  One has to make a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they take the Deputy's hub cap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was much faster than the Deputy.  I was not worried about the hub caps; I was afraid that they were going to take me.  That would also constitute wilful obstruction.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify one matter. Concern has been expressed as to whether this legislation will apply to demonstrations, strikes, pickets and so on. My clear intention in placing a picket on a premises during an industrial dispute would be to stop in a peaceful way people from going to work.  On the first day of the strike I may have a placard which simply states &ldquo;Strike on here&rdquo; but if people pass it I may have a placard carrying the word &ldquo;Scab&rdquo; on the second day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I find that goods are being delivered to the employer through the back gate and organise a picket involving a large number of people, not necessarily to climb up on the bonnet of the lorry or to touch the hub caps but rather to make it clear to the driver in a tactful way that we mean business and would not like the lorry to pass through the gate, will this constitute wilful obstruction and where will I stand if the employer decides to <Col N="582" /> summon the forces of the law?  If the Garda come to the conclusion that I am wilfully obstructing people from going to their place of work and a supplier from supplying blacked goods to the employer will they have the authority to say to people on the picket line that they have to move and, if they fail to move, to arrest them without warrant?  Will we be then faced with the obscene situation which Britain faced in the early eighties where police on horseback waded through miners who were on strike under similar legislation?</P>
    <P>I note that there is a saver, the reference &ldquo;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  Will the fact that people are on strike constitute lawful authority or reasonable excuse for displaying a sign or for shouting at scabs or attempting to block a lorry?  Suppose it is not an industrial dispute but a protest of some kind.  Suppose it is an anti-abortion protest.  Suppose that at the protest the Peace Train organisation and New Consensus plan to organise outside the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis next week someone on the picket shouts &ldquo;Murderer&rdquo; at people going into the Ard Fheis and this is regarded as insulting or abusive by some member of Sinn Féin, could the Garda attempt to remove posters or arrest people or move them on?</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on this issue because, when it was first proposed in the Bill to give the Garda the power to move people on, one could see where it fitted in and that it would apply in cases where the sensible thing to do would be to move people on.  It is worrying that it is now being extended and will be able to be used in the way I have described.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going back over many of the arguments made when the Bill passed through the House originally. Extraordinary powers are being given to the authorities in sections 4 to 9, inclusive, to intrude into what would be described as normal run of the mill activities. The activities being covered include drunken behaviour, disorderly conduct, <Col N="583" /> abusive and obscene language, threatening and insulting behaviour and loitering. In legislation in the past certain provisions relating to drunken behaviour and disorderly conduct were struck down as not being constitutionally sound. These sections have implications for the principle of free speech and freedom of assembly.  It raises question marks as to whether they would withstand a constitutional challenge.</P>
      <P>I await the Minister's response on these central issues, but we have to approach them in a delicate fashion.  The Garda are being given extraordinary powers to control the conduct of various sections of the community as in the case of a protest or march organised by students or farmers. These groups may engage in robust behaviour to get their point of view across and may find themselves subjected to a range of penalties.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is desirable and marks an improvement, but it is unacceptable that drunken behaviour is to be criminalised under section 4.  It will be an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he might endanger himself.  This could hardly be described as a criminal matter.  It should not be a summary offence leading to conviction and a fine.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 the first step is for the Garda to ask the person to desist or leave the scene.  That is probably the best approach.  Was there any suggestion in the Seanad that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in section 8 (1) (b) (i)?  It would seem that paragraphs (i) and (ii) are alternatives so that a person could be asked first, to desist and then, if necessary, to leave the scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 lays down the steps to be taken by the Garda, including asking a person to desist from undesirable activity, asking him to leave the scene, arresting the person, at which stage there is liability on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six <Col N="584" /> months or to both.  Fines and sentences of imprisonment are already covered in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.  Does that mean that the penalties specified in section 8 are in addition to those in the other sections and there could be a doubling of penalties?  In one instance there is a fine of £100, in another a fine of £200 and in another a fine of £500 depending on the section.  There is an instance of three months imprisonment and another of six months imprisonment.  Finally, in section 8 there is provision for a fine of £500 or six months imprisonment or both.  Are these separate sanctions to be added to what is contained already in the existing provisions?  That question must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 raise the issue of the right of people to assemble or to strongly express their views.  Wilful obstruction seems open to almost any interpretation.  Section 9 provides that any person who in any manner wilfully prevents or interrupts the free passage of any person or vehicle in a public place is liable to a fine.  It is virtually impossible to take part in a public march in the streets of the city or anywhere else without in some way interrupting free passage of traffic and persons.  The penalties and the manner in which they can be imposed are laid out in the Bill and if arrests can take place without warrant that means enormous power is being given to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is an improvement on the section and I am glad to see the extension of the provisions in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 to section 9, because my interpretation of the Minister's intention is that instead of arresting a person there will be a process of asking a person to desist from undesirable behaviour and, if necessary, to leave the vicinity of the place concerned.  That would allow members of the Garda to lower the level of emotion and avoid having to arrest somebody with the result that the full process of the law would have to be brought to bear.  I would like some clarification from the Minister on those two points: the overlapping of penalties and how it is intended sections 4, <Col N="585" /> 5, 6, 7 and 9, and now section 8, will operate.  Will they operate in a phased way in terms of the level of seriousness of response by the Garda to incidents that might give rise to the type of behaviour mentioned in the sections?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello's worry is reasonable in one sense; he is concerned that gardaí might be trigger happy and not go through a measured response to a situation in which they find themselves.  However, in the last analysis, if 20 or 30 people are obstructing a road somebody must have the power to move them.  The £200 penalty, provided for under section 9, would not be sufficient to keep the traffic running in the city if people decided to stage a sit down protest for any reason.</P>
      <P>In order to invoke powers under section 8 a garda would have to specify that he is giving a direction under that section.  It would not be sufficient for him to make the request in an informal way; he will have to make it clear that he is invoking his statutory power under the section before failing to comply could be deemed an offence.  Under the Road Traffic Acts when a garda requires a specimen he must specify that he is invoking the law and relying on a statutory provision.  An informal request will not be sufficient to ground a power of arrest. Once a garda invokes powers under section 8 people will realise that it is a formal request and that a refusal to comply can carry serious consequences.</P>

      <P>To answer Deputy McDowell's last point, the garda would give a warning under the relevant section of this Bill.  I do not intend to refer to all the points raised because they were debated at great length here, at the Select Committee and on Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad.  This debate began eight months ago and everyone in this House thought then that this Bill would become law by the autumn. Almost every elected representative who represents an urban area wrote to me in respect of this matter since I took up office as Minister for Justice.  That highlights <Col N="586" /> the pressure public representatives are under from the victims of public order disturbances to have this legislation enacted.  Deputy Gilmore cited his experience in the past week.  Of all the issues that have been raised with me in the past 12 months by members of residents associations, neighbourhood watch schemes, voluntary groups and delegations from various parts of the country, particularly urban areas, the main priority so far as my Department is concerned is public order legislation.  I am sure all Members will agree that such legislation is a major priority for the public at large.</P>
      <P>While people are naturally concerned about the powers given to members of the Garda, little recognition is given to the commonsense approach applied by the majority of gardaí in implementing our laws.  No Minister or Garda Commissioner could guarantee that in a force of over 10,000 members there would not be an abuse of power at some stage during the lifetime of the force.  The answer is not that we should not give powers to the Garda, but rather that an effective complaints procedure should be put in place.  By and large, the Garda have not abused their power in the past. They have implemented the law by applying a commonsense approach.  That is the road down which we must travel in regard to this legislation.</P>
      <P>People have reservations about particular sections of the Bill.  Both here and in the Seanad I have been open to suggestions and amendments.  This amendment is the result of an amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell.  The wording was not appropriate, but with his co-operation we came up with this solution.  Members of both Houses have been responsible in their contributions to this legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to this amendment, none of us wants people who are legitimately on a picket or protesting about something to be subject to this law.  However, citizens do not have an absolute right to prevent their fellow citizens from going about their business.  I do not believe any of us would argue that that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> Section 9 deals with wilful obstruction, and some people have concerns in that regard.  We are not creating any new offence in section 9.  Section 13 (3) of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851, deals with wilful obstruction.  In section 9 of this Bill we are adding the words &ldquo;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;, which Members agreed was necessary, and we are also increasing the penalty from 20 shillings to £200.</P>
    <P>In relation to the displaying of placards and so on, subsection (1) states that one is committing an offence only when displaying a sign or visible representation which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  That inserts a valuable safeguard in the legislation and should answer many of the queries raised on that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a very valid point in relation to homeless young people.  She was concerned that under this legislation gardaí might harass such young people who through no fault of their own have to live in such conditions. It is not intended that the powers given to gardaí under this legislation would cover such behaviour.  In other words, the gardaí could not continually harass young homeless people.  The legislation refers to unreasonable behaviour, signs and language, the intent of which is to provoke a breach of the peace.  Our young homeless people are not on our streets with the intention of causing a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to repeat what I have already said on this section.  People have been agitating for a long time for many of the provisions in this part of the legislation. Public order disturbance does not always take place in areas which people might regard as public places.  For example, in urban areas it frequently takes place in large public green areas at the gable end of the last house in a housing estate.  The gardaí who are called out to such disturbances on a regular basis <Col N="588" /> have frequently been forced to explain to members of residents associations or concerned community people that they do not have powers to deal with such public order disturbances, that public order legislation is going through the Dáil and that as soon as it is enacted they will have such powers.  I acknowledge that Members do not wish to delay the passage of this Bill because it will assist the Garda and, more importantly, will deal with the serious public disorder that takes place, particularly in urban areas.  The victims of that type of public disorder are anxious to have this legislation enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect a note of weariness in the Minister's response, but after eight months she is entitled to be weary. We are all anxious to see this legislation enacted, but it is not just a question of getting it through this House.  We want legislation in place that will deal effectively with the problem of public disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past week at least one newspaper report suggested that after the passage of this legislation the President may consult the Council of State and refer the legislation to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality, as is her right. We were all anxious to have legislation in respect of the matrimonial home enacted.  Legislation in that regard passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas but is not yet in place.  We do not want provisions of this legislation to be found unconstitutional.  Even if the President does not refer the Bill to the Supreme Court it is possible that a case may be taken privately to test its constitutionality given the concern expressed about this legislation and the sources of such concern. We are obliged to ensure that the measures we enact here stand up, otherwise the years of waiting for this legislation may be extended.  The concern I raised in the context of the amendment was about the extension of the powers of the gardaí to public protests, industrial disputes, pickets, demonstrations and so on.  The Minister stated in her reply that nobody would wish that people engaging in legitimate protests would be subject to <Col N="589" /> the legislation, but that is not the position under the Bill.  This amendment will allow the gardaí to order those engaged in a picket or a protest to move on.  That goes too far.  Having heard the Minister's reply I oppose her amendment.  It will extend the Garda powers too far.  The Bill was intended to deal with rowdiness, disturbances, intimidation and menancing behaviour so prevalent in urban areas which we all come across and have drawn to the Minister's attention.  It is not, and should never have been, intended to deal with problems of public protest.</P>
    <P>Another danger may arise in respect of this provision on which the Minister might reflect.  It is not always the case that people who engage in public protest are quaking in their shoes in fear of arrest.  In some cases people might like to be arrested.  This country loves martyrs. The last industrial dispute which resulted in people being arrested was the famous ESB strike when the public outcry was so great that the protesters were sent home in taxis.  If legislation provides that people who block a road can be asked by the gardaí to move on and if they do not they can be arrested, it could in some cases encourage a demonstration.  I do not wish to labour a point that has been debated but I am concerned about the extension of the Garda powers in this area.  I oppose the Minister's proposal to extend those powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the point.  Nothing we say will alter the reservations we expressed earlier about intrusion into the behaviour of citizens. We agree with the purpose of the Bill but there is a question mark over the implementation of the proposed powers and their extent.  Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 prescribe penalties which may include a fine and or a term of three to six months imprisonment.  Section 8 sets out offences, namely, failure to desist and failure to leave the scene immediately which carry a £500 fine or a period of six months imprisonment.  The other sections prescribe penalties, namely, the imposition of a fine of up to £500.  Are the penalties prescribed replacement <Col N="590" /> penalties or additional to those prescribed in the original provisions?  That is important as the new penalties would add considerably to those listed in the Bill.  Is a step-by-step procedure being introduced? I understood that was the case and that it would improve the legislation by providing that rather than arresting people without a warrant they would be requested to desist and leave the area. The Minister should clarify those points.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not differ from similar legislation, for example, if one is arrested for being in breach of a number of sections of the Road Traffic Act proceedings are taken against a person in relation to each section breached.  Similarly, if one is arrested and charged with offences, under this Bill it will be a matter for the courts to decide whether the person is guilty under each of the sections and, if so, whether the full rigours of the law under each section should be applied.  In that respect this Bill when enacted will not differ from existing Acts.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), lines 3 to 5, deleted and the following subsections substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a) Where a member of the Garda Síochána finds a person in a place to which subsection (1) relates and suspects, with reasonable cause, that such person is or has been acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of that subsection, then the member may direct the person so suspected to do either or both of the following, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(i)  desist from acting in such a manner, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner.</P>
      <P>(b)  It shall be an offence for any person, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, to fail to comply with a direction given by a member of the Garda Síochána under this section.</P>
      <P>(3)  (a) A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (2) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment <Col N="592" /> for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In our discussions on Report Stage the view was expressed that the definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; was too narrow in the sense that it might not cover, for example, people entering a derelict building in a manner which causes difficulties for nearby residents.  Deputies will recall that we had already substantially amended the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the Bill to meet some of the concerns expressed.  For example, Deputy Mitchell was concerned that the original definition might not be sufficient to cover public parks while closed and the amendment we made dealt with that and other areas, such as cemeteries.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I undertook to look again at the definition while the Bill was before the Seanad.  We have had lengthy discussions with the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office about this but we kept coming up against the difficulty that essentially any attempt to widen further the definition would carry with it the danger that virtually everywhere would become a public place.  In the circumstances I directed that alternative approaches should be examined and it is in that context that I brought forward an amendment to section 13 in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As a practical matter the type of difficulty with derelict buildings, referred to at earlier Stages of the debate, should be met to a considerable extent by section 13 and the amendment I am now proposing to that section.  Under section 13 it will be an offence for a person to trespass on any building or its surroundings in such a manner that causes or is likely to cause fear in others.  The effect of amendment No. 3 will be to give the gardaí similar powers to those available in section 8 where they suspect a person is behaving contrary to section 13.  In other words, where a gang of youths congregate in a derelict building in a manner which causes fear in local residents, the gardaí would have the power to direct the gang to leave.  It would be an offence to fail to comply with such a direction <Col N="593" /> and the gardaí in those circumstances would have a power of arrest without warrant.  In many cases this would be a very practical approach to this type of problem and I hope the amendment is acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment improves the Bill.  The Minister will recall that on Committee and Report Stages I raised the question of loitering with intent to steal vehicles.  Leaving aside the rather light-hearted way in which I have outlined my own misfortune, which is only one of a series of misfortunes I have experienced, one of the big problems in the city is interference with other people's property.  Considerable fear is instilled in people by criminals who gather on derelict sites.  There is much observing and watching in a way that interferes with people's property.  For example, in my constituency a lady in her eighties who lives on her own experiences great problems because outside her house is a Telecom Éireann box which is the assembly spot for characters in the area who sit there until all hours of the night playing loud music.  On occasion it is the review stand for stolen cars which pass at all hours of the day and night. People should be respected and allowed to have a peaceful night's sleep.  Telecom Éireann has not been particularly helpful in this matter, although having sent a letter to the chief executive some movement was made on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda should be empowered to deal with people who interfere with other people's rights.  People such as the lady I referred to are prisoners in their own homes.  The legislation does not go far enough to deal with people who are loitering with intent to steal or interfere with vehicles &mdash; I raised this matter by way of amendment on Committee Stage. Some stolen vehicles are stored, sprayed and used in more serious crimes such as kidnapping or bank robberies.  People are living behind shutters and alarms. People's property should be respected. The legislation does not go far enough to deal with vandalism, particularly of <Col N="594" /> property such as cars.  However, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment.  I am glad the Minister did not extend the provision in section 30 to cover vehicles &mdash; already covered under the legislation.  The Bill extends the provision in regard to trespass on buildings to trespass on vehicles and the vicinity of vehicles.  I am glad we are introducing the word &ldquo;desist&rdquo; from acting in such a manner.  I would like to see that as a first step.  The second optional step would be that the person would leave the vicinity and the third step would be to arrest and fine the person.  It is too late to do anything about the options at this point.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides for an additional penalty.  In this case the penalty for the offence is clearly stated whereas the previous amendment would create considerable confusion as there would be an overlap of penalties.</P>

      <P>Since we discussed this matter on Committee Stage I and my officials have had a long and intensive range of discussions with the draftsman, with IBEC and ICTU to try to find wording which would embrace people's legitimate concerns.

Rather than have a beneficial effect it would have the reverse effect, leading to endless need for further clarification, explanation and elucidation.

The purpose of the legislation is to provide protection for employees and ensure that the conditions in regard to the working hours of a vulnerable section of employees are set out clearly.  In such cases the benefit of the doubt should be given to the employees.  In trying to establish what is reasonable, there is inevitably always a degree of doubt about the employment contract but there are plenty of mechanisms to deal with this issue.

      <P>&ldquo;(n) any terms or conditions relating to disciplinary procedures pursued by the employer,</P>
      <P>(o) any terms or conditions in relation to redundancy situations pursued by the employer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage the Minister said it would be better to deal with these issues in the legislation dealing with unfair dismissals and the Bill reforming the redundancy legislation.  We did not have a very satisfactory debate on Committee Stage on the nature of the proposed changes in this area.  I made the point that if we include in legislation provisions which will reduce stress and the level of misunderstanding in the workplace it might also be useful to include provisions relating to the disciplinary procedures which might be pursued by the employer.  I did not have in mind disciplinary procedures which involve dismissal; I was proposing that the procedures on early warnings about unsatisfactory performances by employees, the way in which such warnings are given, etc. should be spelt out in the terms of employment so that all sides know the procedures to be used in cases involving disciplinary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thought this matter could be dealt with more satisfactorily under the unfair dismissals legislation. However, having examined it I do not see any codes of practice on disciplinary action, although if an employee is ultimately dismissed the tribunal will look at the procedures taken, ensure written warnings were given, etc.  Will the Minister <Col N="597" /> agree that it would be an improvement if everyone knew at the outset the disciplinary procedures within a company?</P>
    <P>Paragraph (o) of my amendment relates to redundancies where, occasionally, disputes arise due to the procedures followed.  On reflection, I am willing to accept the Minister's argument that it would be very difficult to, <i>ex ante</i>, set out these procedures in the terms of employment and, therefore, I will not press paragraph (o) of the amendment. Nevertheless, the disciplinary procedures should be set out in the terms of employment handed to employees at the start of their employment or, as proposed in the Bill, in certain subsequent circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have considered this matter further and have come back to my argument at the beginning of the debate, that this legislation will implement a directive in a simple manner and will give precise information.  The precise type of information in the directive, agreed at Council of Ministers meetings, subsequently agreed with IBEC and ICTU and debated on Committee Stage can be provided for in simple legislation.  I undertook on Committee Stage to ensure that the legislation was as simple, open and easily understood as possible.  While it would seem admirable to inform employees about the disciplinary procedures of a company in the context of this directive, the inclusion of such a provision in this legislation would merely add to what should be a simple procedure.  I have considered the matter further but cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>During Committee Stage debate on this amendment Deputy Bruton queried the grounds for capping an award if an employee had shown that he or she had suffered financial loss in excess of the award.  Deputy Rabbitte argued also that circumstances could arise where failure to provide a statement of employment particulars, or failure to provide notification of changes in particulars could result in a significant financial loss for the employee and that compensation of four weeks pay would not be sufficient to make good the loss in some instances.  I agreed to consider the matter further.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I stated that it is the normal practice to place a ceiling on the level of compensation which may be awarded under protective labour legislation by the rights commissioner or by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  To allow the rights commissioner or the tribunal to award unlimited amounts of compensation could be open to challenge on the basis that it would be unconstitutional. The question to be addressed, therefore, is what is the appropriate ceiling for the purposes of the Terms of Employment (Information) Bill which we are now debating?  Two issues are particuarly relevant in this regard.  First, what financial loss, if any, would be likely to be suffered by an employee and, second, what level of compensation would be consistent with other labour legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People might say this is a minor Bill but we have had a great deal of discussion within the Department and, in regard to the earlier amendment, with the draftsman's office and the Attorney General. The Department has difficulty in identifying any situation in which an employee would suffer significant financial loss.  Deputy Rabbitte argued that an employee could lose out if his or her job was wrongly described or because they did not have a job description.  The employer could oblige them to do other work or could move them within the employment.  In response to Deputy Rabbitte's argument, it could be pointed out that the Bill does not require that <Col N="600" /> a job description be provided, only the nature and title of the job.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances described by Deputy Rabbitte, it is difficult to see how a failure to provide information would result in a reduction in pay.  The purpose of the Bill is to give information in a simple form.  It gives legislative underpinning to any changes that would arise if employment was outside the State.  We discussed the Payment of Wages Bill on Committee Stage and how it provided for circumstances such as those referred to by Deputy Rabbitte.  It is open to an individual to refer a complaint to the rights commissioner who may uphold the complaint.  The unfair dismissals legislation also places a ceiling on the amount of compensation which may be awarded; the Payment of Wages Bill has a similar provision.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the primary remedy is that one gets a statement of one's right as a citizen and as an employee of a firm. The first right conferred in the Bill, and it is a proper one, is that a person is entitled to this information.  Compensation would be regarded as an additional remedy and for that reason we have provided for a ceiling of four weeks. From what I understand, Deputy Bruton's amendment was that there would be no ceiling.</P>

      <P>If there was a need in the future we would bring in regulations. As the Bill comes into force and is utilised &mdash; which I hope it will be because proper utilisation of any such legislation means that both employer and employee have a more harmonious relationship &mdash; and if it is proven that there is a need in this regard, the Minister of the day could, by regulation, raise the amount of compensation. That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that it was difficult to think of circumstances where the damage would be substantial.  The only misgiving I would have about this amendment is that it <Col N="601" /> seems the Minister is giving herself power to shut the door after the horse has bolted in that it is only if a case of manifest injustice emerges she would subsequently table regulations before the House to deal with the matter in that way.  She would not, of course, be able to deal with the specific case of injustice that had given rise to the need for regulations.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstand the position, but since the Minister is not proposing to alter the four week rule &mdash; she is proposing to leave that intact &mdash; she is only giving herself an escape clause if things go wrong for some poor individual but that individual's problem will not be addressed.  If the Minister accepts some validity in the argument &mdash; there is some validity in it and we should create legislation that can accommodate the unforeseen &mdash; she should go the whole way on this issue or tell us now the nature of the regulations she will put in place at this stage.  We will then know that when we pass this Bill we will be also passing a certain regulation that will accommodate the hardship case we might not yet have foreseen.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Before any order or regulation is made under this Act, the Minister shall publish a statement outlining the likely costs to both an employer and an employee of complying with any requirements specified by the regulation, and the Minister shall cause to have this statement laid before the Oireachtas at the same time as the order is laid.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment should be part of any legislation we pass in this House.  We should be conscious of the possible costs to an employer and to an employee of exercising their rights under this Bill. There was much discussion on Committee Stage about the way in which labour law, which was expected to be simple, had escalated.  Employers were represented by counsel and it had become quite difficult for employees to exercise their rights in this whole area. We should, therefore, make some effort when passing legislation to predict the future and decide whether the legislation will create significant cost factors for employers that might be a burden on the task of creating employment.  The Minister has argued that this Bill is not likely to impose significant costs but we should be looking ahead also at whether the mechanism for redress may impose burdens on those who seek to exercise their right of redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general principle we should accept an amendment of this nature and build it into legislation so that when we make decisions about labour law, health and <Col N="603" /> safety regulations and so on, we commit ourselves also to some sort of auditive cost.  It is becoming fashionable to talk about equality proofing and environmental or green proofing of legislation but in a country like this, where the biggest single issues are the cost of creating employment and the lack of employment, we should be conscious of the need to employment-proof legislation.  We should look ahead at any action we take to examine the possibility of hidden pitfalls in what is clearly desirable legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this amendment would be more relevant to other Bills where it would be more obvious that there would be cost burdens involved.  However, there is a reasonable case to be made that the existing legislation, apart from the exclusion of casual workers, has not proven to be defective in any way.  We are discussing a new Bill that is not all that different from what had obtained heretofore.  There is an onus on the Government to show the public that what it is doing in this Bill will not have hidden costs for employers in recruiting people or for employees seeking to exercise their rights.  This is not an unreasonable type of amendment.  Indeed, it would have merit if the Government took on board that type of approach to its legislation in general.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a special competitiveness and costs committee under the Minister's Department which did nothing but review different types of costs, insurance and so on involved in creating employment.  That committee had been producing valuable work, indicating cost burdens and obstacles to employment.  The principle involved in the establishment of that type of committee &mdash; to vet activity &mdash; would equally apply to legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister accept this amendment, regarding it as a precedent for use in the case of other Bills whose provisions might be even more far-reaching in their cost implications for either side of industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, most employers and employees have a decent relationship.  They have a consensual approach to such matters, which is refreshing and in many cases has led to the type of economic growth we have experienced.  The provisions of this Bill will simply provide a citizen with information about his or her employment; it is not a convoluted statement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment calls on the Minister to publish a statement outlining the likely costs to both an employer and an employee of complying with any requirements specified by the regulation.  As I have said, it is a simple sheet of paper on which is listed the name and address of each, the job description and some other small details.  There is not available to us an itemised costing of that.  Rather, I would regard it as being an everyday relationship between an employer and employee in the same way as he or she would complete any other form in the daily business of hiring an employee and of maintaining employment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Bruton has tabled his amendment in a straightforward fashion.  The idea of some employers that it is burdensome when they have to comply with legislative provisions is not justified.  What makes for proper relationships between employers and employees is mutual trust.  This leads to a sense of stability and motivation on the basis that each understands the other and that the terms of employment are clearly stipulated.  This is what the provision of this Bill are all about.  In my view, there is not a cost implied; it is part and parcel of the daily running of a business, hiring employees and establishing business relationships.  Therefore, I would not advocate costing something that does not have an inherent cost but rather comprises part of the daily interaction in business.  There will be no need to update these provisions unless some changes take place which must be conveyed to employees, since this will not be a weekly, monthly or three monthly occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we had a wider <Col N="605" /> debate about how the Employment Appeals Tribunal has enlarged itself and on occasion would appear to have become rather burdensome.  That is an issue for another day.  It would be our hope that if there are transgressions of the provisions of this Bill, the rights commissioner would be able to deal with them himself in a simple manner.  Though we have allowed for a further appeals procedure, it would be our wish that not many cases would arise and that if they did, they would not have to go beyond the remit of the rights commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see some merit in Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment because a great deal is made from time to time about the imposition and costs associated with various pieces of labour legislation.  We had some discussion on Committee Stage about the recent tendency for the Employment Appeals Tribunal to become the preserve of lawyers in circumstances in which such is not necessary.  In this part of Ireland anyway the convention has always been to rely on the collective mechanisms that have obtained between the large employer organisations and trade unions and to keep the intrusion of lawyers to a minimum. Certainly, that has not happened in recent times, especially before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton is advancing that further here in terms of making explicit what the cost would be. Obviously, the Minister of State is right that the provisions of this Bill will not impose any additional cost worth talking about.  Nonetheless, Deputy Richard Bruton's point is an interesting one.  I do not know whether the time has come for us to codify some of the existing labour legislation.  It is now quite diverse, following on a number of instruments that have emanated from Europe and so on. It is quite a complex area.  It might be helpful to employers and unions if some progress were made towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the weaker for the decision the Minister has taken not to accept my amendment No. 1.  I predict there will be much joy in the Employers' Federation <Col N="606" /> and great heartache amongst the trade unions that, contrary to what they were led to believe, the matter has been rejected out of hand.  The most vulnerable section of workers requiring the protection of this Bill will not have such protection as a result of the exclusion of that amendment.  I altered the amendment to meet what I thought was the spirit of our discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State did, but the important thing at the end of the day is that she refused it. This concerned an important section of vulnerable workers who sought no more than to be advised in advance, where practicable, of the hours during which they would be required the following day. Having regard to the exploitation that takes place in some of the distributive trades in particular, I would seek the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; to an extent that is completely unjustified, since I have come into the House late &mdash; to plead with the Minister of State to reconsider that.  I think the trade unions really thought they had won the Minister of State over on this argument. I predict they will be very disappointed, because the manner in which the amendment is worded would not impose any unreasonable pressure on an employer.  It admits of the needs for flexibility.  It merely requires that, where it is practicable to do so, employees be given notice the previous week of when they will be required, for how long, that kind of thing.  It is a minimum amendment in every sense of the word.  I am sorry the Minister could not find her way to accept it.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for having been extremely indulgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a lot of false talk about the burdens of legislation which, when one really scrutinises them, are not that burdensome at all; it is just good common <Col N="607" /> sense.  On the other hand, the Minister and her Department have absolutely nothing to fear from setting out the facts fairly for all the public to see.  The more we inform the public about labour law and costs the better.  We should not allow outlandish claims to be made about certain legislation being a burden if such claims do not stand up to scrutiny.  My amendment seeks that the Government set out a statement of the likely costs involved, to which people could refer when such claims are made.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the way the tribunal operates is a matter for another time but that is not true.  In section 8 (a) and (f) the Minister has power to determine representation at and costs of the tribunal.  Specific matters are set out in the regulations.  She has power to determine, within the confines of this Bill, what shall be representation at an employment appeals tribunal, and, if she saw fit, insist that there would be no legal representation but that the matter is dealt with in an informal way.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt adequately with the spirit of what I am trying to put forward.  I am sure this kind of amendment will become a feature of legislation for the future.  Everyone would benefit as a result and we would have a more reasoned debate about the real or perceived burdens of such legislation.</P>

      <P>I will answer some of the points raised, particularly in view of the Chair's most generous indulgence of Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; I hope at some stage I will be the recipient of such indulgence &mdash; which allowed him to rework his amendment with great gusto.  What he said was very important and he had great enthusiasm for his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As both ICTU and IBEC know, we spent considerable time trying to get an <Col N="608" /> acceptable form of words.  We had three formulas of words, including the Deputy's, which had the &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; clause.  This was also favoured by ICTU but legal advice was that it would be open to different interpretations. Legislation, by its very nature, seeks to be as precise as possible. The Deputy then spoke about the concern there would be on the trade union side.  They put forward their amendment with great sincerity.  I took the opportunity today at the launch of MAN-DATE, the joint trade union of IDATU and INUVGATA, to say we will review the Shops Acts, 1938 and 1942.  I support the cause of many workers on the fringes of proper working arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Department is consulting all parties in relation to the working time directive and that, with the review of the Acts, will lead to a wider debate on legislation on the working time directive.  There will be two opportunities in which to discuss the issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also raised the question of consolidating and codifying the legislation.  We will examine the matter and see if we can consolidate legislation in relation to conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>I thank the party spokespersons for their observations on the Bill.  We were able to bring in amendments to deal with some of the points made and the Bill will now go to the Seanad.  I thank the Chair and the officials who dealt patiently with everyone.</P>

The fact that there should be consultation before certain categories would be excluded is welcome.  The removal of the open-ended powers of the Rights Commissioner was a sensible change.  Although she did not go all the way in her amendment today, she acknowledges that there may be cases where a ceiling on compensation could be unjust and she is taking power to deal with that.</P>

      <Col N="609" /> We have had satisfactory Committee and Report Stages and I hope we have put in place legislation which will be of mutual benefit to both sides of industry.

      <P>I commend the Minister for the manner in which she conducted the Bill.  The only reservation I had, which I expressed strongly on Committee Stage, was that the additional form-filling would add to what is in reality a binge of form-filling which some small employers are required to comply with.  I am satisfied that that will not happen following the passing of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister at all times insisted that the provisions of this Bill be kept clear, simple and straightforward and that we should not seek to harness them to meet other needs or demands which were expressed forcibly on Committee Stage.  There is widespread exploitation of workers in certain sectors of the building trade, the services trade &mdash; for example in hairdressing &mdash; and in the distributive trades.  These issues have to be confronted in a different context.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte called for condification of existing labour law.  While I am not sufficiently experienced to speak on what is a new area for me, there is no doubt that existing law is not strong enough to meet conditions in the work force.  Some workers have little protection under the law.  That issue has to be addressed and I hope that will be done sooner rather than later.  I suggest a strong case can be made for the codification, upgrading and updating of labour laws in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the hallmarks of a modern and caring society is one which recognises needs and is prepared to do something about them.  In the context of marital breakdown it means a society with strong support services whether State or voluntary and it means a system of laws which protects spouses and children and which enables justice to be done, where necessary.  The Government is committed to a society which cares and a system of laws and administrative measures which deals comprehensively with the issues of marriage breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is part of a series of family law measures provided for in the Government's partnership programme for which I have responsibility as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  In terms of <Col N="611" /> its size and scope it is one of the biggest and most extensive family law measures to come before the House.  It substantially modernises and develops the courts' powers to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown, extends those powers to cases of nullity and foreign divorces, creates new remedies and jurisdictions and makes the law more accessible.  In effect, the Bill extends powers to the courts for the support of spouses and dependent children where marriages break down in every circumstance short of domestic divorce. It provides substantial new powers in relation to pensions and strengthens the law on maintenance.  With a view to safe-guarding and protecting the institution of marriage, the age of marriage is being increased and there is provision for notice of marriage.  With a view to having clear and simple procedures in the law to enable persons to establish the validity of their marriage in the event of foreign decrees of divorce, separation or nullity being granted the Bill provides for updating of the law in this area.  As the Bill contains, in effect, model provisions for any future divorce legislation its importance stretches far beyond the framework in which it is currently set.</P>
    <P>The key features of the extended powers of the courts to make ancillary orders in support of dependent spouses provided for in the Bill are that they will extend for the first time to parties of any marriage that is annulled after the commencement of the Bill and to any spouse whose foreign decree of divorce, separation or nullity is granted after commencement of the Bill's provisions and is entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains important new provisions in relation to jurisdiction of the courts.  Jurisdiction in proceedings for a decree of nullity of marriage, at present confined to the High Court, is being given also to the Circuit Court.  The purpose is to bring that jurisdiction into line with the jurisdiction for separation proceedings, to improve access to the courts and to reduce costs.  The Circuit Court is being empowered also to make the <Col N="612" /> ancillary orders in support of spouses where foreign decrees of divorce, separation or nullity are entitled to recognition in the State and to make any declarations in relation to the status of a person's marriage.  The District and Circuit Courts will have jurisdiction to order maintenance by way of lump sums and secured payments.  That jurisdiction is at present confined to the Circuit Court in separation proceedings only.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a comprehensive framework within which extensive remedies can be secured through the courts by spouses and children who face the consequences of marriage breakdown. The Bill, in effect, gives statutory recognition to the fact that, on breakdown of marriage, there is an obligation on a spouse to maintain and accommodate the other spouse and children to the fullest extent possible, where this is necessary, and that in the absence of agreement on those matters the courts should be in a position to intervene on the basis of a comprehensive range of powers to order maintenance, lumps sums, secured payments and a redistribution of property generally including the family home and pensions.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward the Bill I am indebted to a wealth of sources, not least the White Paper on Marital Breakdown. The Bill draws on the provisions of the Family Law (No. 1) Bill contained in that paper.  It also takes into account the recommendations contained in the &ldquo;The Law of Nullity in Ireland&rdquo; published by the Office of the Attorney General in 1976.  I should also like to mention the following reports of the Law Reform Commission on which the Bill is based: the report on The Age of Majority, Age for Marriage and some connected subjects; the report on Jurisdiction in Proceedings for Nullity of Marriage, Recognition of Foreign Nullity Decrees and the Hague Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages.  The list of reports would not be complete without mentioning also that account has been taken of the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown, the Combat Poverty <Col N="613" /> Agency in their report on the financial consequences of marriage breakdown, and the work of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The recent Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill, to the effect that the Bill was unconstitutional, resulted in considerable publicity and a great deal of contradictory opinion as to its impact on the referendum on divorce planned for later this year.  The Supreme Court judgment struck down what was in effect the central principle of the Bill, namely the establishment of joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the norm within marriage.  In the light of that judgment, the Government has already announced that there is no alternative legislative route which can safely be taken to achieve a broadly similar result.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Bill was an attempt to copperfasten the principle of equality in marriage and was aimed at stable marriages. It was not framed to deal specifically with instances of marriage breakdown, be they separation, nullity or, for that matter, divorce, in the event of divorce being introduced following a referendum.  If couples obtain a judicial separation, the question of the division of property is one for the courts to decide in accordance with the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The Matrimonial Home Bill provisions would not have affected that position in separation proceedings any more than it would in any divorce proceedings, nor would it affect this Bill which deals with all property, including the family home, and allows the court to deal with questions of the transfer of ownership and occupancy of the family home.  As with the property adjustment remedies in separation proceedings, the courts will operate the provisions in the Bill in the interest of justice being achieved for all parties concerned and among the particular criteria which the court will take into account in making property orders in support of a spouse will be the contribution which each has made or will make by looking after the home or caring for the family.  Again, that criterion <Col N="614" /> among others, is already a feature of our separation laws.</P>
    <P>The major thrust of the Bill is the courts power to make financial, property and ancillary orders on the grant of a decree of nullity.  It may surprise some people that, following the granting of a decree of nullity of marriage the courts have no power at present to order maintenance in support of a former spouse or to order a redistribution of property between both former spouses.  That is not the position in other countries, including the UK, where a wide range of powers to make ancillary orders is available to the courts.</P>
    <P>The courts here can order maintenance in support of children of an annulled marriage but they have no powers to order that property be transferred in suitable cases to such children.  Some may argue that since, on nullity, the parties are no longer spouses there should no longer be obligations one to another.  The Government is not of that view.  The 1976 report of the Attorney General pointed out that on the grant of a decree of nullity the consequences for the parties to the marriage and children of the marriage may be far-reaching.  It stated that it was clearly desirable that the hardships which may result from a decree of nullity should be minimised as far as possible and recommended that power be given to the court to enable it to give a wide range of financial relief to the parties of the marriage and to the children of the marriage, in order to do justice between the parties and their children.  The White Paper on Marriage Breakdown reached a similar conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in view of its size it would not be practicable for me to go through all the Bill in detail at this stage.  This is something we will do on Committee Stage.  I propose, therefore, to concentrate on the main provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I contains provisions dealing with short title, commencement and interpretations. Some of those definitions, for example of &ldquo;family home&rdquo;, &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; and &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; are standard provisions in other family law <Col N="615" /> legislation.  Deputies may wish to note that the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in the Bill includes persons whose marriage is annulled even though, legally speaking, they were never spouses.  The definition is used in that way for drafting reasons only.</P>
    <P>Part II, sections 5 to 23, is concerned with the financial, property and other ancillary orders which the court is empowered to make in or after proceedings for nullity or judicial separation. It enables the courts to make, for the first time, financial provision orders following the granting of a decree of nullity.  Part II also re-enacts the substance of Part II of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 which is being repealed by section 3 concerning the powers of court to order financial support in the context of judicial separation.  The purpose is to consolidate those ancillary provisions with the new ancillary provisions in relation to nullity proceedings.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 5 deal with preliminary orders that may be dealt with by the court in proceedings for nullity or separation and allow the court, before deciding on an application for a decree of nullity or judicial separation, to make a barring order, protection order, or a custody order, and orders for protection of the family home and contents.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 are, in one form or another, concerned with the question of the maintenance of a spouse and dependent children.  Section 6 allows the court to make interim maintenance or award lump sums pending the determination of an application for decree of nullity or judicial separation.  Provision for interim lump sum payments is new and is intended to cover situations where there may be hardshp or where immediate bills have to be paid by a spouse.  Section 7 provides for the making of orders for periodical payments, secured periodical payments and lump sums for the support of a spouse or dependent children.  The lump sums may be ordered to be paid by instalments and to be secured.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 7 (6) is new. It gives important new powers to the <Col N="616" /> courts to order attachment of earnings at the same time as maintenance is ordered to be paid.  Before deciding to make or refusing to make such an attachment of earnings order the spouse who is to make the payments must be given an opportunity to make representations in relation to the matter.  Under section 43 I am extending those provisions to cases where maintenance is ordered to be paid in proceedings which do not involve nullity or separation, that is, proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  There are good and valid reasons for strengthening the law in this area.  The Combat Poverty Agency in its report on the financial consequences of marriage breakdown highlighted the extent to which maintenance debtors default on payments ordered by the courts.  While there are cases where the debtor may, due to a change in circumstances, be unable to pay &mdash; and this is allowed for in legislation already by permitting variations of maintenance &mdash; there are many other cases where the debtor simply refuses to pay and this results in the dependent spouse having to pursue separate proceedings in the courts for enforcement of the maintenance.  The agency found that where enforcement was ordered by way of attachment of earnings it doubled the chances of payment. Those facts cannot be ignored and Deputies will agree that the provisions I have made in section 7 (6) and in section 43 are warranted and overdue.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 allow the courts to redistribute property as between spouses for the benefit of a spouse and any dependent children.  In substance, they repeat the provisions contained in the 1989 Act. Section 8 provides that the court may make an order for the transfer of property from one spouse to the other or to any dependent child, an order for the settlement of property, an order to vary for the benefit of the other spouse and/ or a dependent child any antenuptial or postnuptial settlement made on the spouses, or an order extinguishing or reducing the interest of either of the spouses under a settlement of property. <Col N="617" /> Section 9 deals with a number of orders which may be made in relation to the family home.  These may include orders in relation to the right of one spouse to occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse, an order for the sale of the family home and for disposal of the proceeds of sale, and orders under existing statutes, including the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the court on granting a decree of nullity, or at any time thereafter, to make an order for the assignment, in whole or in part, of a spouse's interest in a life assurance policy in favour of the other spouse or dependent child of the family or an order requiring a spouse to take out a life assurance policy in favour of the other spouse or dependent children.  These orders are designed to supplement or substitute for, where necessary, other orders in support of a spouse and dependent children. However, they may also be awarded to &ldquo;compensate&rdquo; for any loss of benefit such as may arise on succession or, for that matter, a pension to which the person might, but for the nullity decree, be otherwise entitled.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal specifically with the question of pensions.  While in cases of nullity, the loss of a prospective occupational pension may in some cases be met by making a property adjustment order, or by a lump sum order, or by a financial compensation order under section 10, adequate relief under those provisions may not be possible.</P>
    <P>Section 11 will, therefore, allow the court, in appropriate cases, to make one of two types of pensions orders.  The first type may be described as a &ldquo;pensions split&rdquo; order where the member spouse's interest in his or her scheme is reduced by order of the court and that amount is used to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit for the dependent spouse.  The second mechanism which may be described as &ldquo;ear-marking&rdquo; is one that retains the dependent spouse's interest in the member spouse's scheme (including the survivors' part) with the proportion of benefit to be paid to the non-member <Col N="618" /> spouse being determined by the court.  In devising these new powers I had regard to consultations with pension experts, including the Pensions Board, and I have taken into account a wide range of reviews which have been carried out internationally.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 11 that notice of any application in relation to a pensions adjustment order must be given by the applicant spouse to the trustees of the pension scheme and, under the section, the court in making a pensions adjustment order must have regard to any representations made by the trustees. In making a pensions adjustment order the court will give the pension trustees such directions as it considers appropriate in relation to the order.</P>
    <P>While section 12 also deals with pensions, its scope is confined to pensions in the context of separation.  The section contains a useful provision enabling the court to order the trustees of a pension scheme not to regard the separation of the spouses as a ground for disqualifying a spouse from benefiting under the scheme on the death of the other spouse. This is intended to remove a difficulty in situations where the rules of a pension scheme may provide that survivors' benefit will only be paid to the spouse of the deceased member if both spouses are residing together at the time of the member spouse's death.  Again, notice of an application under this section must be given to the trustees of the pension scheme and the court is required to have regard to any representations made by them.</P>
    <P>Section 13 repeats in substance provisions in the 1989 Act empowering the courts in suitable cases to extinguish rights of succession of the spouses following a separation decree.  A decree of judicial separation will not end succession rights but the court is empowered in certain circumstances to do so.</P>
    <P>The position is different in the context of nullity.  As pointed out in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, following nullity, succession rights must end because the parties are no longer spouses.  Two ways around possible hardship <Col N="619" /> involved in loss of succession rights suggested in the White Paper are now provided for in the Bill.  The effect of section 16 (2) (k) is that loss of succession rights will be one of the matters to be taken into account when the court is making financial provision for the dependent party; and the effect of section 14 is that where the court finds that it cannot make adequate provision for the dependent party &mdash; in a case where it would otherwise have done so &mdash; it may allow that spouse to apply for provision out of the other spouse's estate.  The Bill goes even further by providing in section 10 for financial compensation orders.</P>
    <P>The section 14 provision will operate as follows.  Where a decree of nullity is in force and one of the parties to the decree dies the other party, if he or she has not remarried, may apply to the court for financial provision to be made for him or her out of the deceased spouse's estate.  In considering whether to make an order under this section the court must have regard to any lump sum payments or property adjustment order made in favour of the applicant, or any device or bequest made by the deceased spouse to the applicant spouse.  The provision which the court can make under this section, with any lump sum payments already made or property adjustment order, must not exceed in total the share &mdash; if any &mdash; of the applicant in the estate of the deceased spouse under the Succession Act, 1965, to which the applicant was entitled or would have been entitled if the marriage was valid.</P>
    <P>Section 15 empowers the court to order the sale of property and repeats provisions in the 1989 Act.  It provides that where a court makes a secured periodical payments order, a lump sum order or a property adjustment order, it may, additionally, at any time thereafter make a further order for the sale of any property in which either spouse has a beneficial interest.  The order for sale may include provisions in relation to the manner and time of sale and disposal of the proceeds of sale.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to the criteria contained <Col N="620" /> in section 16 for the making of court orders under Part II in support of spouses and dependent children.  In view of the importance of that section I now propose to deal with it in more detail. Subsection (1) sets down a general criteria. The court, in deciding whether to make financial and property orders must endeavour to ensure that such financial provision is made for the spouse and children as is adequate and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Subsection (2) sets out more specific criteria in relation to such matters as spouses' income, earning capacity, property and financial resources, likely future obligations, age and conduct of the spouses and accommodation needs. The court must take into account any contribution by either spouse to the financial and other resources of the other spouse and any contribution made by either of them by looking after the home or caring for the family.  Subsection (3) sets out specific criteria in relation to children which take into account financial and accommodation needs, and other matters.  Conduct of the spouses may also be relevant to the question of the making of financial orders in support of a spouse &mdash; desertion, for example, will be a bar unless the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust not to make such orders.</P>
    <P>These criteria in section 16 are the same as those in the 1989 Act except that under section (2) (b) the court must, in nullity cases, take into account responsibilities which a debtor spouse may have in a subsequent marriage and the court must also, in cases of nullity, under paragraph (k), have regard to the value of any benefit &mdash; pension or otherwise &mdash; which by reason of the annulment of a marriage, the spouse will lose the opportunity or possibility of acquiring.</P>
    <P>The remaining section of importance in Part II is section 18 which empowers the court, on the application of either spouse, to vary or discharge previous orders under Part II taking into account any change in circumstances.  Variation orders are also subject to the criteria set out in section 16.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is new and empowers <Col N="621" /> the court to order relief under Part II following the granting of a decree of divorce, annulment or separation in another state which is entitled to recognition in the State.  At present, where a foreign decree of nullity or divorce is entitled to recognition in the State the courts have no power to order financial or other relief for a dependent spouse.  Part III takes into account the Law Reform Commission's report entitled &ldquo;Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations&rdquo; which recommended that in cases where a divorce is recognised in the State the court should have a discretionary power, acting on the principles of domestic legislation, to protect the rights of a spouse with respect to such matters as maintenance and occupation and ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the proposals in Part III deserves particular comment.  The Court of Justice of the European Communities, in interpreting the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters or, as it is commonly called, the Judgments Convention &mdash; which has been in force in Ireland since June 1988 &mdash; ruled that a maintenance order granted in one state, on the basis of the obligation, arising out of marriage, of one spouse to maintain the other, is irreconcilable with a decree divorcing the spouses granted in the State where enforcement of the maintenance order is sought.  This means, for example, if a wife had a maintenance order granted against her husband by an Irish court and her husband subsequently obtained a divorce in England, an English court would not then be in a position to enforce the maintenance order because it will now be irreconcilable with the fact that a divorce has been obtained there.</P>
    <P>This decision is binding on all contracting states and has been followed by the UK High Court in a decision involving an Irish maintenance order sent to the UK for enforcement.  In such circumstances the only avenue at present open to an Irish person seeking maintenance is to apply to the English court, in the divorce proceedings, to make financial <Col N="622" /> provision for him or her at the time of granting the divorce decree or at any time thereafter.</P>
    <P>It will now be possible under the proposed provisions in Part III of the Bill for the maintenance creditor, where the divorce is recognised here, to seek the leave of the Irish courts to apply to our courts for financial provision to be made in his or her favour.  A maintenance order granted in such circumstances by an Irish court, since it would be granted following a divorce which is recognised here, would no longer be &ldquo;a maintenance order granted on the basis of the obligation, arising out of marriage of one spouse to maintain the other&rdquo; and should, therefore, be capable of being enforced throughout the EC as it would no longer be irreconcilable with the decree of divorce.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with declarations as to marital status and the purpose is to restate the law which enables a person to apply to the court for a declaration as to the validity of his or her marriage.  The proposed provisions implement, with certain changes, recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report entitled &ldquo;Restitution of Conjugal Rights, Jactitation of Marriage and Related Matters.&rdquo; The commission was of the view that the present law would benefit from restatement in clear terms in modern legislation.  At present, the power to give such declarations of status is confined to the High Court and its statutory basis comes from an Act of 1868.  The Bill gives the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with the provisions in Part III.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, the question of the marital status of a person, particularly one who has been married or divorced abroad, may be raised &mdash; for example, to determine whether he or she is free to marry here or can claim a pension or other benefit as the spouse or widow or widower of another.  Part III enables the court to make a declaratory order regarding marital status in these and other cases.  These provisions will be welcomed by, among others, the Registrar of Marriages who can now refer persons with <Col N="623" /> queries about their marital status to the straightforward procedures in Part III.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, there is no power, under Part III, to apply for a declaration, say, that a marriage was void <i>ab initio:</i> in this case the correct procedure is to petition for a decree of nullity.</P>
    <P>Although a declaration will normally be sought by one of the parties to the marriage, others may be legitimately interested in its validity.  For example, the trustees of a pension fund may wish to establish whether a woman is the widow of a former member of the scheme.  Applications for a declaration may, therefore, be brought by anyone, but the court must refuse to hear a case if it considers that the applicant does not have a sufficient interest in the outcome of the proceedings.  Moreover, the practice where the Attorney General must be joined as a respondent to any application is being continued.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill implements a long outstanding recommendation in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown for an increase in the age of marriage from 16 years to 18 years.  The Law Reform Commission and the Second Commission on the Status of Women also made this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The notice of intention to marry provisions are consistent with the requirement of most churches that notice be given by members proposing to marry. Circumstances may arise where the inflexible application of either or both of the new rules could be unfair.  In recognition of this, I am providing that a person affected in this way can apply to the court for an exemption from one or both of the requirements.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with a number of miscellaneous provisions, the most important of which, in relation to a new power to the courts to order attachment of earnings orders at the same time as the making of maintenance orders, I have already mentioned.  There are also jurisdictions in Part VI and I dealt with the more important of those in my opening comments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> This concludes my summary of the main provisions contained in the Bill and I am confident that it will be found acceptable in principle by all sides of the House.  I assure Deputies that I will consider fully the points which they make today and during later Stages of the debate.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need for strong support services in the context of marriage breakdown and to the fact that the Government is committed to those services. That commitment has been given very clear expression by way of substantial additional funding allocated to my Department for 1994 for counselling services, the Family Mediation Service and the Civil Legal Aid Board.  As the Minister responsible for those areas, I am glad to be able to say that the moneys provided for counselling have been increased by 150 per cent to £750,000; by 142 per cent to £300,000 for the mediation service and by 56 per cent to £5 million for the Legal Aid Board.  I look forward to a period of development and expansion of those services in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, agree that while it is essential to update and modernise our family law provisions and to give the courts full powers to enable justice to be done to parties of broken marriages, it is equally important that where parties can settle the terms of their separation they should be facilitated by way of mediation and that where there is the possibility of reconciliation they should be facilitated by way of counselling.  The extra funding for support services which I have secured for 1994, together with the various legislative measures I am bringing forward, are a measure of the comprehensive approach I am endeavouring to achieve in relation to the issues involved in marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The question of the application of the tax and social welfare codes in the context of marriage breakdown, as well as in the context of this Bill, is being examined by the relevant Department of Finance and Social Welfare.  Decisions in this area will be provided for in Finance and Social Welfare Bills.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome large sections of the Bill which regularises the position on nullity and foreign divorces recognised here.  Every Member of the House will welcome the provisions relating to the allocation of property and other settlements and the proposal to increase the age of marriage which has long been recommended.  The Bill has a number of other welcome features, for example, the concept of interim lump sum payments and attachment of earnings orders in particular cases.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are some problem areas.  Specifically, the requirement to give notice of marriage in advance will cause public concern.  The Minister has not adequately justified such a measure which will be seen as an intrusion into peoples' private affairs. Equally, there is confusion in my mind as to the treatment of pensions in the context of second marriages.</P>

      <P>The measures I mentioned on the last occasion we debated this demonstrate the seriousness of the Government's approach to tackling criminals and are a major assault on the criminal classes who prey upon us.  Those who abide by the law will throw their full weight behind the Garda in its endeavours to fight crime.  I take this opportunity to give credit to the Garda who, through good policing, prevent crime.  In such <Col N="626" /> cases there are no statistics recorded for use afterwards.  I particularly pay tribute to the gardaí of my own area, including Crumlin, Tallaght, Clondalkin and Terenure, on their good work in policing against the odds.  If crime becomes a statistic we lose sight of the human tragedy behind each case.  In the constituency of Dublin South-West there is an increasing use of knives in assaults, a worrying development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's Bill contains a number of flaws.  No matter how good, no set of crime statistics can account for unreported crime.  I do not see how this can be overcome.  Deputy Mitchell's Bill is too ambitious in this regard and perhaps he should introduce one that takes account of such limitations.  The system used for compilation of statistics should be first class and realistic.</P>
      <P>Another drawback is that the Bill could lead to greater bureaucracy and the creation of another body to deal with and analyse crime trends.  The correct course is to ensure that gardaí are on the beat. We will not solve a crime with a bar chart or a diagram.  The most effective way to solve it with a strong police force.  One area where that is the case is the use of community gardaí in Dublin South West and particularly in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Crimewatch&rdquo; series on television is encouraging enormous public involvement in the fight against crime.  This is making major inroads into the activities of criminals.  The programme is attracting enormous interest and is a useful vehicle for demonstrating what information is required and possibly for producing statistics.</P>
      <P>I agree that our police force should have the most modern technology at its disposal in the fight against crime but I do not agree with Deputy Mitchell that a new bureau should be created.  We should instead make better use of existing statistics and improve the present system. I pay tribute to Deputy Mitchell for the work he has done in the area of crime which is well and truly recognised. However, a crime statistics Bill is not the answer to the problem he is genuinely trying to solve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Walsh, for allowing me time to speak on this Bill.  The level of crime has reached alarming proportions.  Therefore I welcome the announcement by the Minister on 16 December about the crime packages he is introducing for this year and the next three or four years.  The 13 initiatives she included in her Estimate for acceptance by us are welcome, any one of them would constitute an initiative in its own right.  The total package which the public has been demanding will cost about £66 million.  All Members of the House should bear in mind at budget time that an initiative like this costs 12 times the amount of money which will be yielded by the property tax.  It must be paid for and the people who own houses, particularly the more wealthy, will reap the greatest benefit.</P>
      <P>My good friend Mr. Gay Byrne, with whom I crossed swords on another matter lately, had a very interesting discussion on his programme this morning.  I compliment him on getting back to reality when he interviewed the Governor of Mountjoy Prison.  If the Minister wanted a PRO for her Department she could not do better than to appoint a man like that who explained the difficulties he faces and the work done in the prison service to try to rehabilitate and educate the wrongdoers of both sexes.  One statistic was that 66 per cent of all prisoners in Mountjoy have drug-related problems.  I was astounded by that statistic, as were most people listening to the programme. It demonstrates the root cause of most of the crime we are enduring.  If I had a comment to make about the 13 initiatives it would be that I see no particular initiative on drug-related crime and drug problems beyond what has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Ministers have responsibility in this area &mdash; the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice &mdash; and much work has been done.  However, such crime is not confined to major cities but is now reaching even the smaller towns and villages in our constituencies.  It is an escalating problem that deserves a great deal of attention and a concerted effort to try to <Col N="628" /> hold the position and possibly reduce it in the future.</P>
    <P>Drug related crime is a major problem in the developed world.  All members of the European Union are affected by it and America suffers from an advanced level of that type of crime which emanates mainly from drug dealing with Third World countries.  The debate this morning on this matter brought home to all of us the seriousness of such crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that there is a serious crime problem in Dublin city and an initiative has been taken in that regard.  The Garda force was strengthened by the establishment of a mobile task force which has proved successful. Criminals in the city are being harassed and pursued by members of that task force with beneficial effects for communities in the city of Dublin.  However, while the city of Dublin may have benefited from that initiative, criminals are mobile people and a number of them now operate in counties bordering Dublin, especially since our road network from the city to neighbouring counties has been improved.  County Wicklow has been badly affected because of the attention given to crime in Dublin city.  I am not proud of the fact that County Wicklow has had the highest number of burglaries and bank and post office raids in the past two years.  It is traumatic for the staffs of banks and post offices when criminals walk in with guns and using violent language demand that the staff lie on the floor.  It is unfair that staff and customers should be subjected to such trauma.  The Minister should consider giving some relief to counties such as Wicklow, from where it is possible for criminals to make quick getaways because of an improved road network.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years there has been a policy to close down Garda stations manned by only one or two gardaí and that trend has not been reversed.  The Minister should consider reversing that policy decision because places such as Carnew, Aughrim, Ashford and Barnadarrig, where Garda man-power has been reduced or stations closed, have been badly affected by crime <Col N="629" /> not only from criminals who visit the constituency but by local problems in the area.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; button on the wall of closed Garda station is not a substitute for one or two gardaí in a small rural area.  Thousands of people visit Wicklow every year in the summer time. On a nice weekend in the summer there can be up to 10,000 people in Brittas Bay.  Such large numbers of people attract criminals to the area who break into cars but there are no local gardaí in that area. Gardaí in patrol cars must come from Wicklow town, Arklow or Bray to pursue such criminals, by which time, in most cases, the criminal has disappeared with whatever he or she robbed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that peripheral counties around the city of Dublin are considered in conjunction with policies for the city.  The figure for violent crime is increasing.  That is particularly worrying for those who live in isolated areas, such as the elderly, who traditionally did not lock their doors when going to the shop.  Those people are now terrified because it is assumed that money is secreted away under the bed or in a drawer.  Vicious criminals are operating in those isolated areas.  I hope the Minister takes into account the statistics for crime in those areas and I plead with her to allocate some of the new recruits which will be taken on in the next few years to the Wexford division, which covers half of County Wicklow, and the Metropolitan division, which covers the Bray area.  I have approached the chief superintendents in both those areas and was informed that there is an embargo on the number of gardaí which can be recruited to those areas.  There has been a small increase in the number recruited to the Bray area, but the Minister should consider reopening the small rural Garda stations which were closed.  The garda on the beat is very capable of reporting on the happenings in his area.  It is regrettable that a policy which has seen the deterioration of surveillance in an area should continue to operate.  I hope the Minister will reverse that decision.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to highlight problems in rural areas.  I welcome <Col N="630" /> the initiatives the Minister proposes to adopt, but I would add a few more which, with relatively small cost, could add to the security of all areas.  I hope the Minister will note my comments. She is one of the most successful Ministers for Justice we have had in recent years and her interest in her portfolio since taking up office has been commended by people both inside and outside this House.  A person who is willing to work will obviously be asked to do more and I am asking her to examine this matter further.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Mitchell on retaining his portfolio and I hope he remains in that position.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Mitchell on presenting this worthwhile Bill to the House.  We have had a long day today dealing with many aspects of the problem of crime and justice.  We dealt earlier with the Extradition Bill and the Public Order Bill and we are now dealing with Deputy Mitchell's Private Members' Bill on crime statistics.  This gives us an opportunity to address the serious problem of crime and justice in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is concern among the public about the rise in the levels of crime and the lack of security they feel in their homes and communities as they go about their normal business.  The public look <Col N="631" /> to this House and the Government to address this problem and provide them with answers to the complex problems associated with crime in modern society which threaten their security.</P>
    <P>It is a basic civil right for a citizen to live in peace in his or her home, to move about without fear and not have to suffer a virtual curfew that many elderly people and women and children experience in their communities.  In my constituency many people live alongside a fine public transport service, the DART service. Repeatedly, I hear complaints from parents who are reluctant to allow their children to use that facility, particularly late in the evening because of fear of molestation or some type of attack.  It is not acceptable that peoples' rights and freedom are being curtailed.</P>
    <P>The task we must address is not just about punishing crime and being vindictive towards criminals, but about protecting the freedom and rights of the citizen to move about and live a normal life.  If talk could guarantee that and produce greater security for the public, better policing and a reduction in crime, crime would have been eliminated a long time ago having regard to all the talk in this House and outside through the medium of radio and television.</P>
    <P>It is time we considered more critically than we have to date our approach to crime and justice.  We are concentrating and spending too much money on the punishment of crime and not enough on its prevention.  I accept that being soft with criminals does not work, but neither does the so-called law and order approach.  If we are serious about ensuring that citizens are safe and secure in their homes, streets and communities, we will have to adopt new policies based on a sensible analysis of crime, its causes and consequences.</P>
    <P>The recent crime package announced by the Minister for Justice provides an additional £66 million for the fight against crime.  The provision of additional resources to tackle crime is welcome. However, we need to critically examine how this extra money is being spent and <Col N="632" /> whether the public is getting the protection it deserves from the approximately £620 million the State now spends in the various forms of the administration of justice, namely, in respect of the Garda, prisons and courts.  Of the extra £66 million being provided to fight crime this year, £25 million will be allocated for the provision of an additional 210 prison places.  It works out that it will cost approximately £120,000 per prison place. As against that, only £100,000 extra will be provided to fund community-based projects to divert young people from crime.  In other words, the Government in its new package on crime will now spend less in communities trying to keep young people out of trouble than it will spend on providing just one extra prison cell.  Surely this approach is nonsensical. It is time we began to question the fundamentals of our spending on crime and justice.</P>
    <P>Crime must be punished and the only way in which the average citizen can be saved from some criminals is to take those criminals out of society and place them in secure detention.  In the interest of rehabilitating offenders we need to make greater use of alternatives to prison, but I cannot as yet envisage a society in which we will not need prisons. However, it is foolish to believe that crime will be solved by building more prisons, spending more on the prison service and attempting to lock away crime. We are now spending almost £110 million per annum on the prison service.  That is roughly the equivalent of the entire budget for the Office of Public Works, or the entire amount spent on environmental protection, or the entire amount spent on the provision of public housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for public housing is present.  We have not seen him in the House since his announcement of the inadequate housing allocations to local authorities, but that is a matter we can deal with on another day.  It may be of some assistance to the Minister in his battle for additional resources to know that it is an absurd society that annually spends as much on locking people away as it does on providing <Col N="633" /> them with basic housing needs.  It is time to ask if taxpayers' money would not be better spent in helping communities to keep young people out of trouble.</P>
    <P>In every community there are public spirited people who give their time and energy freely and enthusiastically to organise sports clubs, youth clubs, community groups, adult education courses and a wide range of voluntary activity aimed at keeping their communities together and, in the process, provide constructive recreation for young people.  It is often the same handful of people who run sports clubs, organise residents' associations and co-ordinate the neighbourhood watch scheme.  They are people who do not need degrees in sociology or criminology to understand that, despite Margaret Thatcher's dictum, there is such a thing as society, individuals do not exist in isolation from each other, community is essential to our quality of life and cannot be bought in the supermarket, and that young hands and minds will stray if not directed to constructive activity.</P>
    <P>Those people and those communities are being denied support from the Government and from official quarters. For example, there is no proper regular funding for community-based sport and leisure activity.  The national lottery which was set up to provide that funding has been hijacked by the Government and its proceeds are now used as a type of tax on the dreams of the poor.  The last allocation of lottery funds for community activity was made in 1991, just before the local elections.  I expect the next allocation will be made before the European elections in June.  That is cynical political abuse of people's money intended to help communities and if so applied would assist in dealing with the rising problem of crime.</P>
    <P>Surely every pound spent on helping people trying to keep young people out of trouble is well spent.  I meet such people in my constituency.  The organiser of a football team came to see me last week and told me he would have to drop one of his teams because he cannot raise, <Col N="634" /> through normal fund raising, the £40 or £50 per week needed to hire a bus to take young people to matches.  The Government does not understand the difficulty experienced by people involved in community, youth and sporting activities, particularly in deprived communities, in raising funds to keep the show on the road.  Those people who are trying to buy jerseys for football teams and to keep youth projects going receive no help from the Government or official sources and whatever limited access they had to fund raising has dried up now because people spend whatever discretionary income they have in attempting to win the lotto on Wednesdays or Saturdays.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped the abuse of national lottery money and that the money was spent on the areas for which it was intended.  Every pound that would be spent in communities trying to help people to build a sense of respect and dignity in local communities, would save the Government £100.</P>
    <P>In its approach to crime and justice the Government is spending money when it is too late, when the damage is done and the crime has been committed, when the young person is a criminal.  The answer is more prison places, at enormous cost. There is no end to the money available to provide prison places and too little money to provide community facilities which might prevent the problem in the first instance.  This is not simply a question of political ethics; it is at the core of the crime crisis we are discussing. Because the Government is so stingy in its support for communities it has to pour money into undoing the consequences by providing prisons.</P>
    <P>The idea that communities are bound up with the problem of crime is not a new one.  A very interesting article by Jeremy Seabrook in the 26 February 1993 issue of the <i>New Statesman &amp; Society</i> addresses the sense of outrage that occurred in Britain after the killing of Jamie Bulger. The article examines what has happened to the ideology spawned by Margaret Thatcher, which many people here were quick to take up in an uncritical way, the idea that everything was about the <Col N="635" /> individual, that there was no such thing as society, that individuals would interact in the marketplace and whoever had enough money to buy goods would buy them but whoever did not have enough money, that was tough luck for them &mdash; as Margaret Thatcher's psychic, Norman Tebitt, said, they could get on their bicycle and cycle south.  That approach to society ends up in tragic events such as the Jamie Bulger case.</P>
    <P>This article wonders at the idea that crime can be dealt with by various mechanical means such as security cameras.  It points to the irony that in a shopping centre with security cameras, these cameras did not prevent the appalling crime &mdash; admittedly they helped in identifying those responsible for it.  The writer of the article asks a very fundamental question. He states:</P>
    <P>Security video cameras.  What kind of security do cameras provide? Surely, if Bootle really were a close-knit community, as it has been portrayed, it would have no need of cameras. Security, if it comes from anywhere, must arise from the tenderness and vigilance of people committed to the daily protection of one another.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, in most of this country there still exists that sense of tenderness and community spirit which this article says was missing in Bootle.  However, we are in danger of losing it because the people maintaining it at local level are becoming increasingly frustrated and isolated by lack of support.</P>
    <P>Radical new thinking is required to effectively tackle the rising crime problem in Ireland.  For far too long the Government's approach has been dominated by a crime control philosophy which believes that crime must always be with us and that the answer is to police it, arrest it and lock it away.  This approach is clearly not working, is costing too much and needs to be radically changed.  Crime is on the increase.  Offenders who have been imprisoned come out of prison to repeat the same kind of crime or commit <Col N="636" /> new ones.  Increasingly, the rights of the individual citizen are being curtailed by the menancing activities of a growing number of criminals.</P>
    <P>New policies which understand the relationship between crime and society are necessary.  These new policies can only be evolved if we have accurate information on crime and its causes, on which we can have an informed debate.  Up to now, the debate on crime has been too much dominated by sound-bite and quick-fix solutions and not enough on analysis and informed discussion.  This is why we need crime statistics and analysis.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left will be supporting this Bill as we fully acknowledge the need for much more detailed information to measure and analyse the levels of crime. Whether the way to tackle the problem is the bureau suggested by Fine Gael in this Bill, or whether it should be done in some other way is a matter of debate; the important thing is that there should be an acknowledgment of the need for more information if we are to successfully tackle the crime problem.</P>
    <P>Our record in regard to statistics on crime is not good.  Some information is available from the annual report of the Garda Commissioner and there is quite an amount of detail in the annual report on prisons and places of detention &mdash; when they are eventually produced.  Until a few months ago the most recent report on prisons was for 1988 &mdash; six years old. While the reports for 1989, 1990 and 1991 have since been published, this record does not suggest any sense of urgency with reports which are generally regarded as being the most important source of statistical and other information of the penal system.</P>
    <P>The distinguished criminologist, Dr. Paul O'Mahony, author of <i>Crime and Punishment in Ireland</i> and a former servant of the Department of Justice, has been strongly critical of the lack of priority given to the compilation of statistical information on crime.  Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> late last year he said:</P>
    <P>The only solution to our present confusion and ignorance concerning crime <Col N="637" /> and punishment is a greatly increased investment in scientific inquiry into crime, by which is meant both the gathering of new information and the careful analysis and rational synthesis of all available evidence.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Mahony was critical of what he described as the culture of secrecy surrounding the Department of Justice and noted that the Government was almost unique among developed nations in devoting next to nothing to research into criminal justice.  He noted that there was no university department of criminology and that there was no research unit attached to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Clearly these shortcomings in the system will have to be addressed if we are to successfully tackle the crime problem. However, even the limited information available, and the unfortunate personal experiences of many of our citizens, give an indication of the scale of the crime problem.</P>
    <P>What we need is an informed debate on crime and we can have that only on the basis of up to date data.  Everybody has an opinion on crime and these opinions are frequently expressed in strident terms, very often in extreme terms. We need to transfer discussion on crime from the notion as to who has the latest bright idea that is likely to capture a headline in an evening paper to the area of serious debate.  We live in a very complex society.  There is no point reminiscing, as Deputy McGahon did last week, about the twenties and thirties, pointing out that people were poor, hungry, honest and decent at that time, I am sure they were, but the past always looks better in hindsight.  We often forget that even in those days society was not free from crime.  However, what society was free from then, and is not now, is the extent to which people are inundated through television programmes with messages about the quality of life, standards of life, material goods and possessions of one kind or another, the kind of normal lifestyle to which we should all aspire.  In between the television programmes this type of lifestyle is advertised in a very aggressive way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> It is all very well to look back at the 1920s and 1930s and say people were poor and honest.  However, many poor people now can never aspire to buy the commodities suggested to them in their living rooms day in, day out that they should have.  If we have an arrangement whereby people are told through the media that this is the lifestyle to which they should aspire and these are the kinds of goods they should have and we cannot then provide them with the income with which to buy these goods through our employment, social welfare and income policies, we should not be surprised when some people end up concluding that the only way to get these goods is through some form of smash and grab.  This does not justify crime, but we have to understand that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people who find themselves in poor circumstances are law abiding and, unfortunately, are very often the first victims of crime.  We have to understand that crime does not take place in a vacuum: aspects of our society and the way in which we organise our society contribute to the climate in which crime of one kind or another thrives.  This matter has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The problem in Dublin needs special attention.  The recently published crime figures show that the number of reported crimes in Dublin rose by 8 per cent in 1993, twice the rate of the increase in the rest of the country.  This emphasises the need for additional Garda personnel and resources in Dublin.  These official figures merely confirm what most people in Dublin know, that Dublin is experiencing a very serious crime wave.  Dublin, which has just one third of the country's population, suffers more than half of all the crime.  The crime rate in parts of Dublin is almost ten times that in some rural Garda divisions.  What is of even more concern is that the detection rate in Dublin is generally the lowest in the country.  What all this means is that if you live in or visit Dublin you are far more likely to be a victim of crime and the perpetrator has a much greater chance of getting away with the offence.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin are not getting a <Col N="639" /> fair deal in the fight against crime, and the Minister must confront this problem. Dublin is seriously under-policed, and this is clearly adding to the problem. More than half of all reported crimes take place in Dublin, yet less than 4,000 gardaí, approximately one third of the Garda force, are deployed here.  Many Dublin based gardaí are deployed on special duties such as providing protection for VIPs, embassies, public buildings, etc., and are, therefore, not available for routine policing duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>More gardaí and resources must be allocated to fighting the unacceptable level of crime in Dublin.  The most effective way of combating crime is to put more gardaí on the streets to deal with the problems people in Dublin are experiencing.  Juvenile crime is a major part of the problem in Dublin and this clearly emphasises the need for more resources for the juvenile liaison scheme.  I am stressing the particular problems in Dublin because it does not take a genius to work out that the level of crime is related to the number of gardaí.  On the basis of the figures supplied by the Minister for Justice some months ago, the numbers of gardaí per head of population in Dublin is approximately half what it is in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to look at the level of policing in Dublin and in doing so &mdash; this comes back to my earlier point about the need for new approaches to the crime problem &mdash; to try to strengthen the concept of community policing and the involvement of the community in the entire policing exercise.  The neighbourhood watch scheme has been in operation for many years.  There was a great deal of enthusiasm, particularly among those involved in co-ordinating schemes, the community gardaí and so on when the neighbourhood watch scheme started.  People had very high expectations <Col N="640" /> that the scheme would contribute significantly to a reduction in the level of crime.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been a significant reduction in the level of crime in areas with good neighbourhood watch schemes, but it is a pity that the community policing pilot schemes under the neighbourhood watch scheme, have not been built upon.  One cannot simply establish a neighbourhood watch scheme and hope it will solve the problem or set up a community policing scheme when in one large station there is one community garda to cover a big area.</P>
    <P>The concept of community policing needs to be taken a step further.  I have often wondered about the wisdom of concentrating all Garda resources, particularly in Dublin, in large modern Garda stations where contact with the public is mainly through a fleet of cars, motorcycles, etc.  While I appreciate and support the need for good modern working conditions for the Garda and for economies of scale in terms of centralising modern technology and police and detection methods in large Garda stations it has meant that gardaí have been moved further from the community.</P>
    <P>While I would like to see more gardaí deployed in Dublin, I would not like to see them deployed in existing stations. The community Garda strength needs to be increased, and gardaí deployed in local communities and housing estates and based in smaller stations.  Consideration should be given to a system tried out successfully by some Church Orders of deploying priests and nuns in the community when people no longer visited the big convents, monasteries or presbyteries.  The Minister should look at the problems of under-policing in Dublin and consider appointing more community police.</P>

      <P>This Bill fails to address the fundamental causes of crime which are economic and social.  Factors such as high unemployment, social deprivation, poor housing and the lack of adequate educational opportunities contribute to increased levels of crime.  It has been shown there is a definite correlation between social conditions and crime levels.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government and this year's budget address the causes of crime.  This year £129 million, and an additional £12 million, have been allocated for local authority housing.  Between 1993 and 1994 a total of 1,000 local authority houses will be built in Dublin which will provide modern accommodation for people who lack these facilities.  There is also an increase in the amount allocated for refurbishment of flat complexes in the inner cities.  This work is now being done. There are also urban renewal projects underway in Dublin city and throughout the country.  All these measures contribute to tackling the problem of crime by providing people with a better community, improved housing conditions, better social conditions and improved living standards.  The injection of funds into house building, refurbishment and renewal will create an additional 14,000 jobs in the construction industry which will also help to tackle the problem of unemployment and the related problems of social discontent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year £98 million has been allocated for the school building programme. In providing the nation's children with improved educational opportunities, training and skills we will equip them for the future so that they will be able to take up employment and not turn to a life of crime.  Studies have shown that children who drop out of school at an early age and who do not complete their primary education invariably end up in a life of crime.  It is important to provide the best <Col N="642" /> education opportunities possible for our children.</P>
    <P>In the area of health care, additional funds have been provided to tackle the problem of hospital waiting lists and problems in the health services generally.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Government's crime package which is delivering on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackling crime.  I compliment the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on this imaginative initiative which in the future will show benefits.  I also welcome the decision to recruit an additional 407 gardaí in 1994.  There are two Garda Districts in my constituency, Raheny and Coolock, and for the past four or five years gardaí who have been promoted, transferred or retired have not been replaced.  The gardaí are undermanned and this was having an effect on their capability to tackle the increasing crime problem.  This new intake of gardaí will help them return to a situation where they can effectively police our community. The decision to recruit an additional 350 gardaí over the next three to four years will maintain the Garda force at this year's level.  That is necessary because studies have shown that over the coming years, quite a number of gardaí will retire due to garda intake 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>The initiative to recruit an additional 200 clerical and administrative staff will release the same number of gardaí into the community to police our streets and do the job for which they have been trained.  This is an important initiative. Many of the duties which the Garda have been undertaking such as clerical work, typing etc., should have been done by civilians.  I also welcome the proposal to recruit civilians with experience in personnel, human resources, financial control, organisation and development and public relations.  Any modern police force must recruit specialists who have experience in other areas of the economy and enterprise and use that experience to modernise and streamline the Garda Síochána who have given a valuable service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The provision of increased resources for information technology is important. We live in an age where everything is done by computer.  Even criminals have access to the most sophisticated communications devices and the Garda must be equipped to deal with that.  It needs a modern managment information system which computers can provide to provide up-to-date information. The computerisation of fingerprints would allow the Garda to make on the spot checks of persons who have been arrested and give them access to vital information which would enable them deal effectively with crime in a modern society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the upgrading of technology. I understand gardaí are using handset radios and equipment introduced in the mid-1980s and which will soon be obsolete.  The introduction of new, modern communications equipment will enable gardaí to respond effectively to the problems of crime.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the community based initiatives contained in the Government's programme.  One or two pilot schemes in the Tallaght area have been successful and it is intended to set up an additional four or five projects.  Last night I attended a meeting in my constituency in Kilbarrack where a local group of tenants met corporation officials to discuss management of the refurbishment of their flat complex.  Earlier in the day they visited Ballymun to see how the refurbishment was progressing.  The corporation official who had taken them there had no transport so they travelled in a Garda minibus. That is an indication of the level of co-operation between the Garda and local communities.  It is not uncommon for a local community group who wish to visit some other part of the city to be provided with transport by the Garda.  It is important to have that kind of co-operation in areas of disadvantage where the communities are lacking in resources and where the various agencies, local authorities, health boards and Garda, can assist each other to improve the fabric of life.  It is important that the Garda break <Col N="644" /> down barriers of alienation that may exist between communities in areas of our city and in the country generally.  These type of initiatives are important in tackling crime and in bringing communities into contact with the Garda.</P>
    <P>The measures to combat fraud, in particular white collar fraud, are welcome. We are all aware of the person who goes into a bank wearing a mask and using a gun and who robs £10,000.  As a result of white collar crime, vast sums of money can be transferred electronically almost without notice.  It does not involve a holdup and there is little trace of these transactions. It is important that the Garda have the expertise, equipment and facilities to audit and check these transactions where fraud takes place using modern technology.  The commitment to provide information technology equipment and other expertise to the Garda to combat this serious problem is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of 210 additional prison places.  We are all well aware that often there was not sufficient prison space to detain those sentenced.  I welcome the provision of the extra 50 probation and welfare officers and support staff.  Such staff are important to assist those released from prison early into the community under the supervision of probation and welfare officers to ensure that they do not revert to a life of crime.  Any investment in that area is money well spent particularly if it ensures that when first offenders are released there will be some liaison between them and the probation and welfare services.</P>
    <P>The extra resources for the Judiciary to ensure that the perpetrators of crime are brought before the courts and dealt with quickly are welcome.  For too long people who were released on bail awaiting a court hearing committed further crimes.  Any measures which speed that process are to be welcomed. These Government initiatives will address the causes of crime in our society.</P>

I congratulate Deputy Jim Mitchell who perhaps did go for the wrong option on this occasion but who received a consolation prize of being asked by his party leader to stand in the European Elections in the Dublin constituency.  It was a day of celebration for both Deputies who, though they backed two different horses, came out on top, which was no mean achievement.  It would be churlish of me to allow this occasion pass without saying &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely and useful.  There should be regular debates in this House on crime because the public often comment how irrelevant are such debates to the real issues within our society.  Crime is at the very heart of problems in Irish society today.  Society will gain from this debate.  However, we do need accurate figures to inform us, and the public, on how crime continues to increase in our society.  Assumptions, myths, guesswork and speculation serve no purpose unless arguments and discussions are based on facts.  There have been more than 100,000 indictable crime here in the past year &mdash; a big number of crimes in any society &mdash; despite the fact that <i>per capita</i> we have the highest number of police officers of any other OECD member state.  When one thinks about them, they are chilling figures.</P>
      <P>Crimes are committed against people and against property, especially public property.  Indeed, we are facing a wave of crime and vandalism in our society, with the destruction of public property to be witnessed everywhere, especially of public housing.  It is a sad reflection on and indictment of our society that we damage property, public parks, public housing and amenities provided for the public.  Such property has been vandalised, destroyed and pulled apart.  At a time of scarce public resources it is a sad indictment of all of us that so much public property is destroyed and wasted in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of justice, Deputy O'Dea, is well <Col N="646" /> aware of the incidence of crime in Limerick also.  I wish to relate a brief story for the benefit of the House about a young person who stole a car from the southern part of our city and set fire to it close to a public leisure complex.  Not only did the car burn out, but the leisure complex also causing almost £1 million worth of damage, depriving a whole society of recreational and leisure facilities, in addition to communities, business concerns, sports teams and so on.  The Minister will also be aware of the vandalism that takes place in cemeteries which were sacrosanct at one time.  There have been attacks on people, especially the elderly, and damage caused to railway lines and public parks also in our city.  As far as I am concerned, it is mindless crime but we cannot run away from it; it has to be admitted, confronted and dealt with.</P>
    <P>We have all been perturbed about the growth of violent crime in our society, with armed robberies, kidnappings, blackmail, protection rackets.  Almost on the doorstep of this House, there are protection rackets and money is demanded from business people weekly. At one time we only saw such activity on the Hollywood movies.  Now it is in Dublin.  House breaking and attacks on old people were totally unacceptable in our society at one time, but are a regular occurrence in all our cities and towns. More and varied types of petty crimes are being committed.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the points made in the debate such as that unemployment in urban areas is a contributory factor.  In two large housing estates in Limerick, approximately 7,000 people live in each and up to 85 per cent of those eligible for work are unemployed.  They have no stake in society and no meaningful participation in the world around them.  That is wrong.  Young people who grow up in such marginalised societies must be given better example, leadership, be involved in that society and must be brought in from the margins.  The FÁS training and retaining programmes offer enormous opportunity in that respect.  FÁS programmes rather than being held in a centre away from such areas would be <Col N="647" /> more meaningful if held within those communities.  They would do something tangible for the people to whom they could relate.  We have lost a great opportunity in that respect but it is not too late to change.</P>
    <P>Education, especially adult education, has much to offer.  For far too long, adult education has been the Cinderella of Irish education.  It is time it was fully exploited to benefit the people who live in those areas.  We must experiment, endeavour to find a better way forward with better policing.  I heard Deputy Gilmore plead for more gardaí. In that respect the fact that we have more gardaí <i>per capita</i> than any other OECD member state is worthy of consideration.  Indeed, quality policing is more important than quantity.  We can also benefit and learn from experiences in other countries since prevention is better than cure.  For example, Garda training must be upgraded.</P>
    <P>I was impressed recently by a North Tipperary film made by Gerry Gregg and his production crew on the training of gardaí in Templemore.  I was impressed by the standard of the recruits and the quality of the training.  The film was broad-based, modern, good and offered much hope in our society in that those young men and women portrayed in the film were embarking on a career in the Garda Síochána.  We need such people in the force since gardaí have a major role to play in the fight against crime.  While we might not have fully realised it, the gardaí are the ambassadors not alone of the Minister and her Department but also of our society and must play a manyfaceted role.  They should never underestimate their task or think they are invisible; sometimes public officials think they are invisible; they are not and are observed by all of us.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of providing adequate equipment and facilities for the Garda, giving them the very best we can offer, even if it comes from other countries, so that they do not have to complain about lack of equipment in fulfilling their task.  In addition, we should provide them with fair laws, with a balance struck <Col N="648" /> between fighting crime and maintaining civil liberties.  More civilians should be recruited to work in Garda stations; it is wrong to have gardaí undertaking tasks that could be done by others.  The task of the Garda is fighting crime out on the streets, not engaging in tasks for which they may not be suited and which could be undertaken just as easily, if not better, by others.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Garda can influence us all, especially criminals who can be discouraged by their serious, professional, determined attitude in facing them.  That would do much in the prevention of crime.  There is need for a more enlightened attitude in our prisons and we must not be deflected from endeavouring to rehabilitate criminals. People might laugh and say I am naive but we must always try to change people. Cynicism and despair have no place in fighting crime.  We must face up to the problem in an open, honest way.  The courts must also respond fairly.  The Department of Justice has overall responsibility for laying down guidelines and regulations.  We cannot turn back the clock, we must face reality and learn from other countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  Deputies are well aware of how people view crime. The saddest fact is that old people live in fear of attack, their homes are violated when they are broken into by people wearing balaclavas and carrying arms.  To read about crime in a newspaper is one thing but to confront it in your own home is another.</P>
    <P>We must ensure there is a civilised framework within which people can live and we must lock evil people away.  We must face the fact that people fear for their lives and examine how we can prevent and combat crime.  Young unemployed people in large housing estates turn to drinking cider, wine and glue sniffing.  They have opted out of the life but they must be brought back to the fold and given some kind of future.  If we do that the level of crime will fall.  In the meantime it is important that the matter be raised on a regular basis in the House <Col N="649" /> and that Deputies speak out on behalf of the electorate.</P>
    <P>People sometimes feel their voices are not heard.  A colleague of mine in Limerick retired from the corporation after a lifetime's work and was given a bungalow in the city.  It was broken into 12 times, that may sound strange but it is true. Every item was taken, including the clock he received as a retirement present, eventually his tools and bedclothes were taken.  In the end, I sought a transfer for him to another part of the city.  That is totally unacceptable and we must set our face against such behaviour.  We must guarantee people the right to live in their homes in peace and security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate and who were good enough to say kind things about me. I was disappointed with the protective attitude of some Government contributors. Where are the Charlie McCreevys and the backbenchers who are prepared to speak their mind rather than read a script?  I understand Ministers with collective responsibility sticking together but others should have the courage of their convictions and not be like sheep behind the Government.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  Last week the Minister said that my proposal could imply that crime statistics are not measured accurately and she strongly refutes any inference that the Garda suppress reports of crime to make the figures smaller.  I did not make any such allegation. It is typical of the closed mind attitude of the Department of Justice that it would try to turn things around.  The statistics do not reflect the true level of crime, they reflect the level of reported crime.  There is almost a hope that people will stop reporting crime so that the statistics could be shown to be lower than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said it would be unrealistic to separate the functions of recording and reporting crime from the investigation of crime.  Who said that? The person who wrote her speech?  I speak for 66 Members of Parliament, criminologists, the Whitaker Commission <Col N="650" /> and the Law Reform Commission who all made similar points.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she had a reliable guide to the needs of the public and public representatives through the regular requests for information received in her Department and through the continuous demands by Members of the House via the parliamentary question system.  If one were to telephone the Department of Justice and ask them the time they would check it in triplicate before replying.  It is the most secretive of all Departments.  Why not identify the true level of crime and deal with it in a professional way instead of pretending there is no problem?  The Minister said the people who fail to report crime may have good reasons for doing so.  They may be prepared to inform a third party while remaining opposed to reporting the crime to the Garda.  People have stopped reporting crime because they have no confidence in the system.  If one reports the theft of a bicycle or hub-cap the chances of getting a positive response are slim.</P>
    <P>Under section 30 (2) of the National Statistics Act the Central Statistics Office will not have a statutory right of access to records pertaining to a court, the Garda Síochána or the prisons administration. The Minister said that under the Statistics Act, 1993, there is provision for Government Departments, including her own, to invite the CSO to inspect and analyse official statistics along the lines envisaged by me.  She said that following the recent meeting with the Director of the CSO it was decided to set up a special study group to consider how best to co-ordinate statistical data.  That meeting took place almost immediately after I produced this Bill and brought it into the House.  Every time I press for something to be done the Minister sets up a committee or a commission or somehow pushes it further down the road while pretending to do something about the problem.  She goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It would be wasteful if it were to operate in parallel to, and duplicate <Col N="651" /> everything already done by the gardaí . . .</P>
    <P>I have not suggested duplicating anything being done by the Garda Síochána.  I have suggested that an assistant commissioner of the Garda Síochána should be on this bureau.  Every member of that bureau is already on the public service pay roll and it would not cost the taxpayer one extra penny.  This speech is not worth commenting on further but I want to reply to those points which the Minister made because I would not like to leave them on the record unanswered.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Eamon Walsh who said graphs would not solve crime problems. If we had some idea of the true level of crime, the categories of crime and the levels of crime in those categories from period to period we would have some chance of dealing with the problem. At present statistics do not exist.  My proposal is supported by both Whitaker and the Law Reform Commission.  In 1985 the Whitaker report on the penal system concluded that given the state of the criminal justice statistics, the frequency of complex crimes cannot be adequately measured.  It says:</P>
    <P>This lack of information is not merely a nuisance which hinders research, it is a feature of the criminal justice system that decisions are taken at one stage in ignorance of what is occuring elsewhere in the system.</P>
    <P>The recent Law Reform Commission report on sentencing states:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this situation remains unchanged.  Any provisional recommendations in this paper or recommendations ultimately made in our report will be rendered comparatively ineffective by the absence of proper information.  Details of every sentence imposed in every court and of every instance of election for trial venue by judge, prosecution or accused should be recorded and speedily retrievable.</P>
    <P>Pointing out that it would not be possible <Col N="652" /> to attain this by relying on occasional research the commission recommends the setting up of a distinct national office or agency, staffed by experts, to conduct the necessary research and provide statistics.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is concerned at the lack of adequate research, the lack of this independent body and the lack of statistics. There is no research unit attached to the Department of Justice.  The proposed national bureau of crime statistics would be that unit.  The bureau would be made up of people whose integrity cannot be called into question&mdash;the Director of the Central Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Accounting Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions Office, an Assistant Garda Commissioner, a governor of the prisons, a judge of the High Court and a representative of the probation service of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>They are the people to bring together the court statistics, prison statistics and crime statistics in one bureau so that we, the legislators, the Garda Síochána, as protectors of the law, and the Judiciary, those who hand down sentences, will have available to them the sentences which work and are efficient.  Does anybody know the effectiveness of community court orders?  Does anybody know how effective or otherwise is the procedure of suspending part of a sentence and bringing people back to court after three or four months to see how they are getting on?  If some judges knew how effective sentences imposed by others are they could base their sentence on something more scientific than the ritual six months or £1,000.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the Minister's so-called crime package of £66 million which apparently will come out of the next five years' Government spending on the Justice Vote.  The vote for the Department of Justice this year is £550 million.  I presume that because of inflation it will increase by 2 per cent or 3 per cent during the next few years.  This sum of £66 million is more realistic and easier to sell than the £100 million which a former Minister for Justice, Deputy <Col N="653" /> Collins, announced.  All we got from that £100 million was £1,000 provided as a Token Estimate for the Department of Justice Vote for aeroplanes and helicopters which have never flown, have never been seen and never will be seen. I wish to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 January 1994, written jointly by Mr. Tom O'Malley, a lecturer in law at UCG, and Mr. Ian O'Donnell, research officer, University of Oxford Centre for Criminological Research, which states:</P>
    <P>Briefly and simply stated, the Government's attitude appears to be that the optimum strategy for the criminal justice system is one of &ldquo;crime control&rdquo;&mdash; that crime is likely to increase inexorably, and the best that can be done is to detect it with the maximum efficiency and lock up as many offenders as possible.  Few governments in Europe are in a worse position to make such assumptions and predictions because few governments, if any, have devoted such inadequate resources to basic research on crime and delinquency.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from Dr. Paul O'Mahony in his book <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, page 207, on the mysterious criminal justice process, which states:</P>
    <P>At this point a complete and fully elaborated understanding of the reality of crime and punishment in Ireland is at best a distant and elusive goal.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, we lack much basic information about the criminal justice process in all its phases from the commission of crime to release from prison.  Such information is a prerequisite of a full and proper understanding and appraisal of the Irish criminal justice process.</P>
    <P>Second, much of the information we do have is inconsistent and even selfcontradictory to a level which makes drawing confident conclusions impossible or, at any rate, unwise.</P>
    <P>All those sound, independent sources support every argument I have made for the creation of a national bureau of crime <Col N="654" /> statistics.  The only thing wrong is that it did not come from a Fianna Fáil Deputy, it came from a member of the Opposition. This is one of a number of very worthwhile proposals we have put forward. How can we propose to deal with the drugs problem &mdash; drugs which are being sold openly on the streets &mdash; and the associated problems of handbag snatching, burglary and beatings which are taking place in order to feed that habit? How can we deal with the problems of car stealing, the need for car locks, car alarms, house alarms, shutters and so on?</P>
    <P>The elderly in rural areas, who never experienced such a problem, are frightened and intimidated, because the younger population who were there to protect them have emigrated and they are being preyed on.  People in rural areas are moving to towns and villages due to fear. What is to be done about the muggings? There was the case of the man in Dublin 8 who is in his mid-seventies and who, having been hit with a hammer, will close his shop and move into a home? There is also the case of the 88-year old lady in Drimnagh who is terrified by the groups who congregate outside her house every night forming an audience for those in stolen cars?  What about the question of burglary?  What about the ease with which people can obtain guns for crime and the violence which is commonplace in the community?</P>
    <P>How can we start the fight back against crime if all we have are public relations exercises?  Every time a half ounce of drugs is found the Minister is being photographed with it, yet the city is awash with drugs.  We will never know the true extent of the problem unless we measure it accurately; we will never tackle that problem unless we know precisely the level of the problem.  We will never establish the level of that problem without a national bureau of crime statistics. In any plan we put together to deal with crime we must know precisely the level of the problem and whether we are having success in tackling it under the various headings.  We must have procedures for reporting from time to time precisely what our success has been in <Col N="655" /> tackling the problem.  We spend £550 million a year on the criminal justice system and that money will not be targeted adequately until we have the facts and figures to deal with the problem. <Col N="656" /> I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's recent announcement on the administration of third level grants.  There was a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding when students applied for various grants and this long overdue proposal is welcome.</P>
      <P>A number of officially recognised higher education colleges has been providing a very valuable education service for several years.  The sector is growing and there are approximately 3,000 students attending these colleges in the Dublin area.  However, they are not eligible for higher education grants and a student who may not have succeeded in getting a place in one of the public third level colleges cannot avail of a place in an officially recognised private higher education college because of his lack of means.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the idea of extending third level grants to officially recognised colleges.  There are insufficient places in third level public institutions but the demand for places continues to escalate.  Under the present arrangements a person of limited means who fails to obtain a place in a public college is deprived of a place in a private college because of the lack of grant support. If he decides to avail of a place in a private college it places a considerable burden on his family.  Academically qualified students who lack parental finance are effectively debarred from competing for places in private officially recognised colleges.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to award a grant to students who wish to attend private colleges to address a serious issue of social exclusion in the field of higher education which is rooted in the absence of the means to pay.  An alternative that may prove helpful is to lease places in these colleges similar to the way the Minister for Health leased hospital beds in certain areas.</P>
      <P>Students from Northern Ireland are awarded grants by the education and library board for approved courses in private colleges in the Republic, however, their counterparts south of the Border are not allowed this support.  In addition Northern Ireland students attending degree courses of British universities offered in private colleges in the Republic have been entitled to mandatory grants since the inception of the courses in the Republic but that is not the case for students in the Republic.  We need more equitable access to education.</P>
      <P>However, the current position <i>vis-à-vis</i> higher education grants for students seeking to attend private colleges compounds inequity and discrimination.  It is time for a change in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I appreciate his concerns.  It would be difficult to over-emphasise the importance of the student support schemes in the context of our overall third level education system.  For this reason the schemes are constantly being amended and improved when possible in the context <Col N="659" /> of overall Government expenditure on third level education.</P>
      <P>For the 1992-93 academic year, for example, nearly 46,000 students were in receipt of awards under the various student grants and scholarship schemes compared to just over 12,000 students ten years ago.  Overall, in the third level area, well over half the total enrolment of 80,000 students in 1992-93 were in receipt of student support compared with a quarter of all students in 1982-83.</P>
      <P>Total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State in 1993 was approximately £84 million which represented an increase of £9 million or 12 per cent on 1992 expenditure. This increasing expenditure represents the broadening of the scope of the various schemes as, for example, provision was made for the first time in 1992 for mature students.  I had the pleasure of steering the legislation in question through the Dáil.  Prior to 1992 many mature students could not qualify for grants as they did not have the required academic attainments in the leaving certificate examination. Moreover, the schemes only allowed for parental income to be taken into account for the purposes of the means tests.</P>
      <P>The situation now is that mature students who secure a place in third level institutions are automatically considered to meet the academic requirments for the award of grants.  Also, mature students are now means tested for grants by reference to their own incomes if they do not reside with their parents.  These improvements in 1992 resulted in over 800 mature students being awarded grants under the higher education grants and the vocational education committee scholarship schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years several private third level colleges were designated as third level institutions under the National Council for Educational Awards, the NCEA.  This means that such institutions may submit their courses to the NCEA for validation and students who successfully complete validated courses have their certificates, diplomas or degrees <Col N="660" /> awarded by the NCEA.  There is no implication, however, in such designation regarding the provision of State funding.</P>
    <P>There is an argument, however, in favour of students attending validated third level courses in private institutions being eligible for student support grants and this will be taken into account in considering the report of the expert group on grants which was made available to the Department recently.  Consideration will have to be given, however, to requiring some form of insurance bonding from such private institutions before State funding could be provided for their students.</P>

      <P>During the past six months the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry encouraged increased planting on the presumption that higher grants and premia would be payable to all farmers, full or part-time, by the European Union.  A large number of part-time farmers went ahead but now find they will not receive premia at the higher rate. I understood 200 farmers, including some in my own constituency &mdash; I know some of them personally &mdash; have been affected by the recent decision.</P>
      <P>Under the recently announced European Union forestry scheme farmers will qualify for premia at the higher rate only if they derive at least 25 per cent of their income from farming.  Up to now there was no off-farm income limit.  The loss to part-time farmers will be substantial as those who meet the income requirement will receive £121 per statute acre.  Farmers who do not meet this requirements will qualify for a premium of only £49 per acre.  In addition, qualified applicants will receive the premium for 20 years whereas those who are classified as non-farmers will receive the premium of 15 years only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time farmers will now be treated in the same way as corporations and companies, which was not the position previously. The number of part-time farmers is on the increase because of the decline <Col N="661" /> in agricultural incomes.  If we want to keep these families in rural areas we must provide incentives.  The original proposal promoted by the Minister of State provided such an incentive.</P>
    <P>It is clear that many part-time farmers will not go ahead with their plans because of the recent announcement.  Some of those who went ahead on the presumption that they would receive grants at the higher rate now find themselves in a difficult financial position.</P>
    <P>I understand that as recently as 11 January the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, had a meeting with the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. Steichen, about the new forestry scheme but at that stage there was no mention of the 25 per cent income requirement. The scheme proposed by the European Union must be a source of major embarrassment for the Minister of State and the Department who had been encouraging, in good faith, increased planting on the grounds that higher grants and premia would be payable and which would have made the scheme very attractive and lucrative for all farmers, full or part-time.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister of State reassured applicants that they could go ahead on the basis of the proposals submitted by the Department to Brussels for approval.  It is a bit like the Tallaght Hospital case; people had high expectations of receiving money from Europe but now there is disappointment.</P>

The Minister of State should not leave these people in the lurch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the situation. The Commission's Standing Forestry Committee meeting on 15 February, accepted Ireland's affor-estation programme which is part of the reform of the CAP.  This programme will provide substantial increases in afforestation grant and annual premium payments. Other important benefits from the new programme will include the provision of more than 600 jobs in planting and maintenance in rural areas, the stimulation of rural development through increased economic activity, diversification of farmers' incomes and a positive contribution to the environment through increased broadleaf planting. The programme still has to be formally approved by the Commission but I expect this to happen within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>On 16 February, I met with representatives of the IFA, ICMSA, UFA as well as the Irish Timber Growers Association and provided them with a detailed briefing on the outcome to the standing committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for two levels of annual forestry premium.  The first is payable for 20 years at rates ranging between £130 to £300 per hectare per annum depending on species planted and type of land.  The second and lower range is £80 to £120 per annum for 15 years and is payable to those not qualifying for the higher rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's qualification criteria for the higher premium will be that <Col N="663" /> beneficiaries will have to have at least 25 per cent of their income coming from farming.  This will apply to all member states.  One consequence of this will be to concentrate the highest levels of premium support on those most dependent on farming for their livelihood.  Those not qualifying for the higher premium would qualify for the lower payments. This lower range of £80 to £120 per hectare is substantially higher than the comparable old rate of £50 per hectare.</P>
    <P>As regards the 25 per cent threshold, I wish to make it clear that Commission insistence that this be a feature surfaced very late in discussions on Ireland's programme. When I met Commissioner Steichen on 11 January he welcomed the Irish proposals.  The issue of a 25 per cent threshold was not raised at this or any earlier meeting with the Commission.  I was satisfied from my discussions with the Commissioner that Commission approval would be forthcoming for the programme as submitted.</P>
    <P>When the issue of the 25 per cent threshold was eventually raised by the Commission, my primary concerns were the national importance of avoiding any further delay in securing approval of Ireland's programme and ensuring that farmers, in particular, would derive maximum benefit from this CAP afforestation scheme.  Other member states were similarly anxious to avoid further delays in approval of their programmes, notwithstanding the Commission's introduction of the 25 per cent threshold.</P>
    <P>I am currently working on the fine detail of how the 25 per cent threshold is to be interpreted and administered.  I have invited the farming organisations to urgently bring to my attention any concerns they might have in this regard. I am anxious that work in this area is guided by my expressed desire to encourage the development of forestry on family farms throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am also sensitive to the position of those with farm incomes of less than 25 per cent of total income who have already undertaken planting.  Although the number of people falling into this category <Col N="664" /> will be small in relation to the number who can be expected to benefit from this scheme during its operation, I recognise that there is an issue to be tackled.  I am particularly concerned to ensure that those who have received planting approvals from my Department in the period 1 August 1992 to 15 February 1994 are not disadvantaged by imposition of the 25 per cent farm income threshold.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that I have already raised this matter with Commissioner Steichen and our concerns were emphatically indicated to the Commission by the Irish delegation at the Standing Forestry Committee last week.  Consequently, the Commission has undertaken to re-examine the proposal particularly as it affects those individuals mentioned by the Deputy.  I expect to have a response from the Commission at the next meeting of the Standing Forestry Committee on the 8 March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair, on behalf of myself and the consumers, both domestic and industrial, of the inadequate water supply for allowing me to raise this matter.  I am grateful also on behalf of the 400 employees of General Instrument and the 400 who will be employed there if the Minister gives a favourable response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with increasing frustration and anger that I raise this matter, because I raised it on numerous occasions both on the Adjournment and at Question Time with no generous response from the Government.  The issue has been the subject of two deputations from the local urban district council to two former Ministers of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputies Connolly and Dan Wallace.  Unfortunately, nothing concrete emerged to solve the problem and all we heard were pious platitudes. The latest twist has been a point-blank refusal by the Minister to meet any deputation from the urban district council <Col N="665" /> despite numerous requests from that authority.</P>
    <P>It is important to place the history of this problem on the record.  In the mid-1980s the Department of the Environment initiated contacts with Macroom about its inadequate water supply.  All the preliminary studies, research, etc. have been completed and we are awaiting the Minister's agreement to proceed.  It has been with his Department for five years and during that time domestic consumers, potential investors and the industry referred to have been suffering because of the Minister's inaction. Almost 800 jobs are threatened in Macroom because of the failure of the Department of the Environment to give immediate sanction to a new town water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>The announcement in early December by the General Instrument plant that it proposed a major expansion, bringing the numbers employed in the factory to 770, was broadly welcomed.  The credit for this was taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who were in the town on the day of the announcement.  Neither of them is to be seen now when the company concerned is facing almost insurmountable obstacles in its efforts to proceed with this project.</P>
    <P>An essential ingredient for the company is a quality water supply.  The company currently consumes 70,000 gallons a day and will require 300,000 gallons a day to facilitate the proposed expansion. The plant already suffers because of deficiencies in the quality and quantity of supply and the proposed extension cannot proceed unless the Minister can guarantee 300,000 gallons of quality water a day.  This is why the company needs immediate confirmation that the scheme will proceed.  If it does not get that, the expansion cannot advance.</P>
    <P>To date the Department's response has been nothing short of disgraceful.  In reply to a parliamentary question by me on 2 February last the Minister stated: &ldquo;The financing of this scheme, a large part of whose capacity would relate to the <Col N="666" /> increased requirements of an individual industry, is being examined at present by Cork County Council in conjunction with the industry concerned&rdquo;.  This is nothing short of official blackmail of an industry that plans to invest significantly and create 400 jobs in Macroom.  There was no mention of these negotiations during the Adjournment debate on 12 October 1993.  Now, because an industrialist has made a major investment in the town, we think we can put the gun to their head and extract £1.5 million towards the cost of a £5 million scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record some correspondence I received from the industry concerned.  In a letter addressed to me and dated 14 February last, the vice-president and general manager of the company, Mr. Tom Ripp, stated:</P>
    <P>The water issue in Macroom is a serious matter for General Instrument. Failure to identify an adequate water supply to support our future growth could lead to the abandonment of our expansion programme . . .  We cannot afford to support the water scheme while meeting the needs of our expansion programme.</P>
    <P>In correspondence today, Mr. Ripp said:</P>
    <P>The critical item for General Instrument would be the timing for implementation of this upgrade.  We are of the understanding that unless work commences immediately on this project an increased water supply would not be available to meet our demand.</P>
    <P>I must tell you that General Instrument finds it very disturbing that they are being asked to contribute towards the cost of Macroom's water scheme as this project has been under consideration for many years.  One has to question the overall commitment that is being made to support the growth of industry in this area.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>As we discussed during our meeting major problems such as this one are <Col N="667" /> often enough to force reconsideration of any decision.</P>
    <P>This scheme does not have to be modified or require increased capacity, but its plans have rested in the Minister's Department for the past five years.  For some unknown reason there is an unwillingness by the Minister &mdash; and the same applied to his predecessors &mdash; to grant any favours to a town which desperately needs investment to safeguard 400 jobs.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this important matter and congratulate him on his new Front Bench appointment. I hope he will have many long successful years there.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the urgency attaching to the Macroom water supply improvement scheme.  This scheme, which has an estimated cost of £4.9 million, has been technically approved by my Department for some time.  In common with many other worthwhile proposals, it was not possible to provide financing for it up to now due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water and sanitary services programme.  The major industrial expansion now planned at Macroom by General Instrument, for which IDA grants have been approved, is welcome and important.  It undoubtedly brings greater priority to the Macroom scheme the planning of which Macroom UDC in co-operation with Cork County Council, had already well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The water requirements of the planned industrial expansion by General Instrument were notified to the council fairly recently.  They amount to an increased demand of some 270,000 gallons per day and would, therefore, take up the major share &mdash; in excess of 70 per cent &mdash; of the new capacity to be provided by the <Col N="668" /> Macroom water supply improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are all anxious that the new scheme should facilitate the expansion of this major industry.  However, it has been the policy, where a water or sewage treatment scheme is significantly dedicated to the requirements of a single industry, to require a proportional contribution from that industry to the capital cost of the scheme.  Contributions of this kind have, for example, been levied on Asahi, ESB and more recently on INTEL, McCarters and SFADCo in respect of schemes providing a sizeable benefit to them.</P>
    <P>The local authority is in discussion with this industry and the IDA at present with a view to agreeing an appropriate capital contribution towards the cost of Macroom water supply scheme.  I am not privy to those discussions, and I would not in any event regard it as appropriate to speculate on them publicly while they are still in progress.  I hope that a mutually satisfactory arrangement can be worked out between the local authority and the company in the near future for the financing of the water scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Creed will appreciate the good reasons for the policy for requiring financial contributions from industry in situations such as that of Macroom.  This policy is designed first to ensure a fair and wider availability of moneys for new schemes within the overall water and sanitary services programme.  Although this programme has received substantial cofinancing from the European Union, and currently stands at its highest ever annual level of some £122 million, it is still incapable of meeting demands at the pace which we would all like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of industrial contributions is designed secondly to ensure equity in the treatment of industrial water users. As I said, many of these have already been required to contribute to the capital cost of water and waste water schemes.  I accept, however, that it would be desirable <Col N="669" /> to bring greater transparency to the matter of industrial contributions.  For this reason, my Department has commissioned ESRI to examine and recommend on a structured system of capital and current contributions from industry to public water supply and waste water services.  The ESRI report is due shortly. Deputy Creed can be assured of my continuing close attention to this important case.</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand some of the intemperate language which Deputy Creed deemed fit to use to describe this scheme and the way in which it is being managed in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important <Col N="670" /> matter once again.  The reported serious threat to all or some of the proposed £70 million in EU funding for the Tallaght Hospital highlights the foolishness of the petulant outbursts by Government Ministers in their negotiations with Commission officials.  We have had the imprudent denunciation last week of Director General, Mr. Landaburu, as a mere civil servant by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  During the débâcle in respect of the £8 billion last year we had the criticism of Regional Affairs Commissioner, Bruce Millan, by very senior figures in Government.</P>
      <P>It now appears that Mr. Millan is having his revenge and is determined to make the Government sweat for every element of the plan.  It would also appear that Mr. Millan, if nothing else, is consistent. He said we would not get £8 billion and we did not.  He sent his officials at an early stage to query elements of the Government's National Development Plan and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, told the House on 23 November last that there was &ldquo;absolutely no basis for the reports in the <i>Irish Independent&rdquo;.</i> It is clear now that those reports were well founded.</P>
      <P>By far the most important project threatened is the Tallaght Hospital. There is no necessity to rehash the painful 14 year history of broken promises to the people of Tallaght, Clondalkin and surrounding areas.  In the aftermath of today's reports we must ask the Minister if construction of the Tallaght Hospital will continue on the same scale, timetable and per contract.  The plan approved by the Minister already scales down the hospital size to 467 beds.  Nobody made an issue of that scaling down as it may make good sense.  However, further scaling down, for example, reducing the 40 in-patient paediatric beds, would be unacceptable.  Any delay in the construction period of 42 months and, more importantly, any tampering with the equipping and commissioning phase of six to nine months would also be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> If the Minister is forced to find some, or all, of the £70 million promised from within his own budget, the problems could arise at commissioning stage.  The last thing the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin need is a repeat of the Beaumont Hospital experience.  It is difficult to believe that the question of whether Tallaght Hospital conformed to European funding parameters is only now being resolved by the Government.  At this late stage it is almost unbelievable that there should be question marks over the future of the hospital as an eligible project.  I presume that European funding parameters continue to rule out funding for a health care project.  I understand the argument for that hospital was made on the basis of local development requirements.  Anyone familiar with the history, infrastructure and actuality of Tallaght will acknowledge the eligibility of the hospital in that context.  Surely all that should have been clarified months ago.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the local residents of the area I ask the Minister to give unequivocal responses to a number of questions. Will Tallaght hospital proceed as per contract, irrespective of how the EU funds row is resolved?  Is there now clarity about the eligibility of this project for European Union funding?  Can the Minister assure the House that a completed Tallaght hospital will not be left lying idle at the end of the construction period? Has the Minister examined the implications for the wider health services if he is obliged to raid his budget to complete the commission of the hospital?</P>
    <P>I accept those questions are directed to the Minister for Health who I understand is in the Seanad.  I avail of the opportunity to congratulate him on the decisive manner in which he grabbed this project by the scruff of the neck.  He signed the contract and work has commenced. <Col N="672" /> However, these are most serious questions that give rise to the same old concern and distress among residents of the area.  I hope the Minister can finally answer those questions tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, who is in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Rabbitte raised this matter as it gives me the opportunity to clarify again the position regarding the Tallaght hospital project.  The contract for building Tallaght hospital was signed on 20 October 1993.  Work on the building has been underway since 29 October 1993 and is on schedule as planned.  The building period is 38 months and a further ten months will be allowed for commissioning.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I wish to assure the House and the people of Tallaght that the project will be completed on schedule and that the new regional hospital will be opened in 1997. The Tallaght hospital board, which includes among its membership our mutual constituency colleagues, Deputies Eamon Walsh and Flood, is actively monitoring the progress of the building operations on a regular basis.  I understand an on-site inspection by the board will be held shortly and if Deputy Rabbitte wishes to join the board at that on-site inspection and, indicates to me that he would like to do so, I will be happy to arrange for him to do so.  I reiterate to the House and to the people of Tallaght that the project will be completed on schedule.  The new Tallaght Regional Hospital will be completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 February 1994.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 9 March 1993 and again on 4 November 1993, any capital city will attract to itself major institutions, administrative, political and cultural.  However, when one considers a richly endowed city such as Dublin, it is important to bear in mind that cultural institutions such as the National Museum and the Irish Museum of Modern Art are national assets rather than local or regional institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that some imbalance exists in the arts infrastructure of the State and in this regard discussions are ongoing <Col N="499" /> between my Department and the Department of the Environment so that both Departments can co-ordinate future planning in this area.  It is, however, important to realise that local authorities will have to play a significant part in addressing any imbalance which may exist in their own areas and I look forward to their co-operation and commitment in this regard.  The Deputies can be assured that the question of establishing and maintaining an equitable regional balance will be one of the issues which will influence any further decisions in this area.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a similar question on 4 November 1993, responsibility for the administration of the present 1 per cent scheme is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  Under the scheme local authorities may include in the capital cost of public works projects, a sum not exceeding 1 per cent of cost or £20,000 whichever is the lower for an appropriate artistic embellishment.  The scheme applies whether or not the project is financed from Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997, there is a commitment requiring local authorities to spend 1 per cent of their budget for capital projects on artistic embellishment. Officials of my Department have to date had a number of meetings with officials of the Department of the Environment regarding the operation of the scheme.  My Department will continue to pursue this important matter with the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the publication last December of the abridged version of the Book of Estimates for 1994, I continued with my efforts to secure increased funding for An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I believe that recent events have shown that I have enjoyed considerable success in my efforts.  The allocation for An Chomhairle Ealaíon was increased by £1 million in the recent budget, giving them an overall increase of 14 per cent in 1994 over their 1993 figure which represents an increase of over 30 per cent in their funding since my appointment.  This was, I believe, a significant achievement under any circumstances.  It is worth pointing out that An Chomhairle's allocation for 1994 not only meets the commitment made in the Programme for a Partnership Government but exceeds it.  The Deputy should be aware that the allocation achieved for An Chomhairle was widely welcomed by many groups and individuals interested in the cultural life of the nation and among those who contacted me to express their appreciation of my efforts were the Chairman and the Director of An Chomhairle itself.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 22 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy are the day to day responsibility of the RTE Authority and I have no statutory function in these matters.  In accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of the national broadcasting services.  In this regard RTE has advised me that reception in the Leenane area has improved in recent months but that some technical alterations have yet to be completed.  With regard to the Maam area RTE advises that its survey identified the need for two lower power transposers. The performance of these transposers could be adversely affected if the technical modifications at Leenane are not carried out.  The necessary planning and preparatory work is continuing, however, in respect of the masts and buildings required for the project.</P>

      <P>No additional staff are being appointed to the National Museum arising from the provisions of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993.

      <P>However, I should say that I believe the National Museum to have been under-resourced on both the staffing and financial fronts down through the years. I am at present formulating legislation to establish autonomous boards for both the National Museum and the National Library and I have recently circulated proposals to my Cabinet colleagues for comment.  I hope to be bringing my proposals to Government at an early date.</P>
      <P>I will also be establishing an interim board for the National Museum at an early date to advise me on a number of urgently critical issues facing the museum, including staff numbers and structures for the future.  In conjunction with these developments, I would hope to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, for staff levels and structures in the museum that are commensurate with the role of a national institution of such importance.</P>

      <P>I have no such plans.  Under existing legislation it is <Col N="507" /> not possible to do as the Deputy suggests. Under section 4 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, it is the function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange for the provision of a television service additional to those provided by RTE.  The demands that will be placed on the independent television production sector by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, and the advent of Teilifís na Gaeilge will be significant and I intend to see how the sector meets these demands before considering any new initiatives in this area.</P>

      <P>International music publishing would not qualify for the 10 per cent rate in the IFSC because it is not a financial service, nor a service ancillary to a financial service. However, it could qualify for the 10 per cent rate in the Shannon Airport zone if the relevant conditions, particularly in relation to employment, contribution to the use and development of the zone, etc. are met, and an operating licence has been granted by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.

      <P>Section 10 of the 1991 Finance Act increased from £2,000 to £3,000 for a fiveyear lease and to £4,000 for a sevenyear lease the exemption from income tax available under section 10 of the Finance Act, 1985, to lessors of agricultural land who are aged 55 years or over or who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming. As an anti-avoidance measure, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; as defined was intended to exclude from relief, leases made between closely connected relatives. The question of &ldquo;connection&rdquo; is <Col N="510" /> determined by reference to section 16 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, which is the standard test for &ldquo;connection&rdquo; for income tax purposes.  A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife.  A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant.  Without this restriction the relief would be open to manipulation, with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by the lessee.</P>
      <P>The EU early retirement scheme for farmers, recently launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will provide payments to full-time farmers between 55-65 who retire from farming definitely and transfer their farms by gift, lease or sale to other farmers.  It should not be necessary to provide an income tax incentive as well to encourage such land transfers between family members especially one which is open to abuse as mentioned above.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992 all vehicles in the State, unless subject to an exemption, must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners and the appropriate vehicle registration tax &mdash; VRT &mdash; paid.  Exemption from payment of VRT is permitted in a number of specific circumstances, including transfer of <Col N="511" /> residence.  On importing a foreign registered car a person who is normally resident in the State must report to a Vehicle Registration Office within one working day to register the car.  The car will be examined by a Revenue Official to determine its value and the VRT due.  It is an offence to be in possession of an unregistered car and to fail to pay the VRT due.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned was observed by officers of Customs and Excise on 9 February 1994 driving a United Kingdom registered car.  It was established that the driver is normally resident in the State and that he had imported the car in 1993.  As he was not entitled to be in possession of an unregistered car, and was not entitled to an exemption from payment of VRT, the car was seized.  It was released to him on payment of a compromise sum of £700, in lieu of prosecution.  The car was released on condition that the car be registered and VRT paid, or removed permanently from the State, before 25 February 1994.  The Revenue Commissioners are prepared to extend this time limit to 11 March 1994.</P>
      <P>The fact that the car in question is owned by a UK leasing company does not affect its liability to registration here if used in the State by a State resident.  I am informed, however, that it is an express condition of the leasing agreement in this case that the car should not be removed from the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, under EU VAT law, which, in turn, governs Irish VAT law, golf facilities which are being provided in the course or furtherance of business are properly liable to VAT and there can be no question of exempting them from the tax; on the other hand, golf clubs established on a non-profit making basis, for the benefit of their members, can be exempted from VAT.</P>
      <P>The provision, on a commercial basis, of facilities for taking part in sporting activities became liable to VAT at the 12.5 per cent from 1 July 1992.  Prior to that date, the position was quite confused. The provision of certain sporting facilities, including golf courses, has been treated as exempt, while the standard rate applied in other cases.  However, all sporting facilities provided as part of a hotel operation were liable to VAT at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>This treatment of commercial entities could not have been allowed to continue, as it was contrary to EU rules and created distortions of competition between sporting facilities provided by hotels which were taxable and similar facilities provided by other commercial operators which were exempt.  The distortion had become very pronounced because of the trends in the commercial sector over the last few years.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of proprietor-owned clubs being at a disadvantage as compared to member-owned clubs, I wish to advise the Deputy that this issue was considered recently by the Government on foot of a study undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, following representations from the proprietor-owned clubs.  While I accept that there is, inevitably, some competition between taxable and non-taxable entities, I am not convinced that, as matters stand, distortion of competition arises between them to a sufficient extent or on a wide enough scale to warrant changing the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that VAT-registered golf courses are entitled to recover, in full, the VAT borne on the development and maintenance of their facilities and <Col N="513" /> on-going running costs.  Exempt golf facilities are not.  This situation should be reflected in the membership and green fees charged: while the commercial operations must charge 12.5 per cent VAT, the exempt clubs have to set their fees at a level which, inter alia, takes account of overheads including the irrecoverable input VAT.  Thus, VAT is reflected in the fees charged by both types of clubs, albeit in different ways.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that application of the reduced rate, combined with deductibility, should ensure that any price differences, which might arise because of differential taxable status in relation to services provided, are kept to a minimum.  Moreover, within the golf sector, the prices charged for services vary substantially.  Accordingly, it is difficult to demonstrate that, in practice, taxable status makes any significant difference to the prices charged.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the circumstances of many crewmen on fishing boats around the country who find that they are getting virtually no income for many months due to bad weather and at the same time are not able to qualify for unemployment assistance because of earnings assessed on previous fishing activity which is now classified as self-employed; and if he will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in County Cork and ensure that the appeal against the refusal to pay him unemployment assistance is disposed of straight away on the basis that he has no income at present rather than on the basis of earnings which he achieved a year ago.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, share fishermen were regarded as employees for social insurance purposes and as such were insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  Their insurability status changed however following certain court decisions to do with the owners of fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence, share fishermen could no longer be regarded as employees for social insurance purposes in the absence of a contract of service. They then became insured as self-employed <Col N="516" /> people and as such are covered for Widow's and Orphan's and Old Age (Contributory) Pensions.  They no longer had cover for unemployment and illness.</P>
    <P>Following on the decision of the High Court, I met with representatives of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation (IFO) and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (KFO) to discuss their concerns regarding the absence of cover for short term benefits.  Share fishermen are in a unique position in so far as social insurance is concerned.  Prior to the court decision in 1992, they were always insured as employees and thereby entitled to the full range of social insurance payments.  Through no fault of their own and without any change in the way in which their work is organised, they ceased to be so insured.  The harsh nature of Irish weather conditions for fishing and local tie up arrangements and quotas leave share fishermen open to enforced periods of unemployment at certain times of the year.  The difficult conditions under which they work also expose them to increased risks of illness. In the light of these considerations I introduced legislation in the form of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993 to provide share fishermen with this vital cover.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation, people whose principal means of livelihood is derived from share fishing now have the option of paying additional special contributions, if they have income of at least £2,500 per year.  Share fishermen who opt into the new scheme will pay special contributions.  These contributions will amount to 5 per cent of their income in the previous income tax year.</P>
    <P>Contributions will be payable up to the PRSI earnings ceiling, currently set at £20,000 per year.  A minimum annual contribution of £250 will apply.  For these contributions, share fishermen will get disability benefit for up to 12 months in any continuous period of illness and unemployment benefit for up to 13 weeks in any one year.</P>
    <P>The new optional contributions will be payable from the income tax year commencing 6 April 1994 and will bring the share fishermen into benefit from <Col N="517" /> Janaury 1996.  I have also made a special arrangement within the scheme so that share fishermen who apply to my Department before the end of June may pay their PRSI contribution in respect of the 1993-94 tax year, thereby bringing forward their benefit cover to January 1995.</P>
    <P>For unemployment assistance purposes share fishermen are treated as self-employed and their net earnings are assessable as means.  Details of a person's earnings in the previous year provides a reference or starting point for the assessment of means for self-employed persons such as share fishermen.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, following investigation, the person concerned was assessed by a deciding officer with means of £169 per week with effect from 5 May 1993.  The means assessed were derived from his self-employment as a share fisherman.  As this level of means exceeds the maximum rate payable in his case, he is not entitled to payment.  This decision was upheld by an independent appeals officer in September 1993.</P>
    <P>The person concerned made a further application for Unemployment Assistance on 9 December 1993.  His circumstances were reviewed and his means were again assessed at £169 per week, again based on his most recent level of earnings.  He appealed the decision of the deciding officer on 16 February 1994 and his case has been referred to the Social Welfare Officer for reassessment of his means before referral to the independent appeals officer.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Marine has drawn attention to the difficulties experienced by fishermen at present and has indicated that he is pursuing the possibilities for assistance through a number of avenues including the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have received a copy of the Law Society's report entitled &ldquo;The Case Against Capping Compensation Levels in Personal Injury Actions&rdquo;.  I note that the report claims that one of the principal reasons for the higher level of fatalities and serious personal injuries here as compared to the United Kingdom is the stricter enforcement of road traffic regulations in the UK, particularly with regard to speeding and drink-related offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the enforcement <Col N="519" /> of road traffic laws is less strict here than in Britain, especially with regard to the offences mentioned above.  On the contrary, I can assure the Deputy that there is an ongoing and rigorous enforcement of road traffic laws by the gardaí with particular emphasis on drink driving, speeding and reckless driving.  Indeed, the welcome and widely-noted change in social attitudes with respect to drunken driving is a direct result of intensified Garda enforcement of the road traffic laws.  As regards speeding, I note from the Garda Commissioner's Annual Report for 1992 (the last year for which figures are available) that there were 30,327 prosecutions during that year. This works out at over 580 prosecutions for speeding every single week of the year.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have seen to it that the gardaí have the necessary resources, in personnel and equipment, to carry on with this important life-saving task.  In particular, I am determined that the gardaí are in a position to take full advantage of modern technological developments to assist them in this vital area of law enforcement.</P>

      <P>In the time available, the Companies Office is not in a position to provide the statistics sought.  I have asked that the information, when compiled, be conveyed as soon as possible to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Information on enforcement action is available in the series of Companies Reports in the Dáil Library.  The latest relates to the period to June 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since June 1993, the Companies Office prosecuted, for the first time, 40 company directors.  In the calendar year 1993, the courts imposed financial penalties amounting to £1.3 million on 2,000 companies for failure to comply with the Companies Acts.  So far in 1994, fines amounting to some £300,000 have been imposed.  Between now and July 1994, <Col N="521" /> the office is scheduled to be in court on 12 occasions in pursuit of individual directors and companies which do not meet their filing obligations.  On 28 February 1994, 200 companies will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;late filing fee&rdquo; which I introduced by Order last year, and about which a publicity campaign was mounted, resulted in many companies bringing their annual returns up-to-date in the run-up to the October 1993 Bank Holiday weekend.  Some 30,000 returns were lodged in that period in respect of 10,000 companies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this enforcement action is creating a climate of increased awareness of the statutory filing obligations on registered companies.</P>

      <P>A report of October 1993 by Coopers and Lybrand on private motor insurance costs and cover in Ireland and the United Kingdom states that the insurance industry put forward nine reasons, which are not exclusive, including the road system and its maintenance, for the differential in insurance rates between this country and the UK.  The analysis of fatal and injury accidents by possible contributory factor which is contained in the Road Accident Facts, 1992, published by the former environmental research unit, does not support the claim that road condition is the principal factor in such accidents here.</P>
      <P>In terms of the level of road safety generally, the record of this country compares favourably with other EU member states.  The UK has one of the best road safety records in Europe.  The National Development Plan provides for continued substantial investment in upgrading the network of roads, both national and non-national, which will contribute to safer driving conditions generally.</P>

      <P>Earlier this month the French authorities asked the Commission to reestablish for 1994 the minimum import prices which had been introduced in 1993 for certain species of fish and to introduce minimum import prices for certain other <Col N="527" /> species.  The minimum import prices had been introduced early last year to counteract instability caused by the dumping of third country fish on Community markets at that time.</P>
      <P>At the last Council of Ministers meeting in December, 1993 I proposed, in the light of the continuing weakness of the Community fisheries market and the likelihood that the instability experienced in early 1993 was going to be repeated this year, that minimum import prices should be retained for as long as their need was demonstrated.  It is in this context that, when asked for our views, Ireland fully supported the recent French request.</P>

A person found guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the nurturing of an interest in arts and culture among young people to be of primary importance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I was delighted to launch in 1993 the &ldquo;Making Youth Arts Work&rdquo; report &mdash; a report prepared by An Comhairle Ealaíon. Arising from the recommendations of that report, An Chomhairle has allocated an additional £40,000 of its Education Budget to facilitate the appointment of Youth Arts Development Officers in the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Dance Council of Ireland, the National Association of Youth Drama and Music Base.  An Chomhairle has also established a working party with the Youth Affairs Section of the Department of Education in order to progress the implementation of all the recommendations of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I have asked An Comhairle Ealaíon to prepare a Three-Year Plan for the Arts in Ireland and as part of that report I look forward to receiving their analysis as to how best to assist the development of Youth Arts.  An Chomhairle is already doing good work in this area and in addition to its back up services and advice <Col N="545" /> it provided grants amounting to £71,600 in 1991 and £84,800 in 1992 to groups working in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 to 127, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I understand that An Chomhairle Ealaíon has budgeted to expend £4.5 million on Drama in 1994.  Of that amount some £2.173 million will be absorbed by the grant to the National Theatre Society (Abbey and Peacock Theatres).</P>
      <P>An Chomhairle is currently addressing the allocation of the remainder of its drama budget and it is anticipated that decisions will be made in the coming months in response to applications.  An Chomhairle believes that at the end of this process there will be a virtual 50:50 allocation as between theatres, theatre companies and theatre events in Dublin and the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, therefore, when the special <Col N="546" /> case of the Abbey Theatre is excluded, there is a considerable degree of equality and balance between the expenditure by An Chomhairle in Dublin and in the rest of the country.  As Structural Funds become available, the Deputy can be assured that the need to establish and maintain an equitable balance between the regions and the capital will be addressed.</P>
    <P>I agree that the theatre scene in Ireland has indeed changed dramatically over the last 20 years and I believe that the standing and quality is extraordinarily high at the moment.  The changes are characterised most significantly by the very welcome emergence of a number of professional theatre companies based in regional centres outside Dublin, the number of new performance venues and arts centres established by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, by the emergence of many fine dramatists and by the scale and range of touring by professional companies throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The theatre scene in Dublin has become much wider and more varied in the 20 years.  The work of the Abbey and of the Gate and the Dublin Theatre Festival continue to make an important contribution to the fabric of theatre in our capital city and throughout the country. In addition, many new young production companies have emerged, creating job opportunities and refreshing the repertoire.</P>
    <P>With regard to the work of the National Theatre Company, I am already on record as acknowledging its work as the primary cultural agency for the promotion of Irish theatre and the work of Irish playwrights.  I am committed to ensuring that the National Theatre continues to receive adequate funding and support to maintain and develop its important role in the cultural life of the nation.  I see no dichotomy or contradiction between this policy and a policy aimed at the development of &ldquo;local theatrical initiatives&rdquo;.  Indeed, I believe that this simultaneous promotion of the national and the local will prove to be the most fruitful.  Rather than developing at each other's expense, I believe they will <Col N="547" /> support, complement and inspire each other.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the Southern Health Board has any plans to extend the present agreement for hip replacement surgery with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.</P>
      <P>With regard to orthopaedic facilities generally in Cork, the Deputy will be aware that last year I approved the filling of a fifth orthopaedic surgeon post in Cork on a permanent basis.  Approval was also given to the Southern Health Board in 1992 to provide new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher.  Building work on the project is expected to be completed by September of this year. Because of the phasing of the building work, the Board anticipate that hip replacement operations will recommence at the end of May.  In the interim, all orthopaedic procedures with the exception of joint replacements are being carried out at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the fifth consultant post and new clean air theatre facilities will significantly enhance the service for orthopaedic patients in Cork.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,187 candidates took music as a subject in the leaving certificate examinations in June 1993.  This represents an increase of approximately 13 per cent on the previous year.  A total of 8,941 candidates, which represents an increase of approximately 2 per cent took music as a subject in the junior certificate examination in 1993.</P>
      <P>However, these numbers are not as high as I would wish them to be.  In particular I am concerned at the low take-up of the subject by boys.</P>
      <P>The new junior certificate syllabus in music will be examined for the first time in 1994.  It is intended to encourage creative involvement and to enhance pupils' capacity to enjoy music in all its aspects.  It is hoped that it will make the subject more appealing to both boys and girls.</P>
      <P>At leaving certificate level the new course in music which is at an advanced stage of planning will provide progression for the new junior certificate syllabus.  It will take into account recent developments and modern techniques and approaches in music education.</P>
      <P>The course is designed to increase the participation rate in leaving certificate music.  It will also stress provision of realistic attainment targets and assessment criteria.</P>
