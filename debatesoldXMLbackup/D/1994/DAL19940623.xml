      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the escalating crisis facing TEAM Aer Lingus following the laying off of more than 800 workers yesterday, the increasing danger of the dispute spreading to Aer Lingus itself and the need for the Government to clarify its position in view of the clear differences between the Government parties on the approach to be adopted and the urgent necessity of Government intervention to try to secure a settlement of the crisis.  In view of the importance of this matter to the national economy and in particular to the economy of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Agency (Extension of Powers) Order, 1994.</P>
      <P>a copy of which order in draft was laid before the Dáil on 21st June, 1994.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (Extension of Powers) Order, 1994, laid in draft before this House is designed to extend to the agency in relation to licensed activities, a number of the enforcement powers already available to local authorities under air and water pollution legislation.  The agency already has extensive enforcement powers under its own legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, in respect of the integrated pollution control licences which it will issue.  This order will supplement and complement those powers; it will give the agency a wider framework of action in relation to licensed activities as envisaged under sections 100 and 101 of the Act.</P>
      <P>I would like to place today's draft order in context for the House.  Last April I made regulations providing for the commencement of integrated pollution control licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The licensing regulations provide that new activities in eight of the 13 classes of activity scheduled in the Environmental Protection Agency Act require integrated licences from the Environmental Protection Agency on or after 16 May 1994.  Classes of new activity for which Environmental Protection Agency licences are now required include chemicals, minerals, energy, food and drink, waste, wood, paper, textiles and leather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> In April last, I also made an order identifying large-scale manufacture of pesticides, pharmaceutical or veterinary products, and the incineration of hazardous waste as the first priorities among established activities to be subject to Environmental Protection Agency control from 1 September 1994.  I intend that new activities in the remaining classes scheduled in the Act, and existing activities in all classes, will be phased into the Environmental Protection Agency licensing system on a progressive basis. In the initial phases of licensing, I am satisfied that a focused approach is the right one, so that the anticipated level of activity matches the build-up of Environmental Protection Agency competences in this complex area, and that there will be no delays in processing new licence applications.  It is my intention to closely monitor the early performance of the licensing system and the capacity of the agency to deal with further categories of activity.</P>
    <P>Since formal establishment of the agency in July 1993 considerable progress has been made in building up its organisational capacity.  The agency now has 102 staff based in its temporary headquarters in Wexford, Dublin and other regions.  In 1994 it had a budget of £4.4 million, exclusive of any licence fee income, for its day to day operation. There is a substantial body of work underway in the four divisions of the organisation.  In addition to the range of functions previously undertaken by the Environmental Research Unit, the agency has, for example, commenced preparation of a state of the environment report with a view to publication of a full report next year.  It has also advanced preparation of national hydrometric and environmental monitoring programmes and of guidelines for local authorities in relation to sewage treatment and landfill sites.  Data have already been published in respect of drinking water and river water quality.  With the start-up of licensing, the development of monitoring systems and advisory services, its liaison with the newly established European Environmental Agency, and its obligations <Col N="574" /> to provide public access to environmental information, the agency will place particular emphasis on establishment of environmental data bases.</P>
    <P>Integrated pollution control licensing has introduced a new concept into Irish environmental management.  It goes beyond the traditional framework of pollution control by providing for one licence to cover air, water, waste and noise.  Recognising the interdependence of environmental media, IPC licensing seeks to prevent or solve pollution problems without transferring them from one medium to another.  In carrying out its licensing and other functions the agency must have regard to the need to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development, the need for precaution in relation to the potentially harmful effects of emissions, the polluter pays principle and the balance to be achieved between environmental protection and economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act and the licensing regulations make comprehensive and detailed provision for licence application and review procedures; substantial work has been undertaken by the agency to facilitate a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework.  The agency will license activities on the basis that best available technology not entailing excessive cost &mdash; BATNEEC &mdash; will be used to prevent or eliminate, or where that is not practicable, to limit, abate or reduce emissions. In defining BATNEEC, pollution prevention techniques, including cleaner technologies and waste minimisation, are emphasised, rather than end of pipe treatment.  BATNEEC notes are being prepared and will be published by the agency to provide guidance to license applicants and other interested parties. Draft notes for the chemical, waste and energy sectors have already been widely circulated by the agency for comment.  A guide to the implementation and enforcement of IPC licensing has been published and the agency is now holding regional seminars at six locations to promote a clear understanding and appreciation of its licensing function.  A small number of <Col N="575" /> licence applications which had been with local authorities at the commencement date of 16 May have been transferred to the agency and pre-application discussions have been held with 19 companies.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency already has significant enforcement powers in respect of new and existing licences held by established activities in the transitional period from the date of application to the agency until a licence is granted.  In effect, when an established activity becomes licensable, the agency takes over responsibility for the enforcement of current air and water licences or waste permits held by that activity.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of ensuring that existing licence or permit conditions are met in the transitional period between the application for, and the granting of an IPC licence, relevant enforcement provisions of air, water and waste legislation were already extended to the agency under the licensing regulations.</P>
    <P>Once a licence is granted by the agency, the conditions of the licence are fully enforceable by the agency.  Deputies will be aware that the Act grants very extensive discretion to the agency in regard to the kind of conditions which may be attached to a licence, and that failure to comply with any condition is an offence under the Act.  The legal processes already available to the agency under the Act to pursue non-compliance include summary prosecution or indictment; conviction on indictment carries heavy penalties &mdash; a fine of up to £10 million, or imprisonment for up to ten years or both fine and imprisonment.  The agency has made clear that a strong and active policy will be adopted in relation to enforcement of licence conditions, with pursuit of legal processes where clear breaches occur.</P>
    <P>Access to relevant pollution control provision of the air and water pollution acts, as provided for under the draft order now before the House, will strengthen and extend the enforcement powers of the agency in relation to licensed activities.  I have brought forward the order so that <Col N="576" /> the agency can act, if necessary, within the wider context of air and water pollution legislation as soon as it has issued its first IPC licence.</P>
    <P>The powers being extended to the agency include application to the High Court for an order requiring the prohibition, termination or reduction of a discharge or emission, and in the event of non-compliance, the agency may undertake the actions specified in the court order and recover its costs from the offender; the service of notices specifying the measures, and the periods within which they shall be undertaken, necessary to prevent air or water pollution; prosecution of offences under general prohibitions on air and water pollution that is from emissions or circumstances not dealt with in the integrated licence; entry, inspection, monitoring, the gathering of information and prosecutions for the purposes of the proposed extended powers and the recovery of the agency's costs of taking proceedings and the payment of fines to the agency in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>This proposed comprehensive package of enforcement powers, together with the substantial powers and penalties already contained in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, will complete the process in providing the agency with the teeth necessary to carry out its functions effectively under any circumstances.  I strongly commend the resolution approving of the Draft Order to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything that can be done to prevent air or water pollution should be supported.  I have no difficulty in supporting these regulations.  The perception some years ago was that measures to create a clean environment were anti-business.  That has changed and people are aware it is possible to have good sound development while at the same time protecting the environment. Business and industry have responsibility to the rest of society to ensure we have a clean environment to pass onto future generations and have accepted that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the powers vested in the Environmental <Col N="577" /> Protection Agency will not have to be used very often.  The best way to deal with environmental problems is to create awareness so that people become more conscious that what they do in their daily lives affects the environment.  We do not have the right to pass onto the next generation an unpleasant environment that will damage their health. We all share the responsibility of ensuring that those who break the law are dealt with effectively and speedily.  The transfer of powers from the local authorities to the Environmental Protection Agency under those regulations will make it more efficient to control emissions, stop water pollution and impose restrictions that will put an end to continuing pollution.  Whether the local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency does that is irrelevant, provided it is done.  I hope there will be no confusion of roles and local authorities will be aware of the role they must play. It is important that the Minister outline clearly to local authorities where their responsibilities lie so that the job can be done in a cost effective and efficient way.</P>
    <P>I hope these new measures will not impose unnecessary additional costs.  If we educate people about air and water pollution, there should not be a need to spend a great deal of money on enforcement of the regulations.  Unfortunately, we would not be living in the real world if we expected that to happen.  A great deal of work is being done in primary schools to make children aware of their environment and how it can be damaged so easily.  What is being taught to children is making my generation far more aware of the environment.  It is through our young people that everybody will be encouraged to be more aware of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to noise pollution, a problem I have raised for several years.  People affected by noise pollution complain to their public representatives that loud music late into the night and early morning disturbs small children and old people who then cannot sleep.  Noise pollution damages our environment and I am pleased that regulations to stop this <Col N="578" /> pollution are being introduced to make it easier to ensure that those who continue to cause noise problems which disrupt and upset the rest of the community cease their activities so that people can live in peace.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Noise pollution is as bad as other forms of pollution and should be tackled quickly and effectively.  Nobody wants to be a killjoy and if someone has the odd party at home, their neighbours will understand if they explain there will be some noise for a couple of hours, but it is the continuing intimidation by loud music every night that can make life absolute misery.  People come to me looking for transfers from local authority housing estates because the consistent level of noise by the person living beside them causes them hardship.</P>
    <P>Noise pollution from road traffic is a problem we can control.  We are investing money in building motorways, bypasses and so on but to date very little account has been taken of the noise pollution emanating from the traffic using these motorways, particularly when they are near urban dwellings.  For several years I have been highlighting the problems caused by the Shankill bypass which was built very close to some local houses. The lives of the people living in those houses have been transformed.  Where they once lived in peace and harmony, they now have vast volumes of traffic passing by their doors day in and out.</P>
    <P>If we build these types of roads we have an obligation to ensure noise pollution is not generated by the volumes of traffic. Clear and acceptable standards should be set down by way of regulation to which the local authorities or the National Roads Authority would have to adhere.  There is little point in saying that we follow the British guidelines.  We are quite capable of deciding a level of noise that is acceptable and will not disrupt people's lives and we must force the relevant authorities to adhere to those standards.  In regard to the people who are suffering at present, very little funding should be required to take appropriate steps, such as installing double glazing, in order to <Col N="579" /> make life more tolerable for them.  We must not forget those who are suffering from noise pollution at present while we are considering those who may suffer from it in the future.</P>
    <P>I support these regulations.  I hope they will make the whole process of eliminating pollution easier and more efficient.  I hope the powers will not have to be used often and that we will succeed in what we are trying to achieve, namely, educating people to respect the world we live in so that we will not have to employ armies of inspectors to prevent people dumping into our rivers, lakes and seas as well as polluting our air.  If we can eliminate that we will have succeeded.</P>
    <P>We must get the message across to the business community that these types of measures are not anti-business.  We can have good, clean industry as well as a pollution free environment.  Modern technology has ensured that industrial development can take place in harmony with a clean environment.  It is not anti-business to suggest ways and means of protecting our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important measure.  There is no doubt that our clean, green, natural environment is our great national heritage.  The present generation is fortunate that industrial development is taking place in this country in a more enlightened age.  We have seen the ravaging of the environment in other countries throughout Europe and other parts of the world due to industrial development in an unenlightened age. This generation and future generations have a great obligation to protect Ireland's natural environment.  Fortunately, the value of the environment from the point of view of the economy is now understood and more appreciated than was the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be extremely vigilant at all times to ensure that mistakes are never made.  It will be too late if mistakes have to be corrected subsequently; we must ensure they are not made at the outset. The whole purpose in establishing the Environmental Protection Agency was to <Col N="580" /> have one national body that would have full power and authority to protect our environment from improper development and be in a position to take immediate action to deal with any interference with the environment, by way of air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution or in any other way.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is an expert and competent body which has the ability to deal with environmental protection.  Prior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency there was a lack of public confidence in the existing mechanism to enforce environmental control and protection. The number of local authorities &mdash; more than 30 &mdash; who had responsibility for control divided among them meant that none of them could have the competence to deal with complex developments.</P>
    <P>The function of the Environmental Protection Agency, as established by the House, is to license, control and monitor key activities including chemical and pharmaceutical production, intensive agriculture, the production of food and drink, incineration of waste, the production of iron and steel, the manufacture of paper pulp and many other activities in that sphere.  The agency was given the power by this House to grant an integrated licence for all activities within this area and the Minister referred to that in his speech.  As the Environmental Protection Agency is a new agency, power is being given to it on a phased basis and we accept that.  Many people would perhaps wish to see the agency proceed more rapidly in establishing itself firmly and taking on all the functions provided for in the Act.</P>
    <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, each new development requires the positive affirmation of the Dáil and Seanad.  That is not always a feature of Dáil legislation.  When the former Minister of State brought the Bill before the House she deliberately constructed it in such a way to ensure that no future Government could alter the functions of the agency or change its remit without the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is why <Col N="581" /> the present Minister of State is seeking an affirmation of the extension of these powers.  That is appropriate and I believe the House will be willing to give its approval.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the orders for debate is to transfer the licensing functions from local authorities to the Environmental Protection Agency.  My party welcomes this move.  Some questions need to be asked, however, about the Government's commitment to the development of the role of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Minister stated in his contribution that only £4.4 million has been provided in the 1994 Estimates to enable the agency carry out its functions and that it now has a staff of 102.  I am advised that in 1989 the agency estimated its requirements at approximately £8 million. In the light of that, the £4.4 million would appear to be a very small sum compared to the agency's anticipated requirements as far back as 1989.  I do not know whether the Minister can give an adequate assurance to the House that this agency is being properly funded and staffed by the Government in order to enable it carry out its functions in the most efficient and rigorous fashion.</P>
    <P>There was a demand from the public for the Environmental Protection Agency to be the champion in protection the environment and have all the resources necessary to exercise its powers.  The Environmental Protection Agency is not fully operational and it would be premature to pass judgment on it although we have high hopes that it will become an environmental watchdog. Much of the pollution emanates from public bodies and local authorities are serious offenders in many cases.  Malfunctioning machinery emits poisonous smoke into the atmosphere and there are illegal smoke emissions from health board furnaces.  The public are dubious about the genuineness of public bodies tackling this issue.  Is the agency properly funded?</P>
    <P>The great test for the Environmental Protection Agency is whether it is prepared to take on public bodies and prosecute them for their offences.  If it does <Col N="582" /> the public will have greater confidence in it.  I have no doubt that, given the resources, the Environmental Protection Agency will become the champion of the environment.</P>
    <P>A decision was taken that the agency will be decentralised and located at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  The State is required to maintain Johnstown House.  Teagasc previously occupied the site but no longer has the manpower to maintain the house.  The State decided to build a new premises for the Environmental Protection Agency in the grounds in spite of the cost of maintaining the house.  How is this expenditure justified? The Environmental Protection Agency board is meeting in Dublin and is based there.  Where will the board meet when the premises are ready?  Is it a question of half-hearted decentralisation?  The Minister of State is from Wexford and I hope he will ensure the commitment is honoured.</P>
    <P>I understand that almost all the members of the board work in the public sector.  I mention that because I said earlier the public sector is often the biggest polluter.  Is there a need for the private sector to be more strongly represented on the board?  The annual report has not yet been published.  What is the statutory requirement in that regard?  When will it be published?</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned vehicles causing air pollution.  A parliamentary question was put down by a member of my party on Tuesday, 21 June asking the Minister for the Environment: &ldquo;if, in view of the fact that bus exhaust emissions are a serious contributor to pollution in our cities, the regulations, if any, that are in place, in line with our European obligations under Directive 93/59/EEC, to introduce measures against air pollution by motor vehicle emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.  The Minister replied that Directive 93/59/EEC specifies analogous air pollution standards for new light commercial vehicles including some minibuses with effect from 1 October 1994. <Col N="583" /> Will the Minister assure us that the regulations will be in operation by that time?</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh ar ordú seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní féidir liom ach fáilte a chur roimh an reachtaíocht seo, ach ní dóigh liom gur leor é sin a rá.  Is beag seans a bhí ag Teachtaí ó tháinig an Rialtas isteach, ceist an Environmental Protection Agency a phlé, agus is áthas liom an deis sin a bheith againn anois.  Ag an am céanna feicim nach bhfuil mórán suime ag Comhaltaí eile sa cheist mar nach bhfuil ach mé féin agus an tAire agus a chomhleacaí anseo.  Pé scéal é, tá pointí áirithe agam le díriú ar an Aire agus a pháirtí.</P>
      <P>The Minister may remember that An Foras Forbartha, which did a credible job, was axed suddenly in 1987.  Fianna Fáil has been in the dock since then as far as its motives in the area of environmental protection are concened.  It has been a long court case.  For many of us, 1987 is a faded memory and for others, like the young people in the Public Gallery, it is not even a memory.</P>
      <P>An Foras Forbartha was abolished against the advice of the Departments of Environment and Finance.  A great deal of expertise was lost, as was the library, which I made great use of at the time. Does the Minister regret that decision? The Environmental Protection Agency has a lot to live up to.  There was considerable anger expressed at the time and Deputy Quinn described the decision as incredibly stupid and short-sighted. Unfortunately the Progressive Democrats described it as encouraging but that was before I beat Deputy Harney in the European elections in 1989.</P>
      <P>It was announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would come into being during the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government and was heralded as being far more than a PR exercise.  It was to restore public confidence in environmental legislation.  I hope it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Question Time last Tuesday the reply to a question about what progress was made since the Hickson fire last <Col N="584" /> August did not inspire confidence. Eleven recommendations were made but no action was taken apart from ongoing reviews.  &ldquo;Reviews&rdquo; are a euphemism for doing nothing.  The Hickson fire will be the acid test in determining the effectiveness of the agency.</P>
    <P>The order to extend the power of the Environmental Protection Agency is not very radical in terms of improving the situation.  Both the county councils and the Environmental Protection Agency are suffering from an identity crisis in this area.  I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency intends to take on board the pollution control and regulatory functions of the county councils.  I would sound a note of caution in this regard as, difficult as it may be to believe when one sees what they are capable of doing in other areas, the county councils have a good deal of expertise in this area. There are some very good people in county councils working on pollution control with very few resources &mdash; they do not even have mobile phones on which they can be contacted when they are out of their offices &mdash; and endeavouring to keep up with the job they have to do.  By virtue of their size and functions, county councils can be the worst polluters, yet the Environmental Protection Agency, the acknowledged experts in environmental protection, cannot take them to court or suggest any changes to the Government.</P>
    <P>Another bugbear is that the Environmental Protection Agency does not have any substantial input into the measures to deal with noise pollution.  My predecessor, Roger Garland, tabled amendments on this problem when the Bill was being debated in the House.  There was an ongoing dispute at that time between the residents of St. Margaret's, which is to the west of Swords, and Dublin Airport about noise pollution.  This major problem needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has been heralded as a great new organisation, and I hope it lives up to its reputation. However, when compared with An Foras Forbartha, it is both under-funded and understaffed.  The agency will <Col N="585" /> find it very difficult to live up to its reputation if it is not given more funding and staff.  During the mid-eighties An Foras Forbartha had a budget of £5.5 million and a staff of 200.  The Minister proudly announced today that the Environmental Protection Agency would have a staff of 102 and a budget of £4.4 million.  The agency cannot be expected to achieve more than An Foras Forbartha if it has a smaller budget and fewer staff.  The expectations for the agency are somewhat over-optimistic and I would urge the Government to take a realistic look at the situation before it heralds the agency, a recycled An Foras Forbartha with, on the basis of figures, much less potential, as a wonderful new invention. For the sake of the environment and future generations I hope I am proven wrong in this respect.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a chur in iúl don Aire atá ag titim amach i dtíortha eile.  On the question of noise pollution, Schipol airport in the Netherlands is very aware of its environmental responsibilities and is governed by laws in that regard; it does not adopt an end of the pipeline approach.  The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is very worthy but we should be seeking to avoid this through the establishment of an integrated management production chain for agriculture and industry.  The brief of the Environmental Protection Agency should be widened so that it can advise on planning and help cut the distance between work and home, so to speak, another enormous contributor to environmental degradation.  It should also be able to make recommendations on road pricing and fare reductions, thereby increasing the use of public transport by the public.  Every year 30,000 houses in the Netherlands are insulated in an effort to reduce energy use and it is proposed by the year 2000 that 50 per cent of its organic waste will be converted to compost, thus avoiding landfill problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister should broaden the brief of the Environmental Protection Agency so that it can make recommendations to Government on issues of policy.  The Minister should not regard this as a final <Col N="586" /> measure but rather as a long overdue move in making the Environmental Protection Agency as effective as An Foras Forbartha, which is sadly missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the additional powers being given to the Environmental Protection Agency.  As a Cork Deputy, I am very conscious of the very strong pharmaceutical base in Cork, a major source of employment which gives very meaningful wages to its employees.  This is not to say I am not conscious of the necessity to be very vigilant in licensing and monitoring the industry.  The Environmental Protection Agency has an open door policy with the public and is fair in its dealing with both the public and industry.  It is in the interests of an industry which has taken a major bashing in recent years to ensure that it complies properly with the laws and regulations, and a genuine attempt is being made throughout the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that this is done.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the decision to decentralise the Environmental Protection Agency but regret that no centre has been located in Cork.  It is necessary to have regional centres and I strongly urge the Minister to consider siting a regional centre in the extremely well equipped Cork County Council laboratory in Inniscarra.  On 1 September approximately 30 of the industries which come within the ambit of Cork County Council in terms of licensing and monitoring will be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Therefore it stands to reason that instead of people travelling from the centre at Johnstown a centre should be located in Cork city so that the expertise of the agency will be available to the people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Sargent has left the House because he mentioned the Hickson plant.  Pharmaceutical companies in general are of one mind to ensure compliance. For example, Hickson's recently applied to Cork County Council for a licence.  In fairness to the company, I should say my understanding is they have withdrawn that application to the local <Col N="587" /> authority.  This means the Environmental Protection Agency is afforded an opportunity to monitor the application and issue the licence, subject to whatever restrictions and/or conditions they deem necessary.  That is a further indication that all those industries down there are willing to put their backs behind the Environmental Protection Agency, to come together in a unified manner to ensure that our environment is protected.</P>
    <P>I should warn the Minister that there is a grave danger here of overlapping the roles of the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities nationwide. In Cork County Council we have an extremely efficient staff in the environmental section.  On the transfer of 30 industries to the Environmental Protection Agency, 67 members of the staff will remain the direct responsibility of Cork County Council.  Particularly bearing in mind the extremely expensive equipment involved it would be sad were we to have duplication in staffing.  A properly integrated approach is needed in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork County Council make much greater progress in their dealings, particularly in regard to the availability of the laboratory in Inniscarra so that, at the end of the day, we shall have a proper monitoring-licensing system of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Members for their contributions, which demonstrated that there is wide agreement that we must continue to build up and strengthen the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Now that licensing has commenced we are completing the first phase of this strengthening exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order before the House is an important support of this process which, along with other standing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, will place the agency in a strong position to supervise and monitor the environmental impact of licensing <Col N="588" /> activities and enforce high environmental standards.</P>
    <P>Deputies Sargent and Batt O'Keeffe referred to the Hickson plant in Cork.  As I said during Question Time this week, a number of recommendations of last year's Environmental Protection Agency report have already been implemented. I am satisfied that the new Environmental Protection Agency licence now required for this plant will provide the best framework within which to pursue the agency's recommendations.  The company is aware already of the agency's licensing requirements from pre-application discussions. A full licence application must be submitted by 1 September next.  Now that the agency will be dealing directly with Hickson's I am confident that the recommendations to which Deputy Sargent referred will be complied with fully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe made the point about ensuring there would be no duplication of staffing.  I would hope that will be the case.  I foresee the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities working together.  It is appropriate that any immediate response to an emergency should emanate from local authorities in that they have the requisite manpower and equipment resources to provide local emergency cover.  But the Order before us correctly requires that the agency, in addition to the appropriate local or sanitary authority, must be informed as soon as practicable after any occurrence of an accidental discharge or emission, thereby allowing the agency speedily to advise and assist in an emergency without duplicating that emergency response.  The agency can also activate its enforcement powers, as appropriate, in the particular circumstances of any accident.  I would foresee them complementing each other's roles rather than duplicating them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned an earlier figure of £8 million as representing the full running costs of the agency. However, that estimate pre-dated the agency as ultimately agreed by the Oireachtas and established in 1993.  In the first full year of its operations, while <Col N="589" /> the agency is in its formative stage, the resources provided are substantial.  Of course, we will be closely monitoring the position, ensuring that its future financial provisions match the continued strengthening of its operations.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that the licensing function always had been anticipated to be self-financing.  Recently I made regulations establishing fee levels for licensing applications which I predict will yield substantial moneys to the agency, possibly a figure approaching £2 million in the first year.  In addition to the £4.4 million provided by Government, the agency will derive additional income, estimated at some £500,000, from local authorities for services provided to them. Therefore, we are talking about £4.4 million, £2 million and £500,000, almost £7 million, approaching the figure of £8 million referred to earlier.  I can give the House an assurance that moneys will be made available to the agency as required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned the commitment to establish the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Wexford.  Bearing in mind that I represent the Wexford area I am totally committed to having its headquarters based there.  Unfortunately, for different reasons, the castle first nominated for its headquarters proved too costly to renovate and refurbish to the requisite standard. The agency's headquarters will be based at Ardcavan in the short term, where very soon the staff there will number 26.  Again, in reply to Deputy Molloy, I can say the full membership of the board will be based in Wexford and their meetings take place there, as required.  Obviously there may be times when board members will move about but generally board meetings will take place in Wexford.  In addition, permanent headquarters will be established in Wexford as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy asked what would happen to the castle.  The Office of Public Works are examining the castle at present with a view to ascertaining how it can be developed in the future.  A number of suggestions have been put forward, including mine, that it be developed as <Col N="590" /> a heritage centre for the south-eastern region.  All of those options will be considered in ensuing months.  I assure the House that the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency will be based permanently in Wexford so that in time the agency will have a permanent structure there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe inquired about a regional centre in Cork, something he has been very vocal about in recent years, to the point of demanding at one stage that the headquarters be based in Cork. I am pleased that Wexford won rather than Cork, for once.  I can assure Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that the Environmental Protection Agency has already signalled that it will have a regional centre in Cork.  I am sure, as the Environmental Protection Agency develops, that centre will also develop.  I will pass on the Deputy's views to the board of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett spoke about noise hazards.  As the House will know, regulations were implemented this week in regard to minimising such noise hazards, abolishing the cumbersome procedures we have had heretofore, rendering it easier for concerned citizens to take appropriate action through the courts against people causing excessive noise, exhorting local authorities to do likewise. Obviously those new regulations are only in their infancy.  I hope to see them improved and further developed in the future.  Deputy Barrett also mentioned that traffic noise was not covered under the regulations made last week.  Under the recent Roads Act there is provision whereby the Minister can empower a local authority, or the National Roads Authority, to deal with excessive noise caused by traffic in any given area.  That regulation is at present being examined and, hopefully, will be implemented in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their general welcome of this Order.  As Deputy Molloy said, at the end of the day we all want to see the Environmental Protection Agency the champion out there, protecting, enhancing and preserving our environment.  I have no doubt, from the <Col N="591" /> manner in which they have operated over the past six to nine months &mdash; particularly in the case of the incident in Cork and other incidents, and their involvement in the past week in the River Lung fish kill incident &mdash; they will live up to the standards expected of them when first established.</P>

      <P>In that context I am looking forward to the debate on it, because I am sure that Members will share in the aims of the Bill &mdash; to strengthen our democratic structures and ensure that the public is served in the best possible manner by those they elect and by those chosen to serve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking forward to the debate on this Bill which I hope will be a constructive one.  I am sure it will be, because I know that Members share with me an aspiration to make our democracy more open, more accountable and more accessible to the needs of the people who have elected us.  I sincerely hope that in the process of debating and passing this legislation we can begin the process of restoring trust in democracy.  I hope we can dismantle some of the cynicism and negative perception of politics and politicians which undermines confidence in <Col N="592" /> democratic institutions and in democracy itself.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that as we set out to debate this legislation, we restate our reasons for advancing it.  The Bill is being enacted because the public has a right to know &mdash; a right to know what private interests could potentially influence the decisions policy-makers take, and a right to know that private and public interests are kept separate.  The public has a right to know what interests their politicians have, not in order to jump to the immediate conclusion that those interests are affecting decisions made, but because bringing the information into the public domain effectively separates the public decision from the private interest.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a mechanism for achieving just that: in the first place by identifying the politicians' interests and, secondly, by providing a framework in which any potential conflict which might arise can be resolved.  I know that for the vast majority of Members, the notion of allowing their private interests to influence any public decision they might make would be anathema to them.  Indeed some commentators have suggested that the Bill is unnecessary and unduly intrusive. I want to categorically state that the Bill is not about catching politicians up to their tricks.  The vast majority of Irish politicians are dedicated public servants who have entered politics to do good for the country, and not for personal advancement.</P>
    <P>What the Bill represents, and I believe it is increasingly necessary, is a recognition that the financial and political life of this country has become much more complex.  In that complex world the potential for conflicts of interest to arise has grown enormously.  The mechanisms proposed in this Bill provide us with a way of acknowledging and dealing with that potential conflict so as to protect and enhance our democracy and our high standards of public service.  It is not as if what is suggested in this Bill is new.  A public register of interests by elected Members is a standard feature of democracies the world over.  Our neighbours across the Irish Sea have taken it for <Col N="593" /> granted for years, that on the day a person takes a seat in Parliament, he or she declare their interests.  I am sure Deputy Currie, having served in parliaments outside the Twenty-six Counties, will understand that point very well.  Our MEPs have been registering their interests for years.  Nor is it an entirely new idea here.  Members who have also served on local authorities will be aware of the requirement to declare their interests at that level.  Most Members have quite happily and openly declared their interests at that level for years.</P>
    <P>On the semi-State side, procedures were put in place in recent years requiring declaration of interests by members of boards of semi-State companies.  This legislation does, for the first time, put such arrangements on a statutory basis. Given that the semi-State sector is an arm of the State, so to speak, and that in making decisions, directors and senior executives of State boards are acting on behalf of the public, on behalf of their shareholder the taxpayer, it is time that the system of disclosure of interests at this level was put on a statutory footing. The semi-State sector has expanded considerably in recent years, and with this expansion has come an increasing complexity of operation.</P>
    <P>Given that complexity and the huge sums of public money involved, there is undoubtedly a potential for lapses from the high standards which the public expects.  The clear statutory framework which the Bill provides will protect not only the taxpayer and the public interest, but also those charged with serving on their behalf in the public and semi-State sectors.</P>
    <P>The independent commission set up under the Bill which has wide powers to investigate complaints and to carry out investigations on its own initiative is another powerful safeguard for the conduct of public business in our semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a similar framework for the disclosure of interests by senior civil and public servants in designated positions.  This is not because we believe <Col N="594" /> there are public officials with something to hide, but because of the need to recognise that times have changed.  We have a tradition of public service of which we can be proud.  In providing the system which this Bill proposes, we will safeguard a strong sense of confidence in the integrity of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Bill contains and the structures and requirements which it will put in place.  It will establish a public Register of Interests for Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers.  Others in senior positions of public influence &mdash; board members and senior executives of State bodies, senior civil servants and senior special advisers &mdash; will also be required to put their interests on the record in an annual declaration. Those involved in policy execution, that is, Ministers, senior advisers, senior public servants and directors of State companies, will be required to declare relevant interests of their spouses and children, but on a confidential basis.  Where a direct conflict of interest arises in the course of official duties for those covered by the Bill, that must be formally declared and put on record.</P>
    <P>Civil servants and senior semi-State personnel are obliged under the Bill to stand aside from decisions in which they have a personal or family financial interest unless there are compelling written reasons otherwise.  This requirement is being made a term of their job contracts or conditions of appointment.  If somebody does not obey this requirement in a serious case they can be sacked.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill TDs and Minister are not being asked to stand aside from the exercise of their constitutional and statutory functions, but they will be obliged to formally record if they have an interest in all cases.</P>
    <P>In speaking or voting in the House, Members will be asked to make a formal declaration to the Clerk where they have an immediate personal, family or business interest in the matter in question. This will not apply where the interest is of a broad general character, for example as a mortgage holder, parent or a farmer. <Col N="595" /> A select committee of the House will draw up guidelines for Members in this regard.  The declaration will be simple &mdash;&ldquo;I have an interest in this matter&rdquo;&mdash; and will be formally recorded in the records of the House.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, expensive gifts to office holders will become State property.  This has been long sought and I am sure will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Outside advice is valuable, and I am a strong supporter of a cabinet system which complements the work of an independent civil service.  The Bill sets out new requirements regarding personal ministerial appointments, including advisers.  It will be a statutory requirement under this legislation to publish the details of the appointment, including the person's qualifications for the job where it is a senior policy post.  Ministers will have to make a public declaration if the appointee is a relative.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at this point that there were lessons to be learned about how such appointments were handled. We have put those lessons to good use in the changes to procedures and in the completely open system for appointments now proposed in this legislation.  I am sure these proposals will receive a warm welcome on the Opposition benches.  It will be made a statutory requirement that all such appointments are temporary and end when the Minister's term of office ends.  This has been the practice for many years but it is now being put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Advisers will be obliged to make a full public declaration of their interests by laying them before this House, and they will be prohibited from acting where they have a conflict of interest.  The new rules apply equally to those employed in the normal way and to those working on contract.</P>
    <P>The Bill is fair and reasonable in what it asks politicians to declare.  In fact they are largely the same declarations as those already adopted by parliaments in other democracies.  They include directorships and outside employment; valuable shareholdings; substantial property interests, <Col N="596" /> other than the family home; paid positions as lobbyists and contracts held with public bodies; valuable gifts, other than normal gifts from family and friends.  In essence, the legislation asks politicians to declare those interests which could potentially influence their decisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill's structure is a complex one, but the principles it embodies are simple. The fundamental principle is openness and accountability &mdash; putting private interests on the table so that public and private business is seen to be kept separate and conflicts of interest avoided.</P>
    <P>Public declarations are required of politicians and Minister's senior advisers, as people in the direct public eye.  Other declarations under the Bill are made in private.  We seek to strike a fair balance between the public's right to know and the individual's right to privacy.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive listing of interests is required of those whose public duties are wide-ranging and not confined to any particular sector &mdash; Ministers, Members, senior advisers.  People working in a Government Department or State company are required to list those of their interests which could have a bearing on their duties in that Department or company. For example, a senior civil servant in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry would be expected to declare shareholdings in agri-business, but would not normally be expected to declare shareholdings in a clothing company, unless it interferes with or arises in the course of their normal work.</P>
    <P>If a potential conflict of interest arises in the course of official duties where a closely connected person &mdash; close family or business partner &mdash; would stand to gain significantly, that conflict of interest must be declared.  The interests of connected persons come into the picture only where they are known, are relevant in terms of posing a potential conflict, and are not of a widely general character.</P>
    <P>This relates to a specific financial interest which could affect the conduct of public business.</P>
    <P>During the recent passports controversy, questions were raised as to how well this Bill would address the issues <Col N="597" /> raised.  I take this opportunity to clarify the situation with regard to this issue since I have no doubt that some Members will raise it during the debate.</P>
    <P>Any Minister's interests will be a matter of public record, under the Second Schedule to the Bill.  The Bill provides that where a Minister in the course of his job deals with a situation affecting himself and/or his family, he must declare it.  That provision also covers a situation where an issue which could benefit any one Minister is brought before Cabinet by another Minister.</P>
    <P>What the Bill, as it stands, does not cover, however, is a situation where the actions of one Minister could potentially benefit another Minister, if that action does not involve a Cabinet decision.  I will therefore be proposing an important amendment to the Bill to cover this eventuality, and I look forward to having it discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am sure one of the first questions which will be asked about this Bill is how we will ensure its provisions are carried out.  Making sure it happens is an important feature of any legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed legislation, an independent and powerful commission will be established comprising the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle, and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  This commission can investigate possible contraventions of the provisions of the legislation, on its own initiative or on foot of a complaint.  It has wide powers to summon witnesses and send for records to help it in its task.  The members of the commission will be independent in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that compliance with the terms of the Bill will be part of the term of appointment of designated public servants, senior executives and board members of State bodies, as well as special advisers.</P>
    <P>There will be separate investigation arrangements for Members of the House, since under the Constitution each House of the Oireachtas regulates its own affairs.  A select committee of each House will investigate any complaints about <Col N="598" /> ordinary Members while the commission will include office holders in its remit.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a number of offences, including non-compliance with an investigation, as well as the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  It updates our prevention of corruption legislation dating from 1889 to 1916 to ensure it applies to the complex modern state, and brings penalties into line with modern money values.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill covers the normal provisions for commencement, definitions and regulations.  Part 2 deals with declarations by Oireachtas Members, and the setting up of select committees to oversee this area of the Bill.  This part will be brought into effect by resolution of each House, and the first registration is required within two months after the resolution is adopted.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with office holders and the requirement to make additional confidential declarations of family interests and gifts to office holders.  Part 4 deals with the public sector &mdash; senior civil and public servants, senior advisers, directors and senior executives, and with personal appointments by office holders.</P>
    <P>Part 5 sets up the independent commission and gives it powers in relation to conducting an investigation.  Part 6 deals with various miscellaneous procedures and with enforcement.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule specifies the public bodies which may be designated by the Minister for Finance to be covered by the Bill's provisions.  The Second Schedule sets out the interests which Oireachtas Members are required to register.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a lot of rules, but as any parent, or indeed good lawyer, will tell you, all the rules in the world will not make people behave if they do not want to behave and as any good legislator will tell you, you cannot legislate for morality either.</P>
    <P>We must aspire, however, to high standards in public life, and these standards should be reflected in our legislation.  We must have a system where lapses from those high standards can be laid open to public scrutiny.  For politicians, the ultimate judges of standards in public <Col N="599" /> life are the electorate, and the ultimate judgment is at the ballot box, but the Ethics in Public Office Bill is about a lot more than putting in place a set of rules for those who serve the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about building trust in our public and democratic institutions.  It is about opening up doors on areas which because they have been private, have generated suspicion and innuendo.  By showing that politicians have nothing to hide, it can only enhance confidence in the political system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is part of a broader package of measures to strengthen our democracy and let in the light.  The Electoral Bill, now at a final stage with the parliamentary draftsman will give effect to the Programme for Government commitments on disclosure of political donations, ceilings on election spending and State funding of political parties.  I am preparing freedom of information proposals which can make Ireland a model for open government and open administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>My only wish is that this Bill will live up to the claims the Minister of State has made for it.  She started off by saying:</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill is probably one of the most significant Bills this Government will introduce. It is also one of the most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an extremely large claim to make and it is hardly one which commends itself to other members of the Government and Government supporters in Fianna Fáil, none of whom has bothered <Col N="600" /> to come into the House to listen to the Minister.  The only people sitting behind her are the Labour Party backbenchers, while a Labour Party Minister is sitting beside her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>This would seem to suggest that this is a Labour Party measure for which other members of the Government and supporters of the Government have little enthusiasm.  I will return to this matter later.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that in the process of debating and passing this legislation we can begin the process of restoring trust in our democracy.  I hope we can dismantle some of the cynicism and negative perception of politics and politicians which undermines confidence in democratic institutions and in democracy itself.</P>
      <P>I only wish that this was correct and that we could start to remove this cynicism. On previous occasions the Minister of State will have heard me say that I found the cynicism regarding politicians and the political process in this part of the country extremely disturbing and to be more of a threat to our democratic institutions than the use of the bomb and the gun north of the Border.  I believe that to be the case. While I would hope the measures suggested by the Minister in this legislation would go a long way towards remedying it, unfortunately, that will not be the case, they will go only a very small part of the way.</P>
      <P>Ethics has been defined as:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The branch of philosophy that investigates morality and in particular, the varieties of thinking by which human conduct is guided and may be appraised.  Its special concern is with the meaning and justification of utterances about the rightness and wrongness of actions, the virtue or vice of the motives which prompt them, the <Col N="601" /> praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agents who perform them and the goodness or badness of the consequences to which they give rise.</P>
    <P>Clearly this in not an ethics Bill, it is a disclosure of interests Bill.  Why is the word &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; in the title of the Bill?  The answer can be found in a quotation from the Official Report on 5 November 1992 which states:</P>
    <P>I believe one political party in this House have gone so far down the road of blindness to standards and of blindness to the people they are supposed to represent that it is impossible to see how anyone could support them in the future without seeing them first undergo the most radical transformation.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from a speech by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, at the beginning of the last election campaign, two months before entering into Government with Fianna Fáil and without any change in that party, not to mention radical transformation.  That speech from Deputy Spring and his subsequent actions, so much at variance with it, is the genesis of ethics as applied to this Bill.  The public had to be convinced that there leopard had changed his spots, that there had been a radical transformation in the nature and culture of Fianna Fáil and that Labour would ensure there would be no reversion to the bad old ways.</P>
    <P>The commitment in the Labour Party's election manifesto to put trust back into politics to establish a compulsory procedure for declaration of interest was set out in the Programme for Government and Ethics in Government Bill.  In a cynical exercise, ethics was introduced in an attempt to cover up the great betrayal of the principles enunciated only two months earlier.  The betrayal of those principles and the selling out of those who voted Labour to keep Fianna Fáil out of office was the greatest breach of ethics since I was elected to this House.</P>
    <P>We are all human and I doubt that any of us do not have a skeleton in the <Col N="602" /> cupboard.  I certainly would not like all my cupboards opened to public perusal. The experience of those who do not have anything to hide is so remote from that of ordinary people, one wonders if they should be a Member of this House.  The record of Members over the years on matters covered in this Bill has, as far as I am aware, been exemplary and not deserving of the widespread criticism and cynicism one experiences outside, particularly in a small section of the press.  In my experience, the majority of people I met in almost 30 years of public life have been of considerable personal integrity, irrespective of party or indeed, in my case, irrespective of political jurisdiction. Our record compares favourably with Parliaments in other countries, most notably recently in Japan and Italy.</P>
    <P>There have been blots, questions, unanswered allegations and suspicions that certain things happened not exactly according to the book.  In particular we should be in a better position to assess the ethical standards of our public life when the beef tribunal report is published. I cannot comment further on that, but I hope it will be published before we reach the concluding stages of this Bill so that we can consider its implications.</P>
    <P>Many questions have arisen over the years in respect of patronage, nepotism and sharp dealing, mainly in relation to Fianna Fáil and part of that party's traditional &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  It is regrettable that the party of the Minister of State entered fully into a partnership arrangement with Fianna Fáil in that respect and in this administration has been the major culprit. If this proposed legislation had been in force at the time of the appointment of programme managers, advisers, consultants, spin doctors, secretaries and drivers, would questions in relation to the use of public funds in this manner have been avoided?  In her speech the Minister of State implied that would have been the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made comparisons with the Marcos regime, about which she was attacked in this House and elsewhere.  I am aware of the patronage, nepotism and corruption of that regime, <Col N="603" /> but, unlike the Minister of State, I would not make comparisons with anything that happened here.  Her remarks were way over the top and I hope, even at this late stage, she will apologise for them.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Government sought to delude the Irish people over the famous £8 billion was hardly ethical under my definition of ethics.  The whole episode was a mixture of prevarication and half truths and even a few days ago the Minister of State still sought to hide the facts.  She denied that the Government had asked for publication of the plan to be delayed until after the election. No one had made such an allegation. What had been stated was that the Commissioner responsible, Bruce Millan, had said that the Government had failed to provide the necessary information which would have enabled the announcement to be made before the election.  That prevarication borders on the unethical.</P>
    <P>In what category does one put the recent passport scandal?  I note what the Minister said on that matter.  She accepts that this is something the proposed legislation would not cover and stated: &ldquo;What the Bill, as it stands at the moment, does not cover, however, is a situation where the actions of one Minister could potentially benefit another Minister, if that action does not involve a Cabinet decision&rdquo;.  She gave a commitment to the House that she would propose an important amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to cover this eventuality. I look forward to seeing that amendment.  That indicates that what was said here about the passport controversy was of some importance and meaning to our democratic process and clearly indicates that not everything has been correct in that respect.  I look forward to seeing the gloss the Minister of State will attempt to put on her amendment and I will examine it carefully.</P>
    <P>Many question need to be answered in respect of this legislation.  I welcome the central proposal regarding a commission to undertake the investigation of complaints in relation to office holders, special advisers and public servants, <Col N="604" /> including civil servants, senior executives and directors of State bodies.  I could hardly do otherwise.  So far as I recall, a former leader of Fine Gael was the first to propose such a commission.  He wrote articles and spoke about it in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe a provision should be included to cover that type of relationship also.  In the presidential election, in which I was slightly more than an observer, the proposal for a commission was a central part of the Fine Gael manifesto and became its official policy.</P>
      <P>A question which has not been dealt with is what control is to be exercised over people when they leave office.  I understand this is a matter the former Taoiseach raised.  One day such people are Ministers, top civil servants or advisers with access to sensitive and commercially valuable inside information and the next they are directors or consultants, gamekeepers turned poachers.  Is this position covered by the legislation?  It is an important matter.  The former Taoiseach made suggestions about debarring such people for a period of time from divulging sensitive information and putting themselves in a position where they could be put on the spot about such matters. There seems to be an important gap in the legislation.  If the legislation is as important as the Minister would like us to believe, why has there been no attempt to address this position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the rules of procedure of the House reference may not be made to the appointment of judges or the suitability of persons for appointment.  There ought to be a procedure whereby it should be possible to discuss the suitability of persons to be judges.  At the very least the interests of members of the Judiciary should be made known in the same way as those of other office holders under the Bill.  Members of the Judiciary adjudicate <Col N="605" /> on matters covering the spectrum of life &mdash; important matters involving millions of pounds and affecting vast numbers of people.  Why should interests which might colour their attitudes not be disclosed in this House?  Judges are human and why should they not be covered by this legislation?</P>
    <P>I believe section 7 will be a matter of considerable controversy.  It requires that a Member of the Oireachtas speaking or voting in Oireachtas proceedings in which a Member or a connected person has a material interest must declare that fact.  A connected person is <i>inter alia</i> a relative, meaning a brother, sister, parent or spouse of the person or a child of the person or of the spouse.  This is a catch all provision and to that extent I agree with it.  However, the section goes on to provide that such declarations will be published in the Order Paper of the relevant House of the Oireachtas.  Is that really necessary?  Would it not be sufficient for a Member to declare his or her interest in the House or in a committee so that other Members would know of his or her interest?  It would be possible for a Member to inform the Clerk of the House or the clerk of a committee of his or her interest and it need not be declared to other Members.  The debate could continue and Members would not know until the following day that the Member who participated in the debate had an interest.</P>
    <P>That position is not acceptable.  If a Member with such an interest chose to contribute to proceedings only the Clerk would be aware of the interest until the Order Paper was published.  Members should consider the attention which will be paid to that section of the Order Paper by those looking for a quick or a sensational headline.  This section covers mainly the interests of relatives who have not sought election to this House.  Many Members of this House, members of society and of the media have an interest in finding out matters of this nature, not necessarily related to people's welfare. They are curious people in respect of whom the phrase &ldquo;peeping Toms&rdquo; was used earlier.  Why do the interests of Members need to be stated on the Order <Col N="606" /> Paper?  People will skim through it to see who has declared an interest which does not relate to them personally but to one of their relatives.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  It would be more correct for people to declare an interest in the House so that other Members contributing to the debate would know and be able to deal with it accordingly.</P>
    <P>How does this legislation affect Members who have one home in Dublin and one in their constituency?  Members have to declare both homes.  I see the Minister shaking her head and that would seem to indicate that would not be the case.  The shake of her head is good enough for me but the position is not stated on the record and it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered in the Second Schedule of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding property and interests outside the jurisdiction I have to declare a personal interest in this matter having some interests outside the jurisdiction. Mine are open and above board and are well known to everyone, but there may be Members, office holders and others, including civil servants and so on, who are in a similar category.  I take it that the property and interests outside the jurisdiction should be considered and I would strongly object if that were not the case.  I seek clarification on that matter.</P>
      <P>Certain gifts over £500 must be disclosed, and that is reasonable.  However, a Member may not know the value of the gift given to him or his wife and he may later discover it is more valuable than he thought.  The opposite is likely in my case and that which I thought was valuable turns out not to be so valuable.  All too often I find that that which glistens is not gold.  What is the position in this case? Who undertakes the valuation of such gifts?  What is the position if one does not know the value of a gift?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters, one of which relates to people who are opinion makers.  We like to think of ourselves as opinion makers but the reality is that we are among the least influential.  People <Col N="607" /> operating in the media, in television and radio in particular, have much greater influence than we have.  If anybody came to me with a brown paper parcel it would be a very small one with probably nothing in it because any influence that could be bought from me would not be worth anything &mdash; I take for granted that office holders might warrant a larger brown paper parcel.  However, there are influential people outside this House who take every opportunity to criticise its Members and contribute enormously to the cynicism to which we referred.</P>

      <P>If we are concerned about the title of this Bill, Ethics in Public Office, will we consider what we might do in relation to these people?  Take, for example, financial journalists who exercise an influence far greater than that exercised by any Member of this House, with the possible exception of the Minister for Finance and possibly some other members of the Government.  Are we thinking in terms of having some means by which they will be amenable because the advice they give can have a significant impact on what people decide to do, particularly in regard to stocks and shares.  It is not just people in this House that we ought to be concerned about.  If we are truly concerned about ethics the Minister will reply to some of those questions on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Some people in this House would not want what they consider an intrusion.  I do not consider it an intrusion; it is the price one pays for involvement in public life and it must be faced up to.  I hope, after the initial curiosity and interest, that declaration of interests will be taken as a matter of course and that the media will come to terms with it as it has in Westminster where, initially, the register of members' interests was examined minutely and investigative pieces written <Col N="608" /> about it.  However, after a while that interest subsided.  I hope and believe that the same thing will happen here, that it will be taken for granted that Members of this House are straight and fair, honest and true and declare their interests and that any investigation following that will not discover anything to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will support this Bill on Second Reading but we will not do so to the thump of drums and the blare of bugles.  It is not that momentous an occasion.  It is a necessary declaration of interests measure which ought to have been introduced a long time ago and it is no better and no worse than similar declarations of interests in most parliamentary assemblies.  However, it is no big deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly happy that the Minister in her opening speech on this debate drew down on the passport issue because that is a matter which is relevant to this Bill and I am glad the Minister agrees with that.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill was put into the Programme for Government to serve as the Labour Party's political prophylactic; it is a legislative condom which it proposes to wear in its partnership period which will prevent it from picking up anything it should not pick up from its partners in Government and, at the same time, enables it to participate fully in Government without that contamination. It was designed to wipe away at one stroke all the doubts and allegations which the Tánaiste made about the Fianna Fáil Party and its leadership, to which Deputy Currie referred, doubts which existed in abundance in November 1992 but which evaporated in the frenzy of patronage and job gorging in which the Labour Party indulged and which accompanied the formation of this Government only weeks later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill failed its first test on its first day in print because it was discovered that when applied to real circumstances &mdash; the passports affair &mdash; it has nothing to offer.  As the Minister has now conceded, but would not concede on radio when confronted with the fact, it has no answer <Col N="609" /> to one Minister doing another Minister a favour.  It became obvious within hours that it did not cover the most elementary circumstance in which public office ethics are tested, namely, the situation where one member of the Government, at the request of a second member of the Government, grants a citizenship of the State in respect of a loan of £1 million or more to the business of a third member of the Government.</P>
    <P>What is really wrong with that is that the Taoiseach, and now the Tánaiste, can see nothing wrong in it.  By any standards this is an outrageous and scandalous abuse of public office.  They collectively now defend a particularly squalid sequence of events.  They say now there was no wrongdoing, no conflict of interests and no abuse of public office.  In every single one of those respects they are wrong and have proved themselves unworthy of public office.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are so devoid of ethical standards and judgment as to reach those conclusions and to act in the way they did, they have a cheek to even consider sponsoring legislation to impose ethical standards on others.  Recent events have proved conclusively that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have no standards, no ethics and no credibility.  All they have is brass neck and the Labour Party's backbenchers are tramping down every decent standard in Irish politics as long as they continue to support the Reynolds-Spring whitewash of the passports for sale affair.</P>
    <P>We have been told in this House that it is unfair to raise the issue because it concerns the Taoiseach's family and, with respect, that is a complete falsehood and a lie.  This does not concern the Taoiseach's family.  It concerns the Taoiseach himself.  He is, and always has been, the largest single shareholder in C &amp; D Foods.  He personally gained more than any other person from the Masri £1 million loan.  As the largest single beneficiary of this loan he had a brass neck to say that this was his family's private business.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with his political ethics of which we found precious little trace in recent weeks.  He claimed in this <Col N="610" /> House, in a most cynical way, that all inquiries about this matter should be directed to his company which &mdash; surprise, surprise &mdash; refused to make any answer when asked about the situation. What kind of fools does the Taoiseach take the public for?  What kind of fools do the Tánaiste and Labour Party take the rest of us for if they think we will take such cynicism and abuse of people's confidence in the political process?</P>
    <P>The company's latest and out of date records show that the Taoiseach, at all material times, was the holder of the largest single ordinary shareholding in the company.  The records show that around the time the soft loan was made in exchange for citizenship the company was indebted to the extent of £1.4 million. The records show that when he was Minister for Finance and an officeholder, the Taoiseach received extra shares in that company.  There is no basis for claiming he could not have been aware of the Masris' soft loan to his company and no basis for claiming that he was in some way detached from the affairs of that company.  We are asked to believe that the Taoiseach knew nothing of the loan. Unless he is using the hoary old distinction between personal and official knowledge, we are driven to the conclusion that that claim that he knew nothing about the loan was a brazen, self-serving and cynical falsehood.  Of course, the largest personal shareholder in a company would always be told of a £1.1 million cash injection, especially when the directors of the company were numbered among his close relations.</P>
    <P>I reject as utterly implausible and fantastic the suggestion made by and on behalf of the Taoiseach that he never knew about the loan to his company.  It defies belief.  It defies common sense. It was a brazen and monstrous act of deception and unfortunately &mdash; I say this with a good deal of reservation because I normally do not like to criticise the media &mdash; the media seem to be shying away from it.  One newspaper &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; was so afraid to tell its readers the truth that it even refused to print the company's records for fear of <Col N="611" /> libelling the Taoiseach and the reason is that the Taoiseach has taken it for a lot of money in libel damages.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the then Minister Flynn were not fully aware at all times of the proposal to invest in the Taoiseach's firm.  I found their public evasiveness and inconsistency on the issue to be indicative of collective shame and guilt.  All the huffing, puffing and moralising that went on cannot conceal the truth.  The facts are that three members of the Government who are close confidants respectively proposed, accepted and benefited from a decision which conferred a huge cash benefit on one of them.  If that was as far as the issue went, we would be concerned only with what is on the face of it a conflict of interest, but it goes much further.</P>
    <P>The transaction was an abuse of public office because it broke every guideline and stated safeguard and the very purpose of the business migration scheme. In this application for Irish citizenship there was no factual residency in this country and no checks were made to ascertain if there was residency.  No independent analysis was carried out of the investment by any competent Department or State agency.  There were no checks of substance into the background or antecedents of the applicants for citizenship and no attention was paid to the soft loan aspect of the investment.  As a result, two people who had no connection with Ireland were given citizenship here, even though they made no permanent investment here, never resided here and never intend to reside here.  The only service they rendered to Ireland was to reduce the cost to the Taoiseach and the other shareholders in C &amp; D Foods of their bank borrowings by a soft loan.</P>
    <P>Those are issues which command investigation.  The Labour Party has abdicated from any sense of moral responsibility by posturing as being satisfied with the explanations tendered. Every rule was broken in the Masris application for Irish citizenship.  Every <Col N="612" /> safeguard was trampled on.  The Taoiseach was the largest beneficiary of the soft loan and it is an ethical issue of the highest order that nothing was done, particularly by the Labour Party, to vindicate decent standards in Irish public life.</P>
    <P>In a bizarre twist, the head of the family concerned was refused citizenship unless he made a different and separate investment.  That strange decision shows that migration, residence and Irish connections had nothing to do with the issue: the only issue was money, the only yardstick was the amount of money and the only criterion for granting citizenship was the self-interest of people who are well connected in political life.  The Minister cannot get away from that fact and no amount of evasion or saying she will remedy the position changes those facts. The Minister, who shares office with the Taoiseach who has behaved disgracefully, and serves under a Tánaiste and party Leader who sees nothing wrong with what happened, has the brass neck to come into this House and tell us that she has standards of ethics which she proposes to impose on us.  Shame on her.</P>
    <P>People were sold Irish citizenship for a soft loan to a company of which the Taoiseach was the greatest beneficiary in circumstances in which dishonest and evasive explanations were given to the public.  That amounts to a grave abuse of public office, but it seems to be acceptable to the ethical faculties of the Labour Party.  If the Tánaiste and the Minister see nothing wrong with what happened, their consciences, judgments and ethical faculties must be questioned; they must be brain dead.</P>
    <P>Presumably what happened in this case can happen again &mdash; maybe another soft loan to a firm owned by a member of the Cabinet has been made this week or, as I speak, maybe there are discussions in train to do so.  If it was right in November and December 1992 and it was all right in the eyes of the Tánaiste in May 1994, why should it not happen again?  What is wrong with giving another £1 million to a member of the Cabinet in exchange for Irish citizenship?  Since this pathetic Bill <Col N="613" /> does not deal with this matter, it strikes me that these are very strange circumstances.</P>
    <P>This House was recently treated with contempt by the Minister for Justice who publicly threatened me with embarrassing revelations if I persisted in exposing this scandal.  I do not know how she thought that such a tactic was compatible with ethics in public office.  I do not know how it is compatible with open and accountable Government.  I do not know how any member of the Labour Party who claims to have regard for public standards can sit in the House and say that is all right.  The Opposition is threatened that if we point out something bad about the Government, it will get the dirt on us.  If that is the new ethics in Irish public life which the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, vindicates and stands by, shame on her and on her party colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice's bluff was called.  She did not dish out the dirt.  She could not make anything stick, and it is not because I claim to be a Teflon person. When it comes to exposing a public scandal of this kind, there must be people in the Opposition who are willing to face down a corrupt and appalling bluff of the kind attempted in this House and to stand up for the decent standards in public life. As long as there are people on the Government benches who countenance such outrageous behaviour by the Minister for Justice, this country is in danger.</P>
    <P>I utterly reject the shabby tactics of the Tánaiste in proposing legislative reforms in this area while at the same time stating that there is nothing that needs reform.  I cannot understand that.  On the other had the Taoiseach says that no such decision has been made, that legislation will not be introduced to reform this area.  There is need for such reform because there is something wrong here, but there is no hint of the necessary reforms in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the newspapers cannot see there is something rotten and corrupt in the sequence of events I have described, I despair of them being able to form judgments on matters of public standards or ethics on any issue.  Are they afraid of <Col N="614" /> being sued by the Taoiseach who has made substantial killings in the libel damages thus far?  Where are the critical faculties of the media?  Where are the columnists and the investigative reporters?  Why do people such as Bruce Arnold, Geraldine Kennedy and Vincent Browne not press home on the Taoiseach the scandal and abuse that was implicit in his actions in this matter?  These people are nowhere to be found because collectively they seem to be afraid of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>A gloom has set in over the country. People may say, &ldquo;There are jobs at stake, what are you whingeing about?&rdquo; To reduce the interest costs for shareholders in C &amp; D Foods is not a question of jobs. That company is paying 5 per cent on a loan when it might have had to pay what everybody else must pay to the bank, 10 or 15 per cent.  The fact that it is a question of jobs seems to justify that these people, whe are £1.4 million in debt, can get a soft loan from people who have no interest in or connection with this country and a Minister can dole out citizenship for that reason.</P>
    <P>We are told that the justification is jobs, but where are the political ethics in that?  Where are the Labour Party's political ethics in supporting and countenancing such behaviour?  Where is the Tánaiste's political ethics in saying there is nothing wrong with that, that it is perfectly above board and he did not find anything on the file &mdash; as if he would find the outline of the cash on the brown paper bag sitting on the file, as if he would find a little note to the effect that this is unethical but we will go ahead with it anyway?  What kind of fools does the Government take us to be that we should put up with this nonsense?  What kind of fools does it think we are to believe that a file in the Department of Justice would yield traces of what was a highly improper and most wrongful abuse of public office by people, some of whom are still in public office?</P>
    <P>Do the newspapers collectively accept that there was a gross and obvious abuse of public office and that it can be perpetrated by the Minister and whitewashed <Col N="615" /> by a morally brain-dead Tánaiste?  Do they believe there was genuine residency on the part of the Masris?  Do they believe there was a genuine investment or a soft loan, which is as impermanent as the snow in spring? Do they believe that the business migration scheme was abused?  Do they believe that every safeguard and check that was supposed to be in place was ignored and trampled down?  If they believe that, where are the newspaper's critical faculties now?  Does the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> believe in his heart that the Taoiseach never knew about this loan to his company?  Is that the quality of judgment of the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>?  Does the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> believe that any check was done on the soft loan nature of the transaction? Does the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> consider that there was bona fide residency involved?  Are all these people suffering from the same moral dementia that seems to afflict the Tánaiste and the frightened huddled mass of Labour backbenchers who seem to have lost their voice, their standards and their conscience in this affair.</P>
    <P>There are those who previously saw the issue as electioneering on my part &mdash; an <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial curiously said this was an election stunt.  Now the election is over I cannot be accused of electioneering.  Where are the investigative journalists?  Will the media stand up for decent standards in public life and put to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the wrongdoing that was done, expose precisely what was wrong about it and demand that this be reversed and that those people either apologise to the Irish people for taking a soft loan in these circumstances in exchange for Irish citizenship and white washing the transaction or put it to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that they get out of office?</P>
    <P>Do all these people who thought it was electioneering on my part believe there is something left to investigate?  Where are their consciences?  Are they afraid of the libel laws?  Is it the case that only people who can avail of the privilege of <Col N="616" /> this House have the strength and position to criticise what was obviously a scandalous and grave abuse of public office?  Is it only here and only on such occasion that it can be done?  Is it the case that our media have fallen on their face because they will not vindicate decent standards and they will not investigate corrupt abuse of public office by people in this country?  For some reason they will not do it.  That is to their collective shame.</P>
    <P>I know it is unwise to criticise the media and that they will get huffy and puffy in their editorial chairs.  Facts are facts and they claim to be the moral and political watchdogs of democracy.  They claim these rights and duties but when it comes to the crunch they have been behind the door on this issue.  They have not stood up against the Taoiseach's facile, cynical self-serving and deceptive rhetoric that there is nothing wrong with this.  They have not asked the Labour Party, in particular, to be accountable to the Irish people for their complete abdication of political standards in the matter.  Where are the Labour Party Members for their flagship legislation?  Where are the Fianna Fáil Members, none of whom has darkened the door of this Chamber for this debate?</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important parts of the Government's programme, according to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald. Where are the interested backbenchers preparing to listen to this debate?  What are they doing?  They know this is the means by which the Labour Party can posture as being clean, even though it is a party to a squalid cover-up of a very squalid chapter of events.  This is the second coat of moral whitewash which the Labour Party has tried to put on this issue.  This Bill will not clean up politics and in large measure it will tart up and plaster what is a rotten facade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister of State requires me to state my interests generally at the beginning of every Dáil session <Col N="617" /> and this is to be published.  If I were a Minister and I proposed to make a decision which benefited me &mdash; or if the Minister of State has her way with her amendment, which presumably will be as ineffectual as the rest of the Bill &mdash; whom do I have to inform?

I hope it is all right with you.  I think it is justified in the circumstances.&rdquo; That letter will not be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That letter will not be published under section 14.  What a farce.  If I want to speak on a Bill which concerns an issue in respect of which I have been paid as a barrister I have to go through the rigmarole of getting down on my knees in public and apologising for the fact that I took a fee.  The Taoiseach is the recipient of letters informing him in writing that Ministers are making decisions which benefit themselves or other Members of the Cabinet by up to £1 million in soft loans.  What kind of farce are we dealing with?  Can the Minister of State tell me how it is correct that somebody who informs the Taoiseach under section 14 (1) (b) of a conflict of interest can still make the decision from which he will benefit in secret and the only safeguard is a letter sitting in the bottom drawer of the Taoiseach's desk? How does that square up to accountability, transparency and the public having the right to know?  How does the light get into the bottom drawer of the Taoiseach's desk?  Where will that letter be published?  The Minister of State knows well that it will not be published. <Col N="618" /> That is the kind of rubbish in this Bill and presumably is what Fianna Fáil insisted be put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>If a Fianna Fáil Minister makes a decision which affects his own personal interests or another Minister's personal interests, under this much talked about amendment we will be told that he wrote a letter to the Taoiseach under section 14 (1) (b) of this Bill and everything was all right, Albert did not take offence.  That is the safeguard proposed in this measure. Will the only safeguard we have when one Minister grants citizenship on foot of another Minister's family business being given a soft loan be that he has written a letter to the Taoiseach saying he has done this?  Of course he would have told the Taoiseach in the bar the previous night that he was going to do it.  What kind of nonsense are we dealing with?</P>
      <P>This Bill is badly drafted, deeply flawed and does not deal with real situations. What it does is very simple and very modest.  It requires a register of interests, but it does not provide any real method, when the interests are in conflict, of checking whether a proper decision was made.  That is the crucial problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net effect of section 14 (1) (b) is that one member of Government when making a decision on his own private affairs which benefits himself or a connected person very substantially must pen a note to the Taoiseach and inform him of what he is doing.  If that is the only safeguard the Labour Party can deliver, you have to be sure the Taoiseach is beyond reproach.  In this case the Taoiseach is not beyond reproach.  He has shown that he would not know a conflict of interest if he saw it.  He has never heard of the concept of ethics and standards.  He does not understand that his behaviour in respect of his own family firm was scandalous and an abuse of his position. He does not understand that what the then Minister for Justice, Commissioner Flynn, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, did on this matter broke every rule in the procedures in the Department of Justice in granting that citizenship.  It is in that context <Col N="619" /> that he is being made the moral watchdog of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, is supposed to be the person who knows when there is a conflict of interests.  He is supposed to be the person who is to protect us and to morally guide the other Ministers on how they should decide matters once they tell him in secret about a conflict of interest.  I reject his capacity to do that entirely.  If anybody in this House has demonstrated a signal incapacity to behave ethically or to understand what a conflict of interest is, it is he.  If somebody in this House says &ldquo;This is my family's business, do not hound me; have I not provided jobs, is it not a terrible thing that only Taoiseach in recent times who has any business experience runs into trouble&rdquo;, or offers pat, cynical, rubbishy, explanations such as that for what is in fact an abuse of public office, and gets away with by putting on a brazen face, smiling through it and is appointed by one's partners in Government, the Labour Party, as the person to whom all these secret confessions of interest are to be made by Ministers, what kind of safeguards do we have?</P>
    <P>This Bill is flawed and the Minister knows that it did not cover the matters to which I referred on the radio when I debated the issue with her on the day it was published.  She can correct that but the only safeguard against abuse by Cabinet Ministers of their position is to require them to send a letter to the Taoiseach. Is the Minister of State saying that that is the only safeguard and that the only matter the much vaunted commission can investigate is whether the latter was sent to the Taoiseach?  If the Taoiseach confirms that he received the letter and complied with sections 2,3 and 4 of this Bill, what can the commission do?  It must walk away from the issue; it cannot report to the House that Deputy Connor, for example, had an interest which he failed to declare, he declared it in the statutory way.  In effect, this Bill whitewashes the activities of Ministers and all that is required is for the Taoiseach <Col N="620" /> to be aware of the misdeeds these Ministers are engaged in.</P>
    <P>This is flaccid legislation and I say that in the context of supporting any measure that opens up this House and political life to scrutiny.  I support any measure that is reasonable in these circumstances but I do not see why I have to go down on my knees in public and declare that I received a fee, say, for advising a company whose affairs are the subject matter of a debate in this House, while a Minister who gives £1 million to one of his pals or his family firm has only to write a letter to the Taoiseach.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to remedy the passports for sale affair in retrospect.  We have had no apology from the Tánaiste or statement from the Taoiseach that it was wrong.  We have not even had a statement that this will not happen again. In fact, we have had a justification that there was nothing wrong with what happened so presumably that is a warranty that it can or ought to happen again without any concern by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>A party such as the Labour Party that would countenance the political corruption involved in the passports for money affair has a cheek to lecture this country on ethics or to pose as our moral watchdogs.  The watchdog of labour &mdash; that famous newspaper we used hear about &mdash; is, in 1994, a comatosed, full bellied, toothless, broken spirited mongrel.  This Bill is not even a bark; it is a moral and intellectual whimper from a group of hypocrites.</P>

      <P>I invite the House to cast its mind back to a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; interview during the period of the interregnum following the last general election when the Government was being formed.  Deputy Quinn conceded on that programme that Labour Party members and supporters were having a problem with what he called, &ldquo;the culture of Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the Labour Party's response to the culture of Fianna Fáil.  In fact, in the words of the sponsoring Minister, <Col N="621" /> Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, the Labour Party attaches so much importance to this Bill that it is &ldquo;the price of Government &rdquo;, or at least in those first heady days of the new Government in February 1993, it was the price of Government.  Minister Fitzgerald has learned a lot since then about the culture of Fianna Fáil and the price of Government.  Most people would question whether Labour has a price for being in Government. or, more correctly, a price for not being in Government. Even Minister Fitzgerald, who is an honourable politician, must have some doubts about whether one can legislate to constrain the culture of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I have on occasions, with other Members, attempted to outline for the House my view of what constitutes the culture of Fianna Fáil.  Suffice to say on this occasion that in my view it is not possible to legislate for it.  The only way to combat the culture of Fianna Fáil is to ensure that that party is allowed to examine itself regularly for long periods in Opposition.  Fianna Fáil in Government is unable to resist temptation, is fatally prone to helping its friends and is fervently convinced that it is all in the best interests of the country.  The Labour Party could have said &ldquo;no&rdquo; but, like Molly Bloom, it said &ldquo;yes, yes, yes&rdquo; and now Minister Fitzgerald wonders why her new partner is philandering at night with property developers and missing at weekends playing golf with foreigners who want Irish passports so that their children can play for Ireland in the World Cup. No amount of legislation will encourage Fianna Fáil to stay in the marital home, taking the empties to the bottle bank and addressing the threat of THORP.</P>
    <P>Within weeks of the marriage being consummated, Fianna Fáil was at it again.  It suggested a tax amnesty for big time tax cheats.  Labour fretted and wondered what kind of woman did Fianna Fáil really think it was.  The Taoiseach told them to grow up, marriage was all about give and take and that all of the money would be given to Minister Howlin anyway for good works.  Labour capitulated and this has set the pattern <Col N="622" /> for the remaining period of office of this Government.</P>
    <P>Tax amnesties for the rich friends of Government Ministers or passports for rich foreigners who coincidentally invest in family enterprises connected to Government members are the kind of ethical questions that I would expect the Labour Party to deal with.  This Bill addresses none of those issues.  Instead, we have the spectacle only this week of Minister Stagg stoutly defending the way the Government and his senior Minister are handling the implementation of the urban renewal Acts.  Can Minister Stagg be unaware of the enormous advantages conferred by this special tax designation on favoured developers?  Can he be unaware of the unprecedented extent of financial contributions to the Fianna Fáil Party over the course of the recent European election campaign in the hope that the Minister will smile on their particular site when the decisions have to be made? Does he think the rest of us are fools?</P>
    <P>One of the remarkable aspects of this Government is that the stridency of Labour support for its coalition partner is in inverse proportion to how left wing the Labour Deputy was perceived to be in Opposition and Minister Stagg and others are the prime examples of that.  In the case of Minister Stagg, he denies that this is a Coalition Government.  He explained to RTE reporters at the time of the formation of the Government, having resigned the party Whip a few months earlier because of his objections to coalition, that this was not a coalition, it was a partnership Government which he would be fully supporting.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister has conceded, seeks to provide for a register of Members' interests and my party supports such a requirement.  However, it does not reflect the Minister's aspirations for it as referred to in her speech of 19 February 1993 when she promised, &ldquo;I hope to have the heads of a Bill ready in the next week or so for submission to Government&rdquo;.  The Minister outlined her hopes and expectations for the Bill.  The long lapse in time probably explains why <Col N="623" /> the Bill falls so far short of her expectations. She told the House:</P>
    <P>Separate legislation will provide for the declaration of political donations, State fundings of political parties, and limits on campaign spending. Together, these form an important package which will serve to enhance the political process and remove any suspicion of hidden influences on the action of those involved in politics.</P>
    <P>I agree that taken together such legislation may, subject to scrutiny, constitute an important package serving to enhance the political process.  The electoral reform Bill does not exist.  When and if it is published, will it deal with the issues in the manner claimed by Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald and in several media briefings given on behalf of Government in those first heady days of Government?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assured Members on several occasions that the two Bills will be published in tandem.  He said he was tired telling us that the Ethics in Public Office Bill, formerly called the Ethics in Government Bill &mdash; we see now why it is no longer called the Ethics in Government Bill, Deputy McDowell dealt with that &mdash; and the electoral reform Bill were to be published in tandem.  On Tuesday this week I asked him about the electoral reform Bill and his promise to publish both in tandem.  I asked him if it would eventually emerge in a truncated fashion. The Taoiseach replied he never said the two Bills would be published together but would be &ldquo;discussed in tandem&rdquo;.  Even if I accept the Taoiseach's distinction I am puzzled as to how the two measures can be discussed in tandem as the debate on one started today and the other has not been published.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McDowell said, this is not an ethics in Government Bill but a declaration of interests Bill.  In the absence of the electoral reform Bill in the form promised, it is not possible to evaluate whether this Bill has merit beyond the simple declaration of interests requirement. Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald warned the House in February 1993 that there was <Col N="624" /> little point in trying to re-establish public confidence &mdash; the point being that it had clearly broken down as Fianna Fáil was in Government and the Labour Party solution to re-establish public confidence was to put it back in Government &mdash; if the legislation concerned was clearly full of loopholes as it would then have the opposite effect.  The Minister is right. Apart from the loopholes in the Bill the biggest loophole is the missing electoral reform Bill which was designed, the Minister of State said, to put a ceiling on financial contributions to political parties, impose limits on campaign spending and so on.  It is no secret that we have not seen anything like the fund raising blitz carried on by the Minister's partner in Government in the weeks preceding the European election.  Is the Minister saying that as soon as the debt is cleared and the tax designated streets are selected and so on we can have an electoral reform Bill that will put a ceiling on financial contributions to political parties?</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed in its present form it will be open for one member of Cabinet to exercise influence for the purpose of conferring a benefit on another member of Cabinet.  It will remain possible for one member of Cabinet to benefit from a decision of a colleague without having to declare that he or she will so benefit. It is only where a Minister has a material interest in the personal performance of his or her functions as Minister that he or she will be obliged to furnish a written statement setting out the facts and the nature of the interest.</P>
    <P>The existing guidelines for Government, as I established at Question Time a few weeks ago, require a Minister to draw the attention of Government to the fact that he or she or his or her family has a material interest in the matter before Government.  Despite the existence of these regulations we know that in the pet food passports affair &mdash; it is clear from the Taoiseach's reply to me on 14 June &mdash; he did not draw the attention of the Government to the fact that he, not to mention his family, had a material interest in the issue.  The Taoiseach gave the impression he had severed his connections <Col N="625" /> with the company 14 years ago and the news media faithfully reported that impression, none more so than RTE, but he finally admitted that day he had a 41 per cent shareholding in the company. He is the largest single shareholder in the company.  The remainder of the shares are predominantly, if not exclusively, held by members of his family yet he did not bring that to the attention of the Government.  That is the only inference one can take from his refusal to answer the question.  Yet we are asked to pass legislation which has sufficient loopholes to ensure it will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.</P>
    <P>This fantastic distinction to which Deputy McDowell referred between the onus on Members to declare and the onus on Ministers is the most gaping loophole of all.  Members can propose but the Government disposes.  As Deputy Currie said, seeking to purchase political influence from him will not be worth a great deal and, with all due respect to him and others in Opposition, nobody will invest a great deal in us.  It is Ministers who have influence if it was for sale and I do not suggest it is.  What is the need for section 14 (1) (b) which states that the only requirement on a Minister is to give a note to the Taoiseach saying &ldquo;Dear Taoiseach, I would like you to know that I stand to benefit from the decision I or the Government are about to make.&rdquo;? That is the end of the matter.</P>

      <P>I said I would come back to the question of the media, which was also raised by Deputy McDowell.  The extraordinary thing about the RTE coverage of the passports affair was that snippets were taken from the exchanges in the House on several occasions which, of course, reflected their actuality for those seconds but did nothing to convey the seriousness or the detail of the issue involved.  It presented the Taoiseach in the best possible light, batting in what was a ploy at election time by Opposition Members. The presentation it gave of the Taoiseach's position was misleading and not in accord with the facts.  This is hardly surprising.  When did a current affairs programme on RTE television last do investigative work worth mentioning?</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell dealt at some length with the editors of newspapers who are so frightened at the prospect of the Taoiseach spreading libel writs around like confetti that they will not deal with the issue, with the result that major matters of fact go unreported.  He could have added to the editors of the newspapers to whom he referred the editor of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This extraordinary position is merged with his express wish to excise any reference to comments by Members who raise these issues and of whose parties he does not approve.  This is not healthy.</P>
      <P>I do not question Minister Fitzgerald's integrity or commitment to do the things she said she would do in her speech to restore confidence in the democratic process. However, Members are equally entitled to comment on the performance of some sections of the media in dealing with these issues.  They have been lamentably deficient in their coverage of the performance of the Government in this area.  The contrast between the attention they devoted to the former Taoiseach and his handling of public affairs and the attention they devote to the present Taoiseach is unhealthy.  Even if it is a candidate for an important telecommunications franchise which the Government will give out, it is not sufficient justification for a major newspaper group to write laudatory editorials of the Taoiseach in the passport mess when others in this House tried to raise important issues of public policy relating to that issue.</P>
      <P>I agree it is important for Members of this House who are lobbyists for commercial or other interests outside this House to openly declare that, and be transparent in this House.  If somebody is lobbying for an oil or mining company or a property speculator it is important it is evident here.  It is a glaring defect in the legislation that there is no requirement for the Minister who will make the decision on the oil exploration and mining licences or special tax advantages for property speculators to be investigated or inspected.  A good example of this is what I describe as the Tanaiste's Inspector Clouseau style investigation of the files in the passport affair.  It is too fantastic for serious contemplation by this House that one would have expected the files to contain the essence of what every child knows happened in that case. The legislation is seriously inadequate in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stand by the Labour Party on the <Col N="628" /> publication of the report of the beef tribunal will be relevant in terms of how this House assesses its commitment to bring ethics into Government as this Bill progresses.  If a situation is contrived whereby this House will not have an opportunity prior to the recess of considering the findings of the sole member of that tribunal it is regrettable in the extreme.  It is essential for the Labour Party to get from Government a commitment that, just as in August 1990, this House will be reconvened to consider the findings of the report of the beef tribunal after reasonable notice is given to Members.  This would be consistent with the position of the Leader of the Labour Party when he was in Opposition.  Anything short of this allows for a whitewash and a continuation of the campaign which has run for some considerable time in the media and by Members to shift the focus from the important issues of public policy at stake and considered by the tribunal to the cost to the taxpayer and who was responsible for the tribunal being convened. These are now the issues rather than the serious issues of where politics meets business in this society, issues which caused the tribunal to be set up.</P>
    <P>Until the Government is prepared to put a cap on financial contributions to political parties and to require transparency in that area it will be impossible for us to make a judgement on the legislation, half a Bill, before the House.  I am not suggesting that the situation in this country is anything like in other societies.  For example, it is now accepted as part of political life in Washington that people who served for a short time in Government as senior and important advisers to it cannot wait to disengage themselves so that they can become advisers and lobbyists on behalf of other economies and teach them how to circumvent the laws they helped to put in place when they were working for Government.  I do not think we have reached that stage here but it is important to provide against it.</P>
    <P>Our reputation as a trading nation has <Col N="629" /> been brought into question by some of the issues which led the Labour Party to promote this Bill in the first instance.  It is the kind of issue with which the editor of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> does not want to deal.  What price putting at risk the reputation of this country as a trading nation if we are seen as a dodgy country where Government and elements of business are hand in glove and where normal rules do not apply?  These are some of the issues being examined by the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry from which, whatever the outcome, our public affairs will be all the healthier.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast the stance of the Labour Party in Opposition with the Labour Party in Government.  If the Labour Party was prepared to address issues of Dáil reform other than those before us, for example, in the area of the efficacy of the parliamentary question, I would have a great deal more conviction about my support for this Bill.  The parliamentary question is so often used as a device to be economical with the truth, or for downright deception, that on occasion it is rendered almost meaningless. We saw the extraordinary revelation before the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, that there was a letter of commendation from a superior to a civil servant commending him on having thrown the questioning Deputy off the scent.  Is that the purpose of a Member of this House seeking to elicit information, that the Executive compliments itself on managing to throw the Deputy off the scent?  One of the revealing things about that tribunal of inquiry was my discovery of the background briefings on ministerial files, on the potential supplementary questions, that might be asked by the Opposition. It would be marvellous were those distributed to the Opposition in advance of the real Question Time but, seeing that that is unlikely to happen, if Ministers were required to answer questions, give the information openly and honestly to the thrust of the question, our democracy would be better served.</P>

      <P>I begin by commenting on Deputy Rabbitte's contribution and his description of the Bill as a prophylactic. Having spent no small effort in the past year advocating the use of prophylactics, it is not a bad description because it gives a sense of security &mdash; I hope more than a false sense of security &mdash; to the population as a whole and is a very useful device in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time has elapsed since the original Private Members' Bill, which I suppose was the genesis of this one, was introduced by me on behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party in this House. Three main issues were encompassed in that Bill, including the establishment for the first time of a register of Members' <Col N="631" /> interests.  The Bill sought to deal with the issue of gifts to members of the Government. Members will recall that, at the time, there was some unease about very elaborate gifts given to a member of the Government.  It also dealt with the issue of contributions to political parties.  All of those issues I felt, as did the Parliamentary Labour Party at that time, was essential to restore and maintain confidence in public administration in this country.  Unfortunately, that Bill was voted down by the Government of the day which included Members of the Progressive Democrats' Party.  Indeed, I remember having discussions with Members of the Progressive Democrats on the day.  They did beat their breasts and say how much they would have loved to support the principles enshrined in that Bill but, being practical, pragmatic politicians, they marched faithfully through the lobbies to vote down the first Ethics in Government Bill introduced in this House.  Therefore, it is left finally to a Government composed of the Labour Party, and to a Labour Party Minister, to bring the specifics of a new Ethics in Public Office Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>What motivated the introduction of this Bill was the restoration and maintenance of confidence in public administration here, a very important concept, the maintenance of confidence in our democracy.  We have seen an erosion of confidence in democracies well beyond these shores in recent times.  I say this most sincerely to Members of this House; we have seen political parties that have held sway in Governments in parts of the European Union disappear.  We have seen parties who have held office in countries like Canada being virtually wiped out.  There is a feeling among electorates, not only in this country but elsewhere, that standards need to be maintained in public office and administration.  This Bill is about ensuring that that is achieved.</P>
    <P>It is important for all of us that there be complete openness and transparency in public office here, in our Legislature and in Government.  That is what the Labour Party promised the electorate <Col N="632" /> before the last general election; that is what we are about to put in place; that is the way it is going to be.  I might express one word of caution, and I say this advisedly, we should not let this debate pass without mentioning that we have been and are very well served by our public representatives and public officials.  We do not have some of the scandals that have arisen elsewhere.  The introduction of this Bill should not be advanced as an excuse for any hurlers on the ditch to comment on the very high standards we have been fortunate to maintain in public administration, and in our representatives, since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill is as much a protection of the Members of this House and of those engaged in public administration at the highest levels as it is a safeguard for the public.  I heartily welcome it on that basis as well.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Michael McDowell focused almost exclusively on the business migration scheme.  He laced his contribution with his usual personal abuse but, primarily; his clear message was a simple one, that the Progressive Democrats are bankrupt of ideas, bankrupt of policies and becoming increasingly bankrupt of personalities as they too disappear from their ranks.  They do not represent anyone anymore.  They are desperate for any role to maintain themselves in political business.</P>

In relation to the business migration scheme I want to say that on a serious issue it gives rise to concern.  For that reason the Government has said it will be reformed.  It will be transparent and there will be public confidence in all the business done by this Government.  This is a reform that was not brought about <Col N="633" /> when the Progressive Democrats held office.</P>

      <P>It is important for us to be very honest with ourselves.  We understand the political motivations of trying desperately to score points.  The other point made by Deputy McDowell and echoed by Deputy Rabbitte was in relation to the media and its role.  I have the highest regard for the importance of the media as the watchdog on public administration, on Government and on the Legislature.  By and large they do a good job.  I do not always agree with them.  Very few people who read the national media, particularly the Sunday newspapers, would believe they are supporters of my party.  Our experience during the past 18 months since we assumed office would be the reverse. Notwithstanding that, I do not take it upon myself to attack the media.  They have an important role to play in ensuring that we are constantly nudging ourselves to have the most open and transparent form of administration it is possible to put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> Putting this type of legislation into force is not easy.  Legislation, according to Deputy Rabbitte, is inadequate.  There is not going to be a mechanism available that will guarantee beyond doubt that there can never be shady or underhanded actions.  This Bill was worked on, from the time we went into Government, by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who has put endless work into ensuring it is model legislation that will be followed by other Governments and other Legislatures in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the beef tribunal I wish to restate the commitment already given by the Taoiseach that there will be a full debate on the report in this House.  Other issues raised include the Electoral Bill. That Bill, which is complex and difficult, is at the final stages of preparation.  It will include the commitments given in the Programme for a Partnership Government. There will be a cap on campaign expenses allowable and a ceiling on contributions to political parties.  Before the end of this Government's term we will introduce a freedom of information Bill which will also address many of the points raised by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to his ability to get what he regards as adequate answers to the parliamentary questions.  That is our firm commitment and it will be delivered upon as our other commitments, outlined in such detail in the Programme for a Partnership Government, were delivered upon in every other area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>This is a landmark Bill.  We have never had a similar Bill dealing with ourselves, the conduct of our own business and the conduct of Government in the history of this Dáil.  It is a landmark Bill and I know how difficult it was to bring the Bill to this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the side of their mouths the Progressive Democrats told me they would love to support it but they voted it down.  I then brought it before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where it was debated for two years. I know, although I will not put on public record because of privilege, the attitude of some parties opposite when it was debated in that forum.  Finally, due to the persistence of the Labour Party and the fact that it is enshrined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it is now brought before the House in a form that, I think, will be welcomed by everybody of goodwill who is well disposed to positive open government and open administration. It is a landmark advance which nobody pretends is perfect in every detail but is a huge step forward.</P>
      <P>If there are relevant and positive suggestions from the Opposition benches the Bill will go before the select committee and the goodwill which the Minister of State has shown from the start of this process will be continued in that committee.  Positive amendments will be accepted which will help to improve the Bill.  This will give us not only the safeguards the public require but the safeguards which are right and proper in any open and transparent democracy.  It will be welcomed by people who know the positive changes this Government has brought about in the practical areas of health, education, housing and social justice.</P>
      <P>Now it is our turn to deliver on our commitment to put trust into politics. There are many outside this House and, unfortunately, some within who would erode our democracy by carping and undermining the values that underpin public life and draw people into public service.  Some of us resent it, particularly from those who come here on a part-time basis because they are earning their main living elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the tremendous work of my colleague, the Minister of State, in bringing the Bill to this stage.  It is a <Col N="636" /> landmark Bill that will restore and maintain public confidence in our important institutions at a time when institutions across the world are being eroded.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Laoighis-Offaly</i>): There must be no good cases in the Four Courts today.  It is sad that Deputy Michael McDowell has to resort to this device continually to ensure that he has an audience. Unfortunately, his actions and comments feed the cynicism of politics about which Deputy Currie spoke so well in his contribution.  While Deputy McDowell has a good turn of phrase his comments were typical of his actions in this House and the attitude of his party which both inside and outside this House has preached morality and ethics but when in Government did nothing to put them into practice.  Yet, when somebody else tries to put in place an innovative measure all he can do is sneer and jeer. This is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said he is not happy about the provision on the declaration of interests he will be forced to make under this Bill.  Perhaps that is what is worrying him but, given that efforts are being made in difficult times to preserve and promote democratic ideals and practice, he should adopt a more responsible approach in terms of his attendance, behaviour and contributions in this House.</P>
      <P>If these provisions had been in place a number of years ago when there was a golden circle, in the glare of media attention, there might have been no need to go through the long drawn out and expensive process of establishing the beef tribunal where the Deputy's colleagues made much money so that the public could get answers to questions which should have been answered in this House.  I welcome this Bill as it marks an effort to dispel this cynical attitude to politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> Deputy McDowell used the phrase, &ldquo;a moral and intellectual whimper from a group of hypocrites&rdquo;, in concluding his contribution.  I wonder was he referring to his party?  At least the Labour Party has taken upon itself to formulate and present to this House wide-ranging legislation which will not only affect Ministers but other office holders, Members of this House and senior officials in the public service.  This constitutes action; all we had from Deputy McDowell was words. Who is the hypocrite?</P>
    <P>This Bill will be of real benefit to these Houses in that it provides for greater openness as regards Members' business interests.  The disclosure of interests by all Deputies and Senators in a public register will demonstrate to the public that their elected representatives have nothing to hide and if they do it will become transparent.  Perhaps that is what is worrying many Members.  The public have a right to know that we act on their behalf.  The disclosure of certain private interests will demonstrate to the public that there is a clear separation of public and private interests.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about a snooper's charter as it has been described by some people; we are trying to make it clear to the citizens of this State that we are working on their behalf and that if there is a conflict of interest there will be a mechanism to deal with it.  The Bill will require Members to make <i>ad hoc</i> public statements when speaking or voting on a matter before the Houses in which they or a connected person has a material interest.  I welcome this provision as both the public and other Members will be made aware if there is a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept this Bill as it will help to strengthen democracy.  If both Houses put it into practice and show the public that it works we will have done a very good job.  As the Minister of State mentioned, power and finance here, as in other countries, are interconnected and becoming more difficult to unwind.  This measure, in so far as it applies to Members, will be of help in unravelling this web.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> There are other areas where an attempt needs to be made to untangle the web.  I hope that those working in the media will adopt a similar attitude in their profession which, as has been mentioned, contributes to public life.  Given that it now faces competition from the English tabloids there is a danger that standards will be lowered.  I urge those in the journalistic profession to consider the possibility of putting a mechanism in place under which complaints made by the public could be investigated and dealt with.</P>
    <P>During the past fortnight I was accused of going to the World Cup in three newspapers which I found difficult to redress. I would welcome the establishment on a voluntary basis of a forum at which members of the public could seek redress.  If this could be done in the area of journalism, if this Bill is implemented, when the Labour Party honours it commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to bring forward the electoral Bill and, more important, a freedom of Information Bill, we will have done a good job in dispelling the cynicism which is eating at the heart of public life. If this trend is not reversed this country will be open eventually to sinister influences which are taking root in many mainland European countries.  It is up to us, as politicians, to ensure that this does not happen here.  This Bill marks a good attempt to do this in the sphere of politics. I urge other sectors to do the same and commend strongly this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Tugann an Bille seo deis dúinn scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an méid a bhí le rá ag Pairtí an Lucht Oibre nuair nach raibh siad sa Rialtas agus ag an Taoiseach nuair a bhí sé sa Rialtas.  B'fhéidir go dtaispeánfaidh sé sin go bhfuil gá leis an reachtaíocht seo in oifigí poiblí, ach tá sé deacair a thuiscint cad iad na dearcanna a bhí ag na daoine éagsúla nuair a bhí an Bille seo os ár gcomhair in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I looked up the record of the debate on the Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill, 1991, introduced by <Col N="639" /> the Labour Party, I was amazed at the comments of the Taoiseach, then the Minister for Finance.  At column 2285 of the Official Report of 7 May 1991 he stated:</P>
    <P>At the outset, I have to say that the Government do not think the introduction of legislation to deal with the topics referred to in this Bill is either necessary or appropriate.</P>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach in 1991, legislation on ethics in Government was neither necessary nor appropriate, but something has happened in the meantime. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I hear Deputy Howlin tut-tutting. The introduction of this legislation leads me to remark on what a remarkable change of direction the Labour Party have taken in Opposition compared to what they advocated in Government.  What a remarkable about-turn.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's views on the about-turn of the Labour Party when in Opposition compared to when in Government could be a topic for a long debate in a public house?  The public are now talking about the about-turn of the Labour Party in Government compared to its views in Opposition.  That also begs the question about the about-turn of the Taoiseach in allowing this Bill to come before the House.  In 1991 he made strong arguments about why such legislation was unnecessary.  There have been many about-turns since 1991.</P>
    <P>In column 2286 of that report the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is well known what the Labour Party advocated and what was and was not done when they were in Government. They should take their medicine and not try to pretend they are something in Opposition that they were not in Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is probably saying today that the Labour Party should take its medicine and not try to pretend it was something in Government that it was not <Col N="640" /> in Opposition because Members of the Labour Party certainly stood on their heads when the Government was being formed and in a sense made it necessary to introduce ethics in Government.  We may not need a Bill, but we certainly need certain standards to which the Labour Party should live up.  Instead, it has let the show down and gave probably the worst performance ever by a party in Government once it was appointed.  It appointed relatives as advisers and so on. It is costing us a fortune to keep this Government in office and it is falling apart already.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that a Member of this House cannot accept a gift without questioning its value.  Why should we have to say to a person giving us a gift that we cannot accept it because if we do we will have to hand it over to the State?  Surely in any walk of life gifts should not be valued monetarily, it is the thought that should count.  If I received a gold fountain pen with my name inscribed on it from a mad Sheik, as a token of the fact that I may never be a Minister, what would I do with it?  Why should I have to hand it over to the State?  In time to come it should be possible for members of my family to be reminded of the great politician who went abroad and was presented with a gold pen.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomed the legislation in 1991 and we welcome this Bill, but in my view it is much ado about nothing and will not do anything in terms of ethics. It is similar to a see-through blouse, it promises much but will be blurred in the end.</P>
    <P>In regard to gifts, in 1991 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>I do not understand how any reasonable person could require an elaborate, statute-based scheme on the lines proposed in this Bill.  Deputy Howlin appears to see a bribe attaching to every gift and avaricious Ministers grabbing everything that is offered to them, but that is not the reality.</P>
    <P>What has happened since then?  Does the Taoiseach see a bribe attaching to every gift, or has some avaricious Minister convinced <Col N="641" /> him that the reality is that there is an absolute need for this legislation?  That was not the position in 1991, only three years ago.  In column 2288 of that report the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has an exaggerated view &mdash; I know he has not had the experience of office &mdash; (which was unfortunate so close to an election) of this whole area of gifts.  I think he has an illusion that if he became Minister it would be the key to Aladdin's Cave or that everywhere he would go he would be showered with very valuable gifts, but I will give him the benefit of my experience, and I am sure many people in the Opposite benches will corroborate what I am saying.</P>
    <P>What has happened since then?  Has Deputy Howlin found an Aladdin's Cave to enable the Taoiseach to suddenly change his mind, or has the Taoiseach found an Aladdin's Cave?  I would like the Taoiseach to examine his speech of 7 May 1991 and explain to the House why he has seen a light somewhere along the way to Damascus.  In column 2288 the Taoiseach went to say:</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has expectations of becoming a Minister (which is true because he was always ambitious) and thinks that most of the gifts he would receive on various occasions would amount to close to £200 he is in for a shock and he will be very disappointed indeed.</P>
    <P>Has the shock been that the gifts are worth £500?  The Taoiseach was not even prepared to accept that the gifts were worth £200, but their value has been increased to £500.  Why has that happened? Have gifts become more expensive, have people become more generous or is the Taoiseach anticipating what will happen when his excellent Ministers go abroad and are showered with gifts?  On 7 May 1991 the Taoiseach further stated:</P>
    <P>The question of gifts is over-elaborated by Deputy Howlin.  I am sure he knows the reality of life as much as I do.  If he was less hypocritical about <Col N="642" /> our views on the Labour Party and what they stood for in previous years he might be presenting a different case. Maybe he did not know what they stood for then.</P>
    <P>That was prior to taking up office in November 1992.  The Taoiseach did not even know what the Labour Party stood for when it entered Government and somersaulted, caused consternation and let down those who voted for the famous change.  The chickens are coming home to roost, as the Minister of State is well aware.  Indeed, many of them are still flying and have not landed yet.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I could be ruder than that as far as the Labour Party is concerned.</P>
      <P>With all the power at his command in 1991, the Taoiseach went on to say that he did not see any need to change the existing situation and even were changes needed, the Bill's provisions would be so easily evaded as to make it worthless in the prevention of unethical conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): In referring to the Bill's provisions being easily evaded, I hope the Taoiseach was not thinking of minor matters such as £1 million being given to companies, matters which would be completely outside the scope of this Bill.  This Bill is merely a mirage and will not make the slightest difference to the Government's behaviour. If Ministers want to abuse their positions, the Bill will not prevent them from doing so.</P>
      <P>In column 2290 of the Official Report of 1991 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further reason that this area should not be singled out for regulation on a statutory basis.  I am not at all satisfied that the proposed section accords with the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under Article 15.10 of the <Col N="643" /> Constitution each House of the Oireachtas has the exclusive right to determine its own rules and procedures.</P>
    <P>Was the Taoiseach talking off the top of his head when he referred to Article 15.10 of the Constitution being breached by the 1991 legislation?  Has he received legal information since then to say the article will not be affected?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I hope that is true, otherwise it would be ridiculous.  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>I ask the House to join me in rejecting this Bill which, on close examination, is seriously defective.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will tell us about all the changes that have been made so that we need not concern ourselves about the mental state of the Taoiseach in doing such a somersault in a short time.  If the Taoiseach was right all the wrong provisions in the 1991 Bill are still wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Maybe.  I hope in the closing speech we will see a performance that will convince us the Bill can stand up to critical analysis according to the Taoiseach's standards and the views he held when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated she sincerely hoped that in the process of debating and passing this legislation we can begin the process of restoring trust in our democracy and dismantle some of the cynicism and negative perception of politics and politicians which undermine confidence in democratic institutions and in democracy.  That is the type of language <Col N="644" /> the Labour Party used in Opposition.  I watched Deputy Spring fold his arms, lie back against his seat and savage the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The Deputy was full of ideas.  Is it innocence on the part of the Labour Party or brass neck that made the Minister read such a statement following what her party did on entering Government?  Members of the Labour Party talked about standards and ethics but we all know the party failed miserably to live up to any standards in Government.  The media is not harming the party at present, it is merely reflecting what the public say about its standards.  The collective brass neck of the Labour Party may have allowed the Minister to make that statement but I am amazed that the party does not now gently slide out of the partnership, look to the future and hope that things will improve.  The Minister had an opportunity to make her speech and she set herself up as a target by laying down ideal standards about restoring trust in our democracy.  How can people have trust in a democracy and in politics when they see politicians behaving in the opposite way from when they were in Opposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): The Minister's Leader said on one occasion that before a party could join Fianna Fáil, it would have to be taken to a sheep dip or something equivalent, and washed out.  Since then nothing happened, in fairness to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have not seen it being driven into sheep baths. The parties kissed and made up and the Labour Party did not give a tuppenny curse as long as it got into power.  As soon as it saw the leather in the Mercedes, it brought in as many family members as possible to work here.  The Labour Party <Col N="645" /> preaches standards.  Fine Gael has reasonable standards, we do not talk about them too much but in reality we live up to those which the Labour Party has failed miserably to live up to.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the value of the Bill earlier. The details are not worth going through.  We will all declare we have nothing and we will put it on record but maybe some busybody or journalist will write about the paupers in politics or the people who have money.  I do not see what influence politicians have.  Does it matter a tuppenny curse whether I have money in the Bank of Ireland, the Allied Irish Bank or an investment company? What can I do about that?  Many people who have an influence on public opinion will not be covered by this Bill, but we will be.  It is grossly unfair that spouses, who out of sheer love and kindness marry somebody &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; because I do not wish to be accused of using politically incorrect language &mdash; will have to declare their interests.  In future, people should carry a health warning saying &ldquo;this person may become a politician&rdquo;, if they do, the person who marries them will have to declare their property.  Why should a spouse of independent means before becoming impoverished by marrying a person in a normal walk of life &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;normal&rdquo; purposely &mdash; who subsequently becomes a politician, have to declare an interest they may have in a boutique or shop?  What has that to do with the public and what influence does it have?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): The politician's spouse or children must declare their interests.  I am glad the Minister gave me my next clue.  The Bill includes penalties for revealing confidential information.  The Minister's Leader was involved in information published in a newspaper that appeared to be leaked from his office about Northern Ireland.  Did the party find anybody guilty?  No.  Will anybody be found guilty as a result of this Bill if confidential information <Col N="646" /> is revealed?  No. Journalists will have the right not to reveal the party as is customary.  A Member could be lambasted in a newspaper and I regard the provisions about confidential information as poppycock.</P>

I welcome the Bill, it is harmless, but it could embarrass people who might not want their confidential information revealed.  I do not have enough trust to believe that someone will not leak information at some stage.  I look forward to the Minister's reply and I hope the Taoiseach will reiterate the views he held at an earlier time.  They are important now because the Bill is basically the same as it was then.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo mura ndéanann sé tada ach an fhírinne a thabhairt amach.  Le fada an lá táimíd i bFianna Fáil ag cloisteáil scéalta agus innuendoes ó lucht an Fhreasúra ag cur in ár leith gur dream áirithe muid a bhfuil saibhreas á dhéanamh againn as mí-úsáid na polaitíochta. De bharr an Bhille seo nó aon Bhille eile <Col N="647" /> dá leithéid a thabharfar isteach, leireofar nach fíor é sin.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill if it does nothing but lay to rest the constant innuendo against the Fianna Fáil Party, its Members and its public representatives in particular.  For a long time now, going back to the 1940s, every leader of Fianna Fáil, every Fianna Fáil Taoiseach has been subject to attack and innuendo because of personal affairs.  This started with the Locke affair in the 1940s, in relation to which a public tribunal was set up, and has continued ever since.  I hope this Bill will put an end to that.</P>
      <P>The people have proved very wise over the years.  They know their public representatives and it is not by chance that for the last 60 years they have confirmed the status of the largest political party. To say they did that and, at the same time, believe the charges constantly levied against us is to label the people as fools and say they did not know their own public representatives.  That, of course, is not true.</P>
      <P>I regret one omission from the Bill, namely, that some of us will not have the opportunity of giving a list of our liabilities which, for some, would be much longer than the list of assets.  I will look with interest to see how many Deputies from all sides of the House do not have other income exceeding £2,000.  It would be interesting to find out whether there is any significant statistical difference between the number of Deputies in each party who live solely on their salaries as Members of this House.  I believe there is no significant difference.  This Bill will put to rest the imputation that Fianna Fáil is the party of the big people, of people on the make and involved in shady deals.  In regard to those who do not want to believe the truth, there is nothing that can be done.  When very young I learnt a basic fact of life &mdash; one can declare all one's interests and those who do not want to believe will not.  That is one of the mysteries of the human person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty about declaring the details that must be declared.  However, I hope the media will not misuse the <Col N="648" /> information given and convey impressions that are far from the truth. I, for example, am a director of a cooperative and two companies in which I have no material interest and from which I will never get any financial gain.  These are community enterprises and my directorships are purely for the purpose of supporting local initiative.  However, if I am described in a list as a Dáil Deputy and company director it will be quite easy for somebody who does not want to know the truth or does not seek the truth to conclude that I get huge financial benefit from those directorships.  Even the truth is not always the whole truth.  There is an obligation on the media to give a fair, full and unbiased report of the information given by us in good faith.  To do otherwise would be a travesty of justice and a misuse of the information given.</P>
    <P>In politics, we are our own worst enemies because for cheap political gain we attack each other and make innuendoes about each other.  This damages the credibility of politics.  I believe all Members of this House are in politics because they believe in what they are doing, and that there is no financial gain for them in being in politics.  Most Members would be better off financially if they had never entered this House. However, to listen to some of the contributions, one would not think that.  It does a disservice to politics, to the work we are doing and to the people to give the wrong impression about this issue.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem about a Bill like this, in that it deals totally with the material influences such as directorships, gifts, etc.  People in politics can be influenced not just by material considerations but by the people they associated with, even if there is no financial spin-off.  That is something we will never be able to tie down in law.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when I was involved in employment I concluded that for good staff no rules were needed and that for those who wanted to cheat, no rules would hold them in.  Ethics is about individual commitment, with or without laws to hold us in.  It is about our individual commitment to honesty, fair play and <Col N="649" /> serving the people who elected us.  The Members of this House are here because they believe in that ethic.  I have no doubt that if they deviated from that ethic their harshest judges would be the people who elected them.  They are the final guarantors of ethics in public life, particularly in regard to those of us to whom this Bill refers, who are elected Members and subject at regular intervals to the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach, fáiltím roimh an mBille seo mar, thar aon rud eile, cuireann sé deireadh leis an ionsaí 40 bliain atá á dhéanamh ar Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil len é a bhaint anuas agus dochar a dhéanamh dó mar nach féidir a chur in ár leith go bhfuilimid mí-éifeachtach i Rialtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us has been eagerly awaited.  It has been the subject of media debate and speculation. It contains provisions about which I would have misgivings but is no less welcome for that.  Now that it is before the House it should be judged on its merits.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to make it abundantly clear that the desire to ensure ethics in public life is by no means confined to one political party.  It is shared by all of us who sit in the Houses of the Oireachtas, right across party lines.  I hope that in the debate on the Bill there will be thoughtful and constructive suggestions on this matter and that subsequently the Minister will be open to accepting amendments in order to ensure the Bill is an effective instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was introduced not to rectify any perceived misbehaviour or wrongdoing on the part of Members.  I do not share the public or media cynicism regarding politicians.  However, if the Bill helps to deflate some of this cynicism, it is an added bonus.  The Members of this House are hardworking and conscientious. The reason the Bill caused some annoyance when first proposed relates to the perception that it started from the premise that politicians are inherently untrustworthy.  It is understandable, therefore, that Deputies and <Col N="650" /> Senators might feel somewhat offended. However, this is not the premise behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two main reasons for the Bill, the first is to bring us into line with standard procedure in EU member states and the United States where the annual declaration of interest is commonplace. The best comparison is the annual register of interests of Members of the House of Commons.  This Bill will institutionalise here what is essentially common practice in other countries.  In the coming years I assume the provisions of the Bill will be accepted as part and parcel of the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The second reason for its introduction is in the interests of transparency.  We are living in an era of great change in political and financial life.  Many matters have become more complex and in the interests of transparency we must respond to this complexity.  I have referred to the integrity of Members and this Bill will put that integrity on the record for all to see.  The purpose of the Bill is not to question the integrity of Members but rather to ensure that all business is seen to be done in a clear and open manner.  That is not to say that I am fully satisfied with its provisions. There is room for improvement.  I will refer to that later.</P>
    <P>In debating the Bill it is useful to reflect on the broader issue of ethics in politics. There has been much discussion on ethics in public life in recent years.  However, much of it has been narrow in focus and viewed through a rather distorted prism. As a result we have seen the emergence of a new and unhealthy strain in Irish political life whereby the pursuit of so-called ethics is measured in terms of personal vilification and the hounding of individuals.  For a time it seemed that the real traits of good politics, those of common decency, hard graft and solid commitment, were being replaced by false piety, righteous indignation and cruel smear.  I lament that this strain in Irish politics is most closely associated with one political party, the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that since the Irish people showed them the door in the European elections the Progressive Democrats have been moaning that they never meant to be perceived as plaster saints, but that is utterly untrue.  Chipped and shop-soiled it may be, but plaster saints the party remains.  This was very evident in what I can only describe as the bilious and pompous statement of Leinster House's resident football hooligan in pinstripes, Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>

      <P>When listening to this bile, this hate-filled contribution I asked myself, could this be the party that reneged on its promise not to accept ministerial pensions?  Could it be the party that sits in the Seanad today, a House it has vowed to abolish, the party that has tore itself apart because of its hunger for just one Euro seat?  Since its inception the Progressive Democrats has sought to canonise itself as a patron saint of political rectitude while simultaneously pursuing a policy of selective political assassination.  However, it is now abundantly clear that the Irish voter has seen through the ruse and, in doing so, I hope, has drawn to a close an era of personalised and vindictive politics, because that is not what ethics is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it ethical to throw unsubstantiated smears across the floor of this House? No, it is not.  The Progressive Democrats do not occupy the high moral ground, and never have done so.  They are much more comfortable wrestling in the political gutter, hurling abuse, forever negative.  That is not what ethics is about.  We all know what the Progressive Democrats ethics is.  Ask Deputy Pat Cox about the Progressive Democrats' ethics.  No Law Library theatrics can disguise the simple fact that the jury has <Col N="652" /> returned the verdict on the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>While I accept the broad thrust of the Bill and the bulk of its proposals, there are provisions about which I am concerned. As regards the <i>ad hoc</i> declarations of interests, the proposal that such declarations be published in the Order of Business is superfluous and more than a little over the top.  It would serve only to encourage prurient interest. It should suffice simply to declare these interests, should they arise, to the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I fully support the establishment of a select committee of each House of the Oireachtas to investigate complaints about Members and to report back to the House.  However, I sound a strong note of caution here.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and I have seen how the legitimate work of the committee can be hijacked for party political purposes.  In the run-up to the European elections there was a great deal of publicity, with people involved in high jinks as Euro candidates, jumping through the hoops in an attempt to gain the headlines. Given that the three Euro aspirants are now back with us, I hope we can get on with the very important business of the House.  Bearing in mind these colourful experiences, I hope the select committees, given the responsibilities they must discharge, are not abused in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The key to the long term success of the Bill rests in its ability to strike the correct balance between transparency and the public interest on the one hand and the legitimate right to privacy on the other. For that reason I have some reservations about the scope of the term &ldquo;connected person&rdquo;.  I hope that the Bill, in its application, will not lead to unwarranted intrusions into the lives of ordinary people who happen to be related or connected to a politician.  I trust the Minister will scrutinise the application of this aspect of the Bill to ensure there is no infringement of privacy.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provision that addresses the growing phenomenon of using political representatives as paid <Col N="653" /> lobbyists and consultants.  This practice is part of the political culture in America and is also well established in England.  I do not know how prevalent the practice is in Ireland or if any Members are working in such a capacity, but it is an unhealthy trend, one which I hope this Bill will discourage.</P>

      <P>The country's animal health status has not been diminished since the advent of the internal market.  However, the removal of systematic border inspections and the discontinuance of quarantine for imported farm animals means that there is greater exposure to disease risks.  It is critical that importers and farmers exercise every possible vigilance in order to keep these risks to a minimum. My Department will continue to inspect and monitor imports to the maximum extent permissible under European Union rules.</P>

      <P>There is also a very heavy responsibility on importers to make every effort to ensure that the animals they are importing have been tested fully and have a satisfactory health status.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in February the House of Commons agricultural committee instigated an inquiry into the health controls on the importation of live animals to the UK?  It is in both our interests that the UK and Ireland stand together on this issue.  I have serious concerns about the present importation of live animals since the Single Market took effect.  Will the Minister consider tightening up the controls and joining with the UK authorities to ensure that we continue to enjoy our present high animal health status?  Since the introduction of free movement of animals in and out of the country has the Department been notified of any outbreak of exotic diseases or an outbreak of a more virulent strain of an endogenous disease?  Is the Minister aware of the serious veterinary concerns about this? Is the Department taking its responsibilities as seriously as it should to protect our animal health status on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>No exotic animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or classical swine fever have come into the country. A couple of cases of Johnes disease have been found on imported cattle &mdash; but this disease was already in the country &mdash; as well as a few cases of warble fly <Col N="655" /> infestation, which have been treated.  It cannot be said that the animal health status here has deteriorated because of the Single Market.  There have been a few reports of imported cattle being of poor quality and sickly, but these would be contractual issues between the purchaser and the vendor.  Obviously, there is no connection between the Single Market and BSE, for instance.</P>
      <P>By the large we are coping well since the operation of the Single Market, but I take the Deputy's point that we must at all times be hyper vigilant.  However, let me stress that those who import animals have a great responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the concerns being expressed here and in the UK on the present regulations governing the free trade in animals since the Single Market, would the Minister agree to review this matter in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  I have serious concerns in this area.  What concerns me about the present operation of the regulations is their potential to damage our animal health status.  Will the Minister agree to a review of the operation of the present regulations?  It is not only disease that is being imported, but as the Minister is probably aware &mdash; certainly the Department is &mdash; the number of culled heifers that have been imported and which have turned out to be free-martins. We need far greater scrutiny of how the system is operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 43 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>According to CSO statistics the value of live cattle exports in 1991 and 1992 amounted to £67 million and £70 million respectively.  Comparable statistics for 1993 are not yet available.  These figures do not include the value of export refunds paid on these animals which, for example, amounted to £13 million in 1992.  My Department estimates that 374,442 live cattle were exported in 1993 and that 155,476 live cattle were exported up to the end of May this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some level of live exports provides for greater competition in the marketplace and, of course, trade conducted in accordance with EU law may not be restricted.  Nevertheless, I am aware of the implications for employment of high levels of live cattle exports.  Because of the greater benefits to the economy from exports of beef it is Government policy to provide a generous range of State grants for investment in plant and machinery, for research and for market promotion by the beef processing sector. <Col N="657" /> It is also Government policy to ensure that EU support mechanisms provide effective encouragement for the export of beef in processed form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned about the recent statements of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, on live exports.  Does the Minister of State agree that the essential criterion in this entire debate between live and dead meat exports is that balance must be brought into the equation?  The Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, has come down heavily on the side of meat processors, virtually against live exports. Does the Minister remember what happened in the 1970s when there were no live cattle exports and how farmers throughout the country were left with one arm longer than the other?  Does he remember what happened in the 1980s when there was a single tender for intervention? That was another cartel, effectively aided and abetted by his Department, because only those who sat around the table in the Burlington had any say.  With competition farmers are now getting a reasonable return for their animals, particularly for the poorer quality stores for export.  I would urge the need for balance.  I ask the Minister to bring balance to his argument.  There will be plenty of cattle for the meat factories, but we must keep the live exports to ensure a fair price to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle that balance is the key to the question of live cattle exports versus beef processing.  It would not be fair to say that my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, has come down against live exports.  My colleague and I have taken the position that, as the Deputy said, it is a matter of balance.  Obviously, there needs to be competition in the marketplace to protect the producer.  A cartel among the meat factories is of no benefit to the producer. I like to take what I believe is the long term view.  The market for live cattle exports to Third World countries is volatile. We have had a very high level of export to these countries.  We have had <Col N="658" /> an excessively high level of live exports last year and so far this year.  If those markets were to suddenly disappear for any particular reason or if, because of competition or whatever, we could no longer command such a high level of exports to those markets, that would have the effect of producing a glut on the home market which would not be welcome.  In the long term interests of the producer, the processor, and, indeed in the interests of employment, we should aim to ensure within EU regulations that the processors are guaranteed the supply of animals that is required so that they can expand market share in terms of the EU markets.  Those are our main markets, I believe stability will come from there, but there must be a level of live exports also to maintain balance in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is in the interests of the European Union to ensure that these live exports to third countries continue as the EU is marginally in surplus in terms of cattle production? Finally, is it Government policy, through the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to pressure the EU to reduce export refunds on live exports to third countries and what is the Minister of State's opinion on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the matter on an EU-wide basis, it is obviously in the Union's interest that live exports continue. In the context of this country, where we produce eight times the amount of beef we need, we have a different problem but certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the refunds have been reduced twice and the matter will not arise again until October because the last reduction will not have an effect on the market until then due to a pre-pricing structure operated by live exporters.</P>

Apart from beef and milk, the Commission price proposals for 1994-95 involve minimal changes for those sectors of interest to Ireland.  Essentially they involve implementation of CAP reform decisions together with consequential or other adjustments to related measures.  I can detail some of the proposals for the Deputy, but he can rest assured that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make every effort to ensure that a package is agreed that is in the best interests of Irish agriculture.

    <P>Generally payments are not refused because of incorrect or insufficient information being supplied by applicants other than in cases where it is found that <Col N="662" /> a false declaration has been made.  The problem is that failure to complete properly an application form leads to delay in processing an individual case for payment. An undue amount of staff time is taken up pursuing additional or correct details.  By way of example, some 40,000 or 50 per cent of the June 1993 special beef premium applications were deficient in one way or another and required furether correspondence from the Department. Our experience is that, in a high percentage of cases, several reminder letters have to issue before any response is forthcoming.  As a result, staff time which would otherwise be devoted to making payments is taken up with query cases often to the detriment of farmers who have taken the care to submit correct applications.</P>
    <P>Detailed statistics are not maintained in relation to the number of cases under each scheme where payment is delayed, reduced or ultimately disallowed.  In practice, many problem cases are eventually paid but farmers who are careless with their application or who fail to supply all necessary details will at best suffer delay in receiving payment and, at worst, receive reduced payment or none.</P>
    <P>Because of the considerable expenditure involved, the EU Commission lays down very specific conditions for the filling of forms and complying with other requirements.  However, penalties have been eased in the CAP reform arrangements following representations from the Department and greater tolerances are now allowed before total loss of payment occurs.  We are continuing to press the Commission for greater flexibility and expect further progress on that front.  I must, of course, make it clear that false declarations will continue to be severely penalised.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuously monitoring all aspects of the schemes with a view to keeping administrative procedures as simple as possible within the constraints of the EU Regulations and to ensure that penalties are seen to be fair and reasonable.  Help sheets are available with all scheme application forms and, in <Col N="663" /> addition, assistance is available to farmers by way of information seminars held throughout the country by the Department in conjunction with Teagasc and through the Teagasc CAP consultancy service.</P>
    <P>There are appeal arrangements within my Department open to farmers who are not satisfied with decisions on applications for premium and headage grants. In accordance with a commitment by the Government in the context of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> I am at present considering ways of improving these arrangements and, in particular, of putting in place a more formal appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I announced a £4.8 million investment to develop and upgrade computer facilities and other resources, particularly in local offices of my Department, with the objective of achieving the optimum delivery of my Department's services to farmers, with special emphasis on the timely payment of headage and premia grants. Given the very substantial increase in the volume of applications in 1993 and the new integrated control system introduced under EU regulations, I believe that the record level of payments achieved speaks for itself.  The additional resources which I have obtained from the Government will result in an even higher level of payments being achieved in 1994 and subsequent years.  My objective is to secure a streamlined system for the delivery of all direct payments to farmers which is as simple as possible while remaining consistent with EU regulations.  Considerable progress has already been achieved and with the additional computer resources being put in place, I am satisfied that my objective will be fully realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That comprehensive reply deserves more study than I have time to give it today.  Does the Minister accept that there is total chaos in the delivery of payment under the headage and premia schemes?  How many farmers are on the stop list?  The Minister should <Col N="664" /> distinguish between false and inaccurate declarations.  The vast majority of them are inaccurate, not false.  Could we have more user-friendly application forms? Even forms filled in with the aid of Teagasc advisers are returned under the heading of false declaration.  How can farmers win if the Teagasc adviser does not get it right?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give farmers a printout of the state of play of various payments? There are a few dozen schemes where payments are made in one-third and two-third instalments.  A farmer is unaware of what he has been paid for what year, what he is due and what he can expect for the balance of any year. They cannot tell financial institutions or merchants where they stand with these payments.  Will the Minister put a system in place which will ensure farmers receive a balance sheet or updates?  That would relieve pressure from the beleaguered agricultural offices around the country.</P>

      <P>The June 1993 special beef premium applications posed particular problems and it was decided to carry out a sample analysis of 400 cases. The results were as follows: No identify cards &mdash; 129 cases or 33 per cent; invalid tag numbers &mdash; 121 cases or 30 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a problem in terms of processing.  There was no date of birth in 39 cases or 9 per cent; duplication of applications, 31 or 8 per cent; problems at inspection, 13 or 3 per cent; wrong application form, 13 or 3 per cent; no signature, 3 per cent; female cards, 2 per cent; other problems, 5 per cent; the number of problems now solved represents 4 per cent.  In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Government committed itself to maintaining and improving existing procedures for dealing with complaints arising from decisions in individual cases and, where these channels are exhausted, to put in place arrangements under which farmers <Col N="665" /> will have the right of recourse to formal appeals procedures.</P>
      <P>The recent appointment of regional HEOs to co-ordinate the work of local offices in their regions adds a new element to the procedures for dealing with complaints.  In future problem files originating in local offices will be directed to the regional HEO for examination. If he or she cannot solve the problem the file will then pass to Castlebar or Portlaoise for further examination. Consideration of a proposal involving the appointment, probably in the Dublin head office, of a number of appeals officers to deal with appeals under headage and premia schemes is at an early stage.</P>
      <P>I will examine the feasibility of having printouts.  As the system is further computerised that may be possible, but I will not give a commitment on it.  However, I will investigate the idea to see if it is possible to put an appropriate arrangement in place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teagasc Authority recently unanimously recommended that the director be removed from office. <Col N="668" /> Section 7 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, states that the first director shall be appointed and may be removed from office at any time by the Minister and that each subsequent director shall be appointed and may be removed from office at any time by Teagasc with the consent of the Minister. The consent of the Minister has not been sought in this case.  There is a tradition that public servants are not referred to in this House and I will observe that practice.  All I will say is it seems from reports that a proposal will be submitted by Teagasc to the Department and obviously serious consideration will have to be given to any such proposal.</P>

      <P>Following an inspection visit late last year by EU veterinarians serious deficiencies were reported in three Irish meat plants from a total of twelve plants inspected.  Minor deficiencies were reported in the remaining plants.  Details of these deficiencies have been communicated to the plants concerned and my Department is supervising the measures necessary to correct them.  Of the three with serious deficiencies, one ceased operations temporarily in order to effect a full refurbishment of the plant which is almost completed, another had its operations severely restricted until remedial action was taken and is following an approved programme to correct structural deficiencies, while the third plant has remedied its operational deficiencies and has submitted a programme which has been approved by my Department for remedying its structural deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is quite serious, that it takes inspection by the European Commission to discover serious deficiencies in a quarter of the plants investigated and lesser deficiencies in others?  Would he comment on the fact that these plants had already been approved by his Department and indicate to the House how it is that there is a discrepancy between the <Col N="673" /> finding of his Department and those of the European Commission examiners and say how he intends to rectify that discrepancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 30 plants which slaughter for the export trade.  Three categories apply in Ireland and the 12 plants here would fall into the third category. Within the general context it should be stated here that the standards of our slaughtering facilities in terms of our export trade are as high or somewhat higher than those obtaining in quite a number of other EU member states. There is a fourth category of unacceptable slaughtering facilities in member states but we do not have any in that category.  The 12 plants which are the subject of this question were visited two years ago.  On the second inspection it was found that nine had minor problems. Three had major problems but, as I said in my reply, those are being addressed.  An effort is being made by the Commission throughout the Community to bring slaughtering facilities up to the required standard in line with the relevant directive so that, at the end of the day, they would fall into the first category.  Some of the difficulties that occur, particularly in the case of the smaller plants, can occur in a structural sense; but it must be realised that structures cost money and there is also a time element involved.  In three of the 12 plants in the third category, effective remedial action has been taken since the veterinary inspection carried out between 21 October and 5 November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister outline to the House in as much detail as possible the procedures pursued by his Department in hygiene inspections of abattoirs that process meat for export, which is the category about which we are talking?  Would he agree with me that the inspection procedures for this category of abattoirs would be much better than the category of abattoir covered by the Abattoirs Act of 1988 which dealt with abattoirs engaged in slaughtering for the domestic trade, where there is insufficient <Col N="674" /> staff, whether professionals like veterinarians or health boards staff, available to implement the requirements laid down in that Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If a particular abattoir is substandard or a health hazard my Department would close it down pending remedial action.  The approach adopted within the Community is to allow people time to come up to standards.  The same applies within the context of the 1988 Act.  Smaller abattoirs which slaughter for the small domestic market are given every opportunity to come up to standard. As the Deputy will know, if these abattoirs do not make an honest attempt to improve slaughtering standards, they are closed down.  The Deputy will see that there is a continuous thrust in an attempt to raise standards.  Standards in relation to slaughtering for export and for the domestic market are very high within the context of overall European Union standards, with a continuous effort being made to improve them.  This will be abundantly clear from the action taken following the inspection which took place in the autumn of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is a matter of concern that we have a two-tiered method of examining these slaughterhouses, in that procedures adapted for exports appear to be given priority over the domestic market?  Is it not true that there was a recent examination by the European Commission of domestic market abattoirs which was also critical of the standards of the smaller scale abattoirs?  Is that true or not?  I am not referring to the inspection carried out two years ago but to the more recent one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the inspection to which Deputy McManus alluded but I shall check on the points she has raised.  It would be wrong to give the impression that different standards apply to different sectors.  For instance, some abattoirs that slaughter for export also slaughter for the home market. However, we have a high concentration of smaller abattoirs, quite a lot in some <Col N="675" /> counties, possibly killing one steer and a couple of sheep a week and operated by self-employed people.  Once there is a perceived substantial movement to improve hygiene standards and so on we are tolerant.  For the very reasons the Deputy elucidated, we deal severely with those who may give the impression they will take action but do not do so.  I might add that such abattoirs are being closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is very similar to that of Deputy McManus, which is that we really cannot condone much longer a two-tier health and hygiene standard for abattoirs.  I am sure domestic consumers would not like to realise that the standards required for the home market are less stringent than those applicable to the export market.  Are the provisions of the Abattoirs Act, 1988 being fully implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to draw a distinction between all aspects of the relevant directives in relation to export, which can relate to the size of premises and so on, so that it will be seen we are not comparing like with like.  It is not correct to talk in terms of a two-tiered system.  The general question of slaughtering facilities is something with which I have been concerned since assuming office in this Department.  I am pursuing a number of initiatives with a view to achieving greater progress, although I would not be in a position to disclose exactly what I am talking about at this time.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a system at all levels in the food and processing chain that gives an absolute guarantee to the consumer. To use the jargon of the expert group report which we discussed recently, it is a consumer-led industry.  It is abundantly clear to everyone that the consumer is much more demanding nowadays and it is my intention to respond fully on all fronts.</P>

This is obvious in my own area which deals with food processing.  Is it not true also that practically all the plants operating for the export market also operate, perhaps on a small scale, for the domestic market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could refer to the original question.  Eighteen plants were not considered to warrant a visit during the recent inspection.  Nine of the 12 plants which were at the lower end of the scale came through that inspection two years on.  Of the three plants with serious deficiencies one temporarily ceased operations.  High standards apply throughout the food industry.  I agree with Deputy Leonard that it would be wrong if an impression went from here that there was a hygiene problem with our product.  That must be avoided.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied regarding the level of training of agricultural officers for handling specific meat products?  One will recall &mdash; I do not want to allude overly to it &mdash; from the beef tribunal that one of the problems seemed to have been that the agricultural officers, in many cases, did not have specific training in day to day working with meat and meat products.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that of the 12 factories inspected by the EU officials a quarter were found in breach of the regulations?  What were his officials doing who visit these plants, and who inspect the meat from them?  The new health and safety regulations and the slaughterhouse regulations place a heavy financial burden on small operators for the home market to meet these standards. Has the Minister considered granting financial assistance to enable them to achieve these standards bearing in mind that where there was farm pollution, farmers were granted assistance to clear up that problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question asked what my officials are doing.  They constantly write to the various meat plants <Col N="678" /> bringing to their notice practices which could be improved.  That would have happened in the two year period following the inspections carried out by the EU.  At the end of the day there is a consideration throughout member states with the Commission to give people time to comply. Some people here did not use that time to comply and did so only under pressure. Obviously I cannot be satisfied with that. I am aware of the problem regarding abattoirs which slaughter for the home market and I am working towards providing assistance in that area but nothing has been finalised.  Some of these abattoirs are considerable employers in their local areas, in that they buy from local producers and provide a good service.  I am sympathetic to them and I am endeavouring to afford some assistance in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to abattoirs in the home market has the Minister received any complaint about the conduct of his officials inspecting existing abattoirs where the owners have been given vague directions as to what the regulations require of them?  Is the Minister aware that in some cases people who spent £40,000 to £50,000 developing their premises are now threatened with closure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the operator of the abattoir to provide a proposal of the works to be carried out and a timescale for their implementation.  I take the view that if a particular operation is a health hazard it has no place in the Irish food chain.  I have not had direct representations in relation to vague instructions.  There is an onus on the person operating the abattoir to provide a costed proposal in terms of the works proposed to be carried out and the timescale <Col N="679" /> for their implementation.  The Department will not be draconian in that area.  We have a responsibility to the consumer which must be discharged in full.  On the other hand, where substantial moneys are involved for small operations, it is only fair that people are given latitude to effect improvements on an incremental basis.  The time-frame cannot go on forever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Will the Minister agree it would be in the public interest to publish these findings?  We have now got to the stage where that is the most effective way of ensuring standards are met.  The results of the inspections of the larger meat plants should be published.  In relation to the smaller abattoirs I understand the Minister is reviewing the Abattoirs Act.  When does the Minister expect to have a plan for dealing with the considerable staffing problems throughout the country?  The veterinary union has pointed out that meat is not being stamped in accordance with EU regulations in any country.</P>

Although time was given, the opportunity was not availed of.  It was only after the heavy hand was used that remedial action was taken.  It is my understanding that between 35 and 38 people are employed in the company concerned. <Col N="680" /> In the first instance, we have a responsibility to the consumer in terms of the quality of the product that they receive. On the other hand, there is a need to protect employment and provide outlets for producers.  Perhaps we could be more draconian in ensuring there is no health hazard and that standards are acceptable in inspecting meat for human consumption. The EU directive is so wide-ranging that it would be extremely difficult for any operator to fulfil all the conditions.  In publishing the findings damage could be done unfairly.

In view of the shortfall of <Col N="683" /> £1 billion for the National Development Plan, will the reductions which will have to be made in the operational programme for agriculture impinge on this scheme? I hope the need to control farmyard pollution will be given priority by the Department.</P>

      <P>Farm waste studies identified areas where intensive farming is carried on as having serious pollution problems.

      <P>I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Leonard.  Under the REPS scheme there is scope for development in that regard.  The REPS scheme is a non-capital one to encourage farmers to farm in an environmentally friendly manner, including a requirement that farmers adhere to a programme for collection, storage, management and disposal of all farmyard waste.  Obviously, a capital commitment must precede that to ensure a system is in place.  We must <Col N="684" /> be mindful of areas in which there is a high concentration of pollution and assist in every way possible to rectify those problems.  The programme for rural environmental protection affords the possibility to move forward on a number of fronts, although it may not be able to deal substantially with all the problems outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 January 1994 farmers applying for disadvantaged areas headage payments are subject to the same tax clearance procedures as already applied to all persons applying for grants or subsidies of more than £500 from Government Departments or public bodies.  At present however the tax clearance requirements do not apply to premium payments under the guarantee section of FEOGA.  The extension of tax clearance to EU assisted schemes took place following consultation with the Commission.</P>
      <P>The EU is not currently invoking infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome against Ireland on this matter.  The position is that the Commission's Director General for Agriculture has written to our permanent representation in Brussels expressing his view that our tax clearance procedures are not in keeping with Community law and has requested our observations on the points he has raised.  The issues raised are being examined by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Director General for Agriculture on his comments to the Department and I am glad the Minister of State has admitted that <Col N="686" /> today.  Does the Minister not agree that it is ridiculous to insist on a farmer having a tax record with the tax office, which may cost him up to £300, in order to collect £500 in premia from the Department when his only income is from social welfare?  Surely that should be waived. Instead of £500, the ceiling should be at a minimum of £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Clarification is necessary in this regard.  The tax clearance procedure does not apply to premia payments as they are funded solely by the EU.  Headage payments involved an element of national funding.  Tax clearance for headage payments was introduced this year on the basis that such payments are funded partly by the EU and partly by the Irish taxpayer.  That procedure has been in operation since 1988 for other publicly funded grants following the Minister for Finance's budget speech in 1987.  The position is that to receive grants of between £500 and £5,000 applicants must state the tax district dealing with their tax affairs, furnish their tax reference number and indicate that, to the best of their knowledge, their tax affairs are in order.  For grants of more than £5,000 applicants must produce a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners before the grant is paid.  The basic principle is that a tax defaulter or evader should not be allowed benefit from publicly funded grants.  There is no equitable argument against that.  There is no requirement to produce a tax clearance certificate for grants of less than £500.  I am surprised the principle of this causes concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that approximately 30 per cent of farmers whose land had poor law valuations of £20 or less have not yet been written to by the tax inspector?  It is clear that such farmers could not have a taxable income as they are at the lowest end of farm income.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.  Is it not ridiculous that the Minister should insist on such farmers, who will never be in the tax net, getting a <Col N="687" /> tax number from the tax office which usually involves employing an accountant to do his accounts at a cost of up to £300? Those farmers must go through that costly procedure to receive a grant of no more than £500 from the Minister's Department.  Does the Minister not agree that the ceiling should be £3,000 instead of £500?</P>

I am aware of a report which illustrates that when special attention was paid to certain areas much more money was forthcoming.  If a person's income is very low there should be no need for him or her to employ an accountant.  We are not talking about filling out a complicated tax form.  If the income of a holding arises from headage payments and disposal of animals I would have thought it would not be too difficult to convey information about factory receipts and headage payments and I do not understand why it should cost £300.</P>

The Government's use of this mechanism to force people who are not <Col N="688" /> liable to tax into the tax net will be proved wrong.

      <P>I have difficulty with the Minister's view of equity in this case. I do not see why the limit cannot be raised to a reasonable tax free allowance. The same equity that applies to farmers should have applied to people who participated in the beef tribunal; consultants did not have to produce their tax free certificates to earn hundreds of thousands of pounts.  PR consultants were employed who earned £500,000 in <Col N="689" /> one case and £380,000 in another.  The company which supplied the beautiful carpet in this Chamber did not have to supply a tax free certificate, yet it closed down owing the State £450,000 in revenue. The rules of equity which apply to farmers should apply to everybody else.  I sympathise with the Minister who comes from a non-farming background as he does not seem to grasp&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has 36 sections and two Schedules.  It sets up a number of new procedures and bodies and contains provisions for costs, for the award of costs and for the publication of reports.  In every respect it is entirely in keeping with the present Government's mania for bureaucracy and entirely in keeping with the Labour Party's devotion to interfering with everything in sight.  Since it has all those features, it is fair to ask if this Bill is really necessary and, looking at it carefully, I have to come to the conclusion that most of it is not.  The parts of this Bill that are necessary deal with Ministers and senior officials in the public service and in positions in public companies.  The rest of it is unnecessary and ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February last year we had a debate in this House on what were then proposals by the Minister of State in relation to ethics in Government.  A great many questions were raised during that debate. An examination of the record of that day &mdash; volume 426, column 4 &mdash; will show that the Minister of State had very few answers to the questions that were raised. I asked her, for example, if she could tell us against what kinds of abuses by Deputies and Senators the proposed measures were intended to guard.  I asked if she could indicate in what way Members of the Dáil or Seanad, in their capacities as Members of the Oireachtas, could misuse those offices for personal gain or for the benefit of people on whose behalf they might be acting.  Similar questions were put by my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, from Limerick East &mdash; the real Michael Noonan as we call him on this side of the House.  Deputy Richard Bruton made what I thought was a very telling point; he said that the provision for complaints to which the Minister referred on that day and which is now contained in the Bill refers not to complaints about Deputies or Senators misusing their office, having undue influence or making undue or illegal gains in some way, but to cases where Deputies or Senators fail to list some item of their interests deliberately or through error. <Col N="747" /> The complaints procedure in this Bill is not about unethical behaviour on the part of Deputies or Senators, it is about their failure to conform to the requirements of a bureaucratic system, the need for which has not been conclusively demonstrated.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and some of her colleagues on the Government benches pointed out that members of local authorities have to declare their interests in a register, similar to that proposed in this Bill.  They had the kindness to point out &mdash; although I do not see the relevance of it to this debate &mdash; that I probably would not know about this as I had never been a member of a local authority.  I do not know what point they hoped to make but I was aware of it.  Members of local authorities do not have to provide information for a register of interests of the kind the Minister and her colleagues mentioned on that day.  However, she neglected to mention two other vital facts.  The first of those vital facts which was conveniently forgotten is that members of local authorities, in that capacity, have some powers which find no parallel in the offices of Members of this House or the Seanad.  In the Houses of the Oireachtas we, the Members, take no executive decisions.  We pass legislation and vote moneys in the context of framing policy.  We have no connection with the implementation of policy in our capacity as Members of these Houses.  In many respects we are further away from the execution of policies we adopt than are members of local authorities from the execution of the decisions they make. The parallel is, to say the least, of limited and fairly doubtful value.</P>
    <P>The second fact which the Minister and her colleagues failed to mention is that to the extent that there continue to be allegations of unethical behaviour by members of local authorities, the declarations of interests which they are required to make clearly do not prevent these things from allegedly happening.  If there were any relevance in mentioning the declaration of interests by members of local authorities in the context of this Bill, it would be simply to make the point that what is proposed in this Bill cannot <Col N="748" /> have an effect against the kind of abuses that such declaration in local authorities seems to be designed to deal with.  The more the Minister and her colleagues insist on this, the more they are making the case that what is proposed in this Bill is nonsensical and pointless.</P>
    <P>It is hard to conceive of a situation &mdash; and I will come back to this again &mdash; where a Member of this House could have an improper influence on an executive decision, but we can speculate on how it might happen.  It is conceivable that a Member of this House, acting for his or her own personal gain or for the improper gain of some person outside the House, could persuade a member of the Government, a member of the Executive who is involved in making and implementing those decisions, to do something that would be improper.  That might happen, but if it did it would require the Minister to sin as well, and we could argue that if we had proper provision to prevent members of the Government from falling into that kind of error that would be all that was required. The Minister of State cannot deny my contention that there is no Member of this House &mdash; what this Bill calls &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Member of this House &mdash; or of the Seanad who is in a position himself or herself to directly affect any Executive decision unless a member of the Executive, a Minister or a Minister of State who has some function in the matter, conspires or co-operates in some kind of wrong doing.</P>
    <P>In February of last year the Minister of State indicated that she had been inspired at least in part by the system in operation in Australia.  I should like to remind her that in the course of the debate that day my colleague, Deputy Noonan, pointed out that if she intended to rely on Australia as an example, it was a bad one because the system in Australia does not seem to work.  Up to recently Australian politics were far more corrupt than anything the Minister or her knight in shining armour leader has ever alleged here.  If there is a declaration of interest system in Australia it is a good argument <Col N="749" /> for not having one here because it does not make much difference there.</P>
    <P>Examples abound of political systems where there is provision for declarations of interest but which witness spectacular allegations of corruption; in some cases there have been socialist parties in power who seem to have participated gleefully in the alleged corruption.  Declarations of interest of the kind mooted here, which is a 19th century idea, do not seem to have the effect the Minister and her colleagues claim.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed today that the Bill provides &ldquo;a framework in which any potential conflict of interest that might arise can be solved&rdquo;.  I looked through the Bill to see if I could find anything that would help in resolving a conflict of interest but there is no section that deals with anything or any action that could resolve a conflict of interest.  The Minister said, in a most remarkable speech &mdash; it has the fingerprints of a media guru &mdash; that the Bill &ldquo;is not about catching politicians up to their tricks&rdquo;.  If that is the case what is it about and why are we talking about an ethics in Government Bill?  The Minister said it is &ldquo;a recognition that the financial and political life of this country has become much more complex&rdquo;. I read the phrase several times and I would have to say, bravo, Minister.  I am delighted she and her colleagues have found out that the financial and political life of this country has become much more complex.  Many of us in this House realised that a long time ago and we did not need to produce a lump of legislative lead, as is this Bill, to come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate in February of last year and again today the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, did not give a single example of an abuse by Members of the Dáil or Seanad which this Bill could prevent, not did she signal any abuse to which the provisions of the Bill would even be relevant.  I would like her to tell me &mdash; maybe she is more ingenious that I am in these matters &mdash; in what kinds of abuse I could get involved.  I have interests outside this House; I lecture from time to time in the University <Col N="750" /> of Limerick and I carry out consultancy contracts for a firm that is on contract to the EU Commission in Brussels. I would like the Minister to tell me in what way I could misuse my position as a Deputy to favour unjustly the interests of the University of Limerick or the firm that gives me consultancy contracts on trade policy.  I cannot figure out what way I could abuse my position as a Deputy in doing those things.</P>
    <P>It would not bother me to restate those interests regularly in the House.  If we were debating educational issues it would not cost me a thought to stand up and notify the Ceann Comhairle solemnly that I lecture in the University of Limerick or that I carried out a trade policy consultancy for a firm that is on contract to the Commission in Brussels. All the other Members of the House &mdash; they might be here in numbers as we might have just had a quorum &mdash; would yawn and say, so what?  They would ask why I am saying those things because they would know there is nothing I can do as a Member of this House that would unjustly, illegally or reprehensibly favour the people involved.  This Bill will add to public debate about the activities of Deputies and Senators in this area but it does not deal with the real matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in February last year and again today that issues such as political contributions and so on will be dealt with in separate legislation.  The Taoiseach said they will be taken in tandem with this legislation, but there will be a big gap between the taking of this Bill and that legislation.  In February last year the Minister said that the heads of this Bill would be before the Government within a couple of weeks, but it has taken nearly a year and a half to publish it.  When will we see a Bill dealing with political contributions?  That would be a very interesting areas for examination.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputies saw an interview with Mr. <Col N="751" /> Gerard Collins, MEP, at the end of the European election count in Munster, a magnificantly understated interview, in which he made it very clear that he was accusing a fellow candidate in the constituency of Munster of spending a huge amount of money on an election campaign and he was accusing Fianna Fáil headquarters of spending a large amount of money on the campaign in favour of that candidate.  As far as we can discern &mdash; may be the Minister will inform us on this &mdash; a similar procedure was carried out by the Labour Party during the European election campaign in Dublin where large amounts of money were spent on one candidate and a good deal less, if any, on another.  That matter is to be dealt with in a separate Bill but I will not hold my breath waiting for that Bill to appear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eamon Walsh of the Labour Party told us in February of last year that the register of Members' interests provided for in the Bill &ldquo;will help to identify those powerful groups who interfere with the public process&rdquo;.  No member of this House needs to be told who the interest groups are.  We are innundated with documents, pamphlets and statements from them every day of the week.  Any Member of this House could draw up a directory of the interest groups who wish to have an influence on public policy but that is not the problem. There are the golden circles, the purchasers of passports, the the extended family united by ties of blood and politics, the special advisers, drivers, secretaries and all kinds of hangers-on.  These people have two things in common: they are involved in unethical behaviour and they are involved with Ministers, not with ordinary Members of the Oireachtas, and that is where they abuse arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill requires people to declare these matters but it does nothing to stop unethical behaviour.  The only thing that will stop it is a body of Ministers who believe what they say about ethics, who take seriously what they trumpet about ethics in this House and outside it and who regard ethics as more than a matter <Col N="752" /> of platitudes.  The Minister said today that lessons have been learned about the way in which appointments of relatives have been handled.  She believes the Government has &ldquo;put those lessons to good use in the changes to procedures and the completely open system for appointments now proposed in this legislation&rdquo;. What a wonderful phrase that is. When we consider that all those people are still in place, we have a true measure of the hypocritical smugness behind that statement.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no provisions to stop other forms of unethical behaviour. There is nothing that would have stopped the Taoiseach from claiming he secured £8 billion in Edinburgh, the Minister of State from claiming to be the Minister for £8 billion, the Tánaiste from maintaining that claim when the rest of us knew it was false, or the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach from claiming they did not need to make changes in a spurious national plan.  That aspect of unethical conduct is totally outside the provisions of this Bill and the Government has done nothing to deal with it.</P>
    <P>What I find sinister and cynical about this Bill is that it sets up a commission to administer this piece of political prurience and &ldquo;peeping Tommery&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill a commission will have power to send for persons and documents. I am a member of one of the select committees of the House and its <Col N="753" /> chairman is sitting over there.  Since the establishment of the select committees we have been asking that they be given power to send for persons and documents so that we can do the job the House wants us to do, that is, to oversee and examine Government activities and policies.  This power is being given to the &ldquo;peeping Tom&rdquo; commission but it has not been given to the select committees of this House and joint committees of the Oireachtas that might get somewhere near investigating what the Government is up to.  That takes the biscuit for cynicism.</P>
    <P>If this Government is interested in ethics it will scrap this Bill and avoid wasting the time of this House with this type of political prurience which is only a mask, a screen behind which to hide its utter abdication of every principle it ever stood for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of time for Deputy Dukes but his attitude today is extremely disappointing.</P>
      <P>This legislation was included in the Programme for Government on the insistence of the Labour Party and a commitment to introduce such a Bill was a central plank of the Labour Party's input into that programme and this legislation is being introduced in the first half of this Government's term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fulfilling that commitment; in fact, this Bill exceeds what is required.  I cannot emphasise sufficiently the importance the Labour Party attaches to this Bill.  The people whom the electorate choose to represent them and govern this State must be seen to be above suspicion.  There must be a clear separation of their public activity from their private interests.  This can best be done by making an annual written statement of personal interests that might conflict with public office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasingly, public representatives live in the glare of the media.  We hear of allegations of political abuse, corruption and scandal almost daily somewhere in the world.  We have had the Goodman affair with its allegation of political abuse and overtones of financial impropriety, the passports for sale saga accompanied by allegations of political abuse and financial reward.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State say this morning that she would be introducing an important amendment to cover that issue.  Let me remind the House that those matters relate to a previous Administration to which the Progressive Democrats, Deputy McDowell's party, was a partner. Regardless of what underpins these allegations they add to public cynicism and sceptism about politicians and the widespread belief that all politicians are on <Col N="755" /> the make.  We must demonstrate that we are not.</P>
    <P>The politicians I know in the Labour Party are hard working honest people with a genuine desire to help those less well of who see politics as a means of introducing change and improving the quality of life.  Having said that this Bill is not about scapegoating or witch hunting but about openness, accountability and bringing trust into politics.  It is contributing to the health of our democracy and that is why we, in the Labour Party, were insistent it would be an integral part of the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes beyond the required provisions in the Programme for Government. It establishes a register of interests and of gifts but this extends not only to Members of the Oireachtas but to senior public servants, board members of State companies, ministerial advisers, and includes the publication of all appointments by Ministers.  This will ensure they are of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>The procedures are also very strong in ensuring that complaints will be investigated. In the first instance we have the select committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas and then an independent commission of persons of the very highest level comprising the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad who will ensure that complaints will be throughly investigated and dealt with.</P>
    <P>This is the first part of a package of proposals to ensure accountability and openness in Government.  Deputy Dukes said there was no reference to the disclosure of public donations to political parties.  He knows that an electoral Bill is being drawn up that will cover that area.  A Bill on freedom of information is also being drafted and that will emphasise open Government and democratic administration.  This is just part of the overall package to ensure that the interests of public representatives are being brought into the public domain where they will be held accountable.</P>
    <P>During my perusal of the Bill I focused <Col N="756" /> on section 14, dealing with statements of interest by office holders in relation to performance of certain functions.  I was surprised to learn there were distinctions between how the Taoiseach, Ministers, Ministers of State and office holders were dealt with.  In other words, the Taoiseach will report to the chairman of the commission, Ministers of Government will report to the Taoiseach and all other office holders will report to the commission. Section 14 (b) needs to be examined again because there is no reference to what the Taoiseach will do. Will he refer any matter that comes to his attention from a Minister or Minister of State to the chairman of the commission? That is not specified in the legislation. We may be creating a merry-go-round without setting up the proper method of dealing with it.  I question the need for a distinction in dealing with those three categories of people.  I would prefer if they were all dealt with in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The legislation, in its thrust and content, is worthwhile.  The taxpayers expect their elected representatives who pass legislation affecting their lives to declare publicly any possible conflict of interest. Listening to the various views from Deputies of the far left, the far right and Deputy Dukes from the somewhat marshmallow centre right, it would appear they do not want this legislation. That leads me to question why they have so many reservations about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is that the case? If the legislation contains some faults, surely the Opposition should identify those faults and suggest amendments. The Opposition has been singularly lacking in identifying any provisions its Members intend to seek to amend.  From beginning to end they have engaged in a knocking exercise which leads me to suspect that many on the Opposition benches do not want this legislation. They are certainly not seeking to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> This legislation is necessary.  Other democracies have no difficulty with similar legislation.  We have no difficulty in having to declare our interests at local authority level and why the principle should be opposed to such a degree in our national parliament is beyond me. This legislation is necessary for parliamentarians and particularly so because the media is so often critical of politicians. Our democracy is being scrutinised in the full glare of the media, particularly our politicians, and we must ensure we enshrine in our legislation a set of principles so that the public will see that we are not on the make and that we are involved in politics in the interests of the people and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will lead to greater openness, transparency and confidence in Irish public life.  The Bills sets out clear and fair ground rules for identifying and resolving conflicts between public and private interests.</P>
      <P>The difficulty of resolving the question of public and private interests is as old as the history of government.  Almost 3,000 years ago, the philosopher Plato wrestled with this problem and in his famous <i>Republic</i> he came up with a slightly bizarre solution whereby the philosopher kings of the day were not allowed to rule until they were 40, they were not allowed to marry and they were not allowed to have any business interests.  Hence we have our famous platonic relationships today.</P>
      <P>That was obviously a harsh measure but an examination of the recent history of other democracies, will show there is a great need for these basic ground rules. Over the past two centuries most modern democracies, such as the United States and Britain, emerged from eras of pork barrel, Tammany Hall politics, and the Tory and Whig oligarchies in Britain who rewarded their main followers when they came to power by sustaining them and setting them up in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other democracies today have recognised the necessity for such legislation. In Washington, for example, there are <Col N="758" /> approximately 100,000 lobbyists whose sole job is to try to influence public administration and to persuade the Senators and Congressmen to follow a particular course of action.  Despite the fact that the United States has long had a register of interests, one of its most distinguished politicians, the chairperson of the House Ways and Means Committee, is under investigation because of the enormous influence of lobbying.</P>
    <P>Throughout the recent history of the United Kingdom there has been a remarkable correlation between people leaving high office under Tory governments and their immediate appointments to major positions in the private sector. Indeed, Britain is interesting in this regard and a recent article in <i>The Independent</i> gave a full and clear picture of the interests of MPs.  The headline in that paper referred to the fact that most MPs have some interests which are worthy of declaration and which the British public feels it should know about.</P>
    <P>In Italy recently a constitutional crisis was provoked because the interface between politics and business became hopelessly intermeshed.  There was virtually a peaceful revolution there and the whole system of government was changed.  One of Italy's political parties &mdash; a sister party of Deputy Dukes' party &mdash; was swept overwhelmingly from office.  Across many democracies there is a clearly perceived need for the type of legislation which Minister Fitzgerald has brought before the House today.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament, to which we have worked so hard to elect members recently, also has a register of interests and soon we will be able to examine it to learn of the interests of the 15 new Irish MEPs.</P>
    <P>The conservative parties here have always had difficulty in resolving the ongoing interface between business and politics.  A member of the Progressive Democrats rubbished the Bill this morning, saying it would be a mere prophylactic, yet that party received enormous support from the business sector on its foundation and continues to do so.  As my colleague, Deputy Costello, said, the <Col N="759" /> majority of TDs must live on their basic Dáil salary and will have very little to declare in the register of interests.  While there is little scope in parliamentary politics for earning large amounts of money in other areas the evidence of the past 30 or 40 years is that this type of legislation is necessary.  It is also a realisation of the Labour pledge in the Programme for Government, the first part of a three part programme which this Minister is bringing forward.  The first of those is this Bill.  It will be followed shortly by the electoral Bill which will deal with the funding of political parties and cap the amount of money to be spent on elections. Finally there will be a freedom of information Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the disclosure of interests by Deputies and Senators.  Section 7 requires us to disclose where we would have a conflict of interest in something we were speaking about.  I welcome that and the mechanism whereby the Ceann Comhairle's and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's office will enforce the regulations in part.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part III where the interests of Ministers, Ministers of State and office holders will be clearly delineated and the fact that we will know the connected persons through the confidential register.  I also welcome the Minister of State's comments today that she will bring in amending legislation to deal with the case where one Minister's decision could materially benefit people connected with another Minister.  The comments in relation to gifts are also welcome.</P>
    <P>An ongoing problem occurs where a person who held a high office in the public service leaves and operates in the same area in private business.  We should look at the area of senior office holders assuming important positions in private business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in relation to special advisers and agree with the Minister of State that the <i>cabinet</i> system is an effective one.  Up to 60 per cent of the Programme for Government has been or is in the process of being delivered. The 15 programme managers <Col N="760" /> deserve a great deal of credit for that achievement and I welcome the transparency that will apply.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary and will bring about the desired transparency in public life.  The public should know what our private interests are so that we may always act in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last Dáil session the Taoiseach promised 14 times that the ethics Bill would be published at an early date and it has now finally emerged.  As the Minister of State said, it is about building blocks.  She also said we cannot legislate for morality and no matter what rules exist people will not behave properly if they do not want to do so.</P>
      <P>There must be something wrong with the method of producing amendments or writing sections into the Bill if, after such a long delay the Government has failed to produce the wording that relates to the benefit that can accrue from one Minister to another if the action does not involve a Cabinet decision.  If this is central to what goes on in public life it should have been included.</P>
      <P>Much of this has to do with rumour and reputation.  This Bill did not begin 3,000 years ago but when the danger was presented to former Deputy Charles Haughey who, when he got out of his car anywhere in the country, was rumoured to have just bought a hotel, a public house or 200 acres of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise this issue of Irish newspapers being under threat from dumping by British publishers.  The dumping of British newspapers in Ireland has already caused 800 jobs to be lost, while thousands more are threatened by the price war.  Indigenous newspapers directly employ over 4,000 people in Ireland as well as providing massive upstream and downstream employment. They have a 75 per cent added value <Col N="761" /> compared with an average industry value of 46 per cent and play a vital role in the everyday life of the nation, playing a unique, cultural, political, social and economic role.</P>
      <P>Irish newspapers are totally committed to the wellbeing of Ireland and the people, seeing national and international events through Irish eyes &mdash; something that imported media can never do. Ireland suffers the highest level of imported newspapers.  One in four morning dailies and one in three Sunday newspapers is British.  The reality unfortunately is that Irish newspapers are expensive relative to imported newspapers. There is no single cause for this, although the following are contributory factors.  VAT on the cover charge at 12.5 per cent is the highest in Europe whilst British newspapers produced in the United Kingdom are zero rated.  Government decisions have had a negative impact on the indigenous industry.  The Casual Trading Bill has had the net effect of putting in doubt the future of many vendors.  The ban on tobacco advertising, despite the Minister for Health's assurance that a unilateral ban would not be imposed, and the lack of a freedom of information Act have also had a negative impact.</P>
      <P>Irish newspapers made massive investments in modern technology resulting in much improved and better presented newspapers.  They also invested heavily in reporting public service issues including news, business, the courts, as well as extensive coverage of political, social and cultural matters both in and affecting this country.</P>
      <P>British newspapers operate with nonunion manning levels achieved through radically different industrial relations legislation which further discriminates against Irish newspapers.  The indigenous industry has faced up to the challenges of a radical change in work practice with the minimum of internal strife and without the huge social unrest experienced in Wapping and elsewhere in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that British publishers are intent on destabilising the Irish market through the dumping of &ldquo;editionised&rdquo;<Col N="762" /> run-on copies at hugely discounted prices.  For example, the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> which has a normal retail price of 45p, is being sold for 20p by retailers who are credited on a coupon basis with 25p per unit.  When one takes away the distribution costs of 21p &mdash; this is made up of VAT at 5p, the newsagent's margin of 11p, the wholesaler's margin of 4p and carriage cost of 1p ; the bottom line is that they are dumping free newspapers, plus 1p on each unit sold.</P>
    <P>Another example is the <i>Sunday Times</i> which sells for 90p in Britain and which, when written up for currency values and VAT, should be sold for IR£1.05, and this is before the huge transport costs are added.  This paper sells here for IR£1, which is reduced to 60p for readers who have bought Saturday's edition of <i>The Times,</i></P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the transport costs involved.  Following Ireland's opening World Cup match the <i>Sunday Times</i> attacked the Irish market in a near military style last Sunday, landing delivery planes in Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Galway, Derry and Belfast.  The massive costs of this operation are clearly not reflected in the cover price of the newspaper. Another example is the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> which yesterday was priced at 65p here and 48p in Britain and which today is priced at 30p in both countries. Given the currency surcharge, transport costs and VAT at 12 per cent, this is clearly below cost selling.  The company must be absorbing these costs.  Although dumping does not technically exist within the European Union, this is below cost selling and economies of scale must enter into it.  The biggest selling Irish Sunday newspaper, the <i>Sunday World,</i> sells 270,000 copies, while the <i>News of the World</i> sells 170,000 copies in this country in addition to the 4.7 million copies it sells in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive approach much be adopted to the newspaper industry and a competitive policy arrangement for the print industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> radio and television must be put in place.  It is important for democracy that we retain a strong indigenous newspaper industry.  While <Col N="763" /> politicians and the press sometimes disagree, we need each other to fulfil the various functions we perform which are of critical importance to the well-being of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister should act on these issues as soon as possible.  It is not an exaggeration to say that unless something is done quickly the newspaper industry will be taken out of the hands of Irish people who have the interests of the country at heart.  Generally speaking, the media here is very responsible.  This sort of responsibility comes at a cost which is becoming more difficult to bear.  What we are witnessing is a major circulation war where the British publishing giants are prepared to take massive financial losses to win.  If our print media lose this war, part of our way of life will be re-colonised, so to speak, not to mention the 4,000 jobs at risk, approximately 400 of which are in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to respond to this matter of considerable concern to all Deputies and the wider public.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the difficulties facing Irish newspapers, particularly in terms of competition from newspapers published abroad, and is anxious to assist in whatever way possible. The question of VAT is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance. There are no plans to reduce the rate of VAT on newspapers, which is the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.  Newspapers became subject to that rate in the 1993 budget as part of a general realignment of the VAT rate structure whereby a single reduced rate was introduced. This was the first increase in the VAT treatment of newspapers since 1985 and was unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All newspapers sold in this country attract the same rate of VAT, regardless of where they are published.  A fact which is frequently misunderstood is that UK newspapers, although at a zero rate in the UK, are liable to the 12.5 per cent rate when sold here.  It is important to <Col N="764" /> point out that as a lower VAT rate here would have to apply equally to Irish and UK newspapers the price advantage enjoyed by British newspapers would not be diminished.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Finance Act provided an important concession to the newspaper sector in the form of an extension of the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate to newspaper advertising revenue.  RTE and the independent radio stations are liable for the 40 per cent tax rate on revenue from advertising sales.  This initiative should be of major benefit to the newspaper industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of competition law, there is no rule either at EU or national level that prohibits any firm from temporarily selling at a loss to gain market share.  The exception to this is the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order which prohibits selling groceries at below cost.</P>
    <P>Restrictive practices legislation was replaced in 1991 by the Competition Act. This Act prohibits anti-competitive arrangements which prevent, restrict or distort competition and the abuse of a dominant position in the market-place. An abuse of a dominant position could take the guise of below cost selling or predatory pricing designed to eliminate competition.  It is a matter for the courts to decide whether there is an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>Under the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which I hope to introduce in the House next Tuesday provision will be made for an independent director of competition enforcement who will have day to day responsibility for enforcement matters within the Competition Authority. Unlike the present regime under which an aggrieved party has to initiate the action in the courts, it will be open to the director to pursue an investigation in cases where he or she suspects there is an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent experiences, I share the concerns of the Deputy and other Members about what is clearly a very vicious and hotly contested price war among some British newspapers.  I am meeting this afternoon with a delegation <Col N="765" /> from the national newspapers of Ireland, at their request, to discuss these matters in some detail.  I acknowledge the constructive role played by the newspaper industry which is an integral part of the culture of this State.  This, and other aspects surrounding the operation of a commercial enterprise, will have to be taken into account by the Government in considering the action which can be taken on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter in the House.  The decision by the management of TEAM yesterday to proceed with the layoff of more than 800 workers was the most ominous development yet in what is one of the most serious crises in the public sector for many years.  If this crisis is not resolved not only will some 2,000 workers be dumped on the dole it will also spell the end for one of the few new industrial ventures in the public sector for decades, threaten the existence of Aer Lingus and cut a swathe of economic destruction through much of north Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the seriousness of the situation, it is hard to understand the bloody minded take it or leave it attitude of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his Cabinet colleagues. When Galway faced the Digital crisis in 1992 no effort was spared to save jobs; there were high level meetings, special Dáil debates and ministerial dashes across the Atlantic.  The workers in TEAM Aer Lingus got none of those considerations &mdash; just an ultimatum and a ministerial washing of hands.  Is it any wonder that more and more TEAM workers are beginning to wonder whether there is a hidden agenda involving killing off TEAM and the promotion, perhaps, of some privately-owned firms carrying out similar work?  Is it a Thatcherite agenda setting out to break the workers' trade unions?  Why are <Col N="766" /> Labour Party Ministers standing idly by? The workers are not responsible for the economic problems threatening to strangle TEAM Aer Lingus.  The workers did not undertake the initial viability assessment of the project; they did not get their sums wrong or badly misjudge the market and the competition the company was likely to face.  Therefore, the workers alone should not now be asked to carry the economic can for the TEAM crisis.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that TEAM workers want to defend their jobs and economic position to the maximum extent possible.  Many of them gave up secure jobs to work in TEAM, others moved to new houses to be near the job, taking on new mortgages and commitments. They, more than anyone, have a vested interest in securing the future of the company.</P>
    <P>With the support of the Government it should be possible to find a solution to the current problem which would secure the maximum number of jobs without impoverishing the workers and guarantee the future viability of the company.  We will face an industrial disaster unless something is done to break the deadlock. There must be negotiations some time and it is preferable to enter into them now, when there is something to save, rather than when the only task facing negotiators will be to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a difference of opinion on the Government benches.  The Minister said that the only matter to be discussed is the implementation of the report of the Labour Relations Commission. Labour Party backbenchers suggested that the report of the Labour Relations Commission and the trade union development plan should be on the agenda.  That seems to offer a possible formula for progress and it is astonishing that the Minister should reject it.  The Labour Relations Commission document is in the form of a report prepared for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  Therefore, there is no reason the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court should not <Col N="767" /> be requested to continue investigations at a number of levels, if necessary, to appoint consultants and even an independent chairperson to review all elements of this dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not question the bona fides of those who drafted the Labour Relations Commission document, which was prepared under great pressure and dealt primarily with the industrial relations aspects of the problem rather than with broader viability issue.  It largely took on board the proposals of management which were deeply flawed in the first place and appeared to take little account of the trade union development plan.</P>
    <P>This is not a routine industrial dispute, the problems arise from the economic condition of the company.  It is possible that cost savings as great or even greater than those proposed in the Labour Relations Commission document could be effected with the co-operation of the workforce through a well-based viability plan, but it must be done through co-operation between management and workers living up to the name of the company and acting as a team.  Neither management nor unions can impose their will on the other side, since victory for one may well spell ultimate defeat and disaster for both.  The Government, as a shareholder and the custodian of the public interest in the company, cannot stand on the sidelines and act like some disinterested observer; the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, should be in there encouraging, facilitating, prompting and doing everything possible to bring the two sides together.  Saving the company and its jobs rather than the niceties of industrial relations protocol should be the priority.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should be said that other seemingly impossible disputes in the public sector in the past, in the ESB and Bord na Móna &mdash; about which the Minister knows &mdash; and indeed in others have been solved.  Let the Minister now get off his high horse, look at the files, take a leaf out of the books of some of his predecessors and ensure that this <Col N="768" /> dispute is solved now before further damage is done to TEAM and perhaps to Aer Lingus itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, my motivation and that of the Government is not for the purpose of being bloody-minded, or of being on a high horse, although I am sure Deputy De Rossa's phrase is very catchy in media terms.  The seriousness of this situation is such that the finely measured arbitration that emanated from the Labour Relations Commission constitutes the only way forward for the short term survival of the company.  My motivation &mdash; and that of the Government &mdash; is to maintain employment in TEAM Aer Lingus; the Government's motivation is not to precipitate a crisis but to avert it.  The way forward and the framework for averting a crisis is available to us within the settlement terms put forward by the Labour Relations Commission.  Deputy De Rossa will be aware that there have been months of conciliation talks and discussions, on a bilateral basis, between management and unions.  I reiteriate that, as late as last week when the Labour Relations Commission put forward its report, they confirmed that there still was not a common agenda.  It has been the dialogue of the deaf and the arbitration put forward by the Labour Relations Commission, given the seriousness, gravity and urgency of the situation, constitutes the only way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that, if we could get agreement to the Labour Relations Commission's terms of settlement, we would immediately arrange to move to the other issues, that is deal with the medium and long term strategies. Indeed the Labour Relations Commission acknowledge, in clause 24, the potential of plans put forward, notably by the trade unions group, that as priority, the forum would examine those proposals &mdash; apart from examining any other proposals for medium to long term strategies &mdash; for the enhanced viability of the company in the future; that is the level of priority being given under clause <Col N="769" /> 24.  Everybody involved in the dispute and everybody aware of the crisis, should look to clause 24 as a means by which the issues which the unions seek to address can be addressed when we have acceptance of the settlement terms.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate the facts and how they can be confronted to the mutual benefit of all parties to this dispute.  The first is that TEAM Aer Lingus is grossly uncompetitive, which is accepted by all parties to the dispute.  The company's unit costs are too high in relation to its competitors and that is why it has run out of work and money.  Unit costs are a function of wage costs and output and must be tackled if TEAM is to survive, let alone prosper. Everybody involved who has commented on the TEAM crisis accepts this.</P>
    <P>As I already stated in this House, it is my wish and that of the Government that not alone should TEAM survive, it should also prosper.  To do so it must tackle costs and boost output by increasing its market share through new business. The core of the present impasse is in what order these should be tackled. Here again, we must be guided by the facts.</P>
    <P>The second fact is that TEAM has run out of cash, its bills and wages being paid by the airline.  That is not surprising in view of the fact that the company has been losing over £1 million per month, which will escalate over coming months as the market for airline maintenance suffers its usual seasonal decline.  The inescapable logic of this is that wage costs must be tackled now, if the company is to survive.</P>
    <P>Another factor which must be addressed is the seasonality of the business since TEAM Aer Lingus is a highly seasonal business.  Its competitors have not alone recognised that fact but geared their production and working schedules accordingly. TEAM must do so also if it is to survive.</P>
    <P>There are many ideas on how to develop the company; no one person or group has a monopoly on good ideas.  I want all ideas examined.  In particular, I want the ideas of the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus thoroughly examined and <Col N="770" /> professionally assessed.  As a former Minister for Labour I have consistently advocated and facilitated the maximum feasible input of workers to the development of their company.  After all, they are major shareholders in ensuring that their company remains commercially viable.  This is, and always will be, my general approach.  It is also my approach in relation to TEAM Aer Lingus.  Judging my the contributions of Members across all parties I know that firm commitment to the equity-injection approach I outlined is one on which there has been consensus.  I have been asked to devise mechanisms for achieving this new consensus. There is no need for new mechanisms; as I said, we have one in clause 24 of the settlement terms.  That clause is no smokescreen but the basis on which this dispute can and must be resolved.</P>
    <P>I want to give this House and the workers of TEAM Aer Lingus today a firm commitment that immediately &mdash; and I emphasis immediately &mdash; the survival of their company is assured by the acceptance of the terms of settlement of the Labour Relations Commission, their formal proposals will not only be professionally assessed but implemented if they can be shown to contribute to the company's development.</P>
    <P>However, as the House will be aware, we must satisfy the European Commission that all equity injections into the Aer Lingus group will not alone yield the cost savings specified but will also ensure the future viability of the group.  This condition must be met for all constituent companies of the group, including TEAM.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate once more that none of us wants this dispute to continue.  It need not continue.  All parties subscribe to the fact that the financial crisis in TEAM cannot continue.  I would urge them to also subscribe to the solution which is on the table and move forward from here to re-develop this company to its full potential.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Noel Ó Treasaigh, as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht leis an gcás seo. Caithfidh mé a rá, áfach, go bhfuil beagán díomá orm nach bhfuil an tAire féin i láthair chun an cheist a phlé.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos is dóigh liom go mba cheart dom, ó tharla go raibh an Bille um Eitic in Oifigí Poiblí á phlé againn inniu, a rá go bhfuil spéis faoi leith agam sna comharchumainn Ghaeltachta mar dhuine a d'oibrigh i gComharchumann Gaeltachta le fiche bliana agus mar dhuine atá fós ina Chathaoirleach ar cheann de na Comharchumainn seo.</P>
      <P>Tá mé mar chathaoirleach ann mar creidim go bhfuil an-tábhacht leis an obair atá ar bun ag na coimharchumainn. Ar ndóigh is go deonach a deintear an obair ar na coistí ar na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liomsa thar aon deis forbartha a chuireadh ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaíle fiche bliana go bhfuil na comharchumainn taréis an tionchar is mó a imirt.  Ba iad na comharchumainn ba mhó gur éirigh leo dul isteach sna ceantair is iargúlta.</P>
      <P>Tá comharchumainn bunaithe i nDún na nGall, Maigheo, Gaillimh, Rath Chairn agus Ciarraí.  Tá siad ag feidhmiú i gceantair nach n-eireodh le gnáth-ghnó dul chun cinn ar bith a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I mo Dháilcheatar féin tá cúig chomharchumann Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire ag fáil deontais reachtála ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is íontach an obair atá curtha ar bun acu.  Is íontach an infrastructure atá curtha ar fáil acu don Stáit, do na hoileáin agus do na ceantair in a bhfuil siad ag plé ar bheagán costais.</P>
      <P>Mar shampla, má thógaimid Comharchumainn Inis Meáin, is iad a bhunaigh an mhonarcha cniotála ansin atá anois neamhspleách den chomharchumann agus atá ar na dreamanna is mó easportála airí cniotála go dtí an Seapáin agus go Mór-roinn na hEorpa anois.</P>

    <P>Cuirtear uisce ar fáil do oileán, bóithre, aer-stráice, leictreachas agus mar sin de.  Agus is iad atá i mbun riaradh <Col N="772" /> na scéime leictreachais agus an aer-stráice i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcomharchumann a raibh plé agam féin leis, de thoradh a gcuid iarrachtaí thar 20 bliana tá os cionn 200 post curtha ar fáil acu agus ceann de na muilinn adhmaid is nua-aimsire agus is mó in Iarthar na hÉireann bunaithe acu.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor scéimeanna eile i gceist freisin ar nós Coláiste Gaeilge, scéimeanna ineallra, stóir, scéimeanna caorach agus mar sin de.  I gcás Inis Oirr de, is iontach an obair atá déanta acu súd freisin ó thaobh bóithre, aerstráice, turasóireacht, leictreachas agus araoile.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na comharchumainn gur theip orthu ná Comharchumann Cois Fharraige.  Ach má theip ar an gcomharchumann tá Clódóirí Lurgan fós ann a bhfuil os cionn 30 duine fostaithe acu agus atá ag déanamh go seoigh.</P>

    <P>Is comharchumann nua é Comharchumann Conamara Thiar agus tá todhchaí Iorras Aighneach agus Ros Muc ag braith ar thodhchaí an Comhairchumainn sin.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá freisin nuair atáimid ag caint ar an nGaeltacht nach mbeadh an Ghaeltacht ann murach an teanga Gaeilge.  Is dóigh liomsa go mbeadh sé fíor a rá gurb iad na comharchumainn an deis forbartha is mó a thug suntas don teanga in a gcuid iarrachtaí forbartha.  In ionad maolú a dhéanamh ar an teanga le forbairt tháinig treisiú ar an teanga tré iarrachtaí na gcomharchumann.</P>
    <P>Tá deontais reachtála á íoc leis na comharchumainn leis na blianta fada ach ó 1985 i leith níor tháinig aon mhéadú ar an deontas reachtála sin.  Íoctar an deontas reachtála i ngeall ar an obair fhorbartha a dheineann na comharchumainn agus gan an deontas sin ní fhéadfadh na comharchumainn tabhairt faoi obair fhorbartha na gceantar seo.</P>
    <P>Is fíor a rá muna dtabharfadh na comharchumainn faoi gur beag forbairt a bhéadh tagtha to dtí áiteanna iargculta ar nós Inis Meain agus Inis Oirr.</P>
    <P>Séard atá na comharchumainn ag iarraidh <Col N="773" /> na go gcuirfí méadú ar an deontas reachtála sin agus sin a dhéanamh láithreach leis na cineál costais reachtála atá ag baint le gnótha sa lá atá inniu ann.</P>
    <P>Le £20,000 ar an mór-thír agus £22,000 ar na hoileáin, is ionann sin agus níos lú ná leath de na costais reachtála anois. Iarraim ar an Aire breathnú go fábharach ar an éileamh ó na comharchumainn agus ó choistí na gcomharchumann méadú a fháil ar an deontas reachtála le gur féidir leo leanúint leis an obair iontach atá ar bun acu.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag iarraidh air freisin áit lárnach na gComharchumann i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta a aithint.  Tá go leor scéimeanna nua tagaithe agus imithe idir an dá linn.  Tá go leor scéimeanna agus dreamanna nua forbartha pobail á bhunú.  Níl ach dream amháin a bhí seasmhach go fad-téarmach agus molaim iad as an tacaíocht leanúnach a thug siad, agus sin iad na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá os cionn 300 post cruthaithe acu i gceantar Conamara agus Árainn amháin. Is mór le náireamh 300 post i gceantair mar sin agus dá bhrí sin iarraim ar an Aire aitheantas ceart a thabhairt don obair fhorbartha iontach atá ar bun ag na comharchumainn trí deontas reachtála méadaithe a thabhairt dóibh.</P>

I dtaca leis sin de, tá athbhreithniú curtha ar siúl aige, ar na comharchumainn &mdash; athbhreithniú a chumsíonn éifeacht caiteachais a Roinne orthu.

Beidh cinneadh le déanamh ansin maidir leis an gceist i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na deontais reachtála de, tuigeann an tAire go maith nár méadaíodh na rátaí bliantúla le tamall de bhlianta ach tabharfar aird chuí ar cheist na ndeontas sa tuarascáil, a bheidh le cur faoina bhráid.

      <P>Item No. 4 is a matter to be raised by Deputy Ring. <Col N="775" /> May I belatedly extend my congratulations to the Deputy and welcome him to the House.  I wish him well in his maiden speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, and the Ceann Comhairle, for the kindness shown to me.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Opposition leaders for their kind remarks on my arrival.  I also thank the staff of the Houses for their courtesy.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to give a firm commitment to provide in the immediate future a fully fledged regional technical college in County Mayo in the conviction that this, more than any other factor, would help solve the huge problems of emigration and unemployment in the county.  I come from a working class background and many of my generation did not have the opportunity to avail of third level education but I appreciate its value.  Sadly, too many of the present generation could be described as the nonworking class and are faced with the grim prospect of joining the dole queue or emigrating.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1979 the leaders of the main political parties, including the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, and the Labour Party Leader, the late Frank Cluskey, gave a firm commitment to provide a regional technical college in County Mayo.  Fifteen years on Mayo is still waiting and the case in favour remains as valid as ever.</P>
      <P>Every weekend more than 3,000 students from Mayo travel to and from third level institutions throughout the country.  At Sligo Regional Techical College students from Mayo outnumber those from County Sligo.  This is also the position at Athlone Regional Technical College where students from Mayo outnumber those from Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1971-91 all the urban centres in which regional technical colleges are located showed significant increases in population.  The population of Letterkenny increased by a massive 93 per cent from 5,500 to 11,000.  During the same period County Mayo lost over 50,000 of its young people through emigration. <Col N="776" /> It has also been shown that those towns in which regional technical colleges are located attract industrial development and economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Education projects that there will be need for an additional 30,000 places in third level institutions during the next two decades. I ask that 1,000 of these places be allocated to a regional technical college in County Mayo which continues to be ravaged by emigration.</P>
    <P>Last weekend I attended the unveiling of a memorial an Achill Island to 32 people from the Achill area, more than half of whom were teenagers, who lost their lives in the Clew Bay drowning tragedy in June 1894 when their hooker capsized while on their way from Achill to Westport quay to a board a steamer bound for Glasgow.  One hundred years on emigration is still killing communities in the west and successive Governments have failed to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The problem has been highlighted by the western bishops in their report, &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo;.  A fully fledged regional technical college in County Mayo would be a step in the right direction. Since 1990 we have been promised third level courses in Castlebar as a forerunner to the provision of a regional technical college.  We have had more than enough broken promises and half measures.  We have had a half developed general hospital for years and I welcome the decision of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to approve the completion of this urgently needed facility.</P>
    <P>Facilities without adequate funding are of little use.  It is a scandal that wards at the existing general hospital were closed and that male patients had to be accommodated in the maternity ward.  The number of staff at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Castlebar where there is one nurse for 48 patients is inadequate.  This is not fair on old people who are sick and weak.  These are the people we should be looking after.</P>
    <P>My presence, as a newly elected Deputy for Mayo West, should bring home the message to the Government that the people of County Mayo will no <Col N="777" /> longer accept half measures or broken promises.  The time has come to grant them their just entitlements.  These include a regional technical college and adequate funding for its health service.</P>
    <P>The people of County Mayo want and expect their regional technical college.  I remind the Government that I have been sent to deliver the message loud and clear that, with the rest of the people of Connacht, they will no longer accept half promises.  On this occasion, they have decided that Government representation should be reduced by half.  I hope it will learn its lesson.  The people of County Mayo expect to receive their full entitlement so that they can resolve the problems of emigration and unemployment.  I intend to remind the Government during the next few months of the commitments it has given to the people of County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and congratulate him on his election to this House and on making his maiden speech.  I wish him well in representing the people of Mayo West.</P>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of Education, to speak on this matter and to clarify the present position in relation to arrangements for the provision of third-level courses in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated in the course of a written reply to a recent parliamentary question that she is committed to the provision of two-year national certificate courses in Castlebar on an outreach centre basis commencing in September 1994.  The latest position is that the following three courses have been sanctioned for commencement next September on the Castlebar campus: national certificate in computer programming, national certificate in business studies and national certificate in construction engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These courses will be provided under the aegis of Galway regional technical college.  Lecturing and support staff are currently being recruited by Galway <Col N="778" /> regional technical college for the Castlebar campus.  The Minister has asked her Department and the other agencies involved to ensure all the necessary arrangements are made so that these courses can commence next September.</P>
    <P>Despite media reports about a low level of applications for the courses, the Minister is satisfied that there will be no shortage of suitable applicants for places next September.  As the closing date for applications for courses under the &ldquo;change of mind&rdquo; procedure of the Central Applications Office is 1 July 1994, it will not be possible to have a figure on the actual number of applicants until after that date.  Based on the pattern of previous years it is anticipated that the bulk of applications will be made in the week ending on 1 July 1994.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of an independent regional technical college for County Mayo, the Minister has asked a steering committee, established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, to advise her on the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland. The steering committee is preparing projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education and the corresponding needs by the sector to facilitate these enrolments.  The committee is carrying out a comprehensive needs analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations together with the needs of students and the world of work.</P>
    <P>The committee will also focus on the appropriate provision for mature students as well as the need to provide access to third-level education for disadvantaged students.  In the course of its work the technical working group of the committee is meeting with interested parties in different areas of the country, especially with those interests who have been pro-active to obtain facilities in their areas.  It is understood that a number of these meetings has already taken place. As the Minister has indicated to this House, the work of the committee will <Col N="779" /> have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations.</P>
    <P>It is expected to have the report of the committee before the end of the year, <Col N="780" /> and the Minister will, of course, be giving it urgent consideration as soon as she receives it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 24 June 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission recently adopted a number of measures which I had proposed in <Col N="690" /> order to ensure greater flexibility in the operation of the suckler cow and ewe premium quota regimes in the context of the farm retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>Farmers participating in the farm retirement scheme are to be permitted to lease their suckler cow and ewe quota rights for the duration of their participation in the scheme.  In addition the requirement to use at least 50 per cent of the quota rights during two consecutive years is to be waived for participants in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The new rules on leasing quota rights in the context of the farm retirement scheme will be particularly beneficial to those farmers who wish to participate in the scheme and who do not wish at this stage to transfer their quota rights permanently to other farmers.  The abolition of the 50 per cent rule governing the utilisation of quota rights for participants in the scheme will also introduce a greater degree of flexibility into the scheme by allowing participants to hold their quotas without penalties where the terms of the scheme permit it, thereby enhancing the scheme's success.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Total payments made to date by my Department in respect of the beef tribunal are £7,276,619.95.</P>
      <P>Over the period of the tribunal, legal fees were paid to 10 senior and junior Counsel on the state and tribunal legal teams.  My Department does not have full information on the numbers of legal personnel engaged by other parties.  To date, £4,535,245.50 has been paid to Counsel for the tribunal and the State in respect of legal fees.  This includes an amount of £1,030,374.60 withholding tax, leaving a net figure of £3,504,870.90 of which £785,420 represents VAT.  A breakdown detailing individual payments to Counsel is outlined in the tabular statement which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Apart from the sole member of the tribunal, the following personnel are currently engaged on work related to the completion of the report.</P>
      <P>(1) A senior Counsel at the request of the sole member to summarise and correlate the vast quantity of oral and documentary evidence presented before the tribunal.</P>
      <P>(2) A senior assistnat solicitor, a legal staff officer, a registrar, three clerical assistants and a court crier/ tipp staff to assist in the preparation of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conduct and proceedings of the tribunal of inquiry are matters for the sole member of the tribunal.  I would however point out that the tribunal was established and terms of reference were <Col N="693" /> agreed unanimously by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 40 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>It was decided, as part of the 1992 reform of the CAP, that the premium system for cattle should be enhanced over the three year period 1993 to 1995 in order to compensate farmers for reductions in support prices and the introduction of quantitative limits on intervention intake.  These changes are being introduced on a phased basis and over time are expected to lead to reductions in producer prices.  However, cattle prices actually increased by about 8 per cent in 1993 as compared with 1992.</P>
      <P>The premia system is fully funded by the EU and is subject to terms and conditions laid down by the Union rather than by individual member states.  These provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the special beef premium and suckler cow premium to be increased in three annual stages to reach £87.88 and £136.70 respectively &ldquo;for the 1995 calendar year and thereafter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In addition the bulk of Irish farmers will qualify for a top-up of £29.29 per animal by way of an extensification premium. The system of course incorporates a very deliberate and fundamental change in the direction of income supports in favour of:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme (REPS) is open to any farmer in <Col N="696" /> the country who wishes to avail of it.  The scheme offers an attractive annual grant for five years of £122 per hectare up to a maximum of 40 hectares to farmers who carry out a range of environmentally friendly farming practices including avoiding overgrazing of land.</P>
    <P>In addition, in areas designated as degraded it is a mandatory requirement for participants in REPS who have a ewe quota not to graze commonage lands during the period 1 November to 30 April.  Extra financial incentives are available in such cases involving either additional payments per hectare or specific payments related to reductions in stock numbers.  Moreover, as a further measure aimed at rejuvenating those designated areas, non-participants in REPS who wish to acquire additional sheep quota rights will be required to give an undertaking to remove all their sheep from these areas during the period mentioned i.e. 1 November to 30 April.</P>
    <P>I propose to publicise the REPS widely and to this end an information booklet on the scheme is now available and a series of public meetings will be held at various venues around the country during July. In addition, training courses will be available later in the year for participating farmers, who will be paid £100 on completion of the 20 hour course.</P>
    <P>I am closely monitoring the implementation of this scheme and I intend to review its operation at the earliest appropriate time in order to assess the degree to which it meets its objectives, including that of tackling effectively the problem of over-grazing in certain areas.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 19, 32, 39, 50 and 106 together.  The criteria for designating areas as disadvantaged are laid down in the less favoured areas directive and, <i>inter alia</i>, involve comparing certain agricultural conditions in the areas concerned with those in the country as a whole. By definition this precludes the whole country being classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, sought to maximise the area of the country which is classified as disadvantaged in accordance with the criteria laid down.  In all, there have been five reviews of boundaries of disadvantaged <Col N="699" /> areas.  The fifth review was submitted by the Government to the EU Commission in November 1993.  If all the areas proposed in the submission were to be accepted by the EU, about 75 per cent of the area of the country would be classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In addition, the appeals panel has completed its work on reclassification of areas and I expect to receive its report next month.  Based on an examination of this report, I will make a submission to the EC Commission on reclassification of areas at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We do not yet know when the Commission will reach a decision on the proposed extension.  On the assumption that the decision will be favourable, it should then make a proposal to the EU Council of Ministers which can decide on it only after it has received the advice of the European Parliament.  The reclassification issue is for the Commission itself to decide.  We are, of course, pressing the Commission for decisions as early as possible.  Until we know the timescale involved it is, of course, impossible to say when the new payments will begin.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain processors have recently reduced the price paid to their suppliers for milk.  The level of price is, of course, a matter for producers and purchasers of milk supplies and is affected by many factors.  Among these is the situation on the international market for dairy products which, in respect of the products of most concern to Ireland, has disimproved somewhat in the first half of this year.  This has resulted in higher sales to intervention than in 1993.  I would hope that the market situation would improve in the second half of the year.</P>

The Government is committed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to move progressively to a position during the period of the programme where all valid headage claims will be paid by October of the year in question. As a first step in this direction additional funding of £10 million has been provided this year and the 1994 Estimate reflects this additional funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too early yet to say if the 1994 allocation will be sufficient to pay all valid claims in full by the end of the year. However the increased provision will certainly provide for payment of a much higher percentage of advance on all valid claims and is in line with the Government's <Col N="704" /> commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>I have recently received the report of the Public Accounts Committee on bovine tuberculosis and I am having it examined.  By way of initial comment I can say that a number of the recommendations has been implemented or are in the process of implementation.  The other recommendations will be considered by my Department.  It is important to point out that the level of this disease has been reduced to very low levels in Ireland &mdash; over 99 per cent of the national herd is clear of this disease.  There are inherent difficulties in reducing the residual level of this, or indeed of any disease.  It is also important to recognise that, as was recognised in an independent analysis, the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has been beneficial in protecting market access for our agricultural exports and that the costs involved in operating the scheme have been outweighed by the benefits.  I have placed special emphasis on improving the efficiency of the scheme and on research designed to overcome the barriers to full eradication.</P>

First, the national laws, regulations and administrative procedure which need to be brought into comformity with the provisions of the agreement must be identified.  The appropriate amendments must then be made within the time scales laid down.  Second, the agreement establishing the new trade organisation will require Dáil approval as it imposes a charge on public funds and, third, it will be necessary to make an order to give the organisation legal status and appropriate privileges and immunities under our law.  It is expected that we will be in a position to ratify the World Trade Organisation Agreement before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>In the period 1989-1993 a total of £7,025.55 million has been paid in support measures to the agricultural and food sectors from EU and national sources.  Some 71 per cent of the total is accounted for by the basic CAP market support measures, including the cost of intervention purchase, export refunds and miscellaneous aids.  The remaining 29 per cent is accounted for by direct payments to farmers, mainly in the form of premium and headage payments, and other schemes, including farm modernisation and rural development schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The high costs of market price support was one of the principal reasons decisions were taken in 1992 at Union level on the reform of the CAP.  This reform involved a reduction in guaranteed prices for a number of major products, including cereals, beef and milk.  It also involved an increase in certain direct payments to farmers, in compensation for the phased reduction in prices.  The CAP reform package was completed by a series of accompanying measures, covering forestry, farmer retirement and agri-environment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, generally, the expenditure involved represents good value for money for the European Union and for Ireland.  I am satisfied in particular that the overall CAP reform package represents an improvement in the use of resources at EU and national level. Under the reform, resources are channelled more directly to the farmers, prices are supported at levels more beneficial to the consumer and the food industry, and there is a clearer focus on measures to improve the structure of the agricultural sector and the promotion of rural development.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to strive to ensure that, both in the design of policies and administration of programmes and schemes, the best possible value for money is achieved for both the EU and national taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Union imports limited quantities of agricultural produce at special low rates of duty under Europe Agreements negotiated with a number of eastern European countries.  The agreements were negotiated in the context of the political upheaval experienced in those countries in recent years and the recognised need for closer links with the Union to ensure stability in those regions.  While the Europe Agreements provide for free trade in industrial goods between all parties the concessions on agriculture are limited in recognition of the sensitivity of the agriculture sector in the Union.  In addition these countries provide certain <Col N="712" /> limited export opportunities to the Union for agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The import of agricultural products under concessionary arrangements is always a matter of concern because of the near/over-supply situation in many agricultural sectors within the Union. However, the concessions granted to eastern European countries are limited and there is a special safeguard clause whch can be invoked if such imports threaten the Union market.  There have been little or no difficulties in relation to the import of products of interest to Ireland and indeed the quotas have not been filled in some cases because of difficulties being experienced in a number of these countries.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I am satisfied that, while these imports may make the Union market more competitive, they do not pose a direct threat to Irish producers. Irish agri-food exports have been performing very well and I am particularly pleased that some sectors increased their exports to certain EU markets last year.</P>

      <P>The legislation also provides for the repayment of this tax where:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an individual or spouse is 65 years of age or over, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an individual or spouse is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself.</P>
      <P>In either case repayment of the retention tax is only possible where the deduction of tax exceeds the person's tax liability for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim for refund forms part of the normal income tax return though the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a simplified form 54D for individuals whose income is clearly low enough.  The form 54D is available from the individual's own tax office or from the Inspector of Taxes, Claims Section (DIRT Unit).  The income tax return form or form 54D should, when completed, be returned to the individual's Inspector of Taxes.  Certificates of <Col N="714" /> deposit interest paid to the individual should accompany the relevant form.</P>
    <P>Since a press and radio advertisement campaign undertaken in April, 1990 the Revenue Commissioners have maintained a computerised record of all individuals who qualify for refunds and those individuals are automatically issued with claim forms in advance of the end of the tax year in order to facilitate the following year's claim &mdash; these forms were issued on 24 March this year.  Revenue's information leaflet on deposit interest retention tax was redesigned in 1992 to place greater emphasis on the categories of persons entitled to refunds. This leaflet is available in all tax offices and is distributed at all shows and seminars where the Commissioners have a presence.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of any difficulties or delays in finalising claims for refunds of deposit interest retention tax.  Tax Offices endeavour to make retention tax refunds within a maximum of 6-8 weeks.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of specific cases where delays have occurred I will have them investigated on receipt of the necessary details.</P>

      <P>Under the normal tax system a person is entitled to the personal allowances and reliefs whereas under the marginal relief system a person is entitled to the exemption limits, which are substantially higher than the basic allowances available under the standard system, and also to the child additions.  The marginal relief tax system is designed to ensure that, where it applies, it is more favourable to the individual taxpayer than taxation under the normal tax system and it would not be appropriate to allow for reliefs such as medical expenses under the marginal relief system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, when appraising a particular case, take into <Col N="716" /> account all the relevant factors which influence the tax liability of that taxpayer including non-reimbursable medical expenses.  It should be stressed that in a case where a person's medical expenses are sufficiently large to make it more beneficial for them to be assessed to tax at the standard rate rather than at the marginal relief rate of tax the Revenue Commissioners will automatically place that taxpayer on the standard rate.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 63 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the final report of the National Pensions Board, <i>Developing the National Pension System,</i> was presented to me recently.  This is a <Col N="717" /> comprehensive and complex report which runs to 250 pages and contains 86 conclusions and recommendations including those relating to eligibility conditions for old age pensions and people who have gaps in their insurance.</P>
    <P>At present to qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report recommends that the arrangements for including pre-1953 contributions should be abolished.  It also recommends a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.</P>
    <P>I have already introduced legislation based on the report's recommendations for widowers.  Also under new arrangements which I will introduce shortly, time spent working full time in the home rearing young children or caring full time for elderly or incapacitated people will be disregarded in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  Prior to this, people in this situation would have had a gap in their PRSI record which could have prevented them from qualifying for a pension.  Regulations to give effect to this provision are being prepared in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The report and the remaining recommendations are being studied within my Department and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals based on these issues.  I am not, as yet, in a position to indicate when these proposals are likely to be brought forward.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question by Deputy Ahern, the person concerned, as he is over 66 years of age, may qualify for an old age non-contributory pension, subject <Col N="718" /> to a means test.  I have arranged for an application form to be forwarded to him.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme is a free service operated on behalf of social welfare customers by An Post.  People receiving unemployment payments can authorise An Post to deduct regular amounts towards various household bills from their weekly unemployment payments.  An Post pays the amounts deducted to the appropriate organisations.</P>
      <P>The scheme is operating very successfully and there are now over 5,000 customers availing of the facility.  Some customers opt to have more than one deduction made from their payment.  The total number of weekly deductions currently made is close to 7,000 and these deductions have a value of £3.5 million per annum.  The total deduction amount cannot exceed 25 per cent of a person's net weekly unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>A person may choose to pay regular contributions to any of the following utilities &mdash; ESB, Bord Gáis and Telecom Éireann.  This facility, which is already used to make some 2,000 weekly deductions, will be made available nationwide very soon.  Deductions for rents in respect of certain local authorities are also included in the scheme.  Over 20 local authorities are currently participating in the scheme.  An Post is negotiating with other local authorities with a view to extending the scheme throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Household budgeting has been designed as an aid to managing household finances for those who wish to avail of it.  Deductions made in this regular <Col N="719" /> way help such customers to cope with ongoing expenses and in clearing arrears. This scheme will also assist in reducing recourse to moneylenders.</P>
    <P>I favour the extension of the household budgeting system to other social welfare customers, including lone parents and pensioners.  However, because these customers are paid by means of order books, significant changes in existing systems would be required to make the facility more widely available.  This matter is currently being examined by my Department and An Post.</P>

      <P>The free travel companion pass, which I introduced in 1990, is a special version of the free travel pass which enables anyone over 16 years of age to travel free with the pass-holder.  The free travel companion pass is intended to meet the situation where a person is entitled to free travel under the free travel scheme but cannot make any real use of the concession because of some disability that prevents him or her from travelling alone.</P>
      <P>Companion passes were issued originally to people who were receiving disabled person's allowance and who were certified by their health board to be unable to travel alone.  Since then, I have been able to make companion passes available to additional groups of disabled people such as the blind and persons confined to wheel chairs.  The question of extending this facility to further categories of disabled people will be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I have received a submission <Col N="722" /> from the parties referred to regarding the condition of non-national roads in the Kilmactigue area of County Sligo.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of the non-national roads concerned rests with Sligo County Council.  It is a matter for the council to finance necessary works from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department.  The 1994 discretionary grants to the council amount to £1.629 million.  In addition, under the new EU co-finance scheme of specific improvement grants for non-national roads, grant allocations totalling £875,000 have been notified to the council, including a grant for works connected with forestry operations. Accordingly, the total State grant allocation to the county council for non-national roads in 1994 is £2.504 million which is an increase of 30 per cent on the grants paid in 1993.  I have no funds at my disposal for the making of additional grants.</P>
      <P>The council will have the opportunity, later this year, to put forward applications in respect of roads providing access to forests or timber mills as part of its general submission seeking specific grants in 1995 under the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement works on non-national roads.</P>
      <P>In so far as the specific damage referred to by the Deputy is concerned, it is a matter for the county council to consider what action, if any, would be appropriate, including possible action under section 17 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, with a view to ameliorating the problems referred to.</P>

The Animal Remedies Act, 1993 provides extensive powers for the enforcement of the prohibition on illegal growth promoters and increased penalties for offenders.

      <P>The Dublin District Milk Board was established by Order under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936 to regulate the supply and price of drinking milk in the Dublin area.  After an indication from the EU Commission that the board's regulatory activities were contrary to EU law, the Government decided to abolish both the Dublin and the Cork boards and replace them with a National Milk Agency.  A Bill to give effect to that decision was circulated earlier today.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the Dublin District Milk Board has developed ancillary businesses such as artificial insemination of cattle, milk recording and mastitis control. The Government have also decided that these businesses should be sold. Arrangements to protect the interests of the staff involved were accepted by the staff on 24 January 1994.</P>
      <P>The board has been incurring losses each year from 1989 to 1992: total losses for those years amounted to some £468,000.  Audited accounts for 1993 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The integrated administration and control system, introduced under EU regulations, which applied to the special beef premium and suckler cow schemes in 1993 has, this year, been extended to the disadvantaged areas headage scheme.  This has necessarily meant that the application forms have had to be revised to take account of the necessity of entering the individual eartag numbers of animals applied on under those schemes.  I fully appreciate that this new requirement will mean that farmers will have to take extra care in completing applications.  However, the information requested on applications is no more than is necessary for processing applications in accordance with EU regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is continuously monitoring all aspects of the schemes with a view to keeping the administrative procedures as <Col N="735" /> simple as possible within the constraints of the EU regulations.  Given, however, that the headage and premia schemes involve considerable amounts of money &mdash; as much as £640 million annually when the CAP reform are fully in place in 1995 &mdash; it is not unreasonable that the EU Commission lays down very strict guidelines for the filling of forms and the meeting of other requirements.  Detailed help sheets have been made available with all the scheme applications and in addition assistance is available to farmers by way of the Teagasc CAP consultancy service. My Department in conjunction with the <i>Farmers Journal</i> last week published detailed guidelines and check lists on the completion of the application forms which issued recently and I believe that this will be of further benefit to scheme applicants.</P>

      <P>The question of ambulance replacement is being dealt with in the context of the implementation of the findings of the report of the review group on the ambulance service published in December 1993, which recommend that an efficient fleet management system, incorporating a formal vehicle replacement policy, should be developed by each Health Board.</P>
      <P>To commence the process of development, an immediate injection of £0.5 million was provided to health boards last year with a view to improving ambulance service infrastructure.  The Western Health Board received £65,000 from this fund which was used towards the purchase of cardiac defibrillators for the Board's area.  I propose to continue this programme of development in 1994, and hope to be in a position to allocate funds shortly to the various health boards which will also be targeted at improving the ambulance service infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services is based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the Chief Executive Officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical card holders receive the full range of public health services free of charge including general practitioner services and prescribed drugs and medicines. If a person is not awarded a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons suffering from a condition covered by the long-term illness scheme can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition.  In addition the drug cost subsidisation scheme is available for persons who are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement of prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month currently at £32.  Also any person whose expenditure (including that of dependants) on precribed drugs and medicines for use in a specified three month period exceeds £90 will be eligible <Col N="739" /> to claim a refund of the balance of their expenditure in excess of that amount.</P>
    <P>On a final note I would like to point out that it is open to all persons to apply to the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>The posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's Primary Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>My Department received an application for a shared remedial teacher from the school in question.  Unfortunately, the application was not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review and the needs of all schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I would be most concerned to avoid any situation where children with disabilities being transported to special schools would be put at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under present arrangements, children attending special schools are generally transported on special services which have been put in place for this purpose. The need for escorts on special services will vary depending on the circumstances of the children involved.  There is no actual prohibition on the use of escorts where they can be accommodated and, in some cases, child care assistants attached to special schools already act as escorts as part of their duties.  A parent <Col N="741" /> or other adult may also be allowed to travel with a child where a place is available on the service.</P>
    <P>In the case of children attending the special schools for visual impairment, escorts have been provided by the National Council for the Blind for a number of years.  These escorts accompany children travelling to and from home for holiday periods and their transport costs are funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I announced in the 1994 Education Budget that I would be allocating the sum of £100,000 to support the provision of escorts on certain school transport services for children with a disability.  My Department is working out the practical details of this proposal at the present time.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the proposed changes in the payment of capitation grants to secondary schools and her proposal to designate some second level schools disadvantaged is the correct way to tackle this problem; her views on whether by weighting the capitation as she proposes perhaps as many as half of the disadvantaged children of the country attending non-disadvantaged schools will not benefit from her concern; in view of the fact that it now costs at least £173 per pupil per annum to educate the pupils in some of our secondary schools, the way in which schools which are paid only £158 per pupil can bridge that gap; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am satisfied that the provision of an enhanced rate of <i>per capita</i> grant to certain secondary schools is an appropriate response to disadvantage and is in accordance with the pledge of a major concentration of resources on the disadvantaged contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>I am aware that there are disadvantaged pupils attending schools other than schools which have been designated as disadvantaged for the purposes of this additional <i>per capita</i> grant. However, the schools so designated are those with the highest concentration of disadvantaged and the enhanced <i>per capita</i> grant is but one of a number of interventions from which disadvantaged pupils benefit.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question on 19 April 1994, the State does not meet the full cost of voluntary secondary schools.  Instead specific grants are paid at rates which are reviewed from time to time.  I am pleased to have been able to increase the standard <i>per capita</i> grant towards the general running costs of secondary schools from £150 to £158 with effect from 1 January 1994, the first increase in the rate since 1990. The figure of £173 referred to in the question is the total of the revised standard rate of grant of £158 plus the additional amount of £15 for disadvantaged schools. This enhanced rate is intended to reflect the particular circumstances of these schools, not the circumstances of secondary schools generally.</P>
