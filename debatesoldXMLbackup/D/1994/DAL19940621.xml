    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>1. Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the contribution, if any, he will make to the discussion on the EU White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness at the Corfu Summit, on 24 and 25 June 1994; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to contributing to the discussion at the Corfu Summit later this week on the EU White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness.  I anticipate that we will also review progress on implementation of the action plan adopted on foot of the <Col N="2" /> White Paper at the last European Council in Brussels in December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be particularly pleased to outline to my European colleagues the very favourable economic conditions now prevailing in Ireland due to adoption of Government policies which are fully consistent with the prescriptions set out in both the EU White Paper and the Brussels Action Plan.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware the White Paper sets the achievement of stable and coherent economic and monetary policies as a prerequisite for creating the environment in which economic growth can flourish. Ireland fully accords with this prerequisite: our Government deficit is within the Treaty criterion of 3 per cent of GDP, our debt-to-GDP ratio is falling, the latest CPI figures show Ireland's inflation rate at 2.7 per cent or .05 per <Col N="3" /> cent below the EU average and interest rates are at historically low levels.  This stable macroeconomic environment will deliver economic growth in 1994 of about 5 per cent in Ireland compared with an average of 1.6 per cent for the EU as a whole and crucially will deliver employment growth of an estimated 23,000 or 2 per cent compared with a forecast employment decline of 0.75 per cent for Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>I also look forward to briefing my European colleagues on specific employment policies being pursued by the Government which are fully consistent with the White Paper strategy.  For example the Government in this year's budget moved to provide special funding and tax incentive measures to encourage the development of small business and start-up enterprises and to reduce the cost of employment through a combination of income tax cuts and reductions in PRSI and levies.  In addition an expansion of places on training and employment schemes has been put in place.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Europe wide dimension of the White Paper the Summit will have before it reports of the Christopherson and Bangemann Groups dealing with Trans-European Networks (TENS) and the global information society respectively. It is in Ireland's interests as an export oriented country on the periphery that progress be made under both these headings.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the summit will also focus on the importance for Europe of the small and medium sized industry sector and of ensuring the full development of the Single Market to exploit the potential of this sector.</P>
    <P>Finally it is important that the Corfu Summit ensures that the momentum created by the White Paper is maintained and that it sends a clear signal that employment growth remains at the top of the European agenda.  As one who fought strongly for this priority at previous summits I will be stressing this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach <Col N="4" /> some questions about chapters 8 and 9 of the White Paper.  Chapter 8 concerns turning growth into jobs and chapter 9 concerns statutory charges on labour.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the conclusions on chapter 8 of the White Paper that financial, administrative and legal burdens imposed by Governments tend to fall most heavily on smaller and medium sized firms and that it must be a priority for this Government and the Community as a whole to reduce those burdens?</P>
      <P>In regard to chapter 9 which deals with charges imposed by Government on jobs and employment, is the Taoiseach aware of the contents of Table 2 of the chapter which show that the rate of increase over the last 20 years in income tax and PRSI charges on labour in Ireland has been twice the rate of the average of the European Union and that this imposition of PRSI and income tax charges on employment is one of the contributing factors in our high level of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is fully aware that the Government set up the small business task force precisely to focus on the issues he has raised.  In the most recent budget we took action along lines conducive to helping the small to medium sized business sector &mdash; to remove some of the obstacles and help that sector create jobs.  It is an area that can be most successful in producing jobs as many other countries have found out also.</P>
      <P>Of course we would all like social charges on labour to be as low as possible. In that regard we are at the lower end of the scale in comparison with our partners in Europe.  However, the more competitive we can become the better and that is the direction in which we are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that whereas 20 years ago Irish charges on labour were half the European average, they have now almost reached it?  Is he aware of the recommendation in the report which states that in any efforts to reduce charges on labour, changes must <Col N="5" /> be simple to be successful?  Detailed proposals such as those the Government brought forward to provide a reduction in PRSI for those who promise to employ a person at less than £173 per week &mdash; they do not benefit if they pay £174 per week &mdash; are the complexities which are an obstacle to take-up and have been condemned by the Commission in the White Paper.  This is an error by the Government in its efforts to reduce the costs of employing people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many examples of variety of rates, for instance, in the UK.  The fact that we moved in the last budget to make it more attractive and less expensive at the lower end of the scale to employ people is a welcome start in that direction.  The social costs in terms of Ireland's position and that in other European countries are clear.  Other countries have much higher social charges than ours, but that does not mean we should not become as competitive as we can in every way possible, and that is exactly what the Government strategy is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there are 18 million people unemployed in the Community and that it cannot compete in terms of jobs with the Japanese, Americans or the high performing Asian economies, will the Taoiseach accept that the European market is over-regulated? Does he support policies that would lead to less regulation in the European economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from our performance that we are competitive.  If we had not been competitive in recent years our employment position would be much more serious &mdash; in saying that I am not under-estimating the significance of the size of our unemployment figures. During a recessionary period, when markets were shrinking, Irish exporters gained a bigger share of those markets, that can only come about by being competitive in the marketplace.  There are many areas in which the European Union must make progress in becoming more <Col N="6" /> competitive.  The fact that it became uncompetitive was one of the basic driving forces behind setting up the Single European Market.  Europe as a unit was losing its market share in world trade terms to the United States and Japan and that is why the Single Market had to be considered.  Many of the restrictions and protections introduced in various national economies had to be removed, and others will have to be removed, to make Europe more competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that growth in Ireland will produce about 23,000 jobs.  Will he tell the House over what period &mdash; and in what sectors &mdash; he expects these jobs to be created?  Will he agree that wage levels are only one factor in a range of complex factors in the question of competitiveness? Will he indicate that he will resist attempts at the Corfu summit to further create what is referred to as a flexible labour market, which essentially means removing the social cover for workers in Europe, particularly in Ireland?  Will he resist attempts to create a position whereby employers can hire and fire at will without giving adequate cover to workers?  Will the Taoiseach attempt to persuade the German Government to remove its opposition to the Fourth Poverty Programme which is currently held up as a result of German objections.  Even though it is minimal in its effects &mdash; providing about 3p per head of those currently living on the poverty line in Europe &mdash; nevertheless it is the only programme proposed to deal with poverty in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that the last aspect of the Deputy's question will appear on the agenda&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach put it on the agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if it does, our position will be very clear.  We are not in the business of dismantling any of the programmes the Deputy may have in mind, whether on poverty or worker protection. <Col N="7" /> We want to make the Irish economy as competitive as possible.  Deputy De Rossa is making one recommendation while Deputy Harney's recommendation is almost the direct opposite, but we want to continue to create more jobs in the economy.  We want to ensure better growth and translate that growth into jobs &mdash; the projected estimate by economic commentators is 23,000 jobs this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the European Union White Paper on jobs will have a much better chance of being implemented under an effective President of the EU Commission? On that basis will the Taoiseach confirm that he will not let the national side down if there is an opportunity in Corfu to have Peter Sutherland appointed to that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a totally separate matter.  The question relates to the contribution I will make to the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the best contribution the Taoiseach could make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue as I have done at numerous summits up to now.  I was a lone voice for a good while in trying to get job creation to the top of the European agenda and now that it is there, I will keep it there.  A co-ordinated approach by all member states in this matter can make a much greater impact than the single policy of any member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the White Paper &mdash; this is apropos of Deputy O'Keeffe's question &mdash; pays specific tribute to the contribution of liberalisation of world trade to every occasion on which employment grew in Europe and that it would make sense <Col N="8" /> to have somebody who understands the importance of liberalising world trade at the head of affairs in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am adverting to page 12 of the White Paper, which I am sure the Taoiseach would like to consult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue is worthy of a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you wish to consult it I will make it available to you to verify the relevance of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to admire Deputy Bruton's efforts to bring in an extraneous matter.  Our best performance in the creation of jobs was in the years 1987-89.  The way forward is to ensure high growth and to translate that growth into the maximum number of jobs.  Deputy Bruton is trying to introduce an extraneous political matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on every occasion when there was substantial growth in employment in this State it arose as a direct consequence of a decision by an Irish Government to set a realistic value on the punt?  This occurred following the realignment of the punt in 1986 and, subsequently, its realignment in January 1993 which Fianna Fáil and Labour resisted.  In the light of that experience is it the Government's policy to join a single currency without our principal trading partner in circumstances which would deprive us of the right to set a realistic value on the punt because we would then be on autopilot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a medium or short term agenda.  Everybody realistically looking at the position in Europe today recognises that the introduction of a single currency is not around the corner.  As a former Minister for Finance, the Deputy knows that neither I nor the <Col N="9" /> Minister for Finance speculate on hypothetical questions about what a Government might do.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me advise the House, as is my wont, that nearly 30 minutes are available to deal with questions to the Taoiseach.  I want to bring them to finality quite quickly.  I will call Deputy Boylan shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the single most important economic decision a government can take concerns the devaluation of its currency?  Is he aware there would be serious consequences for Ireland if, as the Maastricht Treaty provides, we were to go ahead with the single currency without Britain as Ireland would then be in the position where it no longer would have the freedom to set the value of its own currency?  Has the Government considered this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton knows that the Government takes all those matters into consideration.  He should also be aware that whereas the Maastricht Treaty sets 1997 as the target year, nobody believes that this is realistic.  It is more realistic to speak in terms of the end of the decade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach lauds small businesses for their role in job creation and I fully support that.  Does he accept, however, that there is no Government support for the start-up of small businesses and that within six months of starting one as many as 12 inspectors from 12 different Government agencies will descend on the business to harass the employer and close it?  Is the Taoiseach making any effort to advise officials that small businesses need time to get their footing and that they should be given the time to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 21 measures in this year's budget to support small business.  The £100 million subsidised interest rate facility was brought forward and recently the Minister for Finance and his European partners agreed at the ECOFIN meeting to further subsidised interest rate facilities.  The list of recommendations of the task force on small business is being implemented and a number has already been implemented.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect to meet the British Prime <Col N="11" /> Minister at the margin of meetings during the Corfu Summit?  Will he press for an early conclusion to the current discussions on a framework document? Given the appalling spiral of violence in Northern Ireland in recent weeks, there is urgent need for political progress to fill the vacuum that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to meet the British Prime Minister, John Major, at an appropriate opportunity during the Corfu Summit.  We will certainly review the work of the liaison committee and the position to see how we can advance the political situation.  That is certainly on both our agendas.</P>

      <P>Before I move on to the detail of this response let me take this opportunity to express before the Dáil my absolute revulsion and condemnation of the massacre in Loughinisland on Saturday night.  A wonderfully happy occasion for all Irish people was darkened by the murder in cold blood of six innocent people.  This was indeed the slaughter of the innocents.</P>
      <P>Such actions cannot and will not be allowed to determine the political agenda.  The two Governments have set their face against allowing paramilitaries to impose a veto on political progress. We will not be deflected from that aim.</P>
      <P>I would like to extend my sympathy to all those bereaved by this atrocity.  The essential purpose of my visit to the United States was to support our soccer team in opening its World Cup campaign. I was proud to do that and delighted at the team's win over Italy.  I know I represent the views of everybody on its marvellous win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in the United States I took the opportunity to make those senior American <Col N="12" /> politicians and business leaders I met, aware of the up-to-date position on the peace process being advanced by the Irish and British Governments and to promote business contacts between Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>In New York I attended a function at the World Trade Centre to mark the opening for business of the Dublin branch of the New York Cotton Exchange, FINEX.  The Dublin exchange is FINEX's first outside the United States and has been opened to reach European customers during European trading hours.  It is hoped that the exchange, which deals in financial futures, will trade up to 2,000 contracts a day.</P>
    <P>In New York I also lent my support to a fund-raiser for the charity First Step, which has helped and continues to help many small Irish businesses become viable employment generating enterprises.</P>
    <P>During my visit to the New York area I met Ms Christine Todd Whitman, Governor of New Jersey.  Discussion centred on the attractions of Ireland as a centre for investment and also on our continuing initiative to bring about lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The issue of peace in Northern Ireland and of the role the American Government and Irish-American can play in helping to achieve it was at the heart of two major speeches I made in Boston, at the Kennedy Library and to the World Affairs Council of Boston, respectively. These two speeches reached a distinguished audience of politicians, academics and decision-makers.  On each occasion, I outlined to my audience the continuing importance of the joint declaration as a basis for progress and the commitment of both the Irish and British Governments towards bringing about a balanced, fair political settlement.  I also stressed the fact that the only way forward lies in participation in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The World Affairs Council in Boston did me the honour of presenting me with the Christian A.  Herter Memorial award, made each year for what the council considers <Col N="13" /> to be a significant contribution to international affairs.</P>
    <P>I was honoured to receive the good wishes of President Clinton on the occasion of the making of this award and, in particular, his recognition of the efforts that I am making to bring about a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Taoiseach in congratulating Jack and the boys for doing us proud on the soccer battlefields of the world.  I join him in condemning the barbarity and sadism of the past few days.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on being presented with the Christian A.  Herter Memorial award for his contribution to peace.  In his acceptance address the Taoiseach said that neither the British nor Irish Governments will allow political progress to be held hostage to the internal decision-making process of any group and that the time for the Republican movement to make its decision clear on the Downing Street Declaration is long overdue.  Will he spell out in detail what he meant by the governments &ldquo;will not be held hostage&rdquo;?  What is his response to Mr. Gerry Adams's comments on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Irish Government knows the timeframe involved in relation to the Downing Street Declaration?</P>

      <P>I was on my way back from the United States and I did not hear Mr. Adams's comments on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It has been clear for some time &mdash; and I said it on a number of occasions &mdash; that I expect a response from the Republican movement sometime in early July.  I do not know if there is anything new in what was said this morning.  The two Governments will not allow the paramilitary organisations to dictate the political agenda and we have no intention of allowing that despite the savage and barbaric attacks on innocent people.  For the life of me I cannot understand what purpose is supposed to have been served by shooting an 80 plus year old while watching a football game on television. The two sovereign Governments will not <Col N="14" /> allow the agenda to be dictated by paramilitaries, no matter how hard they try. Indeed, it is to be expected that people with certain vested interests may try to undermine and derail the peace process but that will not be allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>In the past two days, presumably while in the United States, the Taoiseach outlined proposals for an all-Ireland Authority.  What precise functions will the Irish Government delegate to the all-Ireland Authority?  Will the establishment of this Authority &mdash; which presumably will be superior to the Government &mdash; require an amendment to the Constitution?  Will this Authority be established with the separate consent by referendum of both parts of Ireland, or by a joint decision of the Governments.</P>

      <P>I have never used the word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo;, what I have been referring to all along, which is no different on this occasion, is institutional links between North and South which adequately reflect the diversity and different identities of the two divided communities. I have said that we need economic links between North and South to explore and exploit the opportunities created by a single market on the island of Ireland.  The whole area of North-South economic links is under discussion in the liaison committee.  Those issues are part and parcel of the debate going on at the moment.  I did not use the word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; nor did I attempt to establish the type of Authority or anything like that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's visit to the United States &mdash; and I do not cavil at his visiting the United States on this occasion &mdash; why was it necessary for him to be accompanied by his private secretary, his assistant private secretary, his programme <Col N="15" /> manager, the secretary of his Department and his official driver?  Is it not the case that the Consulate General in New York can provide most of those services on an adequate basis within the United States without the necessity for the Taoiseach to bring such a large entourage with him?  Will he agree that this is a Republic, not a monarchy, and that it is not necessary for him to bring an entire court with him wherever he travels?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which the revised allocations of money under the National Development Plan 1994 to 1999 recently approved by the European Commission will affect the various projects planned by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to Questions Nos. 6, 9, 42, 63 and 70 on 22 March last, I told the House that the total financial allocation made in the National Development Plan for services within my Department's remit was approximately £2,500 million at 1993 prices.  I went on to point <Col N="19" /> out that over 40 per cent of this expenditure would qualify for assistance from the Cohesion Fund, and would not be affected by the <i>pro rata</i> adjustments put forward by the Government in relation to the programmes to be assisted under the Community Support Framework. Overall, therefore, I indicated that the impact of these adjustments on my Department's allocation would be marginal.</P>
      <P>I am happy to confirm today that my assessment of the situation last March has been substantiated by the decisions reached by the European Commission last week on the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  In short, the programmes for which I am responsible are to involve a total expenditure of £2,456 million, in 1994 prices, over the period 1994-99.  As this total is only a few percentage points less than the total proposed in the National Development Plan and as the impact will be absorbed over six years, it is clear that the actual effects on the planning and implementation of projects would be minimal, even if no additional EU aid were to be obtained over and above the allocations now made; it is, of course, the Government's belief that, over the six year period, it will be possible to get additional aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out on many occasions, there are different stages in the Structural Funds process involving the National Development Plan, the Community Support Framework and the various Operational Programmes.  The selection of individual projects for EU assistance is a further phase in the process, following approval of the Operational Programmes and it will be an ongoing process throughout the implementation period.  It is too soon, therefore, to speculate as to the individual projects or their timescale.  I can tell the House, however, that over the six year period over £1.2 billion will be spent on roads.  Over £1 billion will be spent on county and regional roads, when account is taken of other Exchequer moneys for maintenance and of contributions by <Col N="20" /> local authorities from their own resources.</P>
    <P>There will be a consistently high level of spending &mdash; over £100 million per year on average &mdash; on water and sanitary services, enabling continuing progress to be made in protecting and enhancing water quality generally.  There will be co-financed expenditure of £42 million on waste facilities and on environmental research.  Well over £100 million will be spent on the cultural/heritage programme for Temple Bar, a local authority urban renewal programme and a new &ldquo;village renewal&rdquo; measure.</P>
    <P>Overall, the outcome of the Government's approach to the negotiations with the European Commission is a most satisfactory one from my Department's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confirming the figure of £655 million for direct investment in environmental services as stated in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> and that there will be no reduction in that area?  If there is a reduction, will he detail the areas which will be affected? I was pleased to hear that moneys for road development, particularly the improvement of our substandard minor roads, will be available.  Is the Minister saying that all projects will start and finish in accordance with the programme set out in the original plan or will there be delays in respect of some of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all the funds for environmental services come from the Cohesion Fund which is not affected and so the figures I gave stand.  With regard to the implementation of the operational programmes yet to be decided, there is a marginal change in the overall amounts which we hope will be made up by buoyancy in the economy or which could, in a small number of cases at the tail end of the programme, involve some delay.  It is marginal in the context of the whole programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please publish the projects that will be affected and the effect of the reduction in the <Col N="21" /> allocation in each case?  It is important that the public and local authorities should be aware of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is full steam ahead for 97 per cent of what is contained in the National Development Plan relative to my Department.  There will be no delay whatsoever.  I hope that any marginal balance outside of that could also be fully met within the time period but, if not, there may be some delay.  As regards individual projects, the operational programme on environmental services and the operational programme on transport are either with the Commission or ready to be sent to it.  Moneys from the Cohesion Fund are on a project basis, not a programme basis, so each project must withstand economic analysis and strict scrutiny and that will go on through the period of six years.  It will be impossible to give anything more than an indicative list which I will be happy to publish at the end of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the reply.  The major changes made in the planning legislation incorporated 172 pages of amendments and it is difficult for the public to make an input into the <Col N="22" /> changes which are in place as a result of these statutory instruments.  Is the Minister prepared to do anything about the proposal to allow up to four bedrooms to be used for bed and breakfast accommodation without planning permission? Does he intend to do anything about the ridiculous suggestion regarding the restriction of extensions to the rear of houses?  Does he intend to do anything about the suggestion I made during the course of the statements we were allowed to make on these changes regarding local authorities advertising each application in a newspaper on a certain day each week rather than the individual publishing his own application?  It would be cost effective and informative.  Does he intend allowing An Bord Pleanála to continue to contravene development plans if they so wish?  A local authority must go through a statutory process before it can contravene a development plan.</P>

      <P>As regards the four bedroomed bed and breakfast accommodation, I explained on that occasion that where no physical change was made to a premises for which planning permission had already been granted and where the numbers involved were of a minor nature there would be no requirement <Col N="23" /> for planning permission.  That does not exclude the necessity to obtain a fire certificate, meet food and hygiene regulations and building regulations.  Subsequent to the debate a number of Deputies said they were unaware of the necessity to have commencement orders.</P>
      <P>Regarding developments at the rear of premises, anyone who wishes to apply for planning permission to build in excess of the prescribed area can so do.  There is no limitation on making an application and it will be dealt with on its merits.  As far as the other matters are concerned they have been properly explained and widely accepted.  I committed myself at the beginning of my term of office as Minister to greater transparency and openness in the planning system.  There was wide support during the debate for the provision to improve the public notice requirement so that people would not be faced with problems about which they could take no action after a prescribed period.</P>
      <P>On the question of unauthorised developments, I introduced very stringent provisions in the planning and development Bill and increased the fines in cases where people are found guilty of unauthorised developments of a certain nature.  The amounts paid to local authorities in respect of applications of that kind have also been doubled.  These measures are indicative of my desire to combat the problems in this area.</P>

      <P>A substantial array of powers is already available to local authorities and the Garda Síochána to deal with difficulties associated with the indiscriminate location of temporary dwellings.  These powers are contained in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, and the Roads Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>While it is a matter for local authorities and the Garda to use these powers in appropriate cases, I will be monitoring the situation, in particular, to assess the contribution the more recent legislation is making to resolving the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the situation following the Supreme Court decision some years ago that unless a local authority can provide a halting site travellers cannot be moved from wherever they choose to locate? Travellers are not locating on Kildare Street or on the lawn of the Custom House but adjacent to local authority housing schemes.  Local authority tenants believe the law in this area is being applied indiscriminately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and what I have seen there is totally unacceptable from the point of view of the local residents and the people living in these temporary dwellings.  We have a brace of legislative provisions which must be enforced.  The High Court decision in the 1980 McDonald <i>v</i> Dublin County Council case has made the situation much more difficult for local authorities who have to provide alternative accommodation for travellers. The Government increased to £3.5 million the amount of money available to local authorities for the provision of halting sites this year.  It is fair to say that, while making a genuine attempt to deal with the problem, many local authorities are unable to counter opposition from the public to the acquisition of these sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for Deputy Molloy to suggest that local authorities adopt an indiscriminate approach in these matters. From the experience in my constituency I can vouch that this is not the case.  In cases where halting sites do not meet the criteria outlined by Deputy Molloy, we have to ensure both in this House and nationally that more halting sites are provided with better facilities so that all the problems associated with indiscriminate <Col N="27" /> and illegal parking can be eliminated. Some local authorities, including Galway Corporation have made a genuine effort to provide halting sites but because some authorities have not made as good an effort the authorities which tried the hardest have been hardest hit as they are unable to extend existing sites to meet all the needs in the county.  A better and more uniform approach needs to be adopted on this issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, pointed out to local authorities that the housing allocation and our ability to increase it will depend on the efforts made by local authorities in this area.  We are trying to tackle the problem on all fronts but there is very little public support at local level for the acquisition of these sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledged the exceptional work in the Galway Corporation area in the provision of much needed facilities for travelling families.  He also made the point that because some local authorities are not providing facilities there is an obvious tendency for the travelling community to move to areas where something is being done for them.  It is recognised that there has been a huge influx into Galway of travelling families from areas where local authorities are falling down in their duty to provide adequate facilities.  The local community in Galway are beginning to feel resentful that they have to accommodate an enormous number of travelling families because the local authority in Galway has been good in providing facilities for its indigenous travelling community.  Every week in the Galway area more caravans are parked in open fields in the Castle Park area &mdash; at times there can be as many as 80-90 caravans. It is unfair to the local authority tenants who reside in that area to have this problem permanently on their doorsteps &mdash; it has been going on for 15-16 years.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>: The general scheme of the waste Bill was approved by the Government last November.  Drafting and other work has been in progress since then, taking account of developments at EU level, but, because of the length and complexity of the Bill, it will not be possible to complete its drafting in time to allow it be published this session.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply is disappointing since this country is devoid of a waste policy.  We cannot deal with waste unless we have a national waste management policy.  What has the Minister done in terms of endeavouring to minimise the amount of waste produced? Second, what has he done to maximise recycling of waste that arises and, third, how does he intend to dispose of the remaining waste?  Surely he will accept that we cannot deal with waste unless we have management proposals?  Will the Minister please produce a management plan to demonstrate clearly that we will encourage a reduction in the amount of waste produced and do something about promoting its recycling before even talking about its disposal since one cannot dispose of something when one does not know how much will be produced?</P>

There has been a dramatic increase in glass and paper recycling and the recycling strategy will be announced within the next two weeks.  The forthcoming waste Bill will contain some 70 or more sections and obviously will take time to draft.

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>in regard to the recent announcement of the financial allocation of more than £106 million for county roads, the reason less than £4 million was allocated to the three Dublin County Councils, in view of the poor condition of many roads in these counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>State aid is provided to supplement, not to substitute, spending from local authorities' own resources on the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  This aid is allocated by way of discretionary grants and, for <Col N="31" /> the first time in 1994, under a new scheme of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement works.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dublin, the total discretionary grant allocations to the three county councils amount to £1.073 million in 1994.  In addition, under the scheme of specific improvement grants, allocations totalling £1.955 million have been notified to the three councils.  The total State grant allocations to these councils for non-national roads in 1994 are, accordingly, £3.658 million, an increase of £702,000 on the grants paid in 1993.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the State aid available in 1994 for non-national roads was allocated in the form of discretionary grants to county councils for improvement and maintenance works.  The normal discretionary grants &mdash; excluding supplementary improvement grants and pilot schemes grants &mdash; were allocated <i>pro rata,</i> on the basis of road mileage, except in the case of County Dublin which received a supplement to take account of heavier traffic volumes. County Councils generally received approximately £1,088 per mile of non-national road, whereas the three Dublin counties were allocated a total of £1,893 per mile under the normal discretionary grant heading.</P>
      <P>The allocation of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement projects was based on proposals submitted by individual local authorities.  These projects were evaluated and given priority on a merit basis in accordance with EU criteria.  Grant allocations under this heading to individual authorities will be liable to significant change from year to year, depending on the level of commitments on ongoing approved schemes and on the merits of new proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, State road grants for non-national roads totalling £106.4 million were allocated to local authorities.  I am satisfied that all the authorities, including the three new Dublin councils, received their proper share of these significant State funds.  I might point out in this connection that total grants for the three Dublin counties have increased by nearly <Col N="32" /> 24 per cent in 1994 alone, and by 90 per cent since 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the appalling state of roads in County Dublin, many of which appear to have been abandoned or broken and with potholes? Dublin Bus refuses to run services on some as their condition is so bad.  Will he accept that calculating grants for such roads on a mileage basis is inappropriate given that the Dublin area has the busiest roads nationwide and that allocating money on a mileage basis bears no relationship to the amount of road tax paid by the citizens and road users of County Dublin who would like to see some of that tax ploughed back into the improvement of roads for which they paid tax in the first place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that, over the past four years, the amount of grants allocated by the State to Dublin County Council &mdash; now the three new councils &mdash; together represent an increase of between 80 per cent and 90 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas within the same period the county council increased its provision by less than one-fifth of that amount, by 17 per cent.  Clearly it will be seen that the State afforded as high a priority as it could to increasing the level of grants for this purpose.  I also discovered &mdash; and I think Deputy Gilmore is well aware of this &mdash; in my discussions with the former Dublin County Council that, unfortunately, in the case of certain planning decisions, involving a massively increased housing development with a consequent increase in road usage, much of the funds provided in the planning process for capital development were diverted to current expenditure, which I very much regret.  In future I hope that investment by people who build houses in such places, by providing funds to local authorities for capital investment, will be designated for that purpose, thereby ensuring a better roads network.  I accept <Col N="33" /> that there are roads, not only in Dublin but in many other parts of the country, which have deteriorated and warrant the allocation of additional funds at local and national level.  That is why I fought so hard, at European level, to gain support for county and regional roads, since County Dublin will benefit from that expenditure, like all other counties.  I will continue my efforts to improve this overall area in three different ways: first, by a more effective method of undertaking the work involved; second, by ensuring that most of the repairs-improvement works are undertaken in fine weather and, third, by increasing and enhancing European, State and local resources for this primary purpose.  As I said, some of these roads are as unacceptable to me as they are to Deputy Gilmore.</P>

Will he undertake a major survey of the condition of the county roads system and direct the funds to where the greatest need exists in an effort to eliminate the crisis of many potholed roads?  Merely allocating funds on the basis of road mileage means that the counties which have good roads are getting better roads and the counties with bad potholed roads will never catch up.</P>

In his own bailiwick I suggest he would save himself a considerable amount of heartache in this matter if he got to the bottom of the peculiar planning decisions that have resulted in an enormous strain on some rural roads and allowed large housing developments in places where the road network was never intended to cater for the traffic generated by such developments.  If he follows through on that he would avoid some of the flak he has to take owing to bad county roads brought about by a failure to control the bad planning process that has, unfortunately, developed in County Dublin.</P>

In the course of that work, as I outlined, I discovered notwithstanding the merit or otherwise of the planning decisions, that the funds provided to local <Col N="37" /> authorities for planning charges, which are a direct investment by the house-owner for the improvement of the water, sewerage and road facilities, were diverted into the current account.  That is why in some cases many of these roads could and should have been improved before now.  We have to ensure that that capital investment by the public and the houseowner is put into infrastructural development and roads.

Over the period of this plan there will be a substantial investment in the public transport sector. This is a very important element in overall traffic management and will reduce the workload on our roads because there is not scope in the inner city for major road improvements.

Will the Minister request each local authority to produce a five year plan to update, repair and restore the basic foundation for county and minor roads both in Dublin and throughout the country?  What does he mean when he says that local authorities should allocate <Col N="38" /> more of their resources?  Is the Minister not aware that the only source of income local authorities have, outside of commercial rates, comes directly from his Department?  Will he agree that the problem with local authorities using moneys collected for other reasons on current spending is due to his failure to provide sufficient funds to them to provide basic services?  Will the Minister please stop misleading the public by suggesting that there is money available in local authorities to carry out essential repairs to roads which are disintegrating, particularly in the Dublin area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I have to correct the Deputy, who is assuming there are no funds available to the local authorities from their own resources.  The total amount available this year is in excess of £400 million.  If Fine Gael has reached the stage where it can disregard such amounts raised at local level I will not.  The question is not whether they have sufficient funding from their own resources.  It is obvious they do not and that is the reason I am supplementing their resources through discretionary grants and other sources.  The point I was trying to make was that some councils spend as little as £200 per mile on county roads while others spend as much as £1,800 to £2,000 per mile.  If a local authority decides to attach priority to a county road and spends £2,000 per mile from own resources while another spends as little as £200 per mile, I am entitled to question its priorities.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding raised by the State from the car owner, the Commission on Taxation and every reputable economic commentary on taxation during the past 25 years has ruled out the prospect of the Government designating funds raised from a particular group.

Does he realise that anger and frustration is building up among motorists and other road users who are rattled to death every time they travel the roads and that the foundations of houses are being damaged because the roads are in an appalling state?

      <P>I made regulations in April 1994 to commence the integrated pollution control licensing function of the Environmental Protection Agency from 16 May.

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Environmental Protection Agency made 11 recommendations to Cork County Council and the Hickson plant.  In a report issued in January this year the Environmental Protection Agency stated that a number of the recommendations had been implemented.  As I felt that progress in implementing the recommendations was slow, in April I made regulations setting out the detailed procedures for the integrated pollution control licensing function of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In so doing I brought existing large scale chemical and hazardous waste incinerating activities under Environmental Protection Agency control.  The Hickson Pharmachem plant must apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for an integrated pollution licence.  I am satisfied that the Environmental Protection Agency, having carried out a review, will take complete control of the Hickson Pharmachem plant application and will ensure that the recommendations it made will be implemented.</P>

    <P>The new scheme will be extended to include the towns of Ballinasloe, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge, Roscommon and Wicklow.  I am aware of the case made for designation of many other towns throughout the country but, to be effective, the scheme must be limited in its application.  There are, therefore, no proposals at present to extend the scheme to towns other than those I have mentioned, and certainly not to all urban areas.</P>
    <P>As a separate but related initiative, the Government statement of 24 April 1994 on western development announced that it was intended to introduce, on a pilot basis, an urban renewal incentive scheme in a small number of secondary towns in the west.  The detailed implementation aspects of this are being considered.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is disappointing.  For the scheme to be effective, why must the number of towns to which it applies be limited?  How would other towns and cities be affected if even one town in south-west Cork was included in the scheme?  I suggest that the contrary applies and that the Minister's case does not stand up.  Why is south-west Cork effectively declared a &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; area by this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government?  Having regard to the 12 towns to which the Minister referred, is it a coincidence that towns in the constituencies of the three Ministers present were included?  Is it not true that Nenagh is in the Minister's constituency?</P>

      <P>Primary consultations take place with local authorities and county managers concerning the areas to be designated within towns and counties.  While other representations are made to the Minister, primary consultation takes place with the local authorities.  An urban renewal grants scheme will be introduced shortly as a subprogramme to urban renewal which will make grants available to local authorities, civic trusts and other conservation bodies to carry out environmental upgrading works in towns throughout the country.  It is not the intention that these will be confined to towns that have gained urban renewal status but they will be available also to other towns.  I wrote to county managers recently asking them for their proposals in this regard with a view to having such works in place during 1994.  Let me make it clear to the House that these decisions are based on the merits of the cases presented to me and not on political considerations.</P>

      <P>As the Minister's party is promoting the Ethics in Government Bill, would it form part of ethics in Government that three Ministers managed to get towns in their own constituencies designated while places like south west Cork have no town designated? What exactly does urban renewal mean?  How would improving the centre of Clonakilty affect trade in Newbridge and what effect would improving town centres have on other towns?  Will the Minister apply the principle of urban renewal?  There are many parts of Dublin where efforts are being made to re-establish the old villages, for example, Shankill, Cornelscourt etc., where schemes of this nature would be of tremendous benefit.  Will the Minister consider looking at urban renewal in its real context of revitalising old areas and restoring the old villages and towns?</P>

They cannot criticise the designation of some towns and accuse me of political patronage or favouritism in these matters.  Fine Gael should put up or shut up.  They are either in favour of or opposed to the designation of these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the effect of urban renewal, probably the best example is where two pockets in need of renewal were selected <Col N="50" /> by the county manager and improved and, as a consequence, the area between, although not designated, also improved. The Deputy can look at the excellent work done in Bray by the council.  That is what is desired.  However, in some towns urban renewal simply did not take off despite about £1,000 million of private investment.  Such towns are getting a second bite at the cherry as they are not being de-designated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy exactly where it will take place.  The 25 per cent reduction is not confined to Dublin but is common to the five county borough areas.  Quite a number of the areas previously designated in Dublin have been renewed and it is very obvious where such renewal has occurred.  Some of the older areas will be redesignated and new areas will be designated.  The object this time is to designated specific pockets and to be more focused in that sense.  Pockets within Dublin will be designated for urban renewal and the upgrading that comes with urban renewal.  It is obvious that in Dublin that approach has succeeded.</P>
      <P>I reject any notion that the designations in Dublin or elsewhere are a political stroke by me, by my partners in Government or by the senior Minister. That is simply not so, and it is a falsehood to say so.</P>

      <P>I proposeto take the four questions together. <Col N="54" /></P>
      <P>On Thursday last I explained to the House in some detail the gravity of the crisis facing TEAM Aer Lingus.  I noted from the contributions of Deputies from all parties that there was a broad consensus in the House, as indeed there is outside the House, on the seriousness of the financial crisis facing TEAM.  The key facts, however, bear repeating.</P>
      <P>TEAM is insolvent and its ability to continue to pay wages is totally dependent on contributions from the scarce net income of Aer Lingus airline operations. This net income is being generated thanks to the sacrifices and adjustments made by Aer Lingus staff in their efforts to turn around the airline.  TEAM, which is now in such chronic deficit, cannot continue to be such a dangerous cash drain on the airline.  The cash haemorrhage average of £1 million a month during the busy maintenance months of winter will grow dramatically over the leaner summer months.</P>
      <P>Detailed negotiations on this dispute have been going on since September 1993.  The company's financial situation is progressively deteriorating to such an extent that these negotiations must stop now.  It is decision time for the survival of the company.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil on Thursday last and as I re-emphasise now, time and money have run out.  It was against this backdrop that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, called officials from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet both management and unions two weeks ago. Having been briefed by the senior officials from IBEC and ICTU the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on Wednesday 8 June requested the Labour Relations Commission to conduct an inquiry into the dispute under the section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  This was the first time that this exceptional measure was invoked and underlined the gravity and urgency of the TEAM crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission <Col N="55" /> furnished its report to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on Tuesday 14 June and informed him that during its investigation the parties gave no indication of an ability to recognise and discuss a common agenda that would lead to an agreed survival plan.  The commission, mindful of the perilous situation of the company and with a view towards maintaining the employment of the TEAM workforce and industrial peace, therefore made final settlement terms for acceptance by all parties.</P>
    <P>The company, although it did not receive all it sought from the Labour Relations Commission, accepted the Labour Relations Commission's final settlement terms.  I would plead with the trade unions in TEAM to do likewise. We must save this company now.  We can discuss how to develop it later.  If we do not take immediate action, TEAM Aer Lingus's market share will continue to erode to the point where it will run out of business.  It is in a fiercely competitive market with both national and international firms who continually adapt their cost bases to survive.  TEAM Aer Lingus must do likewise now.</P>
    <P>There are two problems which must be addressed: first we must save TEAM Aer Lingus and second we must develop it. The LRC settlement proposals recognise this and specifically in clause 24 provide a forum to do so.  Clause 24 states:</P>
    <P>The potential of the plan produced by the Craft Union Group to make significant contributions to the efficiency of the organisation and the development of its business must be acknowledged.  The parties to establish immediately a joint non-negotiating forum whose major initial task it will be to examine in detail the practicalities of adoption of the plans and to set a course for putting into place those strategies which can make a contribution to the future of the Company.</P>
    <P>Every possible industrial relations initiative has already been taken and processes have been fully utilised in this dispute. Even the exceptional measure of section <Col N="56" /> 38 (2) of the 1990 Industrial Relations Act has been invoked.  I do not believe that anything further can be achieved by referring the matter back to the Labour Relations Commission or any other forum which by definition would have a lesser standing than the LRC.  Indeed the Labour Relations Commission was only able to react with the speed and the professionalism which it did because of its detailed knowledge of the Aer Lingus and TEAM problems arising from its continuous intervention for the past 18 months or so.</P>
    <P>It is my personal desire and that of the Government that TEAM Aer Lingus should have not only an immediate future but also medium and long term prospects and that as many jobs as possible be maintained.  For that reason my Department on my specific instructions invited TEAM employee representatives to read the full LRC report last Friday.  I wished to ensure that there were no obstacles in the way of a full acceptance of the LRC settlement terms.  I regret that the craft unions have not found it possible so far to accept these terms.  I am appealing to them again at this late stage to reconsider their position and to avoid the unfortunate logic of their own stance.  Lay-offs are avoidable if they are prepared to indicate that they can accept the LRC terms as a necessary first step to address the immediate cash haemorrhage from the company and establish TEAM as a competitive player in the world's aircraft maintenance business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that we are on the brink of a very serious crisis considering the scale of threatened lay-offs. I would like the Minister to confirm that TEAM Aer Lingus can be a viable company. Does he recognise that confidence between unions and management of this company is extraordinarily low?  Would he accept that the logical implication is that he must make superhuman efforts to bridge the confidence gap?  Would he agree that the &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; stance which he and the Government have taken to the Labour Relations Commission report is in conflict with its guidelines <Col N="57" /> for the resolution of strikes in essential services where &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; is never part of the agreed vocabulary?  Surely with all the negotiating skills at the disposal of the Government, the Minister can create a forum that would avert 850 lay-offs, which would have implications for the whole aviation industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>TEAM Aer Lingus can be a viable company in the future if the settlement terms as outlined are accepted by all the parties.  It would be wrong of Deputy Bruton to suggest that the Labour Relations Commission has adopted an extreme position.  It has tried to arbitrate on the entrenched positions of both sides and has presented a very finely measured set of settlement terms which, if accepted by all parties, will enable the company proceed to the wider issues that need to be addressed to maintain its long term viability.</P>
      <P>There is a need for mutual confidence between management and unions.  I agree that the relationship between management and unions is not what one would like but that is a matter that must be resolved.  Steps have been taken at managerial level to improve relations, a change of management has taken place and the process will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me emphasise that I am seeking to make the facts known.  There is no question of brinkmanship or trying to play around with the jobs at stake.  At this stage a positive decision needs to be taken on the final settlement terms to ensure that the company is viable.  The Labour Relations Commission pointed out &ldquo;mindful of the perilous position of the company and in the interests of maintaining employment in TEAM Aer Lingus&rdquo; it put forward final settlement terms for acceptance by everybody.  Certainly its terms would not have been the preferred option of either management or unions but, given where we are now, the common sense approach is to accept the final settlement terms and under clause 24 to move on to a non-negotiating forum to discuss the wider issues.  It is acknowledged that the potential of plans drawn up by workers could be dealt with <Col N="58" /> in that forum.  This is the best and only way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister repeatedly states he is not in the business of brinkmanship yet he says the Labour Relations Commission's proposals are the final settlement proposals that must be accepted or inevitably the shutdown of the company will follow.  Surely he must agree that his stance is brinkmanship? Given the oft repeated statements by workers, Members and the Minister that the company ought to be saved, the Minister, as the representative of the shareholders, should intervene directly to bring both sides together to find a rational solution to this problem and this is the only forum superior to the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's assertion that I am involved in brinkmanship. That is far from the case.  I have pointed out on numerous occasions in this House and at committee meetings the developing perilous situation and its inevitable consequences at TEAM Aer Lingus because of the fact there was no work available and cash was running out. I have been making that point as clearly as I possibly can, as I did last Thursday when answering questions so that no one would be under any misapprehension of the gravity of the situation.  The words &ldquo;final settlement terms&rdquo; were used by the Labour Relations Commission, the people with the expertise who have been dealing with the overall situation in Aer Lingus for up to 18 months.  The Labour Relations Commission, which has been asked to arbitrate under the exceptional measure of section 38 (2) is saying that acceptance of the final settlement terms by all parties is needed to restore viability and regain competitiveness in a very competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the facts and no amount of discussion will change the reality.  That must be grasped by all parties.  The Government has accepted the reality and has backed the Labour Relations Commission's final settlement terms.  Management, which has not got what it sought <Col N="59" /> in its submission to the Labour Relations Commission, has accepted those terms, although it would probably prefer others, and it is now down to the workers to accept the final settlement terms.  Nonacceptance has the unfortunate consequences that Deputies are mentioning because the enterprise is neither viable nor competitive as it stands.</P>
    <P>We have discussed Aer Lingus on many occasions since the crisis arose and we are all aware that sacrifices have been made by all in the airline group to bring about the recovery of the company. TEAM is being bankrolled from the scarce net income of the Aer Lingus airline group which cannot afford to continue to do that for any length.  The position cannot continue indefinitely. The facts are in the public domain and I set them out in a responsible way last Thursday so that people could understand the gravity of the situation.  That has been my motivation.  As I said in my reply, the collective expertise of the Labour Relations Commission has come forward with final settlement terms and the common sense approach appears to be that all parties, in the knowledge that no party is getting what it wants, would accept them in the interests of saving the company and that the future development and strategy of the company could be worked out in a non-negotiating forum.  I agree that there should be a greater level of real participation by the workforce, but in the meantime the financial crisis in TEAM is being bankrolled by the airline group which cannot continue to do so because it is trying to recover.</P>
    <P>There is no hidden agenda and I am pleading with all parties to accept the final settlement terms of the Commission as it offers the only visible way forward. All other issues, including the potential of plans drawn up by workers which the Labour Relations Commission acknowledges in its final settlement terms, should be raised in a non-negotiating forum during efforts to seek to develop strategies for the future.  What is clear is that unless the final settlement terms of the <Col N="60" /> Labour Relations Commission are accepted the future competitiveness of TEAM Aer Lingus cannot be achieved. I ask that common sense prevail.  While I deeply regret the position taken by the unions I believe that we must accept the gravity of the situation and make the necessary decisions to secure the future viability of TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy in the constituency where the company is based I am very aware of the difficulty in the constituency and in Dublin generally.  We have to accept that even the most reasonable worker sees the Labour Relations Commission document as an imposed solution.  As a former Minister for Labour, would the Minister agree that from the industrial relations aspect it would be more difficult to secure a resolution should a lock-out or a dispute take place?  Before things go over the cliff I suggest that we use the office of the Minister and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to appeal to both parties to come together and look at the possibilities. Having consulted with union representatives this afternoon I am aware that they want their proposals to be accepted, quantified and put into operation because over the years management has let them down.  They believe their plan has not been considered adequately and I am appealing for time to have it taken on board.  The collective wisdom of management and workers can secure the future of the company.  I appeal to the Minister to consider using ICTU to bring both parties together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Ryan's concern and the concern of many other Deputies and Senators from the constituency who have spoken to me regarding this matter.  It would be wrong to say that a full opportunity has not been given to the two parties concerned at the LRC to put their case.  A full opportunity has been given.  The referral, an exceptional measure which showed the seriousness with which my colleague, Minister Quinn, dealt with the matter, was an attempt to deal with it following IBEC's <Col N="61" /> and ICTU's consideration from both sides of the fence and their reporting to the Minister.  From this a decision came to refer under section 38 (2).  ICTU has been involved thus far and has sought over many months to find a solution to the problem.  Having consulted with them and IBEC the matter was referred, under section 38 (2), to the LRC for a report. The LRC said this was the only way forward it could find.  A full opportunity was given to both parties at that hearing to put their cases together.</P>
      <P>The LRC, which is very experienced in this whole area, concluded that it was not possible, despite the most recent conciliation talks between the parties on Monday, 6 June in the LRC, and the involvement of IBEC and ICTU, to obtain a basis for the commencement of realistic negotiations and that the parties' positions remained entrenched.  It stated that during the investigation a similar position pertained as the parties gave no indication of an ability to recognise and discuss a common agenda that would lead to an agreed survival plan.  The commission, mindful of the perilous situation facing the company and with a view towards maintaining the employment of the workforce and industrial peace, made the final settlement terms.  Because of the many months, days and man hours put in by both sides in seeking to address the fundamental issues, there was a need for third party intervention.  It was not possible, however, to bring them together on a common agenda and, mindful of the perilous situation facing the company, the LRC came forward with final settlement terms to be accepted by everybody as a compromise and an acknowledgement that there is potential in developmental plans for the future.  That is given precedence in clause 24 which states that the parties should sit down in a non negotiating forum and apply those strategies which will help the viability of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The LRC, which is the acknowledged industrial relations expert in this area and which was asked to report by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has come forward with these settlement <Col N="62" /> terms as the only way forward given the present position.  It is important for everyone to understand that it is not a question of a different agenda &mdash; this is the present position.  We would rather have had a solution which would meet and overcome the problems but that was not possible.  We must re-establish the competitiveness of this firm in order for it to have a future.  The people in TEAM have remarkable skills but we must ensure that they can price jobs competitively, get the work and generate revenue to pay the wages which will help investment in the future.  That is the nature of every enterprise and we have come to the stage where that cash drain cannot continue.  Viability must be established if the company is to have a future. We cannot have a situation where a hard pressed airline group is being asked to bankroll TEAM.  It is also in a state of recovery and would be put at risk if we were to allow that to continue.</P>
    <P>I am pleading for common sesne to prevail in the interest of maintaining employment.  I am asking that these final settlement terms be agreed so that we can establish and develop the strategies that will give a more credible and viable future for TEAM with the participation of everybody in the company.  No amount of discussion will change the facts I have outlined and they have to be confronted.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that he is being led astray by his advisers and that the Cahill plan, which was to resolve the financial problems of Aer Lingus, is now unravelling?  Will he accept also that this is not a public service dispute?  This is a company of 1,900 workers whose jobs are at stake.  The potential viability of the company is at <Col N="63" /> stake also.  Will the Minister accept that the only course of action open to him is direct intervention and the creation of a new forum, since confidence no longer exists between the unions and the management in respect of the LRC report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear the Deputy, at the end of his question, cast some doubt on the LRC report.  The LRC is the acknowledged expert in this area. It has been close to the problems not only in TEAM but also in the Aer Lingus group for the past 18 months.  I can assure the Deputy that its members are most able conciliators, and the State is fortunate to have them.  They have come forward with these settlement terms as the only solution available.  That point must be made quite clear.  It is an integral part of any strategy for recovery within the Aer Lingus group generally that all sections of the group make a contribution towards recovery.  We have reached the stage now where, within TEAM, a contribution must be made.  I realise that poses difficulties but the survival of the company is at stake and, therefore, we must take the necessary decisions, based on the views of the only people whom we can trust to arbitrate on this matter in an objective fashion, namely, the LRC.  The LRC is highly regarded and respected right across the industrial relations spectrum, by employers and employees, workers and trades unions alike.  We must take its views on board and move forward.  We cannot do otherwise because there is nothing further I can do that will change the economic facts of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received approval from the European Commission to inject £25 million equity into this company under certain conditions, namely, that its viability be established.  The conditionality applies in relation to all parts of the equity injection into Aer Lingus and the airline group has balloted and agreed on a restructuring and rationalisation programme that seeks to achieve those objectives. The same applies here but both sides in TEAM have been unable to establish a <Col N="64" /> common agenda and reach decisions.  We cannot postpone decisions indefinitely.  If this company was a stand alone operation it would have been put into receivership some time ago.  The airline company is bankrolling TEAM and it cannot continue to do that for any length of time without putting its own position at risk. Taking all that into account and having regard to what will happen if we do not reach positive decisions, it is in the interest of everybody, including the workers, to accept the final settlement terms and progress strategies which will ensure viability in the future.  It is the only way forward and I am pleading that that be done.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the unions will not listen to his pleading unless he and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, agree to take a hands on interest and involvement in this dispute?  The Minister tells us that the LRC report contains the seeds of agreement but it has not worked. Does he accept that the LRC is not the Government or the chief shareholder and that it is up to him to take an interest in it?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, set a precedent when he intervened in an electricity strike.  I ask the Minister, for the sixth time, if he will give the House an assurance that he will not allow this company to layoff 850 people before he meets with the unions and the new chief executive, Mr. Hurley, to try to hammer out an agreement which would save the company?  Does the Minister agree that the unions have no vested interest in seeing the company go to the wall, that their interest is to save the jobs and the company and their reason for not accepting the LRC report is they have not seen anything in it that ensures the long term viability of the company?  The Minister must assure the House that he will intervene now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add to the LRC final settlement terms.  Even if the Government had more money at its disposal than the £25 million it is prepared <Col N="65" /> to invest I would not be allowed to invest it under EU rules.  These are the terms and layoffs are avoidable based on shareholders, management and unions accepting them.  I cannot add to nor subtract from the final settlement terms and that is why I ask those from whom we await a positive decision, the trade unions involved, to take that on board and accept this is the only commonsense way forward.  It gives me no joy to say that but that is the position.  We as a Government accepted the responsibilities imposed on us by the LRC final settlement terms. Management, who did not get what they sought, accepted them.  We are left with the other party to the dispute and I ask them to consider in the cold light of day that this is the position.</P>
      <P>Acceptance provides us with the opportunity, as the LRC states, to withdraw protective notices.  This is the way forward and then to develop the company through the non-negotiating forum.</P>

Will the Minister take a hands on approach armed with the model of Shannon?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Shannon Aerospace or any other company I would not be so presumptious as to talk about a company I am not dealing with.  Any company or organisation involved in this business is in it because it is competitive and able to get business.  In the past TEAM secured <Col N="66" /> business but it was not viable.  Acceptance of the terms is a prerequisite to viability.  There is no magic formula.  We have been through the full gamut of procedures and processes since last September. I understand the dilemmas it raises for people on all sides in TEAM but this is where we are and we do not have any luxuries left to weigh or further discuss.  It is decision time.  The survival of the company is at stake and it is on that basis that I make my plea to everyone concerned.</P>

To suggest that the LRC report is the only solution to this complex issue is overstating the case.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share and understand the Deputy's concern.  He is a constituency Deputy for the area.  The reason we are down to the wire in terms of accepting the LRC final settlement terms is that time has run out.  There is no room for manoeuvre.  Some progress was made in negotiations over the past nine months. The LRC final settlement terms refer to undisputed points of agreement being incorporated as part of the solution together with the other terms they set out as having the prospect of viability.  Had both parties been able to address the magnitude of the problem on a negotiating bilateral basis the LRC would not have been required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we are at the wire and must seek acceptance of the LRC final settlement terms is, as late as last week when the LRC were asked in as an exceptional measure under section 38 (2) &mdash; a referral from the Minister to the Labour Relations Commission&mdash;it was not possible for both parties to come forward with a common agenda and reach decisions to meet the magnitude of the problem.  That is why we have reached the stage where acceptance of the final settlement terms <Col N="68" /> by all sides is being sought.  Given the gravity, seriousness and urgency of the problem the LRC came forward with these final settlement terms which it hopes will maintain employment.  If these terms were not put forward then we would not have available to us any framework within which we could move forward, even at this late stage.  The acceptance of the final settlement terms by the three parties concerned &mdash; the Government as shareholder, management and the union &mdash; would be the first step in establishing viability.  This is a prerequisite for any further discussions about potential developmental strategies which can be adopted on a bilateral and participative basis between management and unions in the future.  Those are the facts and that is why there is no room for manoeuvre at this stage.</P>

I am seeking to explain as best I can to the Deputy and people outside this House <Col N="69" /> the seriousness and urgency of the problem. Those facts are not going to change. Even if there were 20 meetings, one would not change the central issue.  Two of the parties, the shareholder and management, have positively addressed the issue and I am asking the other party to address it in the same way, understanding as I do the difficulties it poses for them. This is the only framework on which I, the workers and the enterprise can go forward.  That is the position, and I cannot make it any clearer.

      <P>As I have previously pointed out to the Deputy, I do not regard the analogy with Northern Ireland <Col N="70" /> as appropriate.  No organisation or enterprise has the standing or expertise of the LRC in this area or knows as much about the workings of Aer Lingus and the problems pertaining to TEAM.  Its officers have been involved in an intimate way for many months in dealing with these problems.  No other organisation would be accepted as being in a position to listen to both sides of the argument and come to conclusions.  The conclusion it has come to is, unfortuntely, as I have outlined. It put forward final settlement terms for acceptance by everyone.  I wish it were otherwise, but that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have run out of time, cash and work and the parties involved in the dispute have to come to certain conclusions on that basis.  Everyone has to make a decision mindful that the position will not change, except to deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £1 million per month drain on the airline during the winter months becomes much higher in leaner summer months and this certainly cannot be borne by the airline.  Another part of the company, which is in recovery and has made sacrifices and a contribution towards viability, will be put at risk if more time is sought.  Unfortunately, time has run out.  The problems of TEAM have been under discussion for many months but it was not possible to report progress.  In spite of the unprecedented referral of the problem to the LRC by the Minister, there was still an inability to form a common agenda at that late stage.  The final settlement terms have been put forward because of the gravity and seriousness of the situation and in the interests of maintaining employment.  Logic and common sense dictate that we must move on from here and that all parties should accept the final settlement terms as a framework on which we can move forward. The other issues which are near and dear to people's hearts can be dealt with under clause 24 for the purpose of further progressing the company.  Given <Col N="71" /> the facts I have outlined, what other way forward is there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>The workers are prepared to negotiate an agreement and last February-March they negotiated savings of £14 million.  Time is running out and given that the workers have rejected the plan, I appeal to the Minister, congress or an independent body to provide more time to enable the staff and the company to resolve the problems.  If this takes another week, so be it &mdash; it will be worth it.  If the problem escalates into a dispute it will be much more difficult to resolve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to refer to the confidential parts of the report which the unions saw last Friday relating to the agreement and whether savings of £14 million were involved.  I do not wish to breach confidentiality but those parts of the report were dealt with in some detail and the unions will be aware of the LRC's position on them.</P>
      <P>We have gone through the full gamut of industrial relations bodies and the LRC is the only body which has the expertise to deal with this matter.  No further time is available to look at the problem.  We have reached the eleventh hour and I am asking people to accept the final settlement terms so as to maintain employment. The other issues can be dealt with separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the unions are concerned the eleventh hour was reached last March when a previous agreement was negotiated.  Will the Minister bear in mind that the unions do not necessarily want to talk to him about extra money from Europe?  They want to talk about future strategy for the company.  The Minister should not underestimate his role in this regard.  Like his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who beame actively involved in a previous dispute, he should take his position seriously and talk to the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus.  We are <Col N="72" /> concerned about this company and he is talking to us, but will he please talk to the workers in TEAM?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial relations dispute in which the Minister, Deputy Ahern, became involved was totally different.  The Deputy asked me to discuss the future prospects of the company. The future is at stake if the terms of this final settlement are not accepted.  If discussions were to bring about viability, we would have had viability a long time ago.  Deputy Sargent who represents that constituency, will be aware of the position also, and I share his concern, but one cannot put the overall enterprise at risk; one has to take decisions.  We have come to that decision; we are at the survival stage and we must be positive.  It is in everybody's interests and common sense dictates it be accepted.</P>
      <P>There is nothing further which can be discussed which would allow us the time or manoeuverability to which Deputy Burke and others referred.  As I said on Thursday last we are at the gate and we know how serious is the matter.  I get no joy from saying that.  It is important, when people have heard the factual position and realise their jobs are at stake, that we seek to take an informed decision in the interests of all our futures; that is what is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has often prided himself on being a pragmatist.  He is not being very pragmatic here and he needs to recognise that this company will collapse unless he takes a hand in resolving the matter.  As he is unwilling to give a commitment in this House to meet the unions, will he endeavour to convince the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, to meet the unions and the new chief executive in order to bring this matter to some kind of conclusions acceptable to all concerned?  It was the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who appointed the Labour Relations Commission and, in his statement, requested them to find &ldquo;an agreed solution&rdquo;, not an imposed one.  If the Minister for Transport, Energy and <Col N="73" /> Communications will not meet the unions, will the Government please request the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to do so?</P>

      <P>I am not selective in my concern.  I also have responsibilities to the many workers in the airline group who have made contributions and sacrifices. I have responsibilities to the taxpayer and to everyone concerned.  I am deeply mindful of my responsibilities in so far as the position of TEAM Aer Lingus is concerned.  We are all on the one wavelength.  We all want a future for TEAM but we cannot wish a future; we have to establish it and give the company a viable, competitive framework within which to work.  That does not exist at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way forward is within the framework outlined.  Until we reach that position talks about the future of TEAM are on very flimsy ground unless we can establish its competitive base.  That is fundamental to any enterprise and that is the position we are at.  I must remind Deputies that, in terms of additional time, the Aer Lingus airline cannot continue to bankroll TEAM; the airline would place itself at risk were it to do so.  As we enter into the lean summer months for TEAM Aer Lingus, the airliners contributions will rise to an extent which simply would not be tenable and would put that enterprise at risk.  Everybody should bear in mind the gravity, seriousness and urgency of the position and allow common sense prevail.  I refuse to believe that anybody is not interested in maintaining employment &mdash; we are all on the same wavelength in that respect &mdash; but this is the only framework within which that can be driven forward.  We have run out of time, out of manoeuverability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 27, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the substantial effect of the Act shall not be impaired by the partial implementation of its provisions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that this Bill is necessary in order to comply with EU legislation. The reason I am proposing this amendment is that this section provides for the partial implementation of the provisions of the Bill, as necessary, which I understand is normal procedure.  This has become an expedient in recent times which is not useful or helpful.  I recall that while certain sections of the Child Care Act were implemented on time others were not implemented until a later date.  There is a danger that the delayed implementation of a section or sections can have serious negative effects.  That is the reason I am proposing this amendment.</P>
      <P>In the situation that is likely to develop in the health insurance market during the next few months I do not think we can delay full implementation of the Bill.  It is probably the Minister's intention to monitor the position to see when it is expedient to implement particular sections, but there is a possibility that the delayed implementation of sections may lead to the creation of loopholes which will become obvious to those who wish to exploit them.  I am not talking here about any companies in this country.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly said, this is a standard provision to ensure that the Bill will not come into force immediately on enactment by both Houses of the Oireachtas and when it is signed by the President.  It allows for flexibility to implement sections as it is deemed appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> As I explained on Second Stage, I do not envisage all the provisions of this Bill coming into force immediately.  I want to see how the market develops.  I am creating a framework to provide for open competition in the health insurance market.  There may be no new competitors for the existing main player in that market.  Therefore there may be no need to establish, for example, the health insurance authority or to provide for the mechanism of risk equalisation which appears to be complicated but which has been thought out carefully.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that there be flexibility to review the matter as circumstances unfold subsequent to 1 July. This section allows for flexibility to put mechanisms in place as appropriate to safeguard the principles which we all want to preserve &mdash; the principles of open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

The Deputy seeks to include the words &ldquo;provided that the substantial effect of the Act shall not be impaired by the partial implementation of its provisions&rdquo;. Who would make the determination? The best way to preserve the key principles I have outlined is to ensure that there is flexibility so that I can respond as necessary.</P>
      <P>The Bill is unique in that we are trying to define market conditions that do not currently exist.  We are not sure what type of players or packages will be on offer or the response the general public will make to them.  We are trying to protect the consumer and for that reason I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete lines 30 and 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may come as a surprise to many general practitioners to discover their services being described as &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo; in this Bill.  I have been lobbied by a number of GPs in respect of this definition.  A fundamental issue is at stake here in respect of areas of the health service about which the Minister spoke eloquently.  If this amendment is not accepted ancillary health services will include the services of general practitioners for the purposes of this Bill and, in effect, primary care and the services <Col N="158" /> of general medical practitioners will be marginalised in a way that is no longer in tune with the reality of the GP service.</P>
    <P>It will also contradict the many statements made by the Minister in regard to the importance of GP services.  In that regard I refer to his strategy where he correctly states that the GP service would be better organised and supported in fulfilling a wider and more integrated role in the health care system.  The question of integration was a key issue in tabling my amendment.  Under the definition in the Bill, primary care and the GP service will be fragmented and marginalised in a way which is not only inconsistent with the Minister's views, but also unnecessary for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider this definition?  For the purposes of this Bill it is not necessary to describe GP services as ancillary and the legislation can be redrafted in the manner I propose.  It would be insulting to those working in primary care to promote the idea that somehow primary care is an ancillary service. It would militate against the integration of the service to have that false separation.  It is generally recognised that integration is the way forward and the Medical Council has recognised general practice as a speciality in its own right. There is a contradiction between what the Minister stated publicly and what is in this Bill.  As we are gender-proofing and carrying out various other types of proofing in respect of legislation it is important that legislation is proofed in the light of the health strategy.  I hope the Minister takes cognisance of these points.  The provisions in my amendment do not conflict with his view and would not create difficulties for the implementation of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister rationalises this definition and puts the business right.  If he does not, regardless of what he might say the signal will be implicit that somehow GP services are ancillary to health services.  Surely that is no longer the case. That can no longer be the case if we are to have proper integrated health services in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy McManus.  Health services are developing and attitudes towards them are changing.  The provision of services, such as hospitals, has changed in the past number of years and we now have what are known as day beds, outpatients services and so on.  It is unfortuante that a reference to ancillary services is included in this manner in the Bill.  It gives the impression that those services are of a secondary nature whereas they are fundamental, especially in the provision of services in a modern context.  The Minister should accept this amendment as it would eliminate any slight &mdash; even though it might be unintended &mdash; on those involved in that arm of the service and at the same time strengthen the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I, too, support this amendment.  Only two weeks ago a woman of almost 80 years in my area urgently required hospital treatment. Her doctor had her admitted to a hospital with which the Minister is familiar, but the specialist had to send her back across the border to Carlow where she had since been cared for by her GP who in the long run plays the role of specialist, house doctor and nurse.  To regard the services of GPs as ancillary is misreading the position.  When one considers the waiting lists and hospital bed shortages, in many ways GPs are the heroes of the medical profession and it is in our interest that they are seen as playing a major role by excluding them from the ancillary section.  I presume the Red Cross is also part of the ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the definition sections of the Bill.  I sympathise with the views of Deputies opposite.  The measure of importance with which we value general practitioners must be clearly underscored.  They are core service providers.  However, the import of this section is different.  I am required to set the minimum benefits package that will be necessary subsequent to the enactment of this legislation and I want to respond to the needs <Col N="160" /> of the consumer in that regard.  I do not wish to set the minimum package at such a high level that it will force or encourage people not to opt for voluntary health insurance.  That is the import of defining a core package of basic cover and other essential services such as general practice or outpatient services, which nobody would regard as irrelevant.  We should not confuse the word &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; or &ldquo;less relevant&rdquo;. Perhaps the choice of the word &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; was unfortunate and if we had thought longer and harder we might have come up with a more appropriate one.</P>
      <P>What is at issue is the definition of a core package which every health insurer will be required to offer as a minimum. Deputies opposite are asking that general practice be included.  We took advice on that because it is something to which I am not averse and which it would be important to do if we could.  We asked our consultants to look at it from an insurance perspective and they advised that it would not be appropriate to include general practice because of the economic consequences.  I have accepted that advice but I have retained the power to adjust minimum benefit as circumstances dictate and have not closed the door forever on changing the minimum benefit to include general practice at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance industry has advised that general practitioner costs are not particularly suited to insurance.  In the United Kingdom the major health insurers, BUPA and BPP, do not provide general practice benefit.  The objective of this legislation is to regulate a market, to define the terms of the market.  In defining the minimum core benefits it is not my intention to pass any judgment on the value of ancillaries that are not included in that minimum core.  What I want is a minimum core that will ensure people have a basic range of benefits that they can afford to pay for.  Of course, no company will be proscribed from offering additional benefit, including general practice cover, and the company that provides those enhanced packages will be more attractive to the general public. <Col N="161" /> Currently, the only major health insurance operator in the country, VHI, does provide general practice cover.  I hope that will be the norm.  However, the advice I sought and accepted from the consultants on European norms is that we should not include general practice or out patient cover in the minimum benefit package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking advice from insurance companies about the shape and profile of our health services and treating the health service as if it is a product like any other.  Clearly it is not. I agree with the Minister that there probably is no great attraction to take out insurance for general practitioner services because general practitioners demand modest fees.  Having said that, I still favour the principle of providing a free general practitioner service for all and would actively support that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has enormous room for manoeuvre in this Bill.  He could do anything. Surely it would be better to be consistent with all the statements he has made and include general practitioners in the minimum package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few people will take out cover for general practitioner services, but if they do, surely they are entitled to the same protection as people looking for cover for hospital care.  It would be far more logical to include general practitioner services as part of the core health care services.  If it does not work out, for whatever reason, the Minister can always go back to the drawing board and change the rules.  He is adopting the wrong approach and down-grading a core element in the service. He cannot say that he does not mean to do that and that he would like to be able to come up with a better word. The word in the Bill is &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo;, I am a practical person and if I see that word I know what it means.  The Minister knows what it means, as does every general practitioner in the country.  I am asking that he make a simple change and accept this amendment.  If it does not work out he can always exclude it on the ground that it was tried but did not work.  The Minister has made great play of the fact <Col N="162" /> that he is progressive and forward-looking, that he wants to change the face of the health services to focus more on primary care.  He has a chance now to do it in a small way.  If he does not do so it is an indication that when it comes to making small decisions that have an element of newness he would rather play safe.  The Minister has no need to play safe because all the safeguards are there if any problems arise in the future.  The Minister does not know what will happen, so why does he not fix the colours to the mast?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an insurance Bill flowing from an insurance directive, the third non-life directive from the European Union.  To say that we should not be mindful that this is an insurance Bill is to miss the point.  The issue is the minimum package that an insurer will be obliged by law to provide for the client.</P>
      <P>We could include everything but we are excluding, for example, dental care. Is that an insult to dentists?  If a Deputy opposite were of a mind to promote the cause of dentistry, would I not be hearing the same arguments in favour of dentistry which is also excluded from the core package.</P>
      <P>We must define a package that the consumer can afford.  I do not want to define a minimum package which, because of the inclusion of general practice cover, would be pitched at a premium that would exclude categories of people who would like minimum coverage.  That is in no way to say that I do not regard general practice as extremely important. My funding of general practice over the last 18 months underscores my support for general practice development.  I have made more strides in the last 18 months than any other Minister in recent times. Including dentistry from the minimum package I do not denigrate or downgrade the practice of dentistry, nor do I expect that dentistry will not be part of packages that will be on offer from insurance companies operating in the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about is the statutory minimum package required of insurers.  That is important.  We must take <Col N="163" /> the insurers' advice.  We are trying at least to maintain the numbers who are currently insured in the new competitive markets.  The advice I have from consuitants who have actuarial and insurance skills is that I should not include general practice.  I regret that, but that was their advice and I have accepted it.  I will keep a close watching brief on the market as it unfolds and if it dictates that I should change the minimum package to include general practitioner services in the future, I have reserved to myself the powers to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that again the insurance companies are trying to get away with the minimum? Everything becomes an extra and it is the extras on which they make their money. In many areas, not just the area of health insurance, people find that when they claim they are not insured for what they want to claim for.  Who is setting the minimum cost to provide a minimum package?  It is the insurance companies, and if they can get away with excluding general practitioner services or dental services from the minimum package, they will do so because they can treat them as extras and make more money out of them.  It suits them to keep the minimal package to the briefest cover possible. They will advertise at a certain price, but many people will realise they need greater cover and will have to pay extra for the services the Minister is excluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I take on board the Minister's argument, he is being sold a pig in a poke by insurance companies. There is merit in Deputy McManus's amendment. The Minister alluded to the fact that he would have preferred to see general practice included.  I suggest it should be included and should not be seen as an extra service to be paid for by the consumer. The Minister should seriously consider the amendment.  General practice is a core requirement of those who need health care.  In many respects it is the first stop in a whole range of services. The minimum requirement is covered by <Col N="164" /> the insurance company, but there must be a balance regarding the health requirement of the average person who would prefer to see general practice included. We would also like to see dental care and other issues covered.  It would be wise to include general practitioners for the reasons stated.</P>

      <P>I support the previous speakers.  Modern technology has enabled general practitioner services to be extended far beyond their remit of 25 or 30 years ago.  The pooling of resources, availability of records, computerisation and so on have given general practitioner services a much more fundamental role. Health clinics are provided by general practitioners in various areas and resources are pooled to such an extent that virtual mini-hospital services are provided, which is very welcome.  The points made by Deputies McManus, Cullen and Browne are valid and should be taken on board.  There is nothing to be gained by relegating general practitioner services to a secondary role.  They are the first line of services to which the consumer has recourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter that concerns me is the impact of insurance regulations on the Bill.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment will have an input in this area.  I am concerned about the commercial aspect that may be introduced by that Department.  As a former spokesman on the insurance industry I was not always impressed by the Department's response to questions and I am not becoming more impressed as time passes. The points raised by my colleagues are valid and were raised for genuine reasons, as the Minister has accepted.  I <Col N="165" /> see no reason that the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much that Deputies opposite have said, but I am making a different point.  I address my comments particularly to Deputy Cullen, whose party always advocates the right of the consumer and consumer choice.  I am defining the minimim package to be available to the general public.  To give the analogy of car insurance, I could make a very strong case that third party, fire and theft should be the minimum package, but comprehensive packages are also offered and it is up to the consumers to decide on the cover they need. If we insisted that everybody should have comprehensive policies &mdash; that would be laudable &mdash; many people would be unable to pay car insurance premia.</P>
      <P>There are many items I would like to include in an insurance package and for which I would like to see people covered, but I want them to make the decision.  I do not want to decide in Hawkins House or Leinster House that people should have a certain level of cover and cannot opt out of that.  I am defining a minimum and people will have a choice thereafter of other services which they deem appropriate to their personal needs.  I would be careful in defining the minimal package too comprehensively because if the minimum package is all-encompassing, what would the other plans consist of?  The minimum package I am defining is greater than some of the baselines that are acceptable as insurance cover in other parts of the European Union.  For example, I do not want the position whereby people who are hospitalised find they are not covered for their stay in hospital or for consultants' fees.  I am concerned that we should not define the package too broadly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite are right in that we are trying to look to the future and define the market.  Deputy McManus is right in that I have retained powers to change the ground rules as market demand dictates, protecting the basic principles on which there is consensus. On Deputy Durkan's point about the role <Col N="166" /> of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, under the Bill that Department will have a role up to the time the health insurance authority is established, should that ever be done.  Its role will relate only to the carrying out of functions that are appropriate to its insurance division that monitors solvency margins and the financial side of the operation of companies.  My Department has no expertise in that area.  The health aspects will be a matter for my Department. There will be no intrusion in the health aspects of the Bill by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Its role will be to monitor the solvency margins and the insurance criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to define a framework within which insurance will operate.  We need to protect the desired principles and define a minimum package that should be on offer so that token packages will not be available whereby people think they are insured and find when they need to avail of insurance they are not sufficiently covered.  That is the thinking behind defining a minimum package.  I am suggesting there is a cogent reason for not defining the minimum package too broadly and hopefully that will in no way be seen as a devaluation of all the other very important health care services, including specifically general practice, outpatient and dental services, all of which are vital health services with great merit.  I hope the Deputies opposite will accept my basic argument and let us proceed with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can accept what the Minister says as the total answer to the points we raised.  The Minister has stated that we must have a minimum package.  There are many ways to achieve that; we could have had a minimum package which excluded certain specialties, for example, cardiology or neurology.  However, the Minister has designed a minimum package which excludes a specialty, general practice.  It is not a minimum package but a package <Col N="167" /> with a missing element.  What concerns me is that the Minister's package reinforces the fragmentation in the health services.  As everybody knows, the relationship between doctors at primary care level and hospital doctors is unique and I do not think it is quite accurate to compare it with dental or other ancillary services &mdash; which I recognise are very important, I am not arguing that point &mdash; but which are very different.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister accepts the idea of the basic principles he included for hospital cover, such as open enrolment, but somehow those basic principles need not apply for cover for GP services. Is the Minister saying that it is all right that the principle of open enrolment does not apply to insurance cover for GP services? That, in effect, is what he is saying. If it is not included in the mainstream, it is not included in the minimum package. The Minister in effect is saying that there will be a minimum package with certain restrictions, which I support, but which excludes one specialty only, yet it is the one service with which most patients have direct contact.  The vast majority of patients are more likely to meet their general practitioner than a neurologist.</P>
      <P>The VHI has already examined the question of providing GP cover.  What is unusual is that the majority of people in Ireland pay for the service of a general practitioner whereas in many other countries they do not have a private general practitioner service.  That, perhaps, is the reason the Minister is in the unusual position of having to consider this question but the Minister must remember that it is because we do not have a free general practitioner service that he should accept the points we raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We can labour this point for a long time.  I do not think it is comparable to say that I could have taken a decision to exclude cardiology or some other specialty that is required at a traumatic moment in one's lifetime.  What has to be taken into account is the afford-ability of the service.  A coronary arterial by-pass operation is a hugely expensive <Col N="168" /> procedure and it would not be in the interest of the consumer with health insurance to exclude expensive procedures which an individual simply could not afford.  General practice, as the Deputy rightly says, is on the other scale of expense and I understand that fees range from £12 to £20.  That is affordable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not affordable for everybody but 35 per cent of the population have free GP services under the general services medical scheme and more than one-third of the population is entitled to free GP services.  It is not true to say, as the Deputy has, that we are unique in having a private general practitioner service.  General practitioners have private practices but the State pays for more than one-third of the population to have access to those private general practitioners as well as paying for their drug bills.  That is a good system and other countries have looked to it as a model for their service.  Those below the income threshold by and large have medical cards and are able to avail of the service.  What we are talking about here is defining a package for those who want to buy private health insurance cover. Every citizen is entitled to free hospital care but we are defining a minimum package for those who want to buy private health insurance.  I do not think it would be right to exclude very expensive procedures such as cardiology from the minimum package as it would be wrong to encourage people to pay into a health insurance scheme when cover for certain conditions at the time of greatest need is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think my approach is right.  It defines the minimum package and covers in-patient care for all procedures.  It does not cover general practice <i>ab initio</i> but as the market develops we may be able to redefine the minimum package to include general practitioner services.  On Second Stage I said that in any event there will be a total review of regulations of the operation of health insurance.  At that stage, if not sooner, we can make whatever <Col N="169" /> adjustments are necessary.  I ask the Deputies opposite to accept the compelling logic of my argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy opposite knows, there is a simple explanation for everything.  The Deputy quotes subsection (2) on page 4 which refers to the powers given to the Minister for Health under regulation to change the definitions to include general practice at a future stage should that be necessary.</P>

How are we supposed to know a hidden clause states that if the Minister wants to introduce something, he has the power to do so?

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the prescription of them by the Minister which will include them or not.  They are excluded specifically in section 2 (1) but I have power under section 2 (1) (ii) on page 4 to include them at some future <Col N="170" /> date by regulation if the circumstances of time demand.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour this point.  I was not proposing that cardiology should be excluded.  I am simply making the point that it is illogical to exclude a speciality such as cardiology.  If this were part of the core health service, including the GP service &mdash; a person who took out insurance could well find that as they got older their need for GP services became considerable and expensive.  As we get older we are inclined to become more prone to illness.  Regardless of how the Minister tried to &ldquo;dress up&rdquo; GP services and the GMS, he is aware that thousands of people, particularly the elderly, cannot afford to go to a GP.  To include that service within the core health service would mean that it is treated on a par with the other costs that might arise but which may never arise in a person's life.  For elderly people the likelihood is that the cost requirements of going to a GP service are greater than that of any other speciality service yet the Minister is specifically excluding it and treating it as somehow ancillary to the health service.  That day is gone.</P>
      <P>I intend to press my amendment because I believe the Minister is wrong and that he is being led by the nose by insurance consultants who have no interest in the health service.  I respect the Minister because he has an interest in the health service but I am surprised he is taking this attitude which is unnecessary and is holding back progress in a petty way.  The Minister could accept the amendment and, if it does not work out in practice, he could simply change the rules.</P>

      <P>As I have said &mdash; although the Deputy continues to ignore it &mdash; we have provided free general practice services for more than one-third of the population and I would like that to be greater. The Deputy and I share the same view in relation to the development of the general practice service and we agree that great strides have been made in that area in the past 18 months.  There are great strides to be made which are clearly outlined in the national health strategy which has been embraced by the Irish College of General Practitioners and, I believe, by the IMO.  My Department will cooperate fully and help in its development but that is not the issue here.  I know the Deputy is passionate about this issue, and I am in agreement with her on it, but what is at issue here is defining a minimum package of benefits which every insurer operating in the new environment will be required to provide in law.  There is a compelling logic to what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance provided for GP services will, of course, be subject to community rating, as will all other ancillary services, under the terms of this legislation. The situation will not arise, therefore, where a person in their twilight years will find it unaffordable.  If they want to buy a package at a later stage which includes general practice they will be able to buy it at a community-rated <Col N="172" /> premium and not at a loaded premium because they are in their twilight years. That is the whole basis of community rating that will apply to all services that will be insured under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The argument has been exhausted on this issue.  I hope Deputies will accept my good faith in this regard.  I intend monitoring the situation closely and I have accepted good advice regarding the minimum that should be defined to offer the maximum number of options to the consumer to buy the package that suits him or her best.  I will not be determining what suits the consumers; they can make that choice and a variety of packages will be available to suit their individual needs, subject to the three principles on which we have consensus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>During my contribution last week I expressed the view that we concentrate too much on measures to deal with the consequences of crime rather than preventing it.  Before the adjournment of the debate I spoke on the section of the Bill dealing with remissions and the suggestion for a register of temporary releases, commutations, remissions and so forth.  I said this would unduly interfere with the rehabilitative process which is part and parcel of the temporary release programme and the management of offenders by our prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment the Minister gave in her speech to prepare and publish a strategic plan for the management of offenders generally.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister accepts the need for, and is open to the idea of, proper statistical analysis and <Col N="175" /> the publication of statistics in relation to temporary releases in general and the treatment of prisoners.  Often we get a very distorted view of what exactly is happening in our prisons and in relation to release policies.  We hear of the dramatic cases, the story about the person being released prematurely but, from my discussions with prison governors and from my own involvement in a number of cases, many of these headline grabbing instances are the rarity rather than the norm.  It is not as easy to get out of prison as we are led to believe.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable to have a public register of temporary releases or to publicise the names of those who are given temporary releases, whatever the reasons for those temporary releases.  It would unduly interfere with the rehabilitative process.  Many temporary releases are carried out in consultation with the Probation and Welfare Service.  There can be many genuine compassionate reasons for temporary releases and for releasing prisoners.  The process of trying to reintegrate prisoners into the community on their release must be taken into account. If we want people to turn their backs on crime, there should be some stage at which we allow them a fresh start without having to let everybody know exactly why they are being released and what their crime was.  This section of the Bill is insensitive and unacceptable in that respect.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of petitions, I am concerned about the trend in Irish political life to try to take the politician out of most decision making.  The view is sometimes expressed that if politicians are involved it must inherently be wrong. Political involvement is labelled as interference, or almost as corruption.  We witness the proliferation of boards, authorities and groups the purpose of which is to take power away from democratically elected public representatives. The cornerstone of any democracy is that the public representative is there to articulate and implement the will of the people.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a view abroad that <Col N="176" /> the best thing to do with the system now is to take the politician out of as many areas as we can.  This area of petitions is such an example.  We could argue that if we left the judicial system totally to its own devices in many respects we would have chaos across the country.  There would be many people in gaol who should not be there.  As I said last week, there is an urgent need for reform in the area of people going to gaol because of their inability to pay fines or simply because they, as social welfare recipients, do not have the capacity to pay the fines.  We have all had experience of such cases. In one case an illiterate gentleman was summonsed; he ended up in gaol.  That was totally unnecessary.  That case could have been dealt with more satisfactorily had social services intervened at a preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of cases where petitions have been sought on genuinely compassionate grounds.  The petition system is legitimate.  The Executive's power to remit penalties is provided for in the Constitution.  We should have confidence in the democratically elected Government of the day to administer that petition system in good faith, in the best interests of the public good and of the community at large.  I oppose the section of the Bill that envisages publicising that process.  That is an unacceptable invasion of privacy.  The petition system has been used to good effect in some areas and, by and large, it is not abused.  However, it highlights the need for reform in certain areas of the system and of our law.</P>
    <P>We need a more integrated approach to crime.  We can think up all the penalties we like, we can talk about reforming the prison system, but we should aim at a system that tries to reduce the number of people who go through the gates of a prison in the first place.  We lack an integrated approach to crime. The focus has been wrong.  There should be full involvement of all the agencies of the State &mdash; the local authorities, the health boards and the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.</P>
    <P>For many years those who designed local authority housing estates did not <Col N="177" /> take crime into account.  Many of the design patterns of local authority estates are such that those estates have become havens for crime and have facilitated criminals and theft.  When did we ever see the Garda, local authorities and architects coming together to look at the design of our cities and housing estates from the perspective of crime?  We have never looked at it from that perspective.</P>
    <P>The same applies to education, drug intervention and prevention programmes at primary and second levels.  The curricula are hopelessly devoid of any proper uniform drug prevention programme and alcohol and substance abuse programme. I rest my case.</P>

It places a major restriction on the right of accused persons to silence.  It provides for changes in the manner in which persons who are mentally ill are dealt with by the courts, and their subsequent treatment. Some of the provisions may be more appropriate to the health area than the criminal justice area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have reservations about some of the provisions of the Bill, I acknowledge that it is a positive and constructive contribution to the debate on badly needed reforms in these areas.  The Democratic Left believes that the principle of the Bill should be accepted by the Government.  At the end of Second Stage, the Bill could go to a special committee where its provisions could be examined in detail.  By using Private Members' Time we do not have the same opportunity to tease out the issues as we would have if the Bill was referred to a special committee.  That is where the <Col N="178" /> serious work of teasing out the pluses and minuses of the Criminal Justice Bill could take place.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the section dealing with bail.  Nobody is happy with the present situation where known persistent offenders are arrested and released on bail only to offend again.  Steps must be taken to break that cycle because the situation is unsustainable.  An ordinary decent citizen who may be a victim of crime or who may have witnessed a crime being committed sees these characters, who often have long criminal records, back on the streets after being arrested. This cycle must be broken.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets minimum levels of bail for certain offences; it provides for the forfeiture of bail if an offender commits further offences while on bail.  Although I was a TD for three and a half years, until recently I thought that when someone found a bailsperson, bail would be forfeited if that person committed a crime. I understand bail is only lost when the individual does not appear in court.  That restricted use of bail should be extended to cover a wider area.  We must ensure these changes make it more difficult for offenders to secure bail.  We must also consider the implications of such a move, and that is where a special committee would be of assistance.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 November 1993, stated that if a significant number of accused are to be denied bail and remanded in custody pending trial, then in the present circumstances, the only certain result would be that prison cells would be emptied of those who have been found guilty, but who have not yet served their sentences, to make room for those who have not yet been found guilty and who may be acquitted.  My colleague, Deputy McDowell, appreciates this because the author of that article is the author of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we perpetrate the revolving door syndrome?  What are the implications of restricting access to <Col N="179" /> bail?  Would prisons be emptied again to cater for those who may or may not be guilty?  We must look at this problem. Given the pressure on prison space &mdash; an issue with which we are all familiar &mdash; we must be sure any changes in bail laws do not lead to the more frequent early release of offenders.  As politicians representing taxpayers, we should be conscious of the cost of keeping people in custody &mdash; approximately £600 per week. That is a lot of money to extract from the PAYE sector in particular, which carries the heaviest tax burden.</P>
      <P>As well as reviewing our approach to bail, we must look at the long delays between the initial charging of offenders and their subsequent trial.  In some cases this may take up to two years or more. That is unsatisfactory, although this process is not as long here as in other countries.  In France, for example, there is a long delay between the time of arrest and incarceration and when one appears before the Judiciary.  However, it is unacceptable for the victim or the perpetrator of the crime to wait two years or more. The X case happened some time ago &mdash; I did not check the record to see how long &mdash; but only recently came before the courts.</P>
      <P>Measures must be taken to reduce long delays.  Additional judges should be appointed.  This would help break the cycle.  Extra resources should be allocated to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the criminal legal aid system.  Additional courtrooms should also be built.  The delay between charging a person and their trial should be reduced to a number of months.</P>
      <P>Steps should be taken to stop offenders using procedural tactics to secure delays. It is sad that the more hardened, successful and professional the criminal the better the legal advice he has access to. The cycle where the criminal uses the best brains in the business to use procedures to delay their appearance in court must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency a young man was knifed to death.  We must do something for those who have been mugged, physically <Col N="180" /> assaulted or whose homes have been broken into.  Although arrests are made and people appear in court, they are back on the streets &mdash; particularly in working class areas &mdash; often taunting their victims. The victim fails to understand what is happening in the judicial system when someone who has committed a major crime, including murder, manslaughter, a break-in or an assault, is back on the streets so quickly.  This is demoralising for victims.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides for the imposition of successive sentencing for offences committed while on bail and for stiff penalties for the person who fails to turn up for trial when on bail.  These powers are rarely used.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us why certain provisions in the legislation are not being imposed.  The area of bail needs to be looked at and the measures in this Bill are worthy of careful consideration.  It is wrong to consider the right to bail as the solution to our crime problems.  Other countries which have more restrictive laws on bail, have more serious crime problems than this country.</P>
    <P>Apart from unemployment, there is little doubt that the biggest social problems in urban areas are crime and vandalism which subject communities to intolerable terror.  That is the reason we support this Bill.  As the Minister knows, this is a common problem in many areas, particularly in Dublin.  Statistics show that almost half of all reported crimes occur in Dublin where less than 30 per cent of the population live.  It is now more common for people not to report crime, particularly muggings, handbag snatches and car break-ins.  Because people do not bother to report such crimes, the crime levels are substantially higher than the official statistics show.</P>
    <P>The Garda's response is terrible at times.  Perhaps some gardaí should do a PR course.  This is not a direct attack on the Garda, but if a house is broken into, it seems to take an eternity for the fingerprint detectives to arrive.  People often feel that a serious effort is not being made to chase the criminal responsible for breaking into their homes.  There is a <Col N="181" /> lack of feedback from the Garda about the progress being made.  This matter should be addressed, people should be reassured that the Garda are pursuing the criminals.  For example, my daughter's bicycle was stolen outside a shopping centre and she reported it to the Garda Síochána.  She was told the bicycle would be on the boat to England in a couple of days.  This is a negative attitude.  If the Garda is there to catch criminals, it should try to catch them instead of dismissing the crime as one which cannot be solved.</P>
    <P>The level of reported crime in the Dublin metropolitan area is seven times higher than in some rural Garda divisions. However, what is of greater concern is the poor level of detection in the capital.  This is disturbing.  The detection rate in three of the four Garda divisions is less than 30 per cent compared to more than 50 per cent in some rural areas. Crime pays because 70 per cent of crimes go undetected.  That is an incredible indictment of the present system.  This means that if one lives in Dublin one is more likely to be a victim of crime and the criminal is less likely to be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The small minority involved in crime are making life a misery for the majority of honest law abiding citizens.  The muggers and assailants have made the simple pleasure of a walk through the city centre at night a thing of the past for all but the bravest.  People will not go into certain areas of the city now.  For example, glue sniffing, drug abuse and vandalism can now be seen in our public parks.  Many public parks have removed the amenities and facilities for children because of vandalism in the children's play centres.</P>
    <P>The sense of community in many working class areas is being eroded as families become prisoners in their homes due to the activities of teenage gangs.  Everyone knows, particularly politicians who knock on doors looking for votes or who try to communicate with the electorate outside election times, that once dusk falls it is difficult to get a response to a knock on a door.  Locks, grills and burglar alarms are now a common sight; at one <Col N="182" /> time it was the key in the door.  I grew up in Harold's Cross where we lived in great poverty.  However, there were few robberies. Not only was the key left in the door but the door was left open and neighbours could walk in.  We exchanged milk, sugar and other necessities and if the door had to be shut, everyone knew the key could be got by putting a hand through the letterbox because the key was on a string.  It is sad that doors are now fitted with Chubb locks, emergency lighting and burglar alarms.  That is how Irish society has developed.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the difficulties for the elderly, particularly in Dublin city. Elderly people are living in fear because they are vulnerable to attack by muggers and during break-ins.  Anyone who has an elderly relative will know it only takes one mugging or one break-in to destroy their quality of life.  I represent a constituency which has a large number of elderly people; it probably has the largest concentration of senior citizen accommodation. The houses in Crumlin, Walkinstown and Drimnagh were built in the 1940s and many elderly people still live there.  It is sad to see people living out their last days in fear of leaving their homes or of opening the door to whoever may knock.  This situation cannot be allowed to continue.  The right to live in peace, free from the threat of attack, should be a basic right of everyone in society yet, it is one which many people do not enjoy.</P>
    <P>There is no single solution to crime. Nobody, least of all the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left or Fianna Fáil, has a magic wand.  There is no instant or quick solution to this problem. Crime has its origins in economic, social and environmental conditions.  It is no coincidence that the areas with the highest levels of crime are also those with the highest levels of poverty, the lowest levels of employment and the poorest housing and environmental conditions. The unfair distribution of income and work and the resources which are still a feature of Irish society must be tackled if a long term solution to crime is to be found.  It is unacceptable to say to an old <Col N="183" /> age pensioner who is being terrorised nightly that they must wait until the politicians solve the unemployment problem in order to be free from the scourge of crime.  These people cannot wait.  They require the Government of the day to put the resources into developing the type of society which would reduce the crime statistics.</P>
    <P>Any theories about solving the crime problem require the dual approach of tackling the social and economic conditions, which contribute to crime, and improving policing methods and judicial procedures to give immediate relief to those under threat.  There is a need for a substantial increase in the number of gardaí on the ground in the areas worst affected.  Prison sentences must not only offer an opportunity for rehabilitation, but they must be a deterrent to crime.  It is not good enough to release juvenile offenders because there are no suitable places of detention.  While early release, in some cases, is a worthwhile element in the rehabilitation process, releasing offenders who have served only a small part of their sentence to make way for other offenders who may need to be released to make way for more offenders, makes a joke of the judicial system.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme has been an outstanding and successful Garda initiative in recent years.  It seeks to identify first time offenders and, rather than subject them to court and a possible prison sentence, it deals with them through formal caution and supervision. Those of us who are in contact with youth leaders, youth clubs and community activists, indeed, everyone who is involved with young, vulnerable people involved in crime regard it as an outstanding success. Yet, sadly, it is seriously underfunded and underresourced.  More than 45 per cent of all those convicted of crime during 1992 were under 21 years of age, yet less than 1 per cent of Garda personnel are operating as juvenile liaison officers and the Minister should look at that.</P>
    <P>Above all, the battle against crime requires the fullest possible co-operation <Col N="184" /> between the public and the Garda.  The extent of co-operation at present varies from area to area and can often depend on the attitude of senior officers in particular districts.  There is a need for more formal structures to facilitate the co-operation needed to counter current levels of crime.  I would like to see the establishment of local liaison committees made up of the Garda Síochána, local public representatives and nominees of community, resident and youth organisations. The committee would not have any say in the day to day running of the Garda but would be a source of advice and a forum for consultation between the police and the public.</P>
    <P>I would record my deep appreciation to the Garda Commissioner.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I proposed the establishment of a task force for a particularly problematic inner city community.  I will not mention its exact location.  After years of political experience and lobbying by residents for more police and better estate management by Dublin Corporation and lobbying for better services for drug abusers and addicts, I brought about a task force for this part of the south inner city of Dublin. It comprises members of Dublin Corporation's community development section, which has a key role to play, and its housing administration section.  The task force also comprises the local director of community care for the Eastern Health Board and the residents' association of the area, it has permanent representation from the Garda drug squad and the local Garda based in Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>The beauty of this task force is that everybody plays a key task role in addressing in particular, the problems of drug abuse, the bad environment and the way in which the social norms were breaking down, and in trying to rebuild a community base.  I wish to record my appreciation to the Garda Commissioner, who releases to the task force each month the services of the drug squad and the local Garda in Kilmainham.  I want to thank the city manager, who releases two and often three of his personnel for the <Col N="185" /> monthly meetings.  I also want to thank the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, who also releases personnel who have busy schedules and could be otherwise occupied.  They put their time and effort into our collective effort to try to resolve a particular problem in a part of the city.</P>
    <P>I was at one of the task force meetings today and the lack of detoxification places and satellite clinics, the lack of access to methadone substitution for heroin and hard drugs and the lack of rehabilitation programmes to cover those drug abusers who wish to be rehabilitated is an outrage.  Due to the lack of resources from the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice hundreds of people in urban Dublin each week are being mugged, have handbags snatched and are physically injured in attacks, hospitalised and have their money and goods stolen. Some of these people will, sadly, die; elderly people are particularly vulnerable. Once they have been mugged or broken into the quality of their lives is destroyed.</P>
    <P>I am so critical of the Government for the lack of detoxification places, satellite clinics, methadone substitution and rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts because there are about 5,000 to 7,000 drug abusers in this city.  Each drug abuser who is addicted robs a minimum of £40 per day for his or her fix.  Many drug abusers rob three times that amount, £120 per day, because they need three fixes to keep their high.  Multiplying the 5,000 to 7,000 drug abusers by the £40 to £120 for their fixes shows clearly that hundreds of thousands of pounds, possibly millions over the years, is stolen in handbag snatches and break-ins.  In many cases these drug abusers are on long waiting lists as they cannot get onto programmes.  A drug abuser who wants to kick the habit cannot get into the miserable ten beds in Beaumont Hospital for detoxification &mdash; there is a huge waiting list.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this Bill and accept that the crime levels in Dublin could be cut by bringing the proper services into being to facilitate the drug <Col N="186" /> abuser who wants to kick the habit.  By providing the services &mdash; the methadone substitution, the satellite clinics and the detoxification units &mdash; the crime levels in Dublin could be cut overnight.  Would the Minister address the issue as to why we are unnecessarily penalising people whose lives will be ruined tonight by a drug addict who robs or mugs them, a drug addict who is one of the hundreds turned away from programes due to a lack of places?  These addicts are pressurised by their families and their communities to kick their habit.  They go to various satellite clinics and hospitals for detoxification.  They try all of the agencies from the Eastern Health Board to the Department of Health and they are turned away.  The Minister has a lot to answer for in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell is to be congratulated for framing so comprehensive a Bill.  It will be of assistance to the Minister in devising future legislation and the Minister for Justice has already indicated that this will be her approach in considering her legislation on foot of what is incorporated in the Bill under discussion.</P>
      <P>We will have to grasp the nettle of the issue of the right to bail.  The difficulty originated with a Supreme Court judgment, which is still law, that there is an absolute or basic constitutional right to bail residing in an accused person. No amount of thinking in regard to the amount of bail required or no amount of mechanical devices in legislation can get over the fundamental proposition of the Supreme Court judgment under the direction of the late Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh as Chief Justice.  It has proved to be the wrong decision.  A constitutional amendment would be required to rectify it.  That is the only way we can approach the problem at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A constitutional amendment would entail that the matter should be within the discretion of the courts.  The courts are there as a fundamental institution of our Constitution, embodying the separation of powers.  It was the law, until the Supreme Court decision of the late <Col N="187" /> Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh, that bail was at the discretion of the courts.  It should depend on the merits of each case coming before the courts.  A Supreme Court decision may interpret our Constitution as giving an absolute entitlement to bail to the individual in this case, but I see nothing contrary to basic Common Law and constitutional independence, as far as the individual is concerned, to make that right a matter for discretion for independent courts.  It operated in this way before the Ó Dálaigh decision.  The Constitution should be amended to bring us back to this position.</P>
    <P>There is nothing negative as far as individual rights are concerned in this case. It rightly restores the discretion to the judge hearing the case.  The judge, as part of an independent institutional framework of courts, can then decide on the merits of the case if it is not in the interest of the administration of law and justice to grant bail.  That is a perfectly legitimate constitutional right.  The weakness of the Ó Dálaigh decision is that it automatically restrains the courts to give bail for such cases, irrespective of their merits.  No matter what is said with regard to what is legitimately put in as evidence by the State as to the likely behaviour of the defendant concerned as to the payment of bail, the judge must ignore it. The Ó Dálaigh decision says there is an absolute right to bail residing in such cases by either the applicant or his legal adviser.  That is a fundamentally wrong way of looking at the Constitution.  This can only be rectified by a referendum, which would restore that balance to the Judiciary.  No amount of tinkering with legislation will rectify it.</P>
    <P>This problem has been examined for a number of years since that decision was made.  Various ways were suggested; there are even some in Deputy McDowell's legislation.  The Minister is now asking the Law Reform Commission to come forward with its recommendations and I await them with great interest. After having looked at and talked about this matter, I am certain that no amount of tinkering can get over that fundamental <Col N="188" /> difficulty.  If one tinkers with it through legislation, one will run into another constitutional boghole.  For instance, if one starts to make any differentation with regard to financial aspects, the judge may have the discretion to impose a higher financial bail level.  That can be deemed to be unconstitutional as well.  One is then differentiating between those who can and cannot afford to pay bail.  The only way to deal with this matter is to restore the judicial discretion in the way it existed before the Ó Dálaigh Supreme Court decision.  We can easily devise a constitutional amendment to meet that requirement.  It should be done because everyone in this House knows the current situation is ludicrous and is being grossly abused.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to what is proposed in section 54 of the Bill, which is in connection with the preliminary examination. I, as Minister for Justice, introduced the Criminal Procedural Act, 1967, which largely removed the preliminary taking of depositions.  Until then, taking of depositions in every indictable case before the accused went for trial was an automatic procedure. This, of course, caused enormous delays. A book of evidence is now proposed but the defence have the right to a deposition procedure if it so wishes.  It is not availed of to a great extent, but it is an anomaly that should be removed.</P>
    <P>There is much merit in having preliminary proceedings taken by the court where the trial will take place.  The case should be listed directly before the trial judge, who can have a preliminary hearing by his registrar, a court officer under his direction or by the judge himself to deal with these preliminary matters in the presence of both the defence and prosecution legal advisers.  All of these preliminary matters can then be disposed of before the trial proper.  The issues set down for trial are then stripped of any technical matters that can cause difficulties, delays, adjournments or unmeritoriously let the defendent go free through flaws in the indictment during trials.</P>
    <P>These areas can be teased out in a <Col N="189" /> preliminary process in the court where the indictable proceedings will take place and not in another District Court which would allow for further misunderstandings. That court should have, as a matter of automatic procedure, the right to refer the case to a registrar for a preliminary hearing in the presence of the legal advisers.  These matters could then be removed allowing specific issues to be set down for the trial by the court. That is the spirit behind Deputy McDowell's proposal in section 54 and I agree with him.  The Minister will have many considerations to take into account, but that proposal should be seriously examined.  It would substantially expedite court hearings.</P>
    <P>The right to silence should also be removed.  It is a relic of an era that is no longer relevant.  We want to see courts functioning effectively.  While respecting basic freedom and the essential principle that a case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, the rights of the accused would not be breached by deleting the right to silence.  If a proper preliminary examination by a court officer of the relevant court takes place in the manner described and the issues are placed in the proper way before a judge and jury, the deletion of the right to silence would not take from the accused in the administration of justice in the trial in an equitable, fair and just manner.  The reverse may even be the case.  The right has been grossly abused in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>The administration of justice is an evenhanded procedure.  It is not only for the benefit of the defence.  It also demands that society be protected.  If somebody is accused of an offence against society of sufficient seriousness to merit an indictable charge, society is entitled to a say in the matter.  In this respect, the right to silence is fundamentally flawed in that it does not acknowledge the right of society as being equal to the right of the individual regarding a criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>If a criminal prosecution is properly prepared by the Garda Síochána, properly considered in a preliminary manner by the court trial, properly conducted by <Col N="190" /> the judge at the court of trial with his jury and properly undertaken in an evidential way, then <i>fiat iustitiae,</i> it is done in that way.  It is justice, and the additional claim that a right to silence is a basic strength in the system of justice is wrong.  It is founded on the wrong premise that every available avenue must exist to enable a person to escape who is guilty of an offence against society.</P>
    <P>In this respect there are two legal concepts of justice under consideration &mdash; the right of society to punish for wrongdoing and the right of the individual within that framework to get a fair trial. The right of silence tilts the matter against society and towards the individual and it is not justified if the trial is conducted in a proper manner between a properly convened judge and jury.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the Minister will, as promised, introduce a comprehensive Bill at a later stage, because the proper administration of justice at every level is the central problem in our society at present.  By every level is meant the Garda and the courts level, including civil and criminal courts level.  There must be respect for the law in all its aspects, including its enforcement and administration. This entails reasonably speedy justice, which is seen to be done in a competent and effective manner, without any undue delay.  To ensure this, more judges will be required at certain levels, both on the civil and criminal side.  It also requires that there be fewer delays in bringing matters forward for trial, whether it be civil or criminal and that once cases have acquired a certain process, fewer adjournments.</P>
    <P>Matters such as these bring the law into considerable disrepute.  With the law in disrepute, a society has the worst of all possible worlds, because if there is no confidence in the administration of justice, both at the detection enforcement level and at the courts and judicial level, the heart and root of civilised society is endangered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it enables a debate of this kind to take place.  I appreciate that the Minister is considering the matter in detail, as is the <Col N="191" /> Law Reform Commission, which has seized on various aspects of these reforms which are so necessary.  It is not a matter which can be side tracked.</P>
    <P>I speak in the House primarily on matters of economics and foreign affairs, but the matter under consideration by the House this evening is more fundamental because it goes to the root of society and to the reason why society is organised: in order to protect our lives and positions and to protect itself.  Unless that is right, nothing else can be right, and it is as fundamental and as real as that.</P>

      <P>I compliment the presenter's of the Bill, Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy O'Donnell, for the good work they have undertaken.  It is a comprehensive Bill, covering a wide range of areas, and it largely focuses on the question of liberty, in terms of bail, the right to silence, pardons, remissions, temporary release, commutation, punishment and so on.  The Bill also deals with criminal procedure and evidence, with accessory areas such as mental illness and infanticide.</P>
      <P>On the issue of bail, a constitutional decision was taken, and a determination was made by the late Chief Justice, Cearbhaill Ó Dálaigh, that people could only be deprived of their liberty on two grounds, that they would interfere with witnesses or that they would not stand trial.  Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell have suggested a novel way of getting around this constitutional impediment, which is not to propose a constitutional referendum on an amendment to the Constitution, but to include another condition which would be imposed on the person granted bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the only requirement on the person granted bail is that he or she turn <Col N="192" /> up for trial, failure to do entailing estreatment of the bail.  However, there is no requirement that the person granted bail be of good behaviour and not commit any other offence for the duration of the bail.  It is therefore a reasonable proposal that this would be a condition under which bail could be estreated and that recognisance be provided.</P>
    <P>The use of a constitutional amendment should not be regarded as a first option when addressing this matter, rather this suggested option should be considered. Given its pragmatic nature, it would have a good chance of success.  In this respect Ireland probably has the lowest proportion of its prison population on remand.  Part of the reason for Cearbhaill Ó Dálaigh's decision regarding bail, and the conditions imposed on the granting of bail, was the considerable length of time people were spending in prison awaiting trial.  In this respect people were imprisoned for three, six, nine, 12 and perhaps 18 months awaiting trial.</P>
    <P>This continues to be the situation in many European countries, such as France, where at least one quarter to one third of the prison population at any given time are prisoners who are not convicted of any offence but simply awaiting trial in the courts.  In this respect I am more in favour of the approach taken by Deputy McDowell, to impose the condition of good behaviour in addition to that requiring the accused to attend trial, rather than taking the option of a constitutional amendment favoured by Deputy Lenihan.</P>
    <P>On the question of remission, I applaud the proposals made regarding obtaining some kind of registration of people who are released early from prison.  The powers exercised by the Minister for Justice regarding commutation of sentence, early and temporary release, are discretionary.  It is appropriate that this be placed on a formal basis, which is made public through the publication of annual reports and so on.</P>
    <P>In this respect the proportion of the sentence remitted requires consideration. This country is unique in that <Col N="193" /> only one quarter of a sentence is liable for remission &mdash; in the case of a female it is one-third.  Male and female offenders are not equal before the law.  We should come into line with European countries where the norm is one-third.  By so doing prison capacity would be increased by 8? per cent and the revolving door syndrome would be eliminated because it is based on discretionary decisions taken on the demands of the court at any given time.  It is the result of an accommodation crisis.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell might consider that if the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  In Northern Ireland there is a 50 per cent remission.  If a person is transferred to Portlaoise Prison and given certain duties to perform it is 50 per cent also.  I would propose one-third.</P>
    <P>I agree with the granting of free pardon.  If the President grants a free pardon it should be deemed that no offence was committed.  That should be specified rather than have what happened in the case of Nicky Kelly.</P>
    <P>There is a novel proposal in the Bill about how to get around the question of a person not incriminating himself &mdash; instead of being interrogated by police the person would be questioned by a judge.  I do not know if we can go down that road but it is worth examining.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the principles and sentiments contained in it are taken on board by the Minister and that legislation relating to many of them will emerge from the Department of Justice.</P>

The lay person probably sees the law quite differently to a person involved in its administration.  The Minister has brought forward a substantial amount of legislation in regard to drugs, laundering of money arising from drug dealing, the public order aspect of regulations and the road traffic offences which the Minister for the Environment dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a slim balance between what <Col N="194" /> is needed to control public order and our rights as citizens.  If we lean too far forward in either direction we could disrupt the intentions behind most of the changes proposed in the criminal justice system.  On the question of bail, if we have a constitutional referendum and bail is curtailed I am certain that a substantial number of innocent people will find themselves in custody and it may be difficult to repair the damage caused.  It is very hard to turn the clock back and say sorry to someone as they walk out the door.  It would be more acceptable to penalise those who do not conform with the freedoms given to them under the Constitution.  The thinking is that you may as well commit as much crime as possible while on bail because as you are to be sentenced for one offence the others will run concurrently.  The courts should be empowered to deal with a person on bail in a more severe manner and impose consecutive sentences.  I support the direction the Bill takes in that regard.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is an important issue.  It is easy to say that the system has gone too far in favour of the accused and the victim is the person who suffers.  The right to silence is probably outdated but we must be very careful if we change it. In the case of young offenders it may be preferable to maintain the right to silence instead of them making statements which could be construed as having been made under pressure from parents, peers and so on.  They may give the right answer to a question in order to extradite themselves from the situation.  We have come a long way from the time the right to silence was introduced and we should move towards changing it.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of diminished responsibility and the mentally ill, there is a case to be made for people who are high on drugs not being held responsible for many of the offences they commit.  I am not saying the should be given a special concession because they are on drugs but some consideration should be given to the state of their minds when horrendous crimes are committed.</P>
    <P>I agree with temporary release because one of the basic principles of our criminal <Col N="195" /> justice system is to rehabilitate prisoners. What is a pardon?  Does it completely exonerate one from the crime one is supposed to have committed?  I would compare it to annulling a marriage &mdash; in the case of annulment, no marriage existed and if a pardon is given, no crime existed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy for bringing the Bill before the House. The notion that rural Ireland is free from crime is far from true.  There is a great deal of crime in rural Ireland and much of it goes unreported.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Lenihan's contribution in the course of which he referred to the Ó Dalaigh decision in 1966.  We have moved on since then and if the law does not realise that then it has been asleep.  We have not kept up with the times and protected the people.  Hard core criminals travel the country at will.  They may be resident in Dublin and commit crimes in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere.  Obviously people from the locality, spotters, tell them which houses are vacant.  There is something wrong when people no longer feel safe in their homes.</P>
      <P>Criminals continue to commit crime because they know they will not be dealt with properly under the law and sufficient places are not available for them in jail. The also know that people are afraid to report crime or to identify them because they will be back on the street within a week.  Many old people in rural Ireland who have been robbed of their savings do not report these crimes because they are afraid they will lose their social welfare entitlements if the Department of Social Welfare finds out they had this money.  I do not know if criminals are aware which people keep their savings at home but numerous houses have been ransacked and money taken; they are certainly not driving from Dublin to Cavan, Monaghan and other rural areas for nothing.  I recently heard a story about a person on social welfare who lives not 100 miles from me who had £18,000 in cash with which to buy a car.  One would have to ask where he got this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> I wish to refer to the laws relating to bail, the central point of Deputy McDowell's Bill.  I listened with interest to the points made by Deputy Lenihan on this issue.  Many criminals on bail adopt the attitude that one might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and go on a rampage of crime.  If they are sentenced to five years imprisonment they will be released after three years on the grounds of good behaviour.  Why should they be rewarded for good behaviour?  The reason they are released has more to do with cost than good behaviour?  Someone said it costs approximately £600 per week to keep a criminal in jail.  The State says it is worried about the cost to the taxpayer but no consideration is given to the victims of crime.  Regardless of the cost, there can be no excuse for releasing on the grounds of good behaviour people who behave in a cruel and abusive way. Crimes of this nature were not prevalent some 28 years ago when Ó Dalaigh addressed the issue of bail in the Supreme Court.  These criminals, for whom I have no sympathy, must serve their full sentence and judges should show no leniency towards them.</P>
    <P>We have a core of hardened criminals and more and more young unemployed people are being brought into the system. They know they can make a few pounds from stealing a bicycle or motorcycle, but if there were no receivers there would be little point in stealing these goods.  I have great sympathy for these young offenders, some of whose parents have visited me.  Until recently this type of crime did not happen in my constituency but it is now widespread throughout the country.  These young offenders who are in jail with hardened criminals are told that if they learn the trade they can do even better and will have a 70 per cent chance of getting away with their crimes. They believe it is well worth the risk if they can make a large amount of money.</P>
    <P>Another reason given for the early release of prisoners is a lack of space &mdash; jails are clogged up and there is not adequate space for prisoners.  The public do not accept this excuse from the Department of Justice.  There is no <Col N="197" /> reason proper provision cannot be made so that all prisoners serve their full sentences and prisoners are properly segregated. We do not have a very large jail population and it should be possible to segregate young offenders from hardened criminals, some of whom are household names and roam the country at will.  Proper facilities should be provided to advise these young offenders and to prevent them mixing with hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>Many people are amazed that every week the person on remand at present charged with committing a terrible crime is taken from jail to court, at enormous cost, merely for a judge to say that he is to be held on remand for a further period. People congregate at the court to which he will be brought to boo him as they are so angry with him.  Why is it necessary to bring him to court every week?  When a person has been charged with a serious crime it is a matter for the Department of Justice to bring him to court as soon as possible.  I have no doubt that every effort is made to bring these criminals to court at the earliest opportunity but I do not understand the reason they have to be brought to court on a weekly basis at enormous cost merely for a judge to say that they are to be held on remand for a further week.  This is nonsense.  These people should be left in jail with those serious crimes hanging over them, so to speak.</P>
    <P>When gardaí arrest someone and charge them with a crime they do not do so lightly.  One is innocent until proven guilty but if it is a serious crime a judge should have sufficient cop-on &mdash; many of them do not &mdash; to put the criminal away and ensure he is remanded in jail until the court case.  It is not right that a court case can be delayed for two years as sometimes a case cannot be proven and the person will have to be compensated for wrongful internment.</P>
    <P>In the case of people who have been remanded in jail, their sentences start from the time they are remanded.  This is nonsense, and the sentence should start from the day the judge pronounces sentence. If this were done criminals would <Col N="198" /> soon realise that we are serious about applying the law.  There was a report on television earlier this evening about a young lad who got four lashes of a whip for damaging people's property.  He was very quiet and I have no doubt he will not commit a similar crime.  The message got through to him.  We need to get a similar message across to criminals.</P>
    <P>People should not have to live in fear in their homes.  Recently when I was canvassing with my colleague in Mayo West I found that many people were afraid to open their doors after 9 p.m.  Up to the time the Supreme Court decision was taken 28 years ago all one had to do was lift the latch and walk into a house but if one calls to a house now after 5 o'clock in the evening one discovers the safety locks are in place.  Who is to blame for that?  In my view it is the people who make the regulations and enforce the law.  While I have every confidence in the Garda, a great force, their numbers are insufficient.  It is a great source of comfort to any community to have a garda living in their midst or gardaí on the beat, which we seldom see because of a shortage of numbers.  In this respect a particular problem is encountered in Border areas since gardaí must devote so much of their time to maintaining security and have insufficient personnel to patrol the streets where their presence would make people think twice before committing a crime.</P>
    <P>I agree that the setting of bail of £100 or £150 is totally insufficient.  I agree that if the person on bail commits a crime, that amount should be forfeited because the sums about which Deputy Michael McDowell spoke are not sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a proposal to increase it to £10,000 or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House about a man who had £18,000 in a bag with which to purchase a car and he is the type of person with whom we must deal.  The provisions of this Bill constitute a step in the right direction.  Bail should be set at a minimum of £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I take Deputy Lenihan's point that a person may not be able to afford <Col N="199" /> bail but were they behaving themselves they would not be seeking bail.  Ninety five per cent of our people are law-abiding and never see the inside of a jail or a courthouse.  However, the law appears to bend over backwards to protect people who commit crimes and that is the view of most victims of crime, that apprehending the criminal is not worth the trouble.  A friend who has been robbed, burgled or mugged who went to the trouble of reporting such crimes, was questioned at length may say he or she was made feel they were imagining the incident.  While such cases must be properly investigated, there is no doubt that the criminal plays on the fact that people do not report many such crimes and their perpetrators get away scot free.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about large numbers of hardened criminals but their influence is spreading.  I am referring to those criminals who can be named, who have others working for them in various areas. I understand from a good friend, a member of the Garda Síochána, that such people are called &ldquo;spotters&rdquo;.  They tell the criminals what is happening locally and when they move in, commit the crime they get a percentage of the proceeds. If those people were removed from the scene, if they got ten years imprisonment for some of their activities it would be easier to deal with them on the expiry of their term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>If bail is to be granted, the figure must be substantial.  The person going bail must be asked where they got the money, whether he or she is a person of substance or is, for example, on social welfare and can pull £1,000 out of a bag and offer it as bail.  I do not think that is sufficient. Bail must be forfeited if there is a breach of the conditions and in such cases those going bail will be forced to think twice. The amounts must be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I was annoyed at several Members speaking about the cost of maintaining our prisons and keeping prisoners in them.  That should not be advanced as a reason for not taking such people off our streets.  I understood that a new prison was to be built but, apparently, that proposal <Col N="200" /> has been put on the back burner because of the cost involved.  It would appear that the rights of ordinary citizens are less important than the cost of constructing a prison to protect them.  That is not acceptable.  The Minister has a duty to protect our people.  Indeed, no cost should be of consequence in protecting our people from criminals because what we now witness can spiral into even more serious crime.  Brutal murders were committed recently, something that was very rare here even ten years ago.  I remember, when growing up, reading of the murder of a farmer returning home from playing cards with his neighbours in County Kerry.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>Irish Press</i> at that time gave banner headlines to the murder for a week.  The perpetrator of that crime eventually was apprehended.  Now such terrible crimes get little more than two lines in any newspaper; that is how complacent people have become.  It is up to us to address that problem and ensure that our people can walk our roads without fear.</P>
    <P>My last point will demonstrate that fear is the real problem, with such criminals building on the fear in people's minds. Last week a man telephoned &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to report that after he had stopped on a road to make directional inquiries a mother and daughter who were walking on that road took off as they were afraid he was stopping to molest them.  He took the trouble to telephone that radio programme to give his identity, the registration number of his car, the locality in which he was travelling, emphasising that he had stopped merely to inquire the direction in which he was travelling because he knew that mother and daughter were afraid that he was endeavouring to molest them or pull them into his car.  It is a sad turn of events here, that people can no longer stop on a road to inquire directions without people being in fear of being molested.  As legislators we will have failed if we allow such fear to develop generally.</P>
    <P>Reference to the cost of keeping criminals locked up annoyed me enormously. Particularly when the view was expressed that it was more than the State <Col N="201" /> could bear.  It is more than the State can afford not to lock them up.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate we had been dealing with amendment No. 6 which had been moved by Deputy Durkan and, grouped with it, amendments Nos. 9, 12, 14 and 16.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 13, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a good time for the Minister to include this phrase with a view to eliminating any doubt that might exist.  While in any event the Minister would have discretion to apply such provision at any time, it would be in the interests, if not of public safety, certainly of clarity and transparency that it be included in the relevant sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said correctly, it is my intention that every regulation that will flow from this Bill will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary because such a provision has been included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 in my name goes a little further than the Minister intends.  There are so many let out clauses for the Minister in this Bill that it raises a question mark over whether its provisions will be maintained. Obviously one trusts the present Minister to deal fairly with the patients, clients, consumers or whatever he wants to call them, but the Bill will continue after this Minister has moved on, presumably to higher things.  We need to be careful not to leave such an open-ended arrangement without accountability which could <Col N="202" /> create major problems in the future.  This is what the Minister is in danger of doing. My amendment proposes that any regulations brought into being &mdash; I imagine there will be major regulations as time goes on &mdash; should be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas but should not come into effect until such time as a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  This does not have to leave the matter open to debate but it does mean that it has to be on the record and that it must be approved by the House so that if there is a contentious issue it is possible for Members to deal with it within the normal framework of the business of the House.</P>
      <P>Not long ago I raised an objection to proposals in the Medical Practitioners Bill to change the make-up of the Medical Council.  Had such an objection not been put, it would have slipped through.  There was a danger, even though I did object, that it could still have been proceeded with except that the Minister withdrew it, and rightly so.  The same type of situation could arise again where vigilance on the part of Deputies, from whatever side of the House, would ensure good practice.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would not cause major headaches.  I do not think any of us has ever caused the Minister major headaches.  We have been extremely co-operative at all times.  I ask the Minister to be aware that everybody is fallible.  An unfortunate situation could have arisen except for the fact that it was possible to be alerted to it.  In relation to regulations I ask that at least that kind of formality be gone through so that we all have a chance to participate and ensure that this Bill works well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken to Deputy Durkan's amendment and I will speak specifically now to Deputy McManus's amendment No. 9.  On virtually all legislation that goes through, there is a debate on the type of regulations and the procedure for dealing with regulations that flow from legislation.  The normal procedure proposed in this legislation is that regulations be laid before the House and <Col N="203" /> become operational unless there is an annulling motion within the statutory period.  Because there will be detailed regulations it would be impractical if I were required to come formally before the House for a positive determination on every regulation, some of which will be technical and minor.  Some may need to be introduced because of a changing market situation when the House is not in session.  I would prefer to stick with the normal procedure which is that of placing the regulations before each House of the Oireachtas and allowing them to come into effect unless an annulling order is passed by either House within 21 days.  This is the normal procedure and it is particularly apt and suitable for this legislation because the number of regulations will be so great that it would be impractical and difficult and would be obstructive of the aims of the Bill, which is supported by all sides of the House, if a positive resolution was required for every regulation.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Durkan in which he seeks to insert the words &ldquo;and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, that is already envisaged.  The phrase &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo;, in amendment No. 16, is not necessary as &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister. That is already incorporated in section 2, page 5, line 13.  The Deputy's other amendments, Nos. 12 and 14, seek to insert the words &ldquo;by the Minister by regulation and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Section 3 already provides for the Minister to make regulations which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and will follow the normal route, that is, they will become effective unless an annulling order has been passed.</P>
      <P>In response to the point raised by Deputy Browne, &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister. Therefore Deputy Durkan's amendment No. 16 is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise we have a time constraint and I will try to act within it. <Col N="204" /> The Minister has pointed out that the regulations may be made during the recess, perhaps during the second or third day of the summer recess.  The chances of an annulling motion appearing before the House within a reasonable period are slim.  In that case there is some merit in the amendments.  The common theme running through all the amendments is the same.  I recognise that tradition would have us do one thing but I am not sure we should not depart from tradition now and again.  Perhaps now is the time to do it and the present Minister may be the person to do it.  One has not always been pleased in the past about regulations made and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas because they may have been made at a time when it was impossible to introduce a counter resolution.  The possibility of an amending resolution coming during the recess is slim. However, I will not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the Deputy's views.  I suppose it is not normal for somebody on this side of the House to express concern that so much power is given to Ministers to make regulations subsequent to legislation.  When I started my political career as a Member of the other House there was a committee on legislation, one of the functions of which was to monitor statutory instruments and all regulations.  It is a good thing to monitor regulations on a detailed basis and perhaps the committee system could be expanded to do such monitoring.  That would change the traditional practice.</P>
      <P>I wish to point to one section of the Bill which is germane to this discussion, that is the conferring of additional functions on the authority, assuming that the health insurance authority is established. I regard that as being of a different magnitude from the normal regulations to define the packages and so on of benefits available.  I have followed the path proposed by Deputy McManus in section 21 (3) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the <Col N="205" /> order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving of the draft is passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>Where amending legislation is necessary, it is right and proper that I would require the formal approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister will not adopt the approach recommended. I do not accept what he has said, that it would create major problems for him.  It would constitute an added protection whereby we would ensure that the legislation and the regulations that will follow are fair to everybody.  I know from experience that regulations made under other legislation have caused major problems because there was no opportunity to raise issues in the way proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw my amendment but under protest as I think it is a good one. The Minister is being too cautious.  I cannot see any difference between what he is proposing and what previous Ministers for Health proposed.  It is a pity that he is not taking the opportunity to be more accountable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These are technical amendments which have been introduced to ensure there is no ambiguity in relation to the application of the principles enshrined in subsections <Col N="207" /> (1) and (2) to the premia charged for children.  It was suggested that an insurer could, as the section was originally drafted, vary the premia charged for children within the zero to 50 per cent parameter on the basis of age, sex or health status.  This was not the interpretation taken by the Department when the section was drafted.  It has been decided to introduce these amendments to ensure there is no ambiguity in regard to the application of community rating to subsection (4).  The word &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; has been inserted in subsection (4) (a) to ensure it is clear that the insurer can reduce the premium for a child to zero per cent if they so wish.</P>
    <P>On the question of providing for a maximum charge of 50 per cent for children of insured persons, it became clear because of the way the section was originally drafted that it might have been possible for insurers not to apply the principle of community rating to children.

      <P>In page 8, subsection (3) (b), line 47, after &ldquo;condition&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as determined by reference to medical records&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands is a bit vague.  I am suggesting therefore that after the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; the words &ldquo;as determined by reference to medical records&rdquo; should be inserted.  I know from experience that in the case of life assurance problems can arise when a claim is made whereby the insurer disclaims liability on the basis that the insured person was aware of their illness or ailment.  The insurer may claim that the insured person did not disclose their full medical history, given the degree to which the illness has progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this may be applied differently in the case of health insurance the section is vague and I would like the <Col N="209" /> Minister to clarify the matter and, if he sees fit, to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of subsection (3) (b) is to ensure that insurers have some control over persons applying for membership who have a pre-existing condition and to whom waiting periods could be reasonably applied.  It is not necessary to accept the Deputy's amendment as decisions by insurers on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions could be based on information available to the insurer following a medical examination or disclosure of medical history by the person applying for membership.  For example, the person concerned could declare it on the application form and there may not be any medical evidence as such.  If the Deputy's amendment was accepted the insurance company would be debarred from accepting a clear statement of a pre-existing condition without medical evidence.  We are in agreement that where there is a pre-existing medical condition it would be reasonable to provide for a waiting period before full cover is applied.  I am informed that the best way to achieve this is to accept the form of words included in the subsection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This technical amendment is necessary to ensure that a person cannot be refused renewal of a health insurance contract on the technical grounds that the contract contains no right of renewal.  That sounds pedantic, but I am informed it is a belt and braces job as there is no specific <Col N="210" /> clause in the contract that states one has a right to renewal.  I want to ensure that people are not precluded from having that right.  This is particularly important for people over 65 years when seeking to renew their health insurance cover as such persons do not have the protection of the open enrolment provision incorporated in this Bill.</P>

One could prescribe something that might not be available.  As a member of a local authority and a health board one of the things for which I have contempt is people assuming power in areas over which they do not have it.  The words &ldquo;and available&rdquo; would strengthen the section.  The Minister will probably say he would not include something that was not available, but Ministers change from time to time and I am sure the Minister agrees that when he was on this side of the House he viewed matters differently and the same will apply when he is again on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I have given some consideration to the Deputy's amendment as it is eminently reasonable.  However, I am advised it would diminish the consumers' right because it would involve a further qualification before payment is made to an insurer.  For example, it could be argued that a contract would not apply <Col N="211" /> if there was ambiguity about the availability of a service.  We should not include a clause that would jeopardise the right of a consumer to avail of insurance for which he or she is contracting.  As the Deputy's amendment would involve a diminution of consumers' rights I ask him to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern, but it is logical that one would not prescribe a package of benefits that did not exist and in so doing mislead the public.  I am advised that the insertion of the Deputy's amendment would cause legal difficulties if an insurer wished to renege on his or her responsibilities. There would then be an onus on the insured to prove that the service contracted was available which might involve ancillary explanations such as the location of hospitals and so on.  I do not wish to diminish the right of consumers in this legislation.</P>

    <P>This relates to an earlier discussion.  I accept the Minister has the right to enlist the assistance of consultants, assistants <Col N="212" /> and so on.  I do not wish to digress into a debate on a Bill due to come before the House shortly, but the role of the person from whom the Minister may seek assistance is important.  As it is similar to the role of the Ombudsman the appointment should be referred to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  The person appointed will advise the Minister under a number of sections and, therefore, it is important that the Minister makes the concession I propose in my amendment. It is the prerogative of the Minister to accept amendments, but perhaps on this occasion he might accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to facilitate the Opposition in accepting an amendment to improve the legislation. The person in question will have an important advisory role, but not one that would require the importance attributed to a formal appointment by the Oireachtas.  There are few statutory appointments reserved to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Office of Ombudsman and Comptroller and Auditor General are two that come to mind.  I do not deem it appropriate for this advisory role to be exalted to a status requiring a formal vote of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 refers to the same person, namely, the assessor, who will assess minimum benefit and be involved in the determination of risk equalisation. It would be inappropriate for such person to be appointed by the Oireachtas. Amendment No. 34 is unnecessary as the subsection is purely technical and allows the transfer of functions from the Minister to the Authority when the latter is established.  The approval of the Oireachtas to such a transfer would be disproportionate to the issues involved.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to apologise to Members of the House for the short period they have had to study the Bill.  The Bill concluded drafting early last week, was immediately brought to Government and subsequently approved for publication. There is a certain immediacy so that the IDA and the Financial Services Industry can with confidence proceed to the market place, especially in the United States, with the aim of attracting further business to the International Financial Services Centre.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide the structure of an investment limited partnership as an investment vehicle for particular categories of investors.</P>
      <P>The taxation aspect has already been addressed in the 1994 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This technically complex 45 section Bill has been developed in consultation with the IFSC through its committee, chaired by Mr. Séamus Paircéir, and the proposed supervisory authority, the Central Bank, with my Department taking a pro-active role to ensure that the legislation is capable of meeting the needs of the expanding financial services industry while ensuring that an appropriate regulatory <Col N="215" /> structure is in place.  I believe that the introduction of this innovative measure will secure employment and investment for Ireland.  This legislation shows what can be done with a little imagination to generate investment which will create employment at practically no cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to respond to the competition in the market place where the availability of the required range of structures is essential.  If the desired legal structure is not available then a fund will not be located here.</P>
    <P>In drafting this Bill regard was had to: (1) the general requirements of the international financial services market; (2) US structural and fiscal requirements; (3) Irish structural requirements; (4) Irish regulatory requirements and (5) an appropriate taxation environment for the limited partnership structure.</P>
    <P>By way of background may I say that the collective investment industry in the IFSC was established in 1989 with the enactment of the UCITS regulations implementing EU Directives.  However, it was only with the enactment of the Unit Trust Act, 1990, and the Companies Act, 1990, that the IFSC first became a creditable international location for collective investment schemes.</P>
    <P>In the four years since then there has been good progress in the collective investment area.  Direct employment in the funds and custody sector now amounts to over 550.  Within the IFSC the collective investment industry is the largest single employer, with no one employer predominant.  The industry does not primarily rely on the existence of the 10 per cent tax rate and requires minimal use of double taxation treaties.</P>
    <P>There is US$14 billion in Irish domicile funds located here in over 160 funds and almost 400 sub-funds.  This provides Irish activity in relation to administration, fund accounting and custody.  There exists a further US$4 billion of funds, domiciled elsewhere but also under administration in the IFSC.  The growth in Irish domiciled funds in terms of value <Col N="216" /> under administration has amounted to a remarkable 143 per cent during 1993.</P>
    <P>Those intimately involved in the funds industry inform me that the absence of a particular structure has serious contrary effects: fund managers naturally wish to centralise their activities in a limited number of jurisdictions for reasons of efficiency and marketing cohesion.  The greater the range of centralised activities then the greater the job prospects. Dublin as a financial centre now features at the many seminars and conferences which are the natural corollary of a burgeoning collective investment industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland has many positive features which keep us to the fore in competing for the available business: first, a strong regulatory environment is provided by the Central Bank, which is an important comfort for the investors who are targeted by the fund managers established in the IFSC.  The taxation regime, which provides tax transparency for non-Irish resident unit holders and investors, is not dependent on the existence of the special tax relief for trading activities.  However, foremost in our favour is the legislation which underpins the collective funds industry, both in primary legislation dealing with structures and in the range of fiscal provisions which give clarity and certainty to the participants in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>To ensure the ongoing success of the IFSC we must have regard to the vital area of the legislative environment. Increasingly, the IFSC will have to be able to respond speedily to the needs of the industry in an increasingly competitive environment, involving the participation of all the major financial services centres.  The competition is intensified because of the growth in the volume of that business.</P>
    <P>The international promoters of collective investment schemes, especially major international banking and fund management groups, require a wide variety of collective investment legal structures to suit the regulatory, tax and marketing situations in all the countries in which they market.  Schemes must be capable of being marketed both to retail <Col N="217" /> and institutional investors, who often have different requirements worldwide.</P>
    <P>A number of existing and prospective IFSC participants have identified the need for a regulated, tax transparent limited partnership structure similar to that in use in other financial services but adapted to Irish needs.  This Bill will be used as another product on the menu of mutual funds structures to complement the collective investment schemes currently in existence.</P>
    <P>A desirable innovation in this Bill is that it has adapted, as required, other primary and secondary legislation and put it within one cover.  This, I venture to say, makes the Bill more understandable by non EU users and thus makes it attractive to lawyers.  In the North American funds market the primary users will be lawyers, unlike in Ireland or the United Kingdom which would have accountants involved.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes the introduction of a new category of limited partnership &mdash; the investment limited partnership, to which, specifically, the Bill will apply.  It is proposed that the 1890 Partnerships Act will remain in force and will govern investment limited partnership except to the extent specifically excluded by the Bill.  The 1907 Limited Partnership Act is being amended so that the problems which have been identified in relation to it have been removed, while the other, desirable provisions of the Act have been incorporated in the Bill.  The 1907 Act will remain in place for other forms of limited partnership.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most important the Bill proposes the introduction of a regulatory system which would provide for the regulation of investment limited partnerships by the Central Bank of Ireland along the lines of that which applies under the UCITS regulations, the Unit Trust Act, 1990, and Part XIII of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The specific problems which were identified in connection with the 1907 Limited Partnership Act and which have been addressed in the Bill are, for example, restriction on the number of partners set out in the Companies Act; doubt about <Col N="218" /> the precise extent of the liability of the limited partners in the event of a withdrawal of capital and the possibility that creditors could levy execution against limited partners for debts of the firm, notwithstanding the limit on their liability.</P>
    <P>To enable limited partners to realise their investment, express provision permitting withdrawal of capital by limited partners has been included, subject to certain conditions.  A limited partner will also be able to assign his or her interest with consent.  In line with the investment nature of the investment limited partnership, general partners have also been given significantly more control over the affairs of the partnership than would be the case with the existing form of limited partnership.</P>
    <P>The general partner also assumes a higher degree of responsibility to creditors and less emphasis has been placed on the capital of the partnership as a protection for creditors.  As an investment vehicle, the partnership is not expected to engage in the kind of high risk venture normally engaged in by a limited partner and would be subject to the various prudential limits imposed by the Central Bank as the designated regulator.</P>
    <P>Before commencing business the investment limited partnership will be required to apply for, and obtain, authorisation from the Central Bank.  The authorisation must be maintained throughout the life of the investment limited partnership.  The Central Bank is given very substantial powers to regulate and supervise investment limited partnerships, including powers to impose conditions as appropriate to particular circumstances.  The relevant provisions in the Bill generally follow those set out in Part XIII of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to investment companies with variable capital and it is envisaged that the regulatory regime would be very similar, ensuring that the new structure would dovetail neatly with the existing range of available investment vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides for the appointment of a custodian who will have <Col N="219" /> specific responsibility imposed on it by the Central Bank &mdash; analogous to the role of a trustee for unit trust schemes supervised under the Unit Trusts Act, 1990.  There will be an obligation to publish annual accounts.</P>
    <P>The industry has identified the primary business applications which this Bill can facilitate.  That relates to multinational profit sharing plans.  Large multinational corporations have provided these type of benefit plans to employees in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, depending on local country customs and regulations.  In an effort to consolidate streamlined costs associated with the maintenance of multiple benefit schemes, large corporations have been establishing benefit plans in which all global employees participate.  This Bill provides an appropriate legal framework in a well supervised, established, financial centre to ensure safety of employee assets.  This occurs because it affords fiscal transparency to the end beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The limited partnership structure is a well established and accepted form of investment in the United States.  The investment limited partnership, from a US perspective, is designed to be a vehicle by which multiple investors can pool their capital resources and avail of the same professional asset management expertise while benefiting from economies of scale and the reduction of management and administrative fees.</P>
    <P>Tax transparency is very important if an investor is to avoid double taxation and the non-US investor is to avoid unnecessary US tax liabilities.  In addition, many countries recognise the partnership as completely transparent providing for investors &mdash; limited partners, who might be called shareholders under another structure &mdash; the benefits of double taxation agreements between their home country and the country where partnership assets may be invested.  For example, a French investor who invests in an investment limited partnership which is investing in US securities will be in a position to reclaim tax with &ldquo;held-on&rdquo; dividends in the US <Col N="220" /> at the French-US treaty rate.  It is anticipated that the greatest use of Irish investment limited partnerships will initially be as an investment vehicle for both US inbound and outbound investment.</P>
    <P>The IFSC has a clear, competitive advantage over other financial centres in the matter of employment potential.  Our European based competitors are suffering from problems of success.  Luxembourg, Guernsey and Jersey have near full employment and significant infrastructural constraints which limit their future development.  In contrast, Ireland has a significant, well-educated labour pool ideally suited for financial services work and an infrastructure up to the highest international standards.  The availability of these resources is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the development here of a collective investment scheme industry.  Ireland's competitiors, particularly Luxembourg, have a very long tradition in the industry.</P>
    <P>In addition to the direct employment in the IFSC already referred to, the funds industry is an intensive user of other professional services.  Each fund requires significant legal input; the industry must use accountancy services, including audit and taxation services.  The funds are users of the Stock Exchange and stock broking services.  There are spin-off benefits in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act brought into law this year contains the requisite provisions to enable the investment limited partnerships which will be established under this Bill to benefit from the tax regime applying to collective investment undertakings of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>In view of the advent of the December 1994 deadline for new IFSC companies, it is urgent that entities formed by existing IFSC companies, whether for their own investment limited partnerships or for a sponsoring company, should not be regarded as falling outside the scope of the existing legislation.  As the opportunity to promote such an attractive investment structure is limited due to the constraints imposed by the 1994 European Union new certification moratorium, the early enactment of this <Col N="221" /> legislation is required not only for that reason but more especially that the industry and IDA can market this package to potential investors, especially in North America.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Since the International Financial Services Centre will lose its designation at the end of 1994 and the entitlement of new companies to have tax exemptions available to them will cease, any measure that increases the ability to provide employment in this centre is welcome.  The delay in bringing forward the Bill is questionable. Six months before the expiry date we are introducing a vehicle which we hope will attract new enterprises to the centre.  The question must be asked: is it too late to be introducing this legislation? It was expected it would be introduced last autumn; but we are only now introducing it at the eleventh hour at the end of this session, without an explanatory memorandum.  It is clearly a rushed job, which suggests that someone failed in the planning and execution of the legislation. It will be a major job for the IDA and other agencies seeking to sell this measure to do all the marketing and attract companies by the end of the year. That is a concern that must be expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the general issue of the regulation of the investment intermediary industry.  This is a good occasion to raise serious concerns that have recently surfaced about the lack of regulation of investment intermediaries. Ireland has no system for regulating the operation of investment intermediaries. They can put up a plate on the door of a building and operate satisfactorily.  It is somewhat ironic that at a time when this House is introducing tax clearance certificates for people selling oranges and bananas on the street, there is no system to regulate people who establish themselves as investment experts, selling largescale investment products, sometimes to an unsuspecting public.  Two recent incidents have been reported in the newspapers of investment intermediaries who were fined and prevented from operating <Col N="222" /> in the UK and who transferred their operations to Ireland and traded from Irish addresses in, it would appear, similar businesses to those for which they were struck off in the UK.</P>
    <P>Some were gambling on movement in the Stock Exchange index and clearly such investments offered no security to people who had entrusted their hard earned savings to those running these schemes.  It would be extremely damaging to Ireland's reputation if such incidents became a regular feature of investment intermediary activities, in particular, in Dublin.  There are all too many people overseas who would be pleased to see the financial services centre and Ireland's attempt to develop a successful industry in this area run aground and damage being done to our reputation.</P>
    <P>I understand that some UK securities regulatory boards have circulated notices warning about Irish based operators who are less than kosher in handling savings. At the end of the day confidence is the key ingredient to success in attracting investments.  The onus is on Government to move speedily to ensure the highest level of confidence in investment intermediaries operating in Ireland.  That means we have to establish credible and effective regulation.  As well as dealing with the Investment Limited Partnership Bill we should take the opportunity to enact legislation to provide for proper regulation of such intermediaries.  During the passage of the Consumer Credit Bill perhaps the Minister would take the opportunity to present legislation providing for the satisfactory regulation of investment intermediaries.  I certainly would not like to see our reputation being damaged in any way.  There is an opportunity before the end of the session to do something to ensure that Ireland's high reputation is protected from possible erosion by fly-by-nights who might establish in Ireland and damage our standing.</P>
    <P>I wish to query the future of the financial services sector.  As I mentioned earlier, the tax concession under which the financial services centre was established runs out at the end of this year and after that date no further companies can <Col N="223" /> avail of concessions.  I know this Bill has the advantage that investment limited partnerships are unlikely to be seriously damaged by the loss of tax status, but no doubt a great many companies who would be involved in the type of business that uses this vehicle probably are involved also in other investment activities that might be adversely affected by the tax change.  To what extent are the activities in the financial services centre tax dependent and vulnerable to changes in the tax regime in other countries? More importantly, from the point of view of developing the centre has the Minister taken action to renegotiate with the European Commission the ending of the tax concession?  It appears we are only starting to develop the financial services centre as a successful location for doing business.  From the Minister's figures it appears that an additional 200 people have been employed in the past 12 months, a substantial increase on the employment levels in the previous 12 months.  Clearly, the financial services centre is in its infancy.  We must ask ourselves if we have done enough in the time up to the end of 1994 to capitalise on the opportunities and, if not, can we renegotiate and gain an extension of time?</P>
    <P>It is somewhat embarrassing that excessive rents have given rise to problems in the financial services centre, apparently curtailing relocation of companies who committed themselves to establishing in the centre.  They have not moved in.  I would be interested to learn how many companies who committed themselves to the centre have not located there at this stage.  What is the problem? If the level of rents is the source of the problem, can a system of arbitration of rent be established?  I think the Government must take action to ensure that the potential of the centre is not damaged by the apparent lack of competition in the provision of sites and the rents charged. Perhaps the Minister would give an insight into the area of vacant space in the centre and how close we are to meeting the projections for the building programme and occupancy rates.  It is <Col N="224" /> important that we know the facts because we are approaching the last six months of the scheme which provides tax concessions. Clearly, we need to know how far we have come against the projected figures.</P>
    <P>The vulnerability of these operations to tax changes must be ever present in the minds of policymakers.  Some recent changes in tax law have damaged Irish companies in recent times.  We need to get our act together and, if necessary, renegotiate the tax concession with the Commission so that we would be in a position at the end of the year to capitalise on opportunities.  Luxembourg is an impressive lesson in what can be done. I understand they employ 18,000 people in the area of financial management, which dwarfs what we have achieved in Ireland.  Admittedly, they are well ahead of us in experience and have established networks.  However, we would have advantages because of our traditional links with the US.  This Bill is particularly welcome in that we are getting an opportunity to land mobile investment management projects for Ireland. Increasingly, multinational companies seem to want to centralise the management of pension funds, other funds and share options.  If they centralise all their multinational operations in one country, clearly the location of that central management is highly mobile and should we be able to offer the best package, we can land employment opportunities for Ireland.</P>
    <P>This investment vehicle provides extraordinary concessions in that projects will not be liable for any of our taxes, capital gains tax, VAT and stamp duty.  We need an assurance that such companies and partnerships cannot be used as offshore companies for purposes that we would not like.  It is heartening that Central Bank regulations will apply, but effectively we are deciding without a great deal of debate to give very extraordinary and generous tax concessions to a certain type of investment vehicle.  The House would need assurances that the vehicle could not use those concessions for purposes for which it is not intended.</P>

      <P>This is a complex Bill and I am sure much of the detail will not emerge until such time as we debate Committee Stage.  Each of the 45 sections will have to be teased out in detail.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party I welcome this Bill.  It represents one more step in promoting the growth and development of international financial services in this country.  When it becomes law it will enable the International Financial Services Centre to bid for business that would not otherwise come to this country if this law was not put in place.  Accordingly, that will inevitably lead to more job creation and to the provision of jobs for the pool of highly qualified young people to which the Minister referred in his introductory remarks. That is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enable investment from United States sources that had been hitherto precluded and which will now take place when the Bill becomes law.  I believe we can expect additional business from the United States and also from Canada, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to United States investors is that they cannot get the benefits of the 10 per cent tax rate when they invest in funds in the International Financial Services Centre which are structured as unit trusts.  This is because of the provisions of the US domestic tax legislation on the worldwide earnings of US individuals and the US/Ireland Double Taxation Treaty. That issue must be addressed if we are to benefit from the investment that is waiting to be garnered.  That issue is clearly being addressed in the context of this Bill.  As I have said, when it is addressed it will inevitably lead to much investment, with consequent benefits to this country.  That is a key element of the Bill which I certainly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a single product Bill, which is sensible and to be welcomed.  Tedious cross references with existing company and commercial legislation can be avoided in future and the comprehensive nature of the Bill will be of assistance both to lawyers and to the IDA in their <Col N="226" /> efforts to market Ireland to overseas investors.</P>
    <P>My main regret &mdash; and this has been referred to by Deputy Bruton &mdash; is that it has taken so long for this Bill to come before the House.  The problems of securing United States investment in funds in the International Financial Services Centre have existed since the centre was established seven years ago, yet it is only now that this problem is being addressed. The centre, which was opened in 1987, gained no real momentum until 1989; but development was then hindered by the worldwide financial recession of 1990 to 1993.  As a result of this, although the centre has been successful, with 3,000 jobs approved and approximately 1,500 of those already in place, it has not yet achieved the critical mass of volume and variety to allow it reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>A key priority must now be the establishment of a working group to examine ways and means in which the International Financial Services Centre can become more competitive in fiscal terms compared with rival centres in other countries and to put in place measures to bring about this increased competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Although we have a headline tax rate of 10 per cent compared to a headline tax rate of 40 per cent in Dutch centres, the IFSC here is not as competitive as those centres which are required to grapple with such a different tax rate and tax regime.  This is because sophisticated international tax planning, such as the exploitation of double tax treaties between various jurisdictions, combined with the manner in which tax charges are computed in other countries, can succeed in bringing down the effective Dutch tax rate well below the 10 per cent.  These areas, which are complex and difficult, will have to be exploited by this country if the IFSC in Dublin is to attain its full potential.</P>
    <P>We could learn much from the Belgians also and the manner in which they co-ordinated their lower effective tax rate, which is much lower than what we have here.  We could learn a great deal also from the manner in which <Col N="227" /> Luxembourg has developed its financial services centre which could be applied here.  That was referred to also by Deputy Bruton.  Undoubtedly, this is an area of growth which, if we can put the proper system in place, can yield large numbers of jobs for young graduates who are very well qualified and who have the ability to work effectively in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what progress, if any, the Minister for Finance has made in having the deadline for the granting of new IFSC licences extended beyond December 1994.  This matter has been mentioned in great detail already by Deputy Bruton.  Clearly, the six months that remain are not adequate to enable the centre develop and grow to its full potential and I want to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, if the Minister for Finance proposes to extend the deadline. Will he consider recommending that and, if so, what action does he intend to take.</P>
    <P>Through the extension of the licence granting period, the centre would be able to continue to attract new businesses during the period in which the financial services industry is recovering from recession.  That is the key issue that cannot be ignored.  This will have a very positive impact on the future of the centre through both the growth of existing businesses and the attraction of new tenants. I ask the Minister to respond to that when replying to the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is complex and difficult.  But it must be seriously confronted because if we put the proper system in place, the benefits will be very tangible in terms of investment into this country and job creation.  We must put every effort into bringing that about.  I welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill has referred to the fact that this a complex Bill and the Minister made reference to its complexity on a number of occasions also.  I became aware of the existence of the Bill for the first time this afternoon when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment kindly wrote to us apologising <Col N="228" /> for the short notice which we have received and explaining that this was because the Bill was only finally drafted last week.</P>
      <P>It should go without saying that if this is as complex a measure as the Minister believes it to be, then it was reasonable in all the circumstances that we should have been given an opportunity, as Opposition spokespersons, to take advice on the matter.  I am conditioned, presumably by instinct, to be suspicious of having to debate a Bill such as this at this hour of night which I am told must be rushed through before the recess for reasons which Deputy Bruton pointed out are a little difficult to understand at first glance.  This was not signalled to us earlier; it was not signalled at the Whips meetings.  We were suddenly told that there was such a Bill and an attempt was made to put it through all Stages tonight. When that was not possible we were told that Second Stage would be taken tonight but that the Bill must be completed before the recess.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the tax designation status for new licensees runs out at the end of this year.  I am a little puzzled, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, why there is such great urgency now. The game is almost up anyway.  I do not share the blanket commendation of the International Financial Services Centre that seems to be conventional.  I am aware that 1,400 people are employed there but I am also aware that the international financial community regard it more as a tax shelter than an indigenous financial industry where skills are developed and telecommunications are so good it is likely to grow and provide additional employment.  It provides badly needed jobs and the tax take at a special rate is significant.  However, there is no way of measuring how many of the projects have been relocated there from elsewhere in the country and what tax is lost as a result of that.  It is difficult to do an audit on it and, as far as I am concerned, the jury is still out.  I welcome it for what it is but I do not give it a blanket commendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless it is intended to bring forward <Col N="229" /> legislation and have it approved in the European context in terms of new licensees, I cannot see why the IDA should be responsible for the last minute introduction of the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill will permit general and limited partners to invest in property.  Is the Minister saying that is strictly prohibited now?  Do I understand that partnerships cannot get a licence as it stands and that is one of the reasons for the Bill?  Is investment in property envisaged in the Bill vetoed at present?  This is relevant to what Deputy Bruton dealt with.</P>
    <P>When I received the Bill today the first thing that occurred to me was there are significant tax exemptions from capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and so on offered in it.  The Minister said the 10 per cent rate was not of primary importance. These exemptions give inordinate possibilities for abuse and the last thing we need to encourage in terms of industrial policy is further incentives to invest in property or fixed assets as compared to investment in enterprise or risk projects. I note it is the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who is bringing this measure forward and not the Minister for Finance so presumably he regards it as an instrument for industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As I understand the limited partnership idea in the United States, it is to raise money for high risk activity.  If memory serves me right, the movie industry benefited enormously from this instrument in the US.  However, the Minister seems to say that investment in high risk activity is not what is envisaged and I would like him to clarify that.  He said: &ldquo;As an investment vehicle, the partnership is not expected to engage in the kind of high risk venture normally engaged in by a limited partner ...&rdquo;.  What does the Minister mean? He referred to existing restrictions in the 1907 legislation and stated there is &ldquo;doubt over the precise extent of the liability of the limited partners in the event of a withdrawal of capital and the possibility that creditors could levy execution against limited partners for debts of the firm, notwithstanding the limit on their liability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> This legislation is ring fencing it to the International Financial Services Centre or to SFADCo.  If the law is defective in terms of exposing one beyond the limited liability envisaged here, why is it good enough for the rest of the country?  Presumably it applies only to the dock site. Why are we not concerned about the rest of the country if there is this imprecise extent of liability?</P>
    <P>I am interested in the explanatory note the Minister sent to us and the passing reference to the Paircéir working group. A tremendous device used by the Civil Service is to refer us to a respectable working group that recommended this and that we all know about.  I did not know about it.  I know Mr. Séamus Paircéir is an eminent retired civil servant who came to the attention of the House in a different connection not too long ago, but I did not know he was chairing a working group on this.  Is the report available in the Library?  Can the Minister make the report available to us before Committee Stage since he and the explanatory notes he sent to us pleads the sensible recommendation of the Paircéir working group as the <i>raison d'Etre</i> for this legislation &mdash; as the Minister said, Paircéir identified the need for a regulated, tax transparent, limited partnership structure?  I would like to read that because the question is far wider than would seem to be implied by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The matter that is uppermost in my mind is that we have a tax driven haven that has attracted an indefinable amount of business to the IFSC.  We have failed time and time again at Question Time to identify precisely the benefit in terms of what we won and what we lost.  If this is just a facility for fund managers let us say so.  What is its precise economic advantage? Are we merely attracting prospective property speculators from Guernsey, Luxembourg and elsewhere into the Irish scene so that they can function from here and we will have what the Minister describes as a full menu to offer them?  The explanatory memorandum is marvellous in terms of its jargon.  The financial services sector is difficult <Col N="231" /> enough without engaging in some of the &ldquo;Ruairí Quinn speak&rdquo; in the explanatory memorandum.  We are going to have a domestic haven&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where money can be laundered and there will be no liability to capital gains tax, stamp duty, etc., for deals made elsewhere and which can be of a considerable tax advantage to those companies in their country of origin, mainly the United States of America.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced of the merits of this legislation.  I do not understand the claims made by the Minister that &ldquo;the industry does not primarily rely on the existence of the 10 per cent tax rate and requires minimal use of double taxation treaties.&rdquo;.  Presumably he is referring to the collective investment industry here. Does that mean any more than that the main gain to them will be exemption from the other taxes to which we have just referred?  What is the net economic advantage to this country, apart from the fact that before the end of the year, when the tax designation status runs out, we will be able to get in a few more clients in order to achieve the numbers we were told in recent years this would ultimately realise?  I am not sure I can see any net gain in this above and beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to underline the point made by Deputy Bruton about the regulation of the industry generally.  The Minister's reference to the desirable innovation whereby primary and secondary legislation is amalgamated in this Bill, a nice neat document which we can give American lawyers who will find it intelligible, etc., is very interesting.  It is a pity we do not follow that example in the case of other legislation.  This does nothing to remove my innate suspicion that we have been very helpful here.  This legislation has been sprung on us before the House rises for its recess and we are supposed to put it through at the last minute.  As an investment vehicle, the partnership is not expected to engage in the kind of high risk venture normally engaged in by <Col N="232" /> a limited partner.  Is that its general use in the United States?</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that generally there is no regulation of investment intermediaries. If we are to take it at face value, it is extraordinary that at the last minute the IDA brought it to the attention of the Government that it is desirable to have legislation so that we can attract elements of this industry before the end of the year, yet we cannot bring in legislation which has been needed for a very long time for the regulation of investment intermediaries generally.</P>

      <P>Probably.  The initiative for this legislation did not come from the Government or the Department; the IFSC committee charged with the development of the centre lobbied the Department to put this new structure in place.  It regarded it as another structure it can offer potential operators in the <Col N="233" /> International Financial Services Centre. There are internal captive insurance companies in the centre which deal with insurance fund management for their organisations.  There are also treasury management operations which basically manage the function of international currency, from which they earn fees, etc.  If a limited partnership is established this Bill will permit funds from outside the State to be invested in the International Financial Services Centre in these structures. That fund must then be invested outside the State.  The Deputy referred to property, and I want to make it clear there is no question of these funds being invested in the State, they will be invested outside the State.  The economic advantage to us from that exercise is threefold: we will get corporation profit tax, some jobs and some fees for the work done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton wanted to know the extent to which the International Financial Services Centre is tax vulnerable.  Companies have to obtain a licence before the end of 1994 and the CPT rate of 10 per cent will run out in 2005.  These are largely matters for the Minister for Finance to whom the Deputy should address these questions informally.  The companies applying for licences know that December 1994 is the deadline and that the CPT rate of 10 per cent will run out in 2005.  We are not dealing here with ordinary small start up companies or inexperienced people. These are highly professional people who know the rules.</P>

      <P>It would be unrealistic for anyone to give a guarantee that all the jobs created will survive.  All of us have learned that lesson by now.  The companies know the rules and we are happy to take those risks as employment will be created and we will get revenue from corporation profit tax and from fees.</P>
      <P>The International Financial Services Centre is a major flagship project.  Questions were asked about whether we were renegotiating the 1994 deadline. Deputies will appreciate that the Government's intentions in that regard relate to commercially sensitive information which would be very valuable to certain firms.  This is a matter for the Minister for Finance and his Department in the first instance but I can tell the House that the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are actively considering our options on that one.</P>
      <P>I was asked for an assurance that these new structures would pay some tax here. Perhaps Deputy Richard Bruton did not intend it but I picked up that he indicated that they did not pay any tax here.  While I am sure the Deputy did not mean to put it that way, I can say that that is not the position, they do pay corporation profits tax here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will not, and I never said it would.  This centre is genuinely building a good reputation in captive insurance for treasury management.  I hope this additional product will help it. <Col N="235" /> The figure I have of jobs already there is 1,400; I think the Deputy said approximately 3,000 had been approved; I cannot dispute that figure.  Approximately 1,400 or 1,500 jobs are actually up and running; that is useful.</P>
      <P>A debate on the Financial Services Centre &mdash; here I am expressing a personal view &mdash; would be useful now and again to look at it in a dispassionate way.  It is a major project for the State and we are entitled to examine it and its benefits. As I speak I do not know whether the committee or the Minister propose that there be an annual report produced on the Financial Services Centre, or whether the committee or the board propose any kind of annual report.  It would seem sensible that, just like the Industrial Development Authority, Forbairt, or any other agency, some form of annual report might emerge from the centre overall so that we could debate where it is going, from where it has come and whether it is meeting its expectations.  I have not discussed that with the Minister for Finance and do not know his view on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>The point about property is that it is all outside the State, the economic advantage is as I have described, our income is from fees, tax and jobs, the three headings under which we earn some pluses. The Bill does not cost Ireland anything in that, if the funds are not established, we do not lose anything but, if the funds are established, we earn corporation profits tax on the fees and services provided, and we get the jobs, however small. Therefore, there is no real risk involved for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just been consulting about the Deputy's point with regard to acceptance of responsibility, for example, to creditors. In that connection the Bill makes it clear that the general partner would have ultimate responsibility, under Central <Col N="236" /> Bank regulations, for any defaults.  As the money is not ours in the first place any defaults are likely to be external rather than internal.  External persons, say an American investing in the fund, would have to have confidence in the fund before investing.  If for any reason that fund went down and the general partner personally was insolvent, then I imagine the loss would fall on the American investor.  But they would have put their money into that fund, presumably knowing where the buck stopped and, if the fund went down, what would be their come-back.  The Central Bank, by regulation, will not permit highly speculative investment strategies; it is the intention of the Central Bank to monitor that.</P>
    <P>I have to say to Deputy Rabbitte in particular that I know the point he makes about the image of places like the Financial Services Centre.  However, I would have to take the Deputy back a little. We deliberately set out to build a high quality, low tax location.  We did set our face, as a Government and country, against a traditional off-shore tax haven. A number of speeches made around that time suggested that that might be the way, to go the route of the traditional tax haven.  It is not a tax haven.  It is a low tax, high quality, highly regulated, respectable centre.  That is an important distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would use the words &ldquo;tax driven&rdquo; and take back the term &ldquo;tax haven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but it is important to say about the Financial Services Centre that we deliberately set our face against that tax haven image other jurisdictions have and went the other route saying it is very attractive from a tax point of view, we do not deny that; in fact we sell that point &mdash; it is tax attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about measuring the tax foregone.  The Deputy will know that under the regulations all the activity investment has to be external.  Presumably, there is little tax foregone.  I have heard it said that some of our domestic <Col N="237" /> financial institutions located there might have operated in the ordinary economy if they did not have this facility, so that to an extent perhaps there is tax foregone.  I do not know whether that has been measured or is capable of measurement. I presume that if we asked them they would say they would not have done it without this incentive.  I do not know whether we would ever get to the end of that particular piece of string.  The Deputy also asked about rents, vacancies and so on.  I do not have that information with me but, if he requires it, I will provide it for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There was a question about investment intermediaries.  There are certain investment intermediaries here who are not regulated but we have regulated many of them, for example in insurance, in which I was involved myself.  Legislation is being planned to regulate the intermediaries not covered at present, for example, those in the unit trust and UCITs area.  That legislation will be based on EU directives and on the recommendations of the working group established under the Irish Association of Investment Managers.</P>
    <P>I will have to inquire whether it is appropriate or possible for me to make the Páircéir report available to the Deputy between now and Committee Stage.  I am not sure what is the position on that.</P>

The initiative came from the committee who put the point to Government that there was another instrument we could use to attract funds that is now readily marketable by the Industrial Development Authority.  The Páircéir working group makes it clear that this is a gap in the list of financial funds and structures we offer to foreign investors.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that the Central Bank will submit a report to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment annually and that this report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, Members will have an opportunity to debate the provisions of this Bill annually on the basis of that report.  I will inquire whether it is possible to obtain further information for the Deputy arising from the Páircéir recommendations but, from my point of view, its recommendation was quite clear and requested the Department to move in that direction.</P>
      <P>I trust that that reply dealt with many Members' inquiries.  If I omitted some I will take them up again.  Whether it be the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or myself who will be here to deal with it, the remaining queries will be dealt with at the next stage.  I thank Members for their views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to establish a funding mechanism for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour for which, as Deputies will be aware, a major development project is proposed. The project is designed to cater for the first large fast ferry of its kind in the world which, subject, <i>inter alia,</i> to the planning process, is due to be introduced on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route from May 1995.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this vessel which is being built at a cost of some £65 million sterling will transform maritime transport on the central corridor, reducing the crossing time from three and a half hours to under one and three quarter hours. This will provide major benefits for tourism and trade.  Indeed, the very introduction of this unique vessel will generate enormous international interest and provide an opportunity to market Irish business generally.</P>
      <P>To cater for this vessel it is necessary to develop facilities at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  Such facilities must be financed and the purpose of this Bill is to enable this finance to be raised outside the Exchequer, while maintaining full public accountability and scrutiny of the expenditures involved.  This proposed development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour is an integral part of the Government's general strategy for the development of the maritime transport sector generally and, more particularly, ferry services on the central corridor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put this Bill in context it is necessary to understand the present management structure for Dún Laoghaire Harbour and its present business.  Responsibility <Col N="240" /> for the management of Dún Laoghaire Harbour was transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine in 1990.  Its expenditure is voted under the Marine Vote and its income accrues as an appropriation-in-aid of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine established an Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board in January 1990 to assist the Minister in all aspects of harbour management and development, including the formulation of overall medium and long term development plans for the harbour. The board, which has 11 members, comprises harbour users and representatives of local community interests.  The views of the board have been taken into account in drawing up the present project and they fully support the project.  I am very happy to be associated with this development this evening given the fact that I was involved in the launch of this excellent report.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire has a long history in the passenger ferry business dating back to 1860.  It is the principal passenger port in Dublin Bay, accounting in 1993 for two-thirds of passenger ferry traffic.  The harbour directly employs 78 workers and has an annual wage bill of some £1.6 million.  Since 1990 cumulative turnover was £12.6 million and the surplus, net of operating and maintenance costs, was £6 million.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a small fast ferry on the Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead route in July 1993 stimulated a growth in total passenger numbers for 1993 in the order of 20 per cent when compared with total passenger numbers in 1992.  The introduction of further new technology in 1995 should build on and greatly enhance the growing market on the central corridor. Improving economic conditions in the near future, particularly in the UK market, should favour the further growth of the central corridor market.</P>
    <P>The level of the employment associated either directly or indirectly with the harbour is substantial.  It is generally recognised by commercial and tourist interests in Dún Laoghaire that the existing ferry terminal operation has a significant <Col N="241" /> impact on the local economy. Direct employment related to the harbour and shore based ferry services exceeds 190.</P>
    <P>Despite this impressive profile, investment in the terminal facilities in Dún Laoghaire Harbour has been limited.  If the harbour is to continue in its primary position for ferry operations, it must invest to provide for the new generation of ferries, which are faster, more comfortable and more versatile.</P>
    <P>The development project for Dún Laoghaire must be seen also in the context of the overall strategy for ports.  The Government, as provided for in the Programme for a Partnership Government, is committed to the introduction of legislation to provide for restructuring of the management framework for port authorities, through the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises, to manage the 12 larger ports, including Dún Laoghaire.  This Bill, which will replace the Harbours Act, 1946, will provide for major changes in the management structures of the main ports. In the case of Dún Laoghaire which is managed, at present, directly by the Department of the Marine, the new Harbours Bill will allow the port to be managed as an independent public enterprise and on a commercial basis.  This will improve efficiency and enhance its ability to respond to market requirements.</P>
    <P>One of the central objectives of port development is aimed at facilitating the expansion of tourism and, by improving access, assisting in the realisation of the employment and earnings potential of this sector.  The Government's Task Force on Tourism had indicated that the sector has even greater untapped potential sufficient to provide an additional 35,000 jobs, with a 50 per cent real increase in foreign earnings from tourism over the next five years.  The tourism task force recognised access as one of the two biggest barriers to tourism development. Adequate competitive port access is a prerequisite for the development of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>In this context, ferry terminal requirements in Dublin Bay have now been <Col N="242" /> evaluated thoroughly.  In particular, the question of closing down Dún Laoghaire Harbour and creating a unified ferry terminal in Dublin Port has been looked at in detail.  The Government, taking account of these evaluations, has recently approved a comprehensive strategy for the development of ferry services on the central corridor.  This strategy involves the parallel and complementary development of ferry terminals at Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire and also the development of Holyhead to facilitate the earliest possible introduction of both B &amp; I's and Stena Sealink's new vessels.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should mention that the new B &amp; I large vessel is being built at a cost of £45 million.  The introduction of these new state of the art vessels will put the central corridor at the forefront of modern ferry technology and services. I am also glad to say that, through the intervention of the Minister for the Marine, an agreement between B &amp; I and Stena Sealink has been brokered which secures the development of Holyhead to meet B &amp; I's needs.  It is obviously important that both ends of the line are developed particularly from the point of view of tourism.</P>
    <P>The proposal to develop Dún Laoghaire to accommodate the new fast ferry technology is viewed as a priority. The development of a new generation of fast ferries, high speed sea service vessel &mdash; HSS &mdash; and the operation of the first vessel of this kind in the world on the Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead route is a significant achievement for the Irish economy.  The HSS introduces new thinking to the achievement of economies of scale and increased capacity by means of increased frequency of sailing rather than by the introduction of increasingly larger vessels.  An important aspect to bear in mind is that the economies and the increased capacity are achieved principally by increased frequency of sailing which is allowed with this new vessel.</P>
    <P>With the HSS service the time taken for a single crossing will be reduced to under one and three quarter hours, with a speed through the water of 40 knots. <Col N="243" /> This will allow five round trips in 24 hours.  The actual capacity of the HSS is roughly comparable to a conventional ferry but the frequency of service will mean that it can do the work of two of the present ferries.  The HSS vessel, costing £65 million, allows for speedy transportation across the Irish Sea for cars, passengers and freight.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been raised about possible increased flows of trucks through Dún Laoghaire Harbour. These concerns are without foundation. The present capacity of Dún Laoghaire Harbour to handle trucks is over 100,000 per annum.  The actual flow is only 33,000 per annum.  While the maximum capacity of the harbour will increase with the new HSS vessel, actual usage by trucks is not expected to increase to any great extent in the medium term.  The principal development will be in the area of passenger and car services.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire Harbour development is intended to strengthen its premier role as an attractive gateway for tourist traffic to Ireland, with Dublin Port maintaining its dominant role in the freight market.  Total Ro-Ro traffic at present on the central corridor amounts to about 155,000 units and the vast bulk of this goes through Dublin Port.  With the introduction of B &amp; I's new super ferry, the proportion of trucks going through Dublin Port should increase and the Dún Laoghaire share decline.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate this new generation of fast ferries, it is necessary to provide new berthing and terminal facilities in Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead.  The capital costs of the project will be funded outside of the Exchequer.  The operator has agreed to underwrite, through harbour dues, the level of borrowings necessary to undertake the project.  This will avoid any burden on the Exchequer or the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The timetable for this project is tight. If the May 1995 target is to be met, contracts must be awarded before the end of July next and financing must be in place in advance of that date.  Hence the urgency of this Bill.  The pre-design estimate <Col N="244" /> of cost, as stated in the environmental impact statement which was prepared for the planning process, was £15 million.</P>
    <P>Tenders for the main contract have now been invited and the closing date for those tenders was last Friday, 17 June 1994.  These tenders are now being assessed with a view to detailed discussions with tenderers and the operator who is underwriting the project.  Because of the commercial sensitivities involved and the range of options open, it would not be helpful at this point to speculate on the precise cost of the final contracts to be awarded.</P>
    <P>All this is, of course, subject to approval of the project by An Bord Pleanála and the granting of planning permission. What is being sought here is a facility to allow the project to proceed in the event that An Bord Pleanála gives it the go ahead and the enactment of the Bill is strictly without prejudice to that decision.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a few words about the principal provisions of the Bill, the main purpose of which is to establish a funding mechanism for development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board.  The Schedule to the Bill contains provisions in relation to the board.  The board shall consist of not fewer than three and not more than five members who shall be appointed by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>The board, on the direction of the Minister, has the power to secure the necessary moneys to defray the expenses incurred or to be incurred by the Minister for the Marine in carrying out the development works in Dún Laoghaire. For this purpose the board may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, borrow moneys from commercial sources up to a limit of £20 million.  The Minister for Finance may make loans to the board in certain circumstances. The Minister may, by order, appropriate to the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Development Fund a proportion of <Col N="245" /> the revenues payable from the harbour operations at Dún Laoghaire and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make non-repayable grants to the board.</P>
    <P>The functions of the board will be to establish a fund and to secure for payment into the fund the necessary moneys to finance development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  Moneys will be paid out of the fund by the board at the discretion of the Minister.  The board is required to keep accounts, such accounts to be audited on an annual basis by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The audited accounts, together with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Borrowings by the board may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. An annual report must be submitted to the Minister not later than three months after the end of each financial year in relation to the operation of the fund. Copies of the annual report shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, provision is made in section 2 of the Bill to confirm the development powers of the Minister in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This has no implications for the planning process.  As regards planning, I should stress that successive Ministers have made it clear that any major development at Dún Laoghaire Harbour should be subject to the full rigours of the planning process.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister does not require planning permission to proceed with this project, the outcome of the planning process will be fully respected.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I emphasise again the importance of this Bill and the project it is designed to support.  I also reiterate that the commencement of the project is, of course, contingent on the outcome of the planning process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not debating tonight the proposed development works at Dún Laoghaire port; that is a matter for another day.  While I accept that there is a need for major capital works, the <Col N="246" /> main purpose of this legislation is to put a mechanism in place to fund such works at the port.</P>
      <P>When legislation is published on a Thursday, most Members do not receive a copy until the Friday or the following Monday; then when one and a half hours are provided late at night for the debate on Second Stage, and the Committee and Final Stages are expected to be taken the following day, and when the Bill is passed within three or four days of the date of publication, it would cause some people to pause and arouse their suspicions.</P>
      <P>Taking this Bill with undue haste will send the wrong signals to the many people who are concerned about proposed development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  While I accept that there is a need for urgency I am unhappy that most of us did not receive a copy of the Bill which was published on Thursday, until Friday or Monday and we are expected to conclude the debate tomorrow evening.  I do not like that style.</P>
      <P>I would prefer the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, who is abroad on important business to be present, although I am aware that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, was Minister for the Marine for a short period.  What is more important is that the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, represents the constituency and might benefit from listening to what we have to say, although he would have the protection of a strong Dún Laoghaire lobby.  We would be interested to hear what he has to say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Bill has been taken so quickly I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to consider the possibility of taking Committee and Final Stages next week at the earliest as we need time for reflection.  I do not like the idea that we <Col N="247" /> should move so quickly from Second to Committee and Final Stages.  As the Dáil may not be going into recess next week there would be ample opportunity to discuss the Committee and Final Stages of this Bill.  I hope, even at this late stage, the Government will be willing to allow time for reflection as that would ease some of our concerns.  The Minister referred to the urgency of the Bill.  In the briefing note we received from his office we were told that the new legislation must be enacted before the summer recess to enable funding to be put in place so that work can commence this summer, subject to planning permission.  Legislative propriety and scrutiny should always precede commercial considerations.  If we must have everything in place before the summer recess, this debate could have taken place last week or the previous week.  Indeed, it would not be unprecedented for the Dáil, or a committee of it, to sit in a few weeks' time when An Bord Pleanála announces its decision.  I dislike the air of rush and haste which surrounds this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our views on the Bill depend on how we perceive plans for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, but we are at a disadvantage in that the matter must go before An Bord Pleanála for decision. We were informed by the Minister for the Marine last week, and again tonight, that this matter is without prejudice to the decision of An Bord Pleanála.  With respect, that is somewhat naive.  There is an air of arrogance about the concept of arranging and putting in place proposals, plans and mechanisms which should not be put in place until An Bord Pleanála make a certain decision.  We are putting the cart before the horse and Deputy Sheehan and I are concerned in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is concern about the proposal in the Bill to do some retrospective tidying up.  Some aspects of the Bill impinge on harbour law and policy as it operated to date and section 2 is a new departure in this regard.  The Explanatory Memorandum states that section 2 confirms the development powers of the Minister in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  Fortunately I am not a one page man and I examined the contents of the Bill which clearly indicate that section 2 does much more than that. It states that the Minister shall have, and be deemed always to have had, power to carry out, or procure the carrying out of, development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The provisions of that section are retrospective and are a new departure so far as marine policy and law are concerned. Section 2 could have a profound retrospective effect and pre-empt decisions of An Bord Pleanála.  It also renders debate on this legislation more difficult for the majority of us.</P>
      <P>Section 2 would put in place the capacity for retrospective solutions to problems and that is not the ideal way to deal with planning or policy matters. Perhaps retrospective solutions are becoming the Irish answer to Irish problems, but I do not favour such a departure from policy.  What legal advice has been sought and obtained by the Minister for the Marine in regard to this retrospective section?  Has the Attorney General adjudicated on the matter and is the Minister satisfied with the legal certainty of putting in place section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, a board will be set up which will be the most meaningless and powerless board in the State.  It will be a toothless tiger, nothing but a mouthpiece for the Minister. The Bill does not even attempt to give it meaningful power.  Section 4 gives the Minister power to give directions to <Col N="249" /> the board members as to what they may and may not do.  He will not advise them and they will not advise him.  Why is this board being set up?  It will carry out nothing but the explicit instructions and demands of the Minister.  There is no attempt in the legislation to give it any independence or autonomy.  There has always been a strong tendency to set up boards and there is never any difficulty in finding members to sit on them &mdash; they attract members like magnets.  The Schedule to the Bill does not indicate the qualifications necessary for members to sit on this board.  Will the Minister allow public representatives to sit on it?  It is unsatisfactory that there is no mechanism to prohibit interested parties &mdash; people with a direct interest in port development &mdash; from sitting on the board.</P>
    <P>We recently debated legislation which involved the setting up of boards, for example the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill and the An Bord Bia Bill, in which there were clear definitions about who could sit on such boards.  Similar definitions should apply in regard to this board. I will take up that matter on Committee Stage which I hope will be taken in the next week or so.</P>
    <P>The legislation puts in place procedures and mechanisms which will be advantageous to Dún Laoghaire harbour. I do not begrudge the people of that area such advantages, but I am sure there will be a cry for similar mechanisms and advantages from other harbours throughout the country.  Despite what the Minister said about the lack of Government funding we are putting in place a mechanism whereby loans taken out by the Minister for the Marine can be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. This is a new departure which should be beneficial to Dún Laoghaire.  However, many other ports throughout the country would dearly love to have the benefit of such a facility and I would like to know if there is any prospect of this.</P>
    <P>There is also a facility whereby non-refundable grant aid can be paid to this board.  Such grant aid, from the Government or the EU, will also be advantageous to Dún Laoghaire.  It too is a facility I <Col N="250" /> hope will be considered for other harbours because what is good for one harbour is good for others.</P>
    <P>Although I have no doubt that the Minister can handle this legislation more than adequately, I would have preferred to see the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, here to present us with his own unique constituency-departmental view of the matter.  However, we will hear the arguments for Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the concept of developments at Dún Laoghaire.  My difficulty relates to rushing this Bill through the House.  I hope we will not repent at leisure in the years ahead.  I make a final plea to the Minister to make representations to his Whip's office with a view to ensuring that Committee and Report Stages will not be taken tomorrow so that we will at least have some days to reflect further on the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Woods is in the House to take this Bill, but I regret that the Minister for the Marine is unable to be with us.

      <P>Deputy Woods, when Minister for the Marine, gave a commitment on Dún Laoghaire harbour to the Seanad and to me in particular. However, when discussing legislation like this the appropriate Minister should be here and it is a matter of regret that he is not, and not just because of his Dún Laoghaire connection.  I thought we would have fielded a Dún Laoghaire team tonight but it will be up to me and Deputy Gilmore to bat on behalf of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that there will be no oral hearing by An Bord Pleanála on the planning decisions for Dún Laoghaire harbour, those who have misgivings about its development will be very disappointed at <Col N="251" /> passing this legislation through the House in a rushed manner.  Whatever about having the Second Stage debate this evening, I was quite surprised to see that we will have the Committee and Final Stages tomorrow evening because, like others, although I got a short briefing document on the Bill late last week, I only saw the Bill yesterday and it is difficult for Opposition Deputies to table meaningful amendments in such a short space of time.  I have endeavoured to do so and I hope that if we are taking Committee Stage tomorrow evening we will have ample opportunity to discuss some of the aspects of the Bill that may give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>As An Bord Pleanála refused permission for an oral hearing it is important to discuss some of the issues with which people have had difficulty in relation to the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour. I am not critical of the board &mdash; we must respect its decisions &mdash; but it is unfortunate that we did not have an oral hearing because it would have provided an opportunity for full and open debate on the future of the harbour as perceived in the planning permission and the development plan.  However, it is important to put on the record that over a period of years a full consultative process was embarked upon.  In putting the draft development plan for the harbour on public display, the interim harbour board of Dún Laoghaire went to great lengths to ensure the fullest public participation. The initial plan was on public display over a period of months and over 7,000 people saw it.  There were about 500 submissions on foot of it and a number of them were taken on board.  There was broad consultation with advisory groups, the Chamber of Commerce and others to arrive at a consensus about our harbour. Criticism that the plan is being rushed through is, therefore, difficult to take &mdash; I am not referring to this Bill but to the plan.  That is not so because it has been under discussion for quite some time.</P>
    <P>It is also important to stress that we are particularly aware of the importance of tourism development in Dún <Col N="252" /> Laoghaire and that is where development of the harbour and the ferry terminal will come into its own.  I am concerned at the suggestion that this will result in heavy freight movement through Dún Laoghaire when that is not something we support.</P>
    <P>We particularly want to promote tourism development through the Stena Sealink company.  As a county council member for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dún Laoghaire Borough I remember that there was at the time quite a degree of discussion about submissions on the plan, including those from the Royal St. George Yacht Club.  That body, with An Taisce and other groups, supported the principle of developing Dún Laoghaire harbour and stressed the importance of the development of the ferry terminal for the future development of Dún Laoghaire given its high rate of unemployment and the fact that the town was practically on its last legs.  They said that the ferry terminal was crucial and the key to the future development of Dún Laoghaire.  It was gratifying to see a well balanced submission which did not focus on sectoral interests.  A survey carried out in 1988 showed that the ferry service contributed some £14 million to the local economy.  I do not know what that would be in today's terms but it would certainly be over £20 million.  That puts in context the importance of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire.  The economy of Dún Laoghaire, the county town of the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, needs the stimulation which development of the ferry service would provide.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed about the increased traffic on this route.  The high speed service will carry much more traffic in 24 hours than existing ships, but will not carry more traffic in any one sailing.  The extra sailings will be evenly spread over the day.  Fears have been expressed about an increased number of trucks rolling through Dún Laoghaire. The fact that the HSS can carry 50 trucks per sailing does not mean it will carry that number.  It has been stated that about 1,000 extra trucks will pass through <Col N="253" /> the port, but that is not the case.  In its submission to An Bord Pleanála Stena Sealink forecasts that the rate of heavy freight will decrease over a period of a year by thousands of units.  It is useful to put this on the record.</P>
    <P>Over a period of six years Stena Sealink is injecting £110 million into the development of Dún Laoghaire.  Considering that under this Bill we are talking about £20 million, this puts in context the input of Stena Sealink and its commitment to Dún Laoghaire.  In line with the reassurances we have received from the company, there should be a response by the public representatives of the area. The injection into the Irish economy by way of employment, port dues and the purchase of goods and services, without receiving a Government subsidy, may not be unique but it is something of which we do not have much experience.  Such commitment to an area deserves all the support possible.  In the context of developing the tourism industry, development of the harbour must be supported.</P>
    <P>I had hoped we would have more time between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill.  I am concerned about the powers given to the Minister.  We will have an opportunity to tease out this matter on Committee Stage and I have put down amendments in this area.  It is proposed that there will be three to five people on the board but it is unacceptable that these people be appointed by the Minister.  If we are to ensure openness and transparency there should be a better mechanism for appointing members to the board so that they will be seen to be independent.  These people will have certain responsibilities but overall responsibility will rest with the Minister. Support for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour should be reflected by appointing local people to the board. This matter may be discussed further on Committee Stage and I will not dwell on it, but it is important that people from the locality be appointed to the board as that would ensure accountability to the area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
    <P>The spring 1993 bulletin of Dún <Col N="254" /> Laoghaire Harbour refers to the report of the review group on commercial harbours, published by the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods.  It states that a State company should be set up to manage Irish ports and it stressed the specialist passenger handling element of Dún Laoghaire port.  The potential of Dún Laoghaire is not in heavy freight but in specialist passenger handling.  In that area there is a proven record and the company wishes to develop it.  If properly handled, such development will be extremely successful.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in expressed disappointment that the Minister for the Marine is not here to put through this important legislation.  I also join in the statements on the rushed way in which this Bill is being put through the Oireachtas.  In principle it is bad that any legislation, albeit relatively uncomplicated legislation such as this, should be circulated at short notice, with Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken within a couple of days of Second Stage. I support the request from Deputy Bradford and Deputy Keogh that Committee and Remaining Stages be postponed until next week.</P>
      <P>The way in which this Bill is being put before the House, on top of the decision by An Bord Pleanála not to grant an oral hearing into the planning application, will fuel a belief that there is a hidden agenda and that behind the scenes moves are being made in the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  That is regrettable and unnecessary because the development of Dún Laoghaire is perfectly capable of being defended and argued for either at the oral hearing or at any forum at which it comes up for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill concerns the proposed development of a new terminal facility at Dún Laoghaire Harbour to accommodate the high speed vessel which Stena Sealink intends to operate from next summer on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route.  This new service and the development to accommodate it have been the subject of local and media comment in <Col N="255" /> recent weeks.  I take this opportunity to restate my position on it.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour must be seen in three contexts: first, Ireland's position in relation to the rest of Europe following completion of the Channel Tunnel; second, the development of a port and shipping policy; and, third, the needs of the town of Dún Laoghaire and the wider Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county.  There is no argument about the need for a fast and efficient means of getting on and off this island by sea.  The new vessel commissioned by Stena Sealink will be the fastest sea vessel ever to ply the Irish Sea.  There are some who question its size and desirability, but just as the age of the steam ship was left behind, so too is this new vessel replacing the traditional car ferry.</P>
    <P>Why should it take three and a half hours to make a journey which can now be done in half the time? The question of immediate concern is, of course, whether this vessel should be put on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route.  Clearly, it is logical to do so.  Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead is the shortest sea route between Ireland and Britain.  Dún Laoghaire is the most used passenger sea port in this State and if we are serious about the development of the tourism industry in Dún Laoghaire we must develop it as it is an attractive destination in its own right.  Those who argue that the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour should not proceed are saying in effect that Dún Laoghaire should cease to be the main passenger port, which it now is.  They are arguing for the relocation of the ferry to another port and for the ending of Dún Laoghaire's historic role as the main passenger sea port in the country.  There are good maritime, transport and strategic reasons in the national interest for this development to proceed but there are also compelling local reasons for it and as a Deputy representing the Dún Laoghaire constituency I wish to put those on record.</P>
    <P>There are 8,000 people signing on at <Col N="256" /> Dún Laoghaire labour exchange.  There are 15,000 people out of work in the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county, over 20 per cent of the workforce.  This is one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, but unlike other parts of Dublin or the country, there are only limited opportunities to tackle unemployment in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is largely built up with only limited scope for further industrial development. Therefore, we have to look to tourism or to the sea to provide some of the opportunities for the generation of employment locally.  The greatest single asset in Dún Laoghaire is its harbour. We have no choice in Dún Laoghaire but to maximise the potential of the harbour. That means the retention of the car ferry, which in turn means moving with the changing maritime technology and being prepared to facilitate the most up-to-date development in shipping.</P>
    <P>I support the development of the new facility in Dún Laoghaire, because it is good for the town, good for the new county and good for the country as it gives us more speedy access to the rest of Europe.  I do not support the development blindly.  I have no illusions that the new ferry facility will generate huge employment or transform the economic fortunes of the area but it is the key to the economic revival of Dún Laoghaire, a town which has been in the economic doldrums for far too long.  The new HSS will bring people to Dún Laoghaire but the challenge will be to retain them in the town for a couple of nights and to do so we must provide facilities to encourage people to stay and spend in our town. That is why I am supporting this development, the development of a cultural facility on the old pavilion site and the development of a multiplex cinema complex on the old Dominican site and why I supported the development of a water leisure facility on the Dún Laoghaire baths site.  I believe the development of these facilities coupled with the new ferry will revive the economic life of Dún Laoghaire and generate valuable <Col N="257" /> employment downstream in tourism and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire needs this type of investment and if it does not get it, I am fearful for the future of the town and its hinterland.  The levels of unemployment and the social problems that emanate from poverty are just not sustainable in Dún Laoghaire.  I know that many who are opposed to this development are understandably concerned about its impact on the residential amenities of Dún Laoghaire and its surrounding areas but I invite them to reflect on the impact on residential amenities of the serious social problems which we are beginning to witness and which will worsen unless we turn around the economic fortunes of the area and provide employment and hope, especially to young people.</P>
    <P>The new ferry facility will probably result in some traffic problems, but these may not be as great as some claim.  They are capable of being tackled in the context of the traffic management plan under consideration by the county council.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the whole issue that must be referred to, namely, the question of employment.  Coupled with the development of this facility I want to see an increase in employment both in the harbour itself and in shipping activity.  It is disappointing that since the Department of the Marine &mdash; which I acknowledge has done an excellent job in the management of Dún Laoghaire Harbour &mdash; took over the harbour there has been a reduction in the numbers employed.  The Department of the Marine took over the management of the harbour in 1988 and the number of employees in the harbour has been reduced by 39 despite the fact that the number of sailings to and from Dún Laoghaire has increased from two to eight.  It is not acceptable where port activity is increasing that there is a reduction in employment.  On his return I hope the Minister for the Marine will address the issue of increasing employment and of providing additional permanent jobs in the harbour.  I do not want to see a completely capital intensive <Col N="258" /> facility develop which will not generate additional employment.</P>
    <P>Let me put down a marker on shipping activity.  I have received reports about some of the employment practices of the operator in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I am very concerned about the increasing casualisation of employment on the vessels to and from the port.  I believe the dispute now taking place in B &amp; I is essentially about the same issue, the replacement of secure employment with good conditions.  I do not want to see a return to pre-Larkin type employment practices on our ships.  I want to see an increase in secure employment as well as hearing more Irish accents the next time I board the Catamaran.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that this is an interim Bill.  Everything about Dún Laoghaire Harbour seems to be interim.  An interim harbour board was appointed several years ago and we do not have a proper harbour authority.  Now we propose to establish an interim body, able to raise loans so that the development can go ahead.  I cannot understand why it was not possible to present a Bill establishing Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority on a statutory basis, as we have been seeking for many years, giving proper representation to the marine, local community and local authority interests to manage Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I am disappointed with this half-way-house measure, a solution to an immediate problem which arises because of the funding needed to proceed with the development if planning permission is granted by An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister should have come before us with a Bill providing for a proper harbour authority as the issue has been around for long enough in the Department of the Marine.  When we come to Committee Stage I intend to table an amendment to that effect.  I also want go express concern &mdash; I will be tabling amendments on this also &mdash; about the retrospective nature of section 2, to which Deputy Bradford referred.  I do not see any necessity for it.  It is not desirable and should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have concerns too, about section 6 <Col N="259" /> (7) which allows for the disposal of investments by this board.  I am not quite sure what those investments are but any time I see the word &ldquo;dispose&rdquo; appearing in a Bill, especially given this Government's penchant for privatisation, I see red.  I will certainly want assurances that we do not have some kind of Trojan Horse for the privatisation of Dún Laoghaire Harbour or some part of it.  I want that section scrutinised carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill, which is necessary, and I support the development of the new ferry facility at Dún Laoghaire.  I want to see it proceed.  The problems associated with it will have to be addressed. A proper harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire should be established.  I do not believe it is necessary for Dún Laoghaire to wait until the legislation dealing with the major ports and setting up the semi-State companies is brought before the House.  Dún Laoghaire port is unique in that it is owned by the Department of the Marine.  This development should proceed if planning permission is granted by An Bord Pleanála and a proper harbour authority should be established.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine must address urgently the need to provide additional employment at Dún Laoghaire Harbour, particularly following these developments.  The tendencies I detect by operators in the shipping industry must be addressed also because we should not allow a return to out of date employment practices.</P>

He said this will result in major benefits for tourism and trade, generate enormous international interest and provide an opportunity to market Irish business. At whose cost will Irish business be marketed?  Will it be marketed into one region in the country, taking it through one of the most developed areas where one-third of the population resides, namely, Dublin?  The Minister said it will generate more development and activity into that corridor.</P>

We have lost out again in the south western region in regard to the INTERREG funds, a subject on which I will be speaking later.  We have developed excellent facilities in Ringaskiddy and Rosslare but one region should not have a monopoly to the detriment of others.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to downgrade the Cork-Roscoff, the Cork-Swansea and the Rosslare-Fishguard ferry services? Does he wish to downgrade the Greenore and Larne services?  It is difficult to understand the Minister's commitment to this port development when one hears the demands of our island people for a proper ferry service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Minister but the Government has provided no funds for an adequate ferry service from Bere Island to the mainland, where a fatal tragedy took place recently. No State money was provided for a ferry service from that island to the mainland in Castletownbere.  I am amazed that <Col N="262" /> Members can emphasise the necessity for a £20 million guaranteed Government loan for one area while the Government has failed to contribute to a decent ferry service from Bere Island to Castletownbere. Do we need further tragedies to bring home to the Minister what we endure in the west and southwest in earning a living?  The <i>Bardini Reefer</i> is lying off the mouth of Castletownbere Harbour. It is a monument to the failure of successive Fianna Fáil Governments and this Coalition Government to remove it. There are super conger eels coming out of its hulk.  The Government say they do not have the money to remove this wreck from the mouth of the second largest fishery harbour yet this Bill, introduced in haste, will enable £20 million to be spent on Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
      <P>The Government failed to provide a proper pier at Whiddy Island, let alone finance a proper ferry service from the island, which suffered a major disaster 15 years ago.  It failed to provide a decent pier at Baltimore for the <i>Oileáin Cléire,</i> the only ferry service for which the Government provides funds in the south-west. It failed to provide decent berthage at Baltimore Harbour for that service and financial aid to Kinsale Harbour Board to develop that port.  The achievement of the Kinsale Harbour Authority shows what can be done through proper port management but the request for £400,000 was shelved by the Ministers for Marine and Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government failed to provide funding for the extension of a pier at Ahakista at Dunmanus Bay to facilitate fishing and tourism.  If we are logical about the development of tourism we must provide facilities for deep water fishing in such areas which are the gem of the west.  The Government should fund an extension that would cost in the region of £200,000.  The Minister has given a £20 million guarantee for a world renowned port but the Government failed to provide funding for the extension of the pier and marine project at Bantry although it is an ideally situated <Col N="263" /> port and accommodated the <i>Spanish Armada</i> almost 500 years ago.</P>

      <P>The Government failed to provide a decent pier and marina facilities in Crookhaven, the gem of the tourism industry in the Barley Cove area.  Yet, at the stroke of a pen, the Minister can guarantee borrowing of £20 million for Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the Minister should withdraw the Bill immediately and rephrase it.</P>

      <P>He should create a harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire.  I am a member of the harbour Authority in Bantry Bay &mdash; a toothless Authority because it has no money except what it receives from port development, which is very little, as it does not have a proper pier.  There is a ramshackle pier in the harbour.  If the Minister wants proper management of Dún Laoghaire Harbour he should constitute a harbour Authority immediately.  If that was done there would be no need for this legislation which is being put through the House with such haste that we hardly have time to digest its implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to advocate absolute powers for the Minister.  Power must be delegated to the people who understand what Dún Laoghaire means to the area.  Perhaps the Minister will withdraw the Bill and, if he will not accept an amendment, rephrase it to include that a harbour Authority is established immediately.  If properly managed, <Col N="264" /> Dún Laoghaire Harbour will generate finance to accommodate the extension. It is a viable proposition and has withstood the test of time.  The Minister should listen to this side of the House and introduce such an Authority immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Rosslare is a fantastic port with wonderful facilities and I look forward to the day when Dún Laoghaire will have similar facilities.  It is the central corridor.  Slightly over 500,000 extra tourists will come through that port by the end of 1999.  Many of these tourists will go to Castletownbere and west Cork but the people of Dún Laoghaire would like some of them to stay there and see the wonders in their area and around Dublin. Deputy Gilmore mentioned how this would generate employment, not only in Dún Laoghaire but in the surrounding area.  Many people in Dublin could be employed and we would like to see tourists stay in the area.  Deputy Sheehan's area will still get the lion's share of tourists and with the improvement of the corridor more of them will come his way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should not see Dún Laoghaire as competing with other ports. It is a busy port and various studies have shown its potential.  We are trying to ensure that potential is realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bradford and, I think, Deputy Gilmore asked what the Bill is about.  It is basically a simple funding mechanism. Deputy Gilmore asked why the full harbour authority was not being established under the Bill.  The harbour authorities should be set up later in the year after the relevant legislation is enacted.  It is <Col N="265" /> not proposed to rush through that legislation before the summer recess.</P>

    <P>In April 1991 the interim harbour board issued the draft harbour development plan.  Following consideration of the various submissions the plan was finalised in April 1992.  The ferry terminal development plan for the harbour is based on the board's plan which was presented to the Minister for the Marine in April 1992.  However, it has been modified to accommodate the arrival of <Col N="266" /> the new style ferries &mdash; the Sea Lynx and the HSS.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the ferry terminal requirements include a dedicated berth to be provided for the HSS vessel, infilling an area of 1.5 hectares to provide additional operational area &mdash; due to new technology and the new HSS vessel this area is much smaller than that envisaged earlier &mdash; and improved passenger facilities. The current proposal for developing ferry terminal facilities at St. Michael's Pier has been considered in a wide ranging and extensive planning and consultative context.  The development now proposed is in accordance with the broad planning objectives of both the 1992 harbour development plan and the 1991 Dún Laoghaire Borough development plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to the traffic issue and correctly said that the traffic would be more evenly spread out.  The traffic issue was dealt with comprehensively in the environmental impact statement submitted as part of the planning process.  The local authority has granted planning permission without onerous conditions.  The outcome of the appeal to An Bord Pleanála is, of course, awaited.</P>
    <P>The development proposed is designed to accommodate the HSS, the high speed sea service, which introduces a new thinking to the achievement of economies of scale and increased capacity in ferry operation by means of increased frequency of sailing rather than by the introduction of increasingly larger vessels. The vessel is about the same length as the <i>Hibernia</i> and <i>Cambria</i> and is approximately 20 metres wider.  As at present, future ferry schedules will be designed to avoid the arrival of a vessel during the identified peak traffic hours for Dún Laoghaire &mdash; 8 a.m.-9 a.m. and 5 p.m.-6 p.m.  The local authority applied a number of conditions to the grant of planning permission, requiring the Minister to make a financial contribution towards necessary improvements in the port access route to accommodate the extra traffic.  Again without prejudice to the decision of An Bord Pleanála, these conditions will be complied with fully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> A number of Deputies referred to section 2.  The purpose of section 2 and the definition of development in section 1 is to confirm and put beyond any doubt that the Minister for the Marine may carry out development works at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  This provision was included in the original Act.  Doubts were expressed about some of the activities permitted on the sea bed.  The legal advice was that it would be preferable on an occasion like this to tidy up this provision and ensure that its original intent is clear.  It will put beyond doubt that the Minister may undertake works on or under the sea bed.  This was always assumed to be part of the original Act. The legal advice available is that the Minister already has these powers in full. Nevertheless it was felt it would be prudent to ensure that any risks in this regard should be removed so that the Minister may, subject to planning permission, proceed with the business of developing the harbour.  This is necessary in view of the major project envisaged and the financial and economic risks involved for the harbour, the State and the economy generally. In view of the size of the investment, we have to ensure that all these legalities are sound.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 2 and 1 relate solely to Dún Laoghaire Harbour and not to other ports or the foreshore generally.  People have suggested that the provisions in this respect are wider than those contained in the Bill.  The reference to foreshore in section 1 is merely a convenient way of defining the sea bed area as distinct from land in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I stress that these provisions do not relate to the planning process and do not change the rules in that regard.  There is, therefore, no need to be concerned about these provisions.</P>
    <P>The plan accentuates the multifaceted use of the harbour and sets out a number of characteristics to be preserved.  First, Dún Laoghaire is to remain an attractive gateway for tourists and Irish residents. To remain attractive, the ferry operation must be provided with facilities consistent with the high standard on board <Col N="268" /> ship and must be run on a commercial basis.  Second, Dún Laoghaire harbour must be preserved as a valuable and pleasant amenity for the sailing community and the many other users of the harbour waters, with potential for much expanded use given better utilisation of water space, the provision of marinas and more public slipways.  Third, the harbour must be preserved as an important amenity for the enjoyment of the citizens of Dublin who for generations have walked the piers and enjoyed the pleasant views within the harbour and across Dublin Bay.  Fourth, it must be preserved as an attractive recreation centre for visitors to Dún Laoghaire and as an important facility for numerous miscellaneous users, including public services, anglers, naturalists, etc.</P>
    <P>The ferry terminal development proposal is broadly in line with the 1992 harbour development plan.  The Minister for the Marine is committed to facilitating the development of Dún Laoghaire recreational potential and is convinced that this can be achieved in harmony with a successful ferry service.  The harbour board is at present advancing proposals for the development of recreational facilities in the harbour.  As a first step, a sub-committee of the board has prepared a report on the development of the west harbour.  The Department of the Marine will support the board in its task as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is solely an enabling measure to provide for the establishment of an interim legal entity &mdash; the other board, which is representative of all interests and people remains &mdash; to fund development works outside the Exchequer.  I stress &ldquo;outside the Exchequer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This Bill creates the right balance between the commercial interests of the harbour and minimising burdens on the taxpayer while at the same time maintaining full public scrutiny of all activities of the finance board. It is the intention that the assets and <Col N="269" /> liabilities of the board be transferred to the State commercial company shortly to be established by the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the Harbours Bill is well advanced and it is hoped to publish it shortly.  In the meantime, all activities of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Finance Board will be subject to full public scrutiny. All borrowings and expenditure by the board will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for the Marine and Finance. The annual accounts of the board will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and copies of the audited accounts will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, I understand that the Committee of Public Accounts, under its terms of reference, may review any body whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, I can assure the House that adequate accountability arrangements will be in place.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered most points raised by Members.  I hope it is realised that this Bill really represents a mechanism to ensure that the funding arrangements can go ahead and that the other elements Members want to see in place will be put in place fairly soon, not merely in Dún Laoghaire but in each one of our main harbours.  As far as tourism is concerned, it is expected to lead to over 500,000 extra tourists, which will be of great benefit to everybody and should be much welcomed by Members here.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their thorough presentation of views on this relatively simple, small Bill.  If Members recognise that it is a very simple measure, that there is nothing hidden in it, I do not see why it cannot be taken tomorrow but that is a matter for the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am highly critical of last week's decision by the European Union Commission in Brussels to reject the application submitted jointly by the south-western and south-eastern regions of Ireland and South Wales for inclusion in the INTERREG development package of £2.4 billion.  It is clearly evident that the south-western region's application was the victim of our Government's lack of commitment to the region's proposal and the red tape bureaucracy on the part of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a recent visit to Cork the Taoiseach gave an assurance that his Government would support wholeheartedly and press for the inclusion of the south-western region in this package, yet there is no evidence that such was the case.  Had this Government lobbied and canvassed the support of other EU member states for the south-western region to be included, we would have had a different result.  Can the Taoiseach or his Minister inform the House why he failed to deliver the promise he gave recently in Cork to have the <Col N="271" /> south-western region included in this INTERREG development package?</P>
    <P>As Ireland is now the only island nation within the European Union &mdash; since Britain has been joined to the Continent by the Channel Tunnel &mdash; why did this country not receive preferential treatment for our south-western region's proposal? The region has much in common and a direct sea link with south Wales. In their joint submission to the European Union authorities in April last Cork and Glamorgan, south Wales, outlined the strong cultural and commercial links obtaining between the two regions.  I ask the Minister of State why was that fact not taken into account by the Brussels bureaucrats and her Government?</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach to instruct our European Union Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, to take immediate steps and use his influence with his European counterparts to redress this decision immediately and have the south-western region and south Wales included for INTERREG funding.  I would go further and call on the Taoiseach to lobby the leaders of the EU member states to have this joint submission of the south-western region and south Wales accepted for INTERREG funding.  I need not remind the House that the south-western region is a disadvantaged area with direct links with south Wales.  Why did they lack the punch to push it through?  I urge the Minister to act before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As is his habit, Deputy Sheehan has said it all so I rise merely to support the sentiments he expressed.  A successful INTERREG programme would have produced very beneficial results for the south-western region of our country and also for south Wales with which we have very strong links.  I am disappointed that progress has not been made in the matter.  I wonder whether this arose through failure at Government level to impress on our European Union colleagues the importance of this programme to the respective regions, or does the fault lie elsewhere.  I should like to know from the Minister of State whether <Col N="272" /> the position can be rectified even at this eleventh hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the eloquence with which Deputy Sheehan put his case.  As somebody with family links in west Cork I understand the importance of the point he made.</P>
      <P>We put the proposal to the European Union very strongly.  I travelled to Wales to meet Sir Wyn Roberts, the Secretary of State for Wales, again to put the case, when there was a joint agreed position between the Irish and British Governments on this.  INTERREG is a Community initiative under European Union Structural Funds with the objective of promoting cross-border co-operation and supporting the economic development of border areas.  During the last Structural Fund round there was a joint Ireland-Northern Ireland programme under INTERREG.  The eligible areas comprised the counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo in the south and all of Northern Ireland except Belfast.  All of the border areas in the Community covered by the first INTERREG initiative were land border areas with the exceptions of Kent-Nordpas de Calais and Corsica/Sardinia.</P>
      <P>In June 1993, the European Commission published a consultative document on Community initiatives in the new Structural Fund round covering the period 1994-99.  In that document the Commission said that it would prefer to maintain the general rule that maritime borders do not qualify, while being prepared to examine specific cases, especially where this would be of benefit to Objective I regions, to determine whether genuine cross-border co-operation possibilities exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward its views on the consultative document, the Government said that access to the Community through the east and south-west coast and UK posts was of vital strategic imporance to Ireland and that a maritime INTERREG programme for Ireland and the UK was considered essential to eliminate infrastructural bottlenecks.  As <Col N="273" /> Deputy Sheehan has rightly said, we are the only island nation in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government also submitted that within the context of such a programme other co-operative measures could also be covered.  In February 1994 the Commission produced its proposals for Community initiatives to cover the period of 1994-99.  In the case of INTERREG, it proposed that in addition to the maritime border areas covered under the previous initiative &mdash; only two in the whole European Union &mdash; the borders between southern Italy and Greece and between Ireland and north Wales should also be eligible.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines for the new INTERREG initiative included &mdash; as well as the North-South border area as before &mdash; Gwynedd in Wales and the east region in Ireland.  The Commission has been using the old planning regions for the purposes of defining NUTS III level regions, so east in that context covers Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. This area corresponds with the Dublin and mid-east regions for the new regional authorities which were established earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals have now been considered by the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, and the management committee on Community initiatives comprising representatives of the member states. Having completed this consultation process the Commission will now formally adopt the final guidelines for initiatives. It is understood that they hope to do this in late June or early July.</P>
    <P>During the course of the consideration of the draft guidelines, the Irish authorities made strong representations to the Commission, at both ministerial and official level, for the inclusion of both the south-east sub-region and Dyfed in Wales, in order to provide coverage for the Southern Corridor, and the south-west, comprising Cork and Kerry, which has established and developed cross-border links with the county of west Glamorgan and the city of Swansea over a long period.  A number of other member <Col N="274" /> states also wanted additional areas added throughout the process, the Commission has tried to restrict the number of internal maritime borders which would be included.  Eventually the Commission agreed to the inclusion of the south-east sub-region along with Gwynedd in Wales.  Unfortunately, it would not agree to the inclusion of the south-west. This is a disappointing result but I think I can say with fairness that everything possible was done to press the case.  We went from one to two regions and we could not push the Commission the extra mile to create three regions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the draft guidelines on the new INTERREG Community initiative provides that in exceptional cases, and in the context of cross-border co-operation programmes, Community assistance may be given to measures in NUTS III areas located outside but adjoining the eligible areas provided they involve a high degree of cross-border co-operation and form only a limited proportion of the total expenditure.  The Government will be examining the possibilities under this provision to provide support for suitable projects in the south-west sub-region.  It must, however, be recognised that the scope available under this provision is considerably less than that which would be provided by full eligibility under the initiative.  Unfortunately, to answer Deputy Bradford's question, it looks as if we are at the end of the road.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Extradition Irish-German Arrangements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Adjournment Debate arises out of growing concern that the extradition arrangements between <Col N="275" /> Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany are in a state of failure and that no extraditions have occurred despite numerous requests by the federal authorities in Germany for extraditions from Ireland to Germany.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the European Convention on Extradition.  It is a sad fact that notwithstanding our adherence of that convention we have not succeeded in delivering to Germany people who could, practically speaking, be extradited to Germany under existing arrangements. It is noteworthy that the German constitution prevents the extradition of German nationals to any other country in the EU.  It is equally noteworthy &mdash; though it is infrequently publicised &mdash; that Ireland's extradition arrangements prohibit the extradition of Irish nationals to most of the civil law jurisdictions in Europe, including Germany.  Whereas on the German side there is a constitutional ban, in Ireland there is effectively a legislative ban on the extradition of Irish nationals to Germany.  Maybe that is unfortunate but that is how things are.  I am not here to complain about the state of affairs but about the state of affairs which exists in relation to fugitive German nationals coming to Ireland and not being amenable to West German law.</P>
      <P>In the post-Maastricht situation we have created a common travel area in Europe in which all European member state nationals are considered to be citizens of the European Union.  In that context, and given that freedom of mobility, it is essential that member states co-operate with each other fully in the extradition of nationals who are fugitives from the domestic system of justice.  Just as it would be unacceptable if an Irish person who was wanted for a very serious crime took a plane to Frankfurt and effectively became non-amenable to Irish law, equally it is unacceptable that German nationals who come to this country should be non-amenable to extradition to face justice in their own country in respect of offences alleged to have been committed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The German Government on a number <Col N="276" /> of occasions has made requests to the Irish Government for the extradition of German nationals to Germany and it has had an appallingly high failure rate. That state of affairs is unacceptable. Clearly people who are engaged in drug dealing, theft or financial misdemeanours of various kinds, should be amenable to German law and we should not allow Ireland to become, in the public perception in Germany, a safe haven for people who have offended against German law and who are not extradited.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs stated recently that our poor protection of investors in Ireland might make this country an apparent haven for fraudulent investment companies.  He made the point that if in that context a documentary was to be screened on German television pointing out how easy it is to avoid financial investment laws in Germany by coming to Ireland and operating from here, there could be a major scandal that could do grave damage to this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to fugitive offenders, Ireland has not been extraditing West German nationals to Germany.  The German Government is so concerned about this that in 1992 at a meeting in Bonn, which Irish officials attended, an undertaking was given to the German Government that a set of guidelines would be provided to it.  In that context they would be guided by the Irish Government in the ways in which it was possible to make effective requests for extradition to the Irish State.  Over two years later those guidelines have not yet been furnished to the German Government.  That is a serious matter because it is causing concern in Germany that fugitive offenders are coming to this jurisdiction and are, effectively, immune from extradition because of procedural hiccups.  On one occasion the West German Government sought the extradition of an Irish national and it was not even told, in the first instance, it was wasting its time, that because the person was an Irish national she could not be extradited to Germany. On the contrary it was told there were documentary and evidential problems <Col N="277" /> with its request for extradition. There is a need for transparency and candour between the Irish and German Governments and a new spirit of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Immense damage will be done to this country if this State does not operate whatever extradition arrangements we have in a co-operative, positive and friendly way with the German state. Great damage will be done to Irish-German relations if successive requests for extradition are turned down on procedural and evidential grounds for want of establishing a proper routine and creating a set of circumstances in which the Germans can put reasonable requests for extradition before the Government and have those requests dealt with in an expeditious manner.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the deep-seated unhappiness in Germany with the present arrangements.  I ask the Minister of State, first, to give this House an undertaking that the promise given in Bonn, which was the subject of a press release at the time, that guidelines would be furnished to the Germans to enable them operate Irish extradition law, will be complied with immediately and that the German Government will not be fobbed off with any further excuses about delays in this matter.  Second, in so far as extradition arrangements between Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany relate to fugitive offenders from either jurisdiction to the other, German nationals to Ireland in particular, the Government should make every effort to ensure that nobody who comes to this country, whether charged with drug dealing offences or otherwise, will find himself or herself in a position where they can hide behind a situation where the two Governments cannot co-operate fully to secure proper and effective extradition between two supposedly friendly member states of the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions were held in early 1992 between Irish and German officials to see what improvements <Col N="278" /> could be made in the arrangements for extradition between our two countries. The discussions were initiated by the Irish side as we wished to make sure that any difficulties that might arise in extradition cases, because of the fundamentally different legal systems in the two states, should be minimised and, if possible, avoided altogether.  The Irish chairman of the group was an officer of the Attorney General's office as what was at issue in the discussions was the requirement of Irish law and the conduct of extradition proceedings in court, matters for which the Attorney General has responsibility.  These matters were explained in detail to the German authorities in the course of a two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>The Irish side offered to supplement this information with a paper setting out guidelines.  The German side undertook that it would follow this up with a paper on its requirements.  In the meantime, detailed guidelines have been provided in any specific case where this has been necessary.  This has, in fact, arisen in only one case during this period, which was last January.</P>
      <P>Our authorities are not aware that the fact that definitive guidelines have not yet been finalised has hindered extradition applications between the two countries. The German authorities are aware, as was made clear at the meeting, that the Irish authorities are pleased to advise on any issue of form or substance on which the German authorities are in doubt when preparing an extradition request. Judicial co-operation between Ireland and Germany is, I am informed, excellent.</P>
      <P>I have taken careful note of what the Deputy has said; I could not anticipate what he would say.  He has put certain questions to the Minister who, unfortunately, is away this week.  I will convey what he has said to both the Minister and the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and to articulate the anger felt by fans who have been left stranded in the United States.  These fans, 400 in number, most of whom are from the Cork area, have been saving for the past few months to attend the games in which Ireland is participating. They booked holidays in the United States with a United Kingdom company, Sportex, through various travel agents in Cork.  They had to endure considerable delays at Gatwick initially and later discovered that their accommodation and ticket arrangements, for the Ireland-Italy match in particular, had gone awry.  This should not have happened. Local travel agents in Cork should have made sure, given that they were dealing with a foreign company, Sportex in this instance, that these fans would not have their arrangements upset for this major international event during which Ireland was given a huge boost at the Ireland-Italy match last Saturday night.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to intervene immediately on behalf of these soccer supporters who have been abandoned by the company concerned in the United States and who are not sure what arrangements are being made on their behalf.  These supporters, mainly from the Cork area, have had a sad experience.  It is disgraceful that they missed the Ireland-Italy match and have had their holiday spoilt due to the incompetence of the United Kingdom travel company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that local travel agents in Cork will not share the responsibility for this fiasco.  They should be more selective in dealing with foreign travel companies, especially when one considers <Col N="280" /> the huge sacrifices made over a long period by these soccer fans to fulfil their lifetime ambition of seeing Ireland play in the World Cup.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the Minister will be able to give a full and frank explanation to the many young people who have had this awful experience and to give some indication to the House of the alternative arrangements which have been made to facilitate these fans.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for sharing his time with me.  I empathise with all those who have been victims in this appalling situation and will try to articulate their sense of grievance and anxiety, which is also felt by their families at home in Cork and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have been led to believe by some of the travel agents in Cork to whom I spoke this morning that accommodation arrangements have now been made.  It was pointed out, tongue in cheek, that funding was being made available by the British travel company to purchase tickets. I ask the Minister to indicate if, at this late stage, arrangements can be made, in consultation with the FAI and the authorities in the United States to purchase tickets for the remaining games.  I ask her to exert as much pressure as possible and consult with the FAI to secure these tickets for the supporters who are the victims.  I hold no brief for the travel company in Britain or local travel agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs who manned offices on Friday evening and all day Saturday. They were most helpful and co-operative in dealing with me and the many people who were making inquiries on behalf of family members.  I also pay tribute to the staff of the consulate in America, Mr. Shane O'Riordan in particular. The message has been conveyed to me by the families concerned that the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish consulate were absolutely superb in trying to assist those <Col N="281" /> who have been caught in this terrible situation and who have been let down. In the context of a wonderful celebration of Irish talent and sport and in the spirit of the occasion the World Cup represents for us, we should do everything possible to resolve the disaster which has befallen those supporters and secure tickets for them for the remaining games.  That would go some way to redress their disappointment and sense of disillusionment. Some of them have been saving and looking forward to this occasion for many years and to be treated in such a shabby manner is nothing short of reprehensible.  There must be some degree of responsibility on the Irish Travel Agents' Association to ensure that foreign travel agents dealing with Irish people are a member of the governing authorities in their jurisdictions and that they fulfil obligations in respect of bonding and so on.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should investigate this matter to ensure we do not have a repeat of this episode.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the fans who saved for this occasion and whose joy at Ireland's wonderful performance against Italy resulted in distress because of their failure to get tickets for that match and the difficulties surrounding their accommodation and travel.  This raises the question of ethics in business for people who sell a package which is alleged to include match tickets but does not.  There are many questions to be answered in this regard.  I am responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain that the Act which governs the operations of tour operators and travel agents selling holidays out of Ireland is the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act provides, among other things, for the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators; and a backup <Col N="282" /> travellers' protection fund raised by contributions from tour operators on a basis determined by the Minister.  The Act applies to overseas travel contracts concluded between intending travellers and travel agents and tour operators.</P>
    <P>A body which wishes to act as a tour operator or a travel agent in Ireland selling overseas travel from Ireland must apply to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for a licence.  Among the requirements which must be satisfied prior to granting a licence is that a tour operator and a travel agent are required to furnish a bond equivalent to between 10 per cent and 4 per cent of their respective annual licensable turnover.  The bond provides that, where a travel agent or a tour operator is not in a position to meet its financial or contractual obligations in relation to overseas travel contracts, a sum of money will become available to the Minister to be applied for settling customers' claims. The moneys may be applied, <i>inter alia,</i> to provide travel facilities for any customer who is outside Ireland and unable to make the return journey as a result of the agent or operator in question being unable to meet its contractual obligations. The travellers' protection fund is available only to meet any shortfall where the amount of a bond is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Having said that, holidaymakers are free, at their own discretion, to purchase holidays from tour operators based outside Ireland who are not licensed or bonded in this country.  The Department has always strongly advised Irish travel agents that it would be in their best interests before making a booking with a foreign tour operator on behalf of a client to make inquiries as to the protection available in the event of a collapse and to advise the client fully of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of Irish supporters who purchased holiday packages to the World Cup with a British tour operator has experienced problems since their arrival in the US.  I stress that <Col N="283" /> the tour operator in question does not hold a licence under the 1982 Act in Ireland, or is not required to do so, and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has no function or responsibility in relation to that operator or any liabilities which that operator may incur.  While this is the formal legal position, my Department has been in touch with a number of bodies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, with a view to seeing what can be done to alleviate the situation.  I understand that Department has been in contact, through the Embassy in London and officials in the US, with the tour operator in question and with service providers in the US in an effort to use its best endeavours to ensure that persons who had booked holidays with the operator will receive their holiday in full.  These contacts are ongoing.  The staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been pulling out all the stops with a view to doing something for those disappointed fans.</P>
    <P>I should stress that my understanding of the position is that the problems experienced relate to the provision of accommodation and match tickets as contracted for.  I am delighted to hear from Deputy Martin that the matter of accommodation has been sorted out.  In so far as the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Department of Foreign Affairs have been able to establish, the question of people being abandoned at airports in the US does not arise as it is understood the airlines in question have been paid and all persons hold return journey tickets.  It is despicable that a travel agent should sell a package with tickets if it is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="284" /> Fitzgerald, for coming into the House to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>The Killinarden area has approximately 2,000 local authority houses and has been established for approximately 20 years.  The area has experienced many difficulties because of unemployment, lack of opportunity and so on, but its people are resilient, they have overcome difficulties in the past and I am sure will do so in the future.</P>
      <P>The Killinarden pre-school playgroup was established 17 years ago by Sr. Bernardine and has flourished.  There are currently 50 children attending the pre-school playgroup with a frequent waiting list of up to 40.  The playgroup is operated by four women from the Killinarden area who, between them, have more than 15 years' practical experience of running such a facility.  They were trained by the excellent organisation, the Irish Pre-school Playgroup Association, and a number of them have been involved with Barnardos.  These women have considerable experience in this area.  They have had to equip the pre-school playgroup through fundraising and they provide a high standard of equipment and services.  They have received only minimum support from the local authority, approximately £300 in the past number of years.  The fact that local women are involved in the playgroup is an advantage because they are familiar with the families sending children to it.  In that regard they could be more helpful than people from outside the area who, through no fault of their own, might not be as intimately involved with families in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately these women now find that their project is at risk.  While I welcome the decision by the Minister for Education to establish eight pre-school pilot projects, nevertheless, the net effect in the Killinarden area is that those four women will have to abandon their classroom because it is the only one available in the area for the pilot project.  While they welcome the pilot project, because of their commitment and experience, <Col N="285" /> those women regret they were not considered as part of it.  The pilot project will be based in west Tallaght and cater for approximately 60 young persons.  Consequently, the need for the pre-school play group in the Killinarden area will continue, but the difficulty for these four women is that the children will probably gravitate towards the pilot project because the funding is substantial.  The Minister for Education is providing two specially trained teachers, two child care assistants and substantial grant aid amounting to £4,500 to equip the classroom and £1,500 for parental development associated with the facility.</P>
    <P>Although the project is welcome, I appeal to the Minister of State to use her good offices to try to achieve flexibility. Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to give a direction that where a pilot project is established it should not impinge on an existing facility and certainly should not sweep it away.  A mechanism should be found to fully involve the four women operating the pre-school play group in the Killinarden area in the pilot project &mdash; the same thing might be done in other areas.  That would solve the problem I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flood for bringing this to my attention and providing more information than was available in the file of the Minister for Education.  The point he makes about the classroom being swept away is well made and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>As the person who proposed the original play group grants scheme by Dublin County Council in 1979 I have a strong personal interest in this area and I very much appreciate the work being done for the community by this play group.  The new scheme is not intended to displace existing facilities but to add to the opportunities available in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education recently announced the establishment of a pilot pre-school project in eight designated <Col N="286" /> areas of disadvantage.  The establishment of this project is viewed by the Minister as an innovative and long awaited development in our educational system, allowing it to respond to the educational needs of our community.  The primary objectives of the pre-schools are to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development and prevent school failure, offset the effects of disadvantage and develop parent potential and community involvement.</P>
    <P>All pre-schools in the project will be closely linked with the national school in each designated area.  The project is due to commence in September next and the eight pre-schools in the pilot project will cater for 60 pupils aged between three and four years.  Each pre-school will be staffed by two qualified primary teachers and two qualified child care assistants.</P>
    <P>The areas chosen for the pilot pre-school project are Churchfield-Knocknaheeney-Farranree in Cork; Southill-Galvone in Limerick; north Clondalkin; south Finglas; Bonnybrook-Darndale-Cromcastle; west Tallaght; Ballybrack-Mountown and Cherry Orchard-Ballyfermot in Dublin.  Decisions on the selection of locations for inclusion in the pilot pre-school project were taken after detailed consideration of needs across the disadvantaged areas.  In this process it was decided that the pilot phase would concentrate on areas of greatest disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In the case of each area chosen the intention is that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment areas of the school to which the project is attached.  The Minister is anxious that the projects being established will not interfere with existing pre-schools which she sees as continuing to serve their existing catchment areas.  The pilot pre-schools should complement the existing playschools and are not designed to compete with or take from existing services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the existing services for children in this age <Col N="287" /> group have a more social and child care orientation.  Their activities place an emphasis on child care and play rather than on education.  The pre-schools established in the pilot project will have precise curricular objectives and parents will be encouraged to participate in the activities under the direction of the school personnel.  It will be a much more school-focused project than the community play group in place at the moment but there is room for both models.</P>
    <P>As indicated in her recent announcement on the pre-school project, the Minister has arranged to have the operation <Col N="288" /> of the scheme evaluated throughout the coming year by the Education Research Centre.  She will be monitoring this process very closely to ensure that any problems, such as those to which the Deputy refers, are fully addressed.</P>
    <P>I will take the Deputy's point in relation to the classroom back to the Minister.  Generally the provision of prefabricated accommodation can be facilitated by the Department of Education so that both pre-schools could operate in the area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 June 1994.</P>

      <P>State aid is provided to supplement, and not to substitute for, spending from local authorities' own resources on the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  This aid is allocated by way of discretionary grants and, for the first time in 1994, under a new scheme of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement works.</P>
      <P>In the case of Roscommon, the discretionary grant allocations to the council amount to £2.674 million in 1994.  In addition, under the scheme of specific improvement grants, allocations totalling £1.382 million have been notified to the council.  The total State grant allocations to the council for non-national roads in 1994 are, accordingly, £4.056 million which is an increase of £950,000 on the grants paid in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the State aid available in 1994 for non-national roads was allocated in the form of discretionary grants to county councils for improvement and maintenance works.  The normal discretionary grants (excluding supplementary improvement grants and pilot schemes grants) were allocated <i>pro rata,</i> on the basis of road mileage, except in the case of County Dublin which received a supplement to take account of <Col N="75" /> heavier traffic volumes.  In the case of County Roscommon, a supplementary improvement grant of £200,000 was also allocated, over and above the normal discretionary grants.</P>
    <P>The allocation of EU co-financed grants for specific improvement projects was based on proposals submitted by the individual local authorities.  The projects submitted by local authorities were evaluated and prioritised on a merit basis in accordance with EU criteria.  Grant allocations under this heading to individual authorities will be liable to significant change from year to year, depending on the level of commitments on ongoing approved schemes, and the merits of new proposals.</P>
    <P>In 1994, State road grants for non-national roads totalling £106.4 million were allocated to local authorities.  I am satisfied that all the authorities, including Roscommon County Council received their proper share of these significant State funds.  I might point out in this connection that total grants for County Roscommon have increased by over 30 per cent in 1994 alone, and by 80 per cent since 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 16, 20, 21, 33, 36, 46 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is an independent statutory body which has been given overall responsibility, under the Roads Act, 1993, for ensuring the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  Section 19 of the Act spells out the functions of the Authority in relation to the planning and implementation of roadworks, and gives the Authority <Col N="77" /> sole responsibility for the allocation of grants for individual projects.</P>
    <P>My powers under the Roads Act are limited to certain broad policy, financial, and quasi-judicial functions such as the approval of motorway schemes, the payment of block grants to the Authority and the issue of directions and guidelines. I have no function in relation to the day-to-day administration and management of the work programme on national roads or in relation to the allocation of funds for individual projects.  Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that I am not in a position to provide specific information in relation to individual national roads projects.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme on Transport, which was prepared in consultation with the National Roads Authority, will be published as soon as possible after its approval by the European Commission.  While the Programme will not list every individual national road improvement project which will be commenced between now and 1999, it is my intention that it will contain an indicative list of the major projects to be commenced and/or completed during the period.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the needs and concerns of Deputies who may wish to have more detailed information in relation to progress on particular projects.  I propose, therefore, to initiate early discussions with the Chairman of the National Roads Authority with a view to putting in place arrangements which will enable Deputies to obtain relevant information conveniently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to national roads was clearly set out in the National Development Plan.  I elaborated on particular aspects of the Authority's functions when I spoke to its first meeting on 19 January last, which was the only occasion on which I have met the Authority to date.  A copy of that speech has already been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I formally consulted the Authority on the national roads aspects of the draft Operational Programme on Transport, prior to its submission to the EU Commission, and on <Col N="78" /> my review of the classification of national roads.  In addition, there is ongoing liaison and regular contact between officials of my Department and the Authority.</P>
    <P>The provision for State grants to the Authority in 1994 totals £196.4 million; of this amount, £1.6 million is in respect of the administration and general expenses of the Authority, with the balance intended to meet the cost of improvement and maintenance works on national roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1992, I made regulations authorising the Garda Commissioner to grant 50 new licences for wheelchair accessible <Col N="80" /> taxis in the Dublin taximeter area on a pilot basis.  In addition to these special licences, I understand that approximately 30 additional taxi licence holders in the Dublin taximeter area have provided wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>
    <P>The operation of the service has been kept under review and views have been sought from organisations representing the interests of people who use wheelchairs. While the reaction to the new service in Dublin has been very favourable, I am aware of its limitations, in terms of the number of vehicles available. I accept that there is a demand for the extension of the service and for the introduction of wheelchair accessible taxis in Cork and in other taximeter areas.</P>
    <P>Regulations to introduce fundamental changes in the system governing the licensing of taxis and hackneys are being finalised at present, in consultation with the other Departments concerned, and I intend that these regulations will be made in the near future.  The regulations will include provisions to facilitate the extension of the service in Dublin and the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis in areas outside of Dublin.</P>

As far as I am aware, no such plan is under preparation for the inner Galway Bay area.  However, extensive research relevant to the water quality management of this area has been carried out in the past and is also contained in the preliminary report and environmental impact statement carried out for the Galway main drainage scheme.</P>

      <P>As previously indicated in the reply to Questions Nos. 67, 132, 135 and 156 of 9 February 1994, a number of important legal, financial and policy issues relating to the sale of local authority flats are being examined in my Department.  It is now clear that these issues present considerable difficulties in terms of devising workable and legally sustainable sale arrangements that would be acceptable to tenant purchasers and local authorities in the long run.  I am endeavouring to complete the examination of the matter as quickly as possible so that decisions can be taken and announced.</P>

Copies of the order &mdash; the Local Government Act, 1991 (Reserved Functions) Order, 1993 &mdash; and of the report were supplied to local authorities; the order was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the report was placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>, <i>(Wexford)</i>: The Environment Council of 8/9 June 1994 considered a favourable resolution of the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste; this included 19 amendments to the Common Position adopted by Council in December, 1993. The Common Position, as amended by Parliament, was generally acceptable to the Council and the European Commission, with the exception of one amendment proposed in respect of economic instruments.  A proposal in relation to this amendment was put forward by the Commission as a necessary legal/drafting amendment and provided a satisfactory basis for resolving the concerns <Col N="93" /> of most member states, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>Council consideration of this issue did not however arrive at a conclusion in support of the Common Position as amended by the Parliament and it was agreed to continue efforts within COREPER to bring about a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The proposed Directive in its present form results from lengthy consideration of the complex issues involved by the Environment Council and the European Parliament, and reflects the present balance of political views within the Union on the regulation of packaging waste. It has been designed to deal with the different situations in member states and the need to avoid creating barriers to trade or distortions to competition.</P>

      <P>The Cairo Conference on Population and Development follows on two previous conferences on population (Bucharest, 1974 and Mexico, 1984) and comes at a time when the links between demographic factors and sustainable development are now accepted by all developed and developing countries with many of the latter adopting population programmes which include family planning components.</P>
      <P>The Conference has been organised under UN auspices and will provide an opportunity for the international community to consider the broad issues of human population growth and distribution and their implications for economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Three preparatory conferences have been held before Cairo.  The last one in New York in April this year drew up a draft Final Document setting out a comprehensive Programme of Action for adoption in Cairo.  The draft on which final negotiations will be held in Cairo is extensive and reflects the broad mandate which the UN General Assembly gave to the Conference.  This recognises the growing awareness that population change, poverty, inequality, patterns of consumption and threats to the environment are so closely interconnected that none of them can profitably be considered in isolation.</P>

      <P>In the light of these discussions both Governments have agreed to keep the situation regarding road closures under close review, taking fully into account the wider social and economic factors as well as the security considerations involved.

    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> Among the recommendations of the Review Team was that the Development Education Support centre, (DESC) and the National Development Education Grants Committee should be abolished and a new National Committee for Development Education should be set up in their place.  It has therefore been decided that DESC should cease functioning as of 30 June 1994.</P>
    <P>Details of the Review Team's recommendations have been communicated to the main organisations involved in Development Education in Ireland and their response has been very positive. I am satisfied that this new committee, which will have a strong regional representation among its membership will have an important input into Development Education throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>While the Limerick office of DESC is to close, I would be very concerned that the momentum and resources built up in the field of Development Education in the Limerick region should not be lost. Officials in my Department have met with interested groups from the region and I understand that a proposal for a grant towards maintaining the resource centre will be submitted to the new committee once it has been established.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reimburse a person (details supplied) in Dublin 24 the moneys due to her from the period 27 January 1994, to 20 April 1994, at a rate of £74.10 per week, giving a total of £889.20 of which £820.80 was deducted as the amount paid already during that period, which this person denies was ever paid to her; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a lone parent's allowance on 26 January 1994.  Following an examination of her case it was decided that she is entitled to lone parent's allowance at the maximum weekly rate of £74.10, which includes an increase in respect of her dependent child.  The allowance was awarded with effect from 27 January 1994, the first pay-date following receipt of her application.</P>
      <P>Social welfare regulations provide that an applicant who satisfies the qualifying conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit and lone parent's allowance simultaneously is entitled to receive half the personal rate of unemployment benefit together with the full rate lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>During the period 27 January 1994 to 20 April 1994, the person concerned received full-rate unemployment benefit of £820.80 (personal rate of £55.60 plus £12.80 dependent child allowance per week for 12 weeks).  As she was concurrently entitled to a lone parent's allowance, she was only entitled to half of the personal rate of unemployment benefit, amounting to £333.60 (£27.80 per week for 12 weeks), during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In calculating the nett amount of arrears of lone parent's allowance due to the person concerned, my Department deducted the full amount of the unemployment benefit plus dependent child allowance paid to her, rather than half of the personal-rate benefit less the child dependent allowance in error.  Accordingly, <Col N="100" /> arrears of only £68.40 was issued to her when the appropriate amount should have been £402.00 (lone parent's allowance of £889.20 less half-rate unemployment benefit and dependent child allowance of £487.20).  Arrangements have been made to issue the balance of arrears of £333.60 to the person concerned immediately.</P>

At an inspection carried out by an officer from my Department on 14 October 1992, the herdowner stated that he had sold four of the animals and he refused to present the remaining 17 animals.  Therefore, the person named failed to satisfy my Department that all the animals in question were as declared and in his ownership and possession.

Payment of extensification premium is ongoing.  If he is eligible payment will issue in due course.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for EC suckler cow premium on 7 July 1992 in respect of 16 cows.  At inspection on 9 October 1992 he presented 16 cows, five of which had mart stickers on their backs.  On the same date, the person named had a TB test carried out on his herd and the five cows with stickers on their backs were not listed as being present for that test.  At another TB test on 15 May 1992, four of the animals listed on his suckler cow application as cows in July 1992 were described as heifers and one further animal listed as a cow by him was described as a female calf on this TB test. The person named was deemed to have made a false declaration by applying for premium in respect of cows which were not in his herd on date of application and also by applying for premium in respect of four heifers and one calf which contravened the terms and conditions of the suckler cow scheme.  As a result he was ineligible to participate in the 1992 and 1993 suckler cow schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The number of hip replacement operations carried out in the Western Health Board in 1992 was 133, and in 1993 228 which included 85 extra operations under the waiting list initiative 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to patients from Mayo, there were 39 hip replacement operations carried out in the 12 month period prior to the end of May 1994.  This compares with a figure of 72 for the year ended May 1992 and with a figure of 45 for the year ended May 1993.  There are currently 49 patients on the hip replacement <Col N="130" /> waiting list from County Mayo, which compares with a figure of 14 for the year ended June 1993.</P>
    <P>The numbers treated in any period will of necessity be related to the numbers referred for treatment from the Mayo area.  As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions on such operations are based on clinical judgment in relation to the patient's condition rather than their geographic address.</P>
    <P>There are two theatres used for hip replacement operations at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  While there are no unused theatre facilities at the Hospital, there is capacity to increase the throughput of patients.  The Deputy will be aware that I allocated an additional £400,000 in 1994 for the development of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park and my Department is in discussion with the Western Health Board, at present, in relation to the appointment of additional consultant and support staff.  These discussions will be concluded in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I announced yesterday an allocation of £850,000 for the Western Health Board as part of the 1994 waiting list initiative. The board will carry out 109 additional orthodontic procedures in 1994 of which 44 will be hip and knee replacements.</P>

      <P>In considering appropriate educational provision for children with autism it is necessary to take account of factors such as the severity of the autistic symptoms and the level of intelligence and of language development.  No one type of educational provision will meet the needs of all children with autism. There is a continuum of special educational needs which is best served by a corresponding range of educational provisions. Accordingly, some needs may be catered for in the ordinary school, while more acute needs can best be met in a more specialised setting.</P>

    <P>Depending on individual circumstances, educational provision can be made in any one of the following: (a) An ordinary national school with the support of a remedial or resource teacher.  (b) A special class in an ordinary national school.  (c) A special school for mentally handicapped children.  (d) A special <Col N="133" /> school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>

    <P>All pre-schools in the project will be closely linked with a national school in each designated area and the project is due to commence in September next.  The eight pre-schools in the pilot project will each cater for 60 pupils aged between three and four years.  Each pre-school centre will be staffed by two qualified primary teachers and two qualified child-care assistants.</P>
    <P>When consideration was being given to the selection of centres for this pilot pre-school project, it was decided that the pilot phase would concentrate on large urban areas of greatest disadvantage. It was not possible to include the Convent of Mercy, Ballina, County Mayo in the pilot project at this time.

      <P>I have received the correspondence to which the Deputy refers and I have noted the concerns expressed by the management of the school in question.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the selection of locations for inclusion in the pilot pre-school project were taken after detailed consideration of needs across the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In the case of each area chosen, the intention is that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment area of the school to which the project is being attached.  Indeed, I would be most anxious that the projects now being established should not in any way interfere with existing pre-schools which I would see as continuing to serve their existing catchment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my recent announcement on the pre-school projects, I have <Col N="145" /> arranged to have the operation of the scheme evaluated throughout the coming year by the Educational Research Centre.  I will be monitoring this process very closely to ensure that any problems, such as those to which the Deputy refers, will be fully addressed.</P>
