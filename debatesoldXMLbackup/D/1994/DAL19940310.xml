      <P>Before Proceeding further I feel sure Members will wish to join with me in extending a most sincere and warm welcome to the parliamentary delegation from Denmark, led by the President of the Folketing, Mr. Henning Rasmussen.  We hope their visit to Ireland will be most happy and memorable and we bid them a most hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9, 10, 3 and 12.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) No. 9 shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 10 shall be brought to a conclusion <Col N="534" /> within one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes; (ii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called on to make a speech in reply not less than five minutes before the debate is due to conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to that but before we decide on the final allocation of time will the Taoiseach agree to take a joint motion in the House &mdash; which I hope will be signed by all parties &mdash; condemning the reckless IRA attach yesterday on an international airport which put the lives of thousands of all nationalities at risk and damaged the reputation of many Irish people, including Members of this House?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the House should be seen to condemn this appalling act by this organisation which seems to work outside the pale of all morality?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to deny the Deputy the right to say these things but I would prefer if these matters were dealt with in a more formal manner. I had not completed the Order of Business and I would have expected that then it could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no hesitation in making a short period of time available for the condemnation of any act of international terrorism such as the attack that took place at Heathrow Airport yesterday evening but I suggest to Deputy Bruton, and the other party leaders, that the Whips discuss the matter this morning.  We do not need much time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am sure the House will agree we were constrained in giving notice of our intention to raise this matter by the fact that <Col N="535" /> the IRA give little or no notice to the people they want to kill.  We must adapt ourselves to this appalling reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton and the Taoiseach.  I do not think the IRA would receive any support in this House for what they sought to do; one is frightened to think of what might have happened.  As Deputy De Rossa suggested yesterday, what we need is a wider debate on Northern Ireland.  It is time the Government moved forward with the constitutional process because while there is a vacuum groups such as the IRA who are intent on continuing the violence are given succour.</P>

      <P>It may be that the Taoiseach did not expect that he would have to deal with this issue this morning but I find it odd that he couched his condemnation in the context of international terrorism; what we should be conemning specifically is IRA terrorism, a specific vicious atack.</P>

In the light of what happened yesterday we do not wish to find ourselves in a situation where the people who perpetrated the Heathrow Airport incident could seek refuge here.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 18 February 1994.</P>
      <P>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was one of the principal products of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which took place in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  The Taoiseach signed the Convention at the conference on behalf of Ireland.  The formal purpose of today's debate is to comply with Article 29 of the Constitution which requires Dáil approval to international conventions which involve a charge on public funds; this approval will allow us to poceed to early ratification of this important global Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues facing the world today.  Growing scientific evidence and concern about the effects of climate change has led to a corresponding political momentum for measures to <Col N="540" /> abate this problem; this process has now been focused in the Climate Change Convention.</P>
    <P>So-called greenhouse gases occur naturally in the earth's atmosphere.  Water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and nitrous oxide trap heat in much the same way as do the glass panes of a greenhouse.  This natural greenhouse effect makes it possible for people to live on earth.</P>
    <P>Human activities, however, are adding to the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere and thus increasing the tendency to trap energy.  Man-made carbon dioxide, which is the most important contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect, comes mainly from the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.  Carbon dioxide is also released by the destruction of forests and other natural sinks that absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC &mdash; a scientifically based body under UN auspices &mdash; produced a First Assessment Report in 1990.  Its major conclusions were that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased substantially as a result of human activity; this is expected to enhance the natural greenhouse effect, which keeps the earth warmer than it would otherwise be; without actions to restrain emissions, an increase in global average temperatures of around 0.3º per decade is likely in the future.  This could imply a sea level rise of around six centimetres per decade.</P>
    <P>These findings were confirmed in the panel's 1992 supplementary report.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the main provisions of the convention which recognises that climate is a &ldquo;common concern of human kind&rdquo; and its ultimate objective is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere &ldquo;to protect the climate system for present and future generations&rdquo;.  All parties are required to undertake certain general commitments, including preparing national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, and adopting national programmes for mitigating climate change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> The convention requires parties who are developed countries to undertake further specific commitments.  These involve adopting national policies to limit man-made emissions of greenhouse gases and to protect and enhance greenhouse gas sinks.  The convention sets an indicative target for developed countries of returning to earlier levels of emissions by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>However, the convention acknowledges that, within developed countries, there will be differences in starting points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases.  The need for equitable and appropriate contributions within the efforts of developed country parties is also recognised.</P>
    <P>Explicit provision is made in the convention to enable regional, economic organisations, such as the European Union, to fulfil jointly the commitments of their member states.</P>
    <P>The European Union is responsible for some 15 per cent of the world's energy related CO2 emissions, compared to 23 per cent for the US and 11 per cent for China.  The Dublin Declaration on the Environment of June 1990 noted the special responsibility of the European Union and its member states to encourage and participate in international action to combat global environmental problems.  The EU has, accordingly, established a commitment to stabilising man made CO2 emissions in the Union as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000; the convention has also been recently ratified on the EU's behalf.</P>
    <P>European Union policy also recognises, however, that member states whose economic development is incomplete will need targets and measures in the context of CO2 abatement policy to accommodate their necessary economic growth.  It is accepted on this basis that some increase in CO2 emissions will be necessary in the four cohesion member states in the period to the year 2000 and that overall European Union stabilisation of emissions must be achieved on the basis of equitable burden sharing between certain member states.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's strategy <Col N="542" /> for achieving the stabilisation target envisages the following three elements: first, national programmes which will be monitored by the Commission within a formal monitoring mechanism; second, specific measures including research and development, energy efficiency and conservation programmes and third, fiscal measures.</P>
    <P>Ireland and other member states have already submitted their national programmes to the Commission.  Agreement has also been reached at Union level on energy efficiency measures in the context of the SAVE programme and on the promotion of alternative energy sources under the ALTENER programme. The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, in co-operation with other agencies, is developing action at national level under both programmes.</P>
    <P>The third element of the Commission's strategy, the carbon-energy tax proposal, is still being negotiated.  The proposal is a complex one and presents difficulties of different kinds for many member states. For Ireland, the Government has made it clear that we do not oppose the principle of a carbon-energy tax provided that the following concerns are met: that the tax is modulated for the cohesion states; that satisfactory provision is made regarding the impact of the tax on the peat sector; that an effective conditionality clause is inserted so as to maintain the competitiveness of EU industry generally; and that effective provision is made to maintain the competitiveness of energy intensive firms facing competition from those not subject to similar charges.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national CO2 abatement strategy was published by the Department of the Environment in June 1993.  The strategy, which was agreed between a number of Government Departments, sets out a programme of measures in the areas of energy conservation, fuel use, transport, waste management and afforestation. The strategy also describes the constraints affecting the Irish situation; the need, on regional policy grounds, for continued economic expansion; structural factors such as our reliance on peat, <Col N="543" /> which is a high carbon fuel, for about 15 per cent of our energy needs; Ireland's already high use of low carbon natural gas, and the absence of a nuclear energy option.  All these factors limit Ireland's ability to reduce CO2 emissions.</P>
    <P>The national strategy is based on the objective of limiting CO2 emissions to 10.7 million tones of carbon by the year 2000; this would represent an increase of 20 per cent over the 1990 level.  This is the lowest projected increase among cohesion member states.  The strategy also provides for a strong contribution from increased afforestation which provides a natural sink for carbon dioxide. Taking this increased sink capacity into account, the net national increase in emissions will be 11 per cent.  While the strategy is mainly concerned with CO2 emissions, provision is also made in relation to methane emissions &mdash; another greenhouse gas &mdash; from landfill sites.  Work is under way on the preparation of a national inventory of greenhouse gases apart from CO2.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined in the strategy are designed to limit the levels of carbon in the atmosphere and to improve the energy efficiency of our economy.  They include: an active demand side management policy by ESB to limit the growth in demand for electricity; improved insulation standards incorporated in the 1991 building regulations for new buildings; intensified promotion of energy conservation under the SAVE programme and otherwise; fuel switching &mdash; beneficial for CO2 reduction &mdash; will be promoted by the continued extension of natural gas network; in the transport sector, the principal objective is to improve public transport and reduce traffic congestion in Dublin; the Programme for Government gives a commitment to increase afforestation up to the year 2000.  This will provide a substantial counterbalance to the expected increase in carbon emissions over the same period.</P>
    <P>The strategy is well balanced and comprehensive, and will achieve its objectives. Public awareness of environmental <Col N="544" /> matters are increased significantly in recent years with the acceptance of the principle of shared responsibility for our environment.  We will all benefit environmentally and economically from the measures in the national CO2 abatement strategy.  Increased energy efficiency is ultimately in everyone's interests.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for a mechanism to provide financial resources on a grant or concessional basis to developing countries.  The global environment facility, or GEF as it is known, has been entrusted, on an interim basis, with the operation of this financial mechanism.</P>
    <P>The global environment facility was established in late 1990 as a three-year pilot programme to provide grants to developing countries for projects aimed at protecting the global environment in ways that are consistent with their national development goals.  Negotiations on the establishment of the GEF on a permanent basis are due to be finalised in Geneva next week.  Ireland will be represented at that meeting.</P>
    <P>Final agreement has not been reached on the level of funding to be provided for the financial mechanism.  This means that the costs associated with the convention can only be estimated tentatively at this stage.  It is expected that the cost in the initial years will be around £250,000 a year.  This amount will form part of Ireland's contribution to the global environment facility.</P>
    <P>The motion comes before this House because of the requirements of Article 29, sub-article 5.2 of the Constitution, under which the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Increases in global warming and the potential climatic changes that could follow are important global problems which require the maximum international co-operation and action if they are to be tackled effectively.  Fine Gael fully supports the ratification of the UN Framework Convention on Climate <Col N="545" /> Change and will support policies and measures designed to limit man-made emissions of greenhouse gases and protect and improve forests and oceans that act as sinks and reservoirs for greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The man-made changes in the earth's atmosphere are without precedent in recorded history.  There is, therefore, good reason to believe the global warming may already be implicated in climatic changes.  The six warmest years on record have occurred in the last 12.  Increased droughts have led to severe famine in many parts of Africa and hurricanes have left thousands homeless in the Caribbean and South America.  Freak summer rainfall has caused flooding of the Mississippi River basin.  Although those facts do not constitute scientific proof, scientists warn that we can assume for practical purposes that global warming is to blame.  To choose to ignore the warning of the scientists is wilfully to gamble with the environmental security of future generations.</P>
      <P>Human activities are releasing substantial quantities of gases, including carbon dioxide, that increase the natural greenhouse effect in the earth's atmosphere.  Under the UN Charter countries have a right to exploit their natural resources, but they also have a responsibility to ensure that activities under their control do not cause damage to the environment beyond their boundaries. The global nature of climate change requires the widest possible co-operation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.  The ultimate goal of this convention is to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at levels that will not dangerously upset the global climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions continue to come from developed countries.  It is vital that those countries take the lead in combating climate change and its adverse effects.  It is also important that they assist developing countries in dealing with the requirements of the convention by providing <Col N="546" /> money and technological assistance.  That is the key to the success of conventions such as this.  Developing countries who are trying to increase their GNP do not enjoy the same standards of living as western countries.  Anyone who visits such countries will be aware that their standards are far behind those of western Europe in particular, even though those standards are not sufficient.  It would be unrealistic to expect developing countries to achieve or contribute towards the attainment of the targets set out in this convention without proper assistance from the western world, which I am glad to note is provided for under the convention. I welcome the fact that while we have financial problems we are making a reasonable contribution, in the region of £250,000 per annum.  We would be fooling ourselves as a world population if we ignored the problems which developing countries will face in trying to reach the standards sought under this convention.</P>
    <P>The European Union is committed to stabilising carbon dioxide emissions in the Union at the 1990 level by the year 2000.  That is a step in the right direction, but the real target should be to reduce significantly CO2 emissions by the year 2005.  The European Union should adopt a strategy for CO2 abatement by introducing research and development programmes and technical measures which encourage energy efficiency and fuel switching.  Fiscal measures, in particular a carbon energy tax, should be introduced and the revenue raised should be recycled into abatement programmes.  In other words, we should implement self-financing programmes throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>While we have set ourselves targets here, we could take a lead in this regard. We could assist our economic development by ensuring that we are a prime example of what can be done to protect the environment.  Ireland should aim to reach the European Union 2005 target of a 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions. It is possible to achieve such a target by implementing a more aggressive energy conservation and efficiency programme, the development of a renewable energy sector and the continued expansion of <Col N="547" /> our forestry programmes.  We need to invest in an expanded public transport system, particularly in our cities, but we should not ignore rural areas.  This would encourage more people to migrate to the cities thus causing greater environmental problems.  We should review the tax on new private cars which makes it less attractive for people to change their car on a frequent basis.  Older cars contribute to the level of carbon and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  If we are serious about resolving these problems we must give good example and reorganise our tax system to encourage people to change their vehicles on a regular basis.  That would be a practical way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>We should introduce stiffer building regulations to match the most stringent international insulation standards and provide grants for low interest loans for fitting existing housing stock with draught-proofing and insulation.  Many people need assistance to carry out this work.  We should implement educational and vocational programmes on energy efficiency particularly for architects, builders and property owners.  People should be made aware of the benefits which derive from energy efficiency. Energy labelling should be mandatory on all appliances in easily understood technical language.  Very often the language used is not clear to ordinary people.  We should encourage industry to become more energy efficient by switching from less friendly environmental fuels to natural gas.</P>
    <P>The awareness and concern expressed by our younger generation for the protection of the environment must not go unnoticed.  I commend young people for their awareness of matters my generation did not fully appereciate.  It is time we recognised the great benefit we can derive from the attention paid by our younger generation to the protection of the environment.  Time is not on our side.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the proposal before the House to ratify the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and express the wish that Ireland plays a full role in meeting its commitments under the Convention, that we participate fully in its subsidiary bodies and in time seriously set about implementing its recommendations and those that evolve from it and from discussions of subsidiary bodies established under it.</P>
      <P>Many commentators were sceptical about the ability of the United Nations Rio Conference on Environment and Development to agree a common and effective worldwide policy capable of protecting the climate system for present and future generations.  The Convention arose from the conference and it is the world's first collective move to deal with the enormous threat to our ecosystem because of our ignorance for so long of the long term effects of greenhouse gases on the earth's atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention recognises that climate change is a common concern of humankind and its objective is to develop a global strategy to protect the climate system for present and future generations. As its title indicates, the Convention is no more than a framework and the commitment of 150 signatory countries is to mainly putting in place regular monitoring of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases.  They are also committed to formulating, implementing, publishing and regularly updating national programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol and measures to facilitate adequate adaption to climate change.  Although the <Col N="549" /> framework set out in the Convention is comprehensive and should prove valuable as a major contribution to lessening the damage to the world's climate from CO2 emissions in particular, it is most disappointing that the world's leading developed countries among the 150 signatories of the Convention did not make a more specific and effective commitment than merely setting as an objective &ldquo;the return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In view of the serious threat to mankind from the continued negligent discharge of vast quantities of CO2 into the world's atmosphere, it was particularly disappointing that one of the worst offenders, the United States of America, did not see fit to give the lead by the introduction of specific stringent national requirements for CO2 emissions.  It seems petrol guzzling Americans could not be asked by their President in an election year, to adjust their lifestyles by adopting cleaner technologies and energy efficiency to reduce their normal CO2 emissions.  The Rio Convention could have set its signatories more stringent requirements if the Americans had the courage to give the world a lead in this issue.  Regrettably, it chose not to do so.</P>
    <P>We can take some satisfaction from the European Union's stand.  It set its member states a strict commitment to stabilise Union emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  I wish to refer to the publication last June of a strategy for the abatement of CO2 emissions in Ireland by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The introduction to that report states: the United Nations framework convention on climate change was signed in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 by the European Community and its member states, including Ireland.  The Convention envisages:</P>
    <P>concerted international action to mitigage Climate Change.  The Dublin Declaration on the Environment adopted <Col N="550" /> during Ireland's EC Presidency in 1990 mooted the special responsibility the Community and its Member States had to encourage and participate in international action to combat global environmental problems.  As evidence of this intent, a joint Council of Community Environment and Energy Ministers in Luxembourg in October 1990 declared the EC's near-term objective as stabilisation of CO2 emissions in general by the year 2000 at 1990 levels within the Community as a whole... Ireland's CO2 abatement strategy will accommodate necessary economic growth over the period of the Strategy and facilitate economic and social cohesion within the community in addition to contributing to stabilisation of the Community's CO2 emissions. The measures detailed in the strategy-limit as far as possible the growth in Ireland's CO2 emissions in the period to the year 2000.  Stabilisation of emissions in this time-frame is not however feasible in Ireland's circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is very significant policy statement by the Coalition Government and I do not believe it is generally known that the Government is reneging on the fine principles outlined by the previous Government in the Dublin declaration on the environment adopted during Ireland's EC Presidency in 1990.  According to the Minister's strategy, the objective here is to increase CO2 emissions by 20 per cent on the 1990 figures by the year 2000 and to ignore the commitment by all member states at the joint council in October 1990.  However, the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Forecasts, based on technical assumptions linking historical growth with energy requirements, together with assumptions about the fuel mix, would point to an increase in CO2 emissions in the year 2000 of over 20 per cent.  Having regard to the accepted developments of the Irish economy and the constraints which surround Energy Policy Options, realisation of the objective of confining growth to 20 per cent will require <Col N="551" /> major effort by all concerned &mdash; policy makers, energy utilities and above all users of energy.  The Minister stated that not alone will we not achieve the EC objective of 1990 emission levels but that his objective is to show an increase of 20 per cent on the 1990 levels and he is not convinced he can achieve that level.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give more details of major efforts to date to meet his limited half-hearted objectives of an increase of 20 per cent or more on the 1990 figure which is not in line with the European Union objective to reduce emissions to the 1990 figure or to achieve the limited objectives set out in the convention.</P>
    <P>When one examines Appendix 2 of the Minister's strategy one can see the main emitters of CO2 in each sector of our economy.  Coal and oil are the main sources through their extensive use in the generation of electricity and in the transport business.  Our use of coal is 20 times higher than the EC average despite the fact that we do not have indigenous coal resources.  Nearly two-thirds of all coal imported is used for the generation of electricity.  If we are serious about reducing CO2 emissions and achieving our European Union commitments to reduce them to 1990 levels we must now seriously examine whether we should convert our major coal-burning power station at Moneypoint to gas.  The comparative costs should be examined, published and debated.  Political choices must be made.  With our EU partners, we have adopted the principle that the polluter pays.  It will soon become clear that this can become quite painful and present major economic problems in the future.</P>
    <P>Nearly all our European Union partners have the benefit of CO2 free nuclear energy to generate electricity but we rightly rejected that opinion because of the enormous safety problems.  On the other hand, we decided to retain the peat option which gives us little choice but to carefully examine our continued use of oil and coal in our electricity generating plans for the future.  Our use of oil has <Col N="552" /> been greatly reduced to something over 300,000 million tonnes.  It would be appropriate to cease using oil for electricity generating purposes and, if necessary, not use stations that cannot easily be converted to gas.  Our continued use of vast quantities of coal indefinitely must be carefully examined, sooner rather than later.  We must act responsibly to protect the earth's environment for future generations and it is clear from the Minister's projections that we cannot meet our international commitments to reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 unless some major decisions are made about fuel consumption policy.</P>
    <P>How long more can we continue to use coal as a major electricity fuel?  Energy conservation, and the development of new energy sources, are important subjects. Conservation activity has waned in recent years in response to lower energy prices, but it should be put at the top of every country's economic agenda because of growing international concern about the environment.</P>
    <P>In the case of new and renewable energy the economics of what are essentially new technology items have been seriously undermined by reduced energy prices worldwide.  There are two clean energy options in particular which Ireland will have to devote much more resources to developing wind power and hydropower.  Wind energy potential in Ireland is significant.  This has been proven by the outstanding success of the Belacorrick Windfarm which has been operating very successfully in Mayo since late 1992.  The potential for hydroelectric schemes is very extensive.  The ESB and An Foras Forbartha were involved in surveying more than 3,500 sites and produced a report on that matter.  There is potential for hydroelectric schemes.  It is clear that energy efficiency is not being adequately tackled here.  We should seriously consider the energy tax option, but it must be considered on a United Nations or worldwide basis because of the economic disadvantage faced by countries who proceed in that direction.</P>
    <P>I regret my time is running out but I <Col N="553" /> wish to stress that change is already taking place in the climate here, with disastrous consequences.  I have reports of a geological survey on flooding in south Galway which shows the exceptionally high rainfalls in that region in 1990 and 1991.  At present 10,000 acres are under water due to the exceptional high rainfall in the past two months.  Climate change has occurred and we are witnessing the bad effects.  The Government will have to consider ways of alleviating this problem and show some compassion for those who are suffering due to the great change in climate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Green Party has to say on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change dovetails very well with my contribution last night on the National Development Plan.  Predictably, the traditional Left-Right parties expended most of their energies quibbling about who said what on Structural Funds from the EU.  The analogy of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic comes to mind when that debate is compared with the implications of this Convention.</P>
      <P>There is an element among the scientific community of doctors differing while patients die in terms of climate change. My former colleagues in Dublin County Council, now Fingal County Council, highlighted this feature when the council was offered low lying land, which is liable to flooding, to be used as a car park.  The response from the management of Dublin County Council was that nothing is proven, despite the fact that the water is evident.  This blind attitude is reflected in this House, as the Minister for Finance continues to say that we must put off the day of reckoning until there is some evidence of economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 200 years we have caused a 23 per cent increase in CO2 levels, bringing them to a concentration higher than any in the past 100,000 years.  We are also responsible for new man-made gases being released into the atmosphere of our 4,500 million year old planet.  One of these gases is Krypton 85, the main gas discharged from THORP, which brings <Col N="554" /> to mind our inaction on that issue.  By the year 2030 we will have caused global temperatures to be higher than they have been for the past two million years, higher than those in which 70 per cent of our existing species, including ourselves, have evolved.  Various scientific reports have outlined the dangers of greenhouse gases.  The response from local authorities and the Government, who ought to be more responsible, is to say that more research, a balanced approach and realistic measures are needed, but they fail to take decisive action.</P>
    <P>Prior to the signing of this Convention at Rio de Janeiro, the intergovernmental panel on climate change reported that a 60 to 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases is necessary to stabilise the world's climate.  Ireland uses 18 per cent more energy in terms of economic productivity than the EU average.  We have very little to be proud of and a considerable amount of which to be ashamed.  We are miserly in our provisions for energy conservation, almost dismissing it as a fringe activity.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil our example has been disgraceful. During the summer the floorboards of this Chamber were ripped up in an extravagant attempt to fit an air conditioning system to replace the fans that had been working well.  That is an example of how not to tackle energy conservation. My office in Kildare House has windows which cannot open and there is a constant blast of air, sometimes cold and sometimes hot, but always draughty. We should certainly get our own house in order in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have done very little in terms of renewable energy and we have provided very little in the form of resources.  Can we afford not to conserve energy?  The greenhouse effects are manifold, the lesser of which is the soil effect.  Professor Gundolf Kohlmaier of Frankfurt University stated that a 2 per cent increase in temperature would increase the amount of carbon released by the soil by 224 billion tonnes to 383 billion tonnes. At present we burn five billion tonnes of fossil fuel.  Professor Kohlmaier said that the response of vegetation and soil in <Col N="555" /> combination could introduce unexpected feedbacks that are not currently included in the models of climate.  We have not even begun to consider these effects.</P>
    <P>Another greenhouse effect is the water effect.  As we know, CO2 is soluble in water.  Professor Peter Liss from the University of East Anglia has pointed out that during glacier times the oceans held much more CO2 than at present.  The release of carbon from fossil fuel burning amounts to five billion tonnes, two billion of which goes into the ocean, two billion into the atmosphere and one billion elsewhere &mdash; it is not fully understood where it all goes.  Plankton, which absorbs much of that two billion tonnes, is slowing down its absorption as temperatures increase.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the North Pole has decreased by one third during the last ten years.  In 1976 ice thickness in Greenland was six or seven metres while in 1987, nine years later, it was four or five metres.  As ice absorbs CO2 the effects of the changes in global climate in this area will be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>Ireland has very little to be proud of in terms of the United Nations framework convention.  Our CO2 abatement policy, as the Minister calls it, is very misleading to say the least.  Instead of decreasing CO2 emissions, we are giving the impression that we are doing something about this problem and at the same time giving excuses as to why emissions should be increased.  The EU agreed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Spain said it could not possibly achieve this target as it was a poor country.  Like sheep, we decided to follow Spain and seek an exemption.  Britain was not prepared to watch Ireland and Spain get away with murder and it also decided to seek an exemption.  The agreement is now effectively in tatters.  We have wrecked the international consensus on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government fails to understand that instead of inhibiting growth, reducing CO2 emissions redirects growth and makes for growth in areas which are more labour intensive. The ESRI has said that <Col N="556" /> an energy tax would be of great benefit in terms of employment if it was applied unilaterally.  Such a tax would give local economies much more independence.  By increasing our CO2 emissions we are setting a very bad example to poorer countries.</P>
    <P>We accept that we will have to reduce the level of CO2 emissions after the year 2000 but by that stage we will have become more dependent on fossil fuels. The 1990 Department of the Environment report on climate change seemed to suggest that climate change would be good for Ireland.  However, it failed to discuss wind speeds, storms and the effects of wind on crops, forests, fishing fleets, coastal defences &mdash; an enormous headache for local authorities &mdash; and buildings in general.  We are talking as if these issues do not matter.  Reference is made in the report to horticulture.  The people of North Dublin know all about the effects of storms on horticulture.  I do not think the Minister will be taking his responsibilities seriously if he allows CO2 emissions to increase at a time when farmers are going to the wall, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to give a lead in creating a model economy based on low fossil fuel usage.  This will be of benefit in terms of the climate, will lead to more employment, reduce international competition and lead to more fully developed communities.</P>

    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the need to stabilise CO2 emissions and quoted the CO2 abatement strategy.  EU policy proposes a stabilisation of CO2 emissions by the year 2000.  However, it also recognises <Col N="557" /> that countries such as Ireland whose economic development is incomplete need time to achieve this target.  Under EU policy the four cohesion countries are permitted to increase CO2 emissions. The increase proposed for Ireland is the lowest of the four cohesion countries. We favour certain energy constraints, for example, we deliberately do not have nuclear power.  Last week in the House the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications explained the Government's policy on THORP.  It has to be accepted that we must use a variety of fuels for security of supply reasons. Usage of natural gas is very high while peat is an important indigenous fuel.  We must also use a certain amount of coal in the foreseeable future.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Deputy Barrett stressed the importance of developing countries making a contribution to improving the global environment.  It is expected that agreement will be reached in Geneva next week on the establishment of the global environment facility.  Ireland will participate in the GEF and our contribution under the climate change and bio-diversity conventions will be paid through this facility. Reference has been made to a contribution of £250,000, which is reasonable for a country of this size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to appropriate forms of renewable energy. Deputy Molloy referred to wind energy. The ESB has been requested, in consultation with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, to prepare a competition to contract for supplies of up to an additional 75MW of installed capacity from alternative sources by the year 1997.  It is expected that further development of wind energy will be a significant part of this initiative. Such a development will be encouraged by the success of the Belacorrick wind <Col N="558" /> project in County Mayo where 21 turbines with a combined capacity of 6.45MW were installed in late 1992.  This project, which has exceeded expectations, produced 15.6 million units of electricity in its first year of operation.</P>
    <P>The location of new projects will be a matter for individual developers.  It is proposed to monitor the performance of successful projects with a view to developing future strategy in this important area.  Last week Deputy Sargent informed me of a number of projects and possible developers of wind energy. In my county some developers have encountered objections from local communities. This problem has to be tackled.  Developers are looking at the potential of various areas for the development of wind energy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the need to proceed with the vehicle testing scheme.  This area is expected to have a major environmental benefit with the maintenance of engines, etc. in good running order.  Transport is also a significant source of CO2 emissions.

    <P>The 1994 Bill is a major reforming measure which is intended to provide a modern framework for the solicitors' profession.  Many former Ministers undertook to introduce legislation amending the Solicitors Acts but I am pleased to have the opportunity of bringing this legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced against a background where there has been persistent public concern about the way in which complaints concerning solicitors are dealt with by the Incorporated Law Society and about the difficulties in obtaining redress against solicitors for negligence, shoddy work and over-charging. The Bill meets the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to provide greater protection for clients of solicitors.  It also takes account of a number of recommendations made by the former Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>The aims of the Bill are to ensure that clients of solicitors are better protected by the law in their dealings with solicitors, that the profession maintains the highest standards of conduct and a rigorous disciplinary system and that training and educational arrangements for solicitors are updated and improved.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Bill proposes a wide-ranging reform of the law relating to solicitors which involves almost every aspect of the regulatory framework of the profession. One of the major areas of reform is based on the recognition of the rights of the consumer of legal services provided by solicitors.  The uppermost concern in framing these measures is to ensure that consumers of legal services are fully protected by law in their dealings with solicitors.</P>
    <P>The concept of consumers' rights was not generally recognised in legislation when the earlier Solicitors Acts were framed.  There is today, however, a substantial body of consumer law and I want to ensure that the legislation which forms the basis for the regulation of the solicitors' <Col N="561" /> profession reflects that positive development.</P>
    <P>There are several measures in this Bill to protect the consumer.  Solicitors' clients will have a right of redress where a solicitor provides inadequate services or where charges for services are excessive. There will be new requirements to ensure that solicitors are fully insured against damages awarded to clients arising from negligence on the part of solicitors. The powers of the Incorporated Law Society and the High Court to intervene in the practice of a solicitor in the interests of clients are also being increased.  Clients will be entitled to clear information about the cost of a solicitor's services while undesirable charging practices are being prohibited.  Criminal offences and tough penalties are provided where solicitors breach new tighter controls on handling clients' funds.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant provisions is setting up a scheme for the investigation of complaints by an independent adjudicator about the Incorporated Law Society's handling of complaints about solicitors.</P>
    <P>Part V contains major reforms reflecting the need to update and streamline the training and educational provisions of the existing legislation.  The Bill comprehensively amends the society's functions in this area.</P>
    <P>I now propose to turn to some of the more significant proposals for reform in these main areas.  I want to deal first with those measures designed to strengthen the protection for members of the public who engage the services of solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society will have new powers under section 8 to impose sanctions on solicitors who are found to have provided inadequate or shoddy services.  The society will be empowered to limit the costs which a solicitor may recover from a client or require a solicitor to refund costs paid by a client and to rectify any error at the solicitor's expense arising from the inadequate services.  Section 9 will empower the society to order solicitors, who are found to have charged excessive fees, to <Col N="562" /> refund fees paid by their clients or to waive the right to recover costs.</P>
    <P>These sections will provided a speedy and inexpensive remedy for many complaints against solicitors without affecting a client's right to seek redress through the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 10 empowers the society to require a solicitor to produce any document relating to a complaint made against him or her which the society is investigating.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the exercise of the new powers being conferred on the society by sections 8, 9 and 10 should be capable of being appealed to protect the legal rights of solicitors and section 11 gives solicitors that right.  Under section 12 the society will have new powers to enable it recover from a solicitor some of the costs &mdash; up to £1,000 &mdash; that it may incur in investigating complaints made under sections 8 or 9.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide for further stronger measures to improve public confidence in the manner in which complaints about solicitors are handled.  This is in response to public concern about the lack of an effective and transparent system for dealing with complaints against solicitors and, in particular, the absence of any public involvement in the process.  To address this, section 15 of the Bill provides for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to investigate complaints about the society's handling of complaints against solicitors.  The adjudicator will have wide powers, including the power to fully reinvestigate the original complaint made to the society about a solicitor, if the adjudicator is dissatisfied with the society's investigation of any complaint made to it.</P>
    <P>The consent of the Minister for Justice will be required for the appointment of the adjudicator who, it is specifically provided, will be independent in carrying out his or her functions.  It is also provided that the adjudicator must not be a practising solicitor, a member of the society or practising barrister.  The adjudicator will be required to report to <Col N="563" /> the Minister and these reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I know the society is not opposed to the appointment of an independent adjudicator.  It is, however, opposed to funding the scheme but the introduction of an adjudicator is necessary because of the failure of the solicitors' profession to live up to its responsibilities of self-regulation. The system for disciplining solicitors no longer commands complete public confidence.  While I expect the cost of funding this new complaints scheme will be modest, it is wholly inappropriate to impose on the taxpayer for this purpose. I feel strongly that the profession should bear the cost involved and this is provided for in section 15.</P>
    <P>A further measure intended to improve public confidence in the profession's disciplinary system is contained in section 16 which provides for the appointment, for the first time, of up to five lay members nominated by the Minister to the Disciplinary Committee of the High Court, to represent the interests of the general public.  This committee, which from now on will be known as the Disciplinary Tribunal, is appointed by the President of the High Court and is responsible for conducting inquiries into allegations against solicitors of misconduct.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 the disciplinary tribunal will be empowered to impose limited penalties where it finds that a solicitor has been guilty of misconduct. These new powers, recommended by the Fair Trade Commission, will enable the tribunal to dispose of some less serious cases of misconduct, without involving High Court proceedings which are necessary under the present legislation.  I referred earlier to the Supreme Court decision in the &ldquo;Solicitors Act&rdquo; case that powers conferred on the Incorporated Law Society by the 1954 Act were unconstitutional. I am advised that the new powers now being conferred on the disciplinary tribunal under section 17 will not breach the constitutional requirements laid down in that case.</P>
    <P>Section 18 extends the existing powers <Col N="564" /> of the High Court to impose penalties on solicitors where the disciplinary tribunal report a finding of misconduct against a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 22, the Incorporated Law Society will be required to publish information annually on complaints received about solicitors and the outcome of investigations by the disciplinary tribunal of complaints alleging misconduct.  I hope that making this information generally available will help to improve the public perception of the manner in which the society handle complaints.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 further restrict the employment of persons who have been struck off the roll of solicitors.</P>
    <P>There have been instances in the past where funds were not available to meet the cost of damages awarded to clients arising from negligence on the part of their solicitors.  Section 26 deals with such cases by enabling the Incorporated Law Society to require all solicitors to be covered by indemnity insurance against losses arising from civil liability claims. While I am aware that the vast majority of practising solicitors are covered by professional indemnity insurance, this provision constitutes an important additional safeguard.  Practising solicitors also will be required under section 54 to satisfy the Incorporated Law Society that they are complying with the indemnity insurance requirements before practising certificates are issued to them.  The Incorporated Law Society has assured me that it will introduce the necessary arrangements under section 26 as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At present, the Incorporated Law Society can intervene in a solicitor's practice where a solicitor has been guilty of dishonesty.  Experience has shown that considerably wider grounds for intervention are desirable to protect the interests of clients.  Accordingly, under the provisions of sections 31 and 32 the Incorporated Law Society will be empowered to intervene in the practice of a sole practitioner who has died or who is incapable of managing his or her affairs through illness or because of an <Col N="565" /> accident or who is adjudicated a bankrupt or who abandons the practice.  In such circumstances, the society will be empowered to take whatever action it deems necessary in the interests of the clients.  Where the conduct of such solicitor is likely to give rise to the payment of grants out of the compensation fund, the High Court may authorise the society to sell that solicitor's practice under the provisions of section 33.</P>
    <P>Section 28 extends the society's powers to apply to the High Court for an order to freeze bank accounts where it believes that a solicitor has been guilty of dishonesty. It also gives the society a new power to apply for an order to freeze the assets of such solicitor.</P>
    <P>Again, to protect the public, section 37 restricts newly qualified solicitors from setting up practice, without the consent of the Incorporated Law Society, as sole practitioners, or in partnership, for a period of three years following qualification. On the face of it, this provision appears to be somewhat restrictive but clients stand to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Section 68 addresses a major concern relating to the way solicitors deal with clients.  This is the matter of solicitors and client costs.  I feel strongly that clients should be informed in advance about a solicitor's charges or likely charges for providing legal services.  At present, clients can be left in the dark about the cost of the solicitor's services.  There can be great uncertainty.  Often it is only at the conclusion of legal business that clients learn of the full liability to their solicitors.  Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that this situation needs to be changed.  I accept that the calculation of actual charges in advance in every case would not be possible particularly in contentious matters.  However, these new requirements offer a very flexible structure providing statements of charges and solicitors should have little or no difficulty complying.  Under this section at the outset solicitors will have to provide clients with particulars in writing of the actual charges or, where this is not possible, an estimate or, if neither is <Col N="566" /> possible, the basis on which they will be charged for legal services.</P>
    <P>In contentious business, such as personal injury actions, solicitors will be required also to inform clients where they will be liable to pay additional costs to the solicitor, over and above those recovered from the losing party.  Having concluded contentious business, solicitors will be required to provide clients with details of the legal services provided, damages and costs recovered and, separately, the charges for the solicitor's services.</P>
    <P>My intention here is to ensure that the client gets the maximum information possible, particularly at the outset, about the costs of a case and the costs of dealing with solicitors.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the apparently widespread practice among solicitors of deducting a substantial premium &mdash; often 10 per cent or more &mdash; from the damages awarded to their clients in personal injury cases, over and above the costs payable by the losing party.  Those costs should normally cover most if not all of the necessary costs incurred by the successful client's legal representatives.  To deal with this problem, section 68 prohibits solicitors from deducting an amount from clients' damages without the prior agreement in writing of the client, and, more importantly perhaps, it prohibits solicitors from charging costs to their clients on the basis of a percentage of any damages that may be awarded to a client.</P>
    <P>Section 76, a major provision, faces up to the difficult issue of serious dishonesty in the solicitor's profession.  It is, of course, unfortunate and regrettable that the reputation of the profession has been harmed by a small number of solicitors who have misappropriated or absconded with clients funds.  It is in the nature of the work of solicitors that they are entrusted to handle very large amounts of money belonging to their clients.  This is not, of course, any excuse for dishonesty on the part of solicitors. On the contrary, this should establish a special relationship of trust between solicitors and their clients.  In fact the law recognises that there is a fiduciary relationship between solicitor and client.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> Solicitors who misappropriate their clients money abuse this special relationship of trust.  I need hardly state that the vast majority of solicitors are hardworking and honest professionals, and that the money misappropriated by dishonest solicitors is very small in comparison with the total amount handled by the provession in their dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a problem.  I know that the society is as determined as I am to tackle this abuse.  To that end, section 76 creates criminal offences for breaches of a number of new requirements in relation to the handling by solicitors of clients' money.  Solicitors will be required to keep clients' funds in bank accounts prescribed by the society and to maintain an accurate record of transactions involving those funds.  The society will also be empowered to enforce these provisions.  Breaches of these requirements will carry a maximum fine of up to £10,000.  I am confident that rigorous enforcement of these provisions will significantly reduce acts of dishonesty by members of the profession and provide a quicker and more effective system for dealing with such cases as they arise. Above all, these provisions will act as a significant deterrent against abuse involving clients' money.</P>
    <P>Section 73 obliges the society to make regulations, with the concurrence of the High Court, requiring solicitors in general to maintain clients' money in deposit accounts or to pay clients the interest on such money.  This is an area where the Incorporated Law Society has taken action but I am convinced that it is appropriate in the public interest to make statutory provision for these matters.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 29 concerning the compensation fund will also benefit the clients of solicitors although perhaps less obviously than the provisions to which I have referred.  The fund is maintained by the Incorporated Law Society to compensate for losses arising from dishonesty on the part of solicitors. Two major changes are proposed in the provisions governing the compensation <Col N="568" /> fund.  The first concerns section 21 of the 1960 Act which provides that any person suffering loss can be compensated from the fund.  A Supreme Court decision in 1989 interpreted this as giving access to the fund to financial institutions incurring loss as a result of undertakings given by solicitors.</P>
    <P>Section 29 will limit the scope of the compensation fund to clients of solicitors only.  This is clearly right.  It was never the intention that financial institutions engaged in large financial transactions, in pursuit of their own business and relying on undertakings from solicitors should be able to claim against the compensation fund should the solicitor default in circumstances in which the financial institutions are not clients of the solicitors. Banks and other financial institutions always have relied on solicitors' undertakings for purely business reasons and without any expectation that they would be entitled to have recourse to the compensation fund.  Financial institutions are in a strong position to protect their own interests.  They should not have to rely on the fund as a form of insurance considering the resources at their disposal and the expertise available to them in deciding whether or not to accept a solicitor's undertaking.</P>
    <P>The second change affecting the compensation fund is the application of a cap or maximum grant limit of £250,000 in respect of a claim made on the fund.  I am satisfied that this limit will provide more than adequately for the vast majority of claims for compensation made against the fund.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, should a claim in excess of £250,000 arise, section 29 provides that the society may exceed the grant limit in cases of grave hardship.  This is an important additional safeguard for clients of solicitors.  I am also empowered to increase the cap of £250,000 in line with inflation.  No payment in excess of £250,000 has ever been made in respect of a claim on the fund by a non-corporate client of a solicitor.  Unlimited liability or indeed any higher statutory limit could lead to depletion of the fund.  In that scenario, the Incorporated Law Society <Col N="569" /> could experience extreme difficulty in dealing fully and effectively with all losses suffered by clients.  Clearly this would be unfair to clients.</P>
    <P>Without these amendments, there would be the continuing risk of large financial institutions lodging claims against the fund of the order of perhaps several millions of pounds.  Claims of that order would inevitably deplete the fund and it would become impossible for the Incorporated Law Society to make good losses suffered by clients of solicitors for whom the fund was designed to protect in the first place.</P>
    <P>In 1988, the Incorporated Law Society made regulations permitting solicitors to advertise their services, subject to certain general limitations, including a prohibition on specifying a fee for services.</P>
    <P>Section 69 of the Bill contains a provision that lifts this restriction.  It prevents the Incorporated Law Society from prohibiting fee advertising by solicitors for any specified legal service.  The society is opposed to this provision.  One objection is that clients are not in a position to assess in advance the quality of the service being offered and are likely to be misled if they make decisions based solely on price.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the society powers to deal with false and misleading advertising. I have more faith in consumers than perhaps the Incorporated Law Society has.  Every day consumers have to make important financial decisions for themselves in relation to services and products. Users of legal services are used to making decisions about the quality of services being offered.  Advertising by solicitors of their services has been a reality since 1988 although fee advertising continues to be prohibited by the society.  Price is clearly a key factor that consumers take into account but there are other factors such as the reputation of the supplier, dependability and quality of service.  I see price advertising as providing further vital information to consumers so that they can make the optimal choice.  I am not suggesting that it would be possible to advertise the prices of all <Col N="570" /> services provided by solicitors but there are services of a more routine and predictable nature which will be suitable for price advertising, such as conveyancing and probate services.  I am not aware that price advertising in England has had the dire consequences predicted by the society.  In fact it is understood to have resulted in substantial reductions in costs, particularly in the area of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>The society also suggests that price advertising is likely to expose the public to the risk of shoddy work from unscrupulous solicitors.  The number of unscrupulous solicitors in the country is small and I take it the society is not suggesting otherwise in its objections to this provision.  The Oireachtas has delegated to the society the responsibility to maintain a high general standard of professional conduct under the Solicitors Acts. The Bill gives the society new and additional powers to deal with shoddy or inadequate services and in general strengthens the society's regulatory control over the profession.</P>
    <P>The society will have sufficient powers to deal with false or misleading advertising and to crack down on unscrupulous solicitors who provides less than quality services to their clients and I expect the society to deal vigorously with any such cases that may arise.</P>
    <P>I now come to a number of provisions in the Bill which have been the subject of some debate outside this House.  Sections 78 to 80 would open up will-making, probate and conveyancing services to competition from other bodies.  I am a proponent of greater competitiveness in the provision of services generally as I believe that invariably the consumer stands to benefit.  This may not be the case, however, in relation to relatively specialised services such as those in question. I accept that probate, will-making and conveyancing services represent an important part of many solicitors' practices. I am considering bringing forward proposals to amend those sections on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, I would welcome the views of my colleagues in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not yet on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Solicitors Acts contain restrictions on the organisation of solicitors practices. Incorporation by solicitors, multi-disciplinary practices involving solicitors and members of other professions and multi-national practices involving Irish solicitors and lawyers from other jurisdictions are not permitted under the Solicitors Acts.  These issues are currently the subject of debate in the profession. It may well be that clients can benefit from changes in the structure of working arrangements in the profession.  It would not, I think, be prudent to statutorily preclude the possibility of future developments in these areas and, accordingly, sections 70 and 71 enable the Incorporated Law Society to bring forward regulations to provide for these new forms of working arrangements.  These regulations will require my concurrence after consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prohibiting incorporation by solicitors may be overly restrictive nowadays.  The professions in England, Wales and Scotland are no longer prohibited from engaging in such working arrangements. Similarly inter-professional marketing developments here may dictate the pace of development of multi-disciplinary practices involving solicitors.  Developments in the EU and further afield suggest that movement towards multinational practices may be inevitable. Both multi-disciplinary and multinational practices are permitted in England and Wales.  The provisions of these sections are framed so that the Minister will have sufficient powers to ensure that the interests of clients are adequately <Col N="572" /> protected, if new working arrangements are ultimately introduced.</P>
    <P>The final major area of reform is contained in Part V of the Bill providing for a number of significant changes relating to the education and training of solicitors. Legal education is a subject that both branches of the legal profession are currently debating.  At the heart of this is the issue of rationalisation of the present system, including resources and the structure of legal training.  An advisory committee on legal education and training comprised of representatives from the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar, the universities, IBEC, ICTU, the Union of Students in Ireland and the Higher Education Authority is currently considering proposals for rationalisation.  The Minister is also represented on that committee, which is chaired by the Honourable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane.  I am very anxious to see progress in this area.  Section 49 provides that the Incorporated Law Society may join with other bodies in holding examinations leading to a joint or common qualification.  This is intended to anticipate arrangements for joint vocational training and I hope will result from rationalisation of the current position.  I expect in time that suitable use will be made of these new provisions.</P>
    <P>Changes in admission requirements for intending solicitors which were introduced by the Incorporated Law Society in 1989 have resulted in a large increase in the numbers of students being admitted to the Society's Law School.  Since then law graduates no longer have to sit the society's entrance examination once they have passed examinations in certain subjects prescribed by the society as part of their degree course.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some intending solicitors seeking admission to the Society's Law School have been experiencing difficulties in obtaining apprenticeships. This is, of course, under current arrangements a prerequisite for entry to the Society's Law School and ultimately to the profession.  A number of provisions in the Bill will assist the profession in providing apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Section 47 allows a solicitor to have <Col N="573" /> two apprentices instead of one and to have an apprentice for every two assistant solicitors.  Section 42 reduces the period of apprenticeship from a maximum of five to a maximum of two years.  Section 44 reduces from seven to five years the minimum period of continuous practice required before a solicitor may take on an apprentice.  Section 53 enables the society to make regulations providing that apprenticeships may be served in Northern Ireland and England and Wales.</P>
    <P>Taken together, I am confident that these provisions will considerably ease the pressure on obtaining apprenticeships. This will enable many well-qualified graduates to get a &ldquo;foothold&rdquo; in the profession.  In particular, increasing the number of apprentices that a solicitor can have will allow a solicitor with the capacity and the work to take on extra employees.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 51 is to facilitate freer interchange between the barristers' and the solicitors' professions.  This was a course recommended by the Fair Trade Commission.  This section provides for exemptions from the society's examinations for barristers wishing to be admitted as solicitors.  It reduces from a maximum of five to a maximum of three years the period of practice at the Bar required by such solicitors.  I sincerely hope that the Bar Council can reciprocate to enable practising solicitors to move more easily into the other branch of the legal profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Part VI strengthens the control of the Incorporated Law Society over the issue of practising certificates. These controls are among a number which have been sought by the society and I am satisfied that they provide for tighter supervision in the interests of the profession and in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, section 61 extends the grounds on which a practising certificate can be refused or issued subject to conditions while section 59 empowers the society to give a direction imposing conditions <Col N="574" /> on a current practising certificate. In addition, section 58 allows the society to apply to the High Court where the society considers that there has been a serious failure on the part of a solicitor to comply with the solicitors Acts or with conditions imposed on a practising certificate. The court may suspend a solicitor's practising certificate in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, some of which I have already covered under other headings. There is just one other provision that I would like to mention at this point. From time to time in the past members of the public have experienced considerable difficulties in engaging the services of a solicitor to take an action against another solicitor.  I know that the Incorporated Law Society can, and do, make arrangements to assist persons contemplating actions against solicitors, but it is more appropriate in the public interest to ensure that adequate statutory arrangements are in place to cater for this. Accordingly, section 67 requires the society to maintain a register of solicitors who are prepared to act for any person who is unable to find a solicitor to take civil proceedings against another solicitor. This section also requires the society to take reasonable steps to assist a person to obtain the services of a solicitor for such purposes.</P>
    <P>The main challenge to be faced in framing these proposals was the need to strike a balance between protecting the public in their dealings with solicitors and providing for a regulatory framework giving the solicitors profession latitude to provide a range of high quality legal service. I am confident that this Bill will achieve these objectives.  Above all, this Bill is a blueprint for reform that caters for the needs of clients of solicitors while, at the same time, it will revitalise the profession as it faces the challenges of change.  The proposals in the Bill are consistent with the overall policy of self-regulation by the profession.  The Bill recognises that this policy of self-regulation needs to be counterbalanced and supplemented with safeguards to protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> Certainly many provisions in it call for change and innovation on the part of solicitors.  I am confident that this old and honourable profession will adopt to the changes proposed in the Bill and will continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the co-operation of successive officers of the Incorporated Law Society who were involved in long and comprehensive consultations about the Bill with my Department.  I am at one with the Incorporated Law Society on many of the proposals in the Bill although there are strong differences of view on crucial issues which I have already outlined. This is inevitable given the range and scope of the Bill and the changes it will bring to the profession.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an interesting and lively debate on the many issues that arise and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I hope it does not unduly offend the 16 lawyers, 11 solicitors and five barristers who are Members of the Dáil if I express the opinion that the legal profession has hidden behind the separation of the Judiciary from the Government and used it for their own benefit.  The continued association of judges with lawyers was addressed in the Fair Trade Commission report on the legal profession in 1990 at page 293, 16.5 as follows:</P>
      <P>At this stage, it seems appropriate that the Commission should express its surprise at the involvement of the Judiciary with the barristers profession through the institution of King's Inns. Although all judges in the Circuit and Superior Courts must have previously been practising barristers, we consider that the Judiciary and the Bar are totally separate professions.  There seems no sound reason for any aspect of the profession of barrister to be influenced by the direct participation of the Judiciary.  Barristers are subject to the authority of judges in their courts, judges can complain to the Bar Council about the behaviour of barristers, and no further involvement would appear to be warranted.  Nevertheless, 22 of the 53 Benchers of King's Inns are judicial Benchers, and there are 9 judicial Benchers and a judge of the Circuit Court among the 43 members of the Council of King's Inns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has implications for disciplining barristers and also where an individual or a company on the instruction of a solicitor appeals the level of fees charged by a <Col N="577" /> barrister to the High Court.  This happened in the first case heard by Mr. Justice Kinlen who handed down his decision on 20 October 1993.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting some of the banter exchanged by the new High Court judge and some of his learned friends as this decision on fee levels was arrived at.  In arriving at his decision Mr. Justice Kinlen quoted his colleague Mr. Justice Hamilton who handed down a decision in Kelly <i>v.</i> Breen, 1978 in which he set out the circumstances in which the court would consider the level of fees to be adequate and fair.  In a detailed nine point judgment he repeats the duties of the Taxing Master and the role of the solicitor and barrister in this regard.  He said: &ldquo;The law as it stands &mdash; and people may criticise it &mdash; is that the fees payable are those which the market will bear&rdquo;. I sincerely hope he is appointed to carry out the next review of Deputies' salaries. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>As is apparent from the table of cases set forth by the Taxing Master in his ruling on 21 May last, the fees for Senior Counsel in libel actions have dramatically increased.  They have jumped from £1,500 in 1989 to in excess of £7,000 shortly afterwards. This is clearly due to the demand on the services of expert counsel in this area.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I adopt the reasoning of the Taxing Master contained in his rulings of 18 March and 21 May 1993 and affirm his decision, without expressing any opinion as to the level of fees charged.</P>
    <P>The level of fees charged by solicitors and barristers is a source of public scandal.  I wish to relate the role of barrister and solicitor to what I think should be the role of lawyer.  I also wish to make the case for solicitors not just to have access up to the Supreme Court but to be able to sit on the Bench up to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Independent Newspapers were a party to this case but nevertheless Mr. Kerrigan makes an interesting point.  He stated: &ldquo;... Mr. Justice Kinlen, the newest appointment to the bench, cracked the odd joke and the other lawyers chuckled.  The whole thing started back in 1987 ...&rdquo;.  On Wednesday, 5 February 1992, the date before the hearing date, the named barrister and solicitor exchanged correspondence. One said to the other he wanted 7,000 guineas, that is £7,350, for each of the senior counsel as a brief fee. One also pointed out that he wanted a &ldquo;refresher&rdquo; of 3,000 guineas, that is £3,150, for each day after the first day the case was at hearing.  This in turn meant that the named junior counsel would automatically get two-thirds of the senior's fee, that is £4,900 brief fee plus £2,100 per day.  Nice money if you can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis each of the senior counsel would earn a total of £19,500, that is £7,350 brief fee plus four refreshers of £3,150 and £13,320 for the junior counsel, £4,900 brief fee, plus four refreshers of £2,100, giving an overall total of £52,320 for a five day hearing.  Who needs a lottery ticket?  The settlement which was reached without any admission of liability by the newspaper concerned was heard by the Taxing Master in the initial stages.  The case was then appealed to the High Court which felt unable to attach any legal significance to the discrepancy between the two sets of counsels' fees. The amount ultimately paid to the solicitors who originally wanted £52,320 was £19,600 on the settlement of the case and £3,500 was paid to Independent Newspapers' <Col N="579" /> counsel.  The court did not think there was anything unusual about that.  I think £19,600 is probably as much as a Senator earns over the year for traipsing up and down to meetings day in and day out.  The level of legal fees is totally unacceptable.  The State, as well as individuals, have paid through the nose and it is essential that this House tackles the problem.  Mr. Kerrigan continued:</P>
    <P>The judge considered other high counsel fees that had been found acceptable by the Taxing Master in other cases and affirmed the decision of the Taxing Master in this case ... Barristers, he said, may charge whatever the market will bear.  In a hearing that was at times light-hearted, Mr. Justice Kinlen told a story of a barrister who would look through his brief and if he didn't find a cheque he'd hand the brief back, saying, &ldquo;My instructions are incomplete&rdquo;.  The lawyers laughed.</P>
    <P>Well they might.</P>
    <P>The judge stressed that that was long ago and today barristers don't get cheques with their briefs.  There was a titter as a lawyer joked that the day that changed, &ldquo;was a sorry day, My Lord, in many respects&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason I spent time reading from this article is not to single out Mr. Justice Kinlen, as I feel certain his approach is in keeping with that of his colleagues but to question the approach of the Judiciary and whether it is consistent with the public interest and the removal of restrictive practices.  The cosy understanding between judges and barristers has gone too far and it is time to put an end to it.  This House should be critical of the Judiciary in this regard.  In the Fair Trade Commission report on the Legal Profession 1990, it is pointed out in table 4.1 on page 19 that in all 100 liability claims tried in court or settled prior to hearing by a number of major member companies of the Irish Insurance Federation in the 12 months period from 1986-87, 24.6 per cent of the awards were swallowed up in legal fees to barristers or solicitors.  Some Members may say that was a selective <Col N="580" /> survey but was repeated in the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on the Legal Profession.  The level of fees charged by some solicitors and many barristers is a public scandal.  There can be no justification for them in some cases, yet the courts, on which we ultimately depend for a decision, cannot be relied on to deal with these matters at arm's length and in a totally neutral way.  We are used to the courts being neutral and independent and the Judiciary have served this country well however, it is time that in the public interest they gave up the ultimate responsibility for deciding on levels of fees.  An independent, non-legal person should be the final arbiter &mdash; perhaps this is a role for the Director of Consumer Affairs or some such person.</P>
    <P>Lawyers tend to come from a certain background from whose ranks judges come, a select and smug group who see themselves as a special category, although most are honourable people who work with dignity.  This separateness and smugness has been underlined by one branch of the legal profession in particular, barristers.  The continued use of wigs and gowns in court cases is a contributory factor.  Pages 309, 17.47 of the Fair Trade Commission report states:</P>
    <P>While the wearing of wigs and gowns in court by barristers is a peripheral issue to our study, it is important to some people.  The Commission does not believe that the wearing of wigs, in particular, adds to the formality and the solemnity of the court, rather the reverse, and it considers wigs to be anachronistic, unnecessary and, possibly, intimidatory.  Insofar as they convey a degree of anonymity to baristers, we consider this to be contrary to our recommendations concerning a closer relationship between barrister and client.  Wigs differentiate between solicitors and barristers in court, and may, to a small degree, inhibit solicitors from representing their clients more frequently.  Since both judges and barristers wear wigs, this may convey the impression of an association <Col N="581" /> and a community of interest between the two.  We consider it would be a sensible move towards a more modern profession if barristers no longer wore wigs.</P>
    <P>I could not put the case more eloquently. I intend to introduce the following amendment on Committee Stage:</P>
    <P>Section 4: (1) All court proceedings shall be as informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice.  (2) Neither judges sitting in the courts nor barristers and solicitors appearing in such courts, shall wear wigs or gowns.  (3) The provisions of this section shall apply to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Supreme Court and all such courts and tribunals constituted under the laws of the State.</P>
    <P>Do we need two separate groups of lawyers?  Is the public interest best served by continuing the existing professions?  It continues to be a strict rule of the Bar Council that, in almost all cases, with the exception of where an opinion is sought or where professionals such as accountants are allowed access to barristers for a briefing, a barrister may not act except on the instruction of a solicitor.  Why should the Bar Council be allowed to continue this practice?  Are these not matters that should be set down by the Legislature and not by the Bar Council or any other body?  The Restrictive Practices Commission believes &ldquo;that there should be no rule limiting direct access which is collectively enforced&rdquo;.  It recommends on page 315 that &ldquo;whether a solicitor is involved or not, there should be a direct contractual relationship between the barrister and the client&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is provision for the public to make complaints and take proceedings against solicitors.  Why should barristers be free from this same remedy? It is time that the nonsensical and unnecessary differences between the two branches of the profession were eliminated and to consider the fusion of these professions into one profession of lawyer which would include training as well as practising law.  This process would be <Col N="582" /> helped by the appointment of solicitors to the Bench of every court up to the Supreme Court.  I suspect that one of the reasons wigs and gowns are retained is to continue to distinguish between barristers and solicitors and to keep the latter out of the higher courts.  If solicitors are capable of arguing their case as far as the Supreme Court, as they have been since the Courts Act, 1971, they should be allowed to sit on the Bench of the same courts.  It would expedite the fusion of the professions if the restrictive practice of access to barristers <i>via</i> solicitors was eliminated by law.</P>
    <P>Lawyers are not the only persons who should be given the right of address in the courts.  There is no reason an accountant or an associate of the Institute of Taxation, for example, should not be allowed the right of audience in tax cases on appeal from the appeals commissioners not only in the Circuit Court but in the High Court and Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It is time we considered the introduction of lay magistrates in the District Court.  Judges have never lived in inner city flat complexes, for example, where people are terrorised every day.  They are administering justice from an ill-informed point of view.  If one or two criminals or drug pushers are intimidating 300 to 400 tenants in a local authority flat complex the entire complex can quickly become run down.  This is the reality of life in the 10,000 inner city flats.</P>
    <P>Although the local authority must give many warnings before issuing an eviction notice and taking the tenant to court, judges often demand four independent witnesses before they will act.  Since tenants are being intimidated it is almost impossible to find witnesses in most cases.  As a consequence committees of local people are taking the law into their own hands.  This is a dangerous development. We should consider allowing trained local people to sit on magistrates benches and hear offences with the advice and assistance of a lawyer.  This is an innovation worth examining.</P>
    <P>I express concern at the dual role of the Law Society which is both a trade <Col N="583" /> union or association representing solicitors and a body which is being conferred with certain duties to protect the public.  There is a conflict of interest.  This worked in favour of solicitors in the past and there is no indication that there will be any change in the future so far as the Law Society is concerned although the independent adjudicator provisions, if strengthened, could be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>The role of protector of lawyer's clients should be taken from the Law Society and given to an independent body which should have the right to hear complaints about solicitors and barristers.  At least one solicitor has expressed the view in this House that the duality of roles is not in the interest of the public and is causing increasing concern within the solicitors' profession.  I will be seeking greater independence for the independent adjudicator and have serious doubts about such a person being funded entirely and directly by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>While I do not have any reservations about multi-disciplinary arrangements involving solicitors and non-solicitors, I have reservations about such an arrangement involving limited liability.  I will be seeking assurance about this provision.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about section 29 (6) under which a limit of £250,000 on a grant from the compensation fund will apply and note that section 30 does not contain a provision similar to the one contained in section 29 (7) under which the Minister will be allowed to vary the amount by regulations to take account of changes in the value of money.  Section 30 should contain a similar provision in relation to the specified amount of £1 million.  The Minister of State said that an amount in excess of £250,000 is rarely awarded to an individual &mdash; he excluded institutions &mdash; and asked what is the problem.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy who strongly supports the development of the Irish language, I see no purpose being served in compelling solicitors to pass a test in Irish.  It would be better if the Law Society maintained a roll of solicitors who are prepared to work through the first language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> We should ask ourselves why a Bill regulating the profession of solicitor which consists of 83 sections is being addressed in such detail when there are no similar regulations applying to the profession of barrister.  This is an extraordinary contradiction.  I will return to many of these points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We need to reform the Courts Bill.  In 1986 I introduced the Courts (Administration) Reform Bill, the purpose of which was to provide for the better administration and organisation of the functions of the courts.  The Bill provided for the establishment of a courts commission and for the amalgamation of the legal profession, with entry being controlled by the courts commission.  An ombudsman was to be empowered to hear complaints against all lawyers and make recommendations to the judicial members, to be known as the law commission, of the courts commission.  The law commission was to be required to establish sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary while a sub-committee of the courts commission, to be known as the long sentence review committee, was to review all long sentences of imprisonment after five years.  The courts commission was to be the rule-making body for the courts.  It was to have a role in the appointment of members of the Judiciary and developing a judicial career structure and was to provide suitable training for the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provided for the improvement of administrative arrangements by changes in the system of on-the-spot fines, requiring the court to be notified of settlements in advance of the court hearing and greater use of agreed written evidence.  The aim of the Bill was to provide, in so far as was consistent with the Constitution, for the responsibility for the administration of justice to be vested in one organisation, namely, the courts commission.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes I proposed in 1986 have been made but more are necessary. Section 1 (1) provided that a courts commission be established after the commencement of the Bill on a date to be <Col N="585" /> nominated by the Minister for Justice. Subsection (2) provided that the commission would have overall responsibility for the administration and organisation of the courts and would carry out a regular review of the need for reform in the courts.  Subsection (3) provided that the commission would be comprised of the Chief Justice; the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court; representatives of the legal professions; representatives from the legal academic field; a representative from each of the Departments of Justice, Finance and the Public Service; a Member of Dáil Éireann and a Member of Seanad Éireann, one of whom was to be chairman of the commission but neither of whom was to be a Minister or Minister of State.  Subsection (4) provided that financial responsibility and accountability for expenditure in the courts area, apart from payment of judges' salaries from the Central Fund, should be vested in a chief executive.  The commission was to report annually to the Oireachtas on its activities and make such special reports as it considered necessary.  This was a far seeing Bill and many of its proposals have come to fruition in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provided for the amalgamation of the two legal professions of solicitor and barrister into a unified legal profession.  The courts commission was to be the body responsible for controlling entry into the profession.  It was also to be responsible for setting standards for administration to professional education courses for training as lawyers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provided for a means of considering complaints against lawyers.  The ombudsman was to be empowered to hear complaints against all lawyers.  We should consider following this format. The ombudsman was to be empowered to carry out an investigation into any complaints and submit a report making such recommendations as he considered appropriate to the judicial members, to be known as the Law Commission, of the Courts Commission, not to the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of that Bill provided that <Col N="586" /> the Law Commission, that is the judicial members of the Courts Commission, were required to establish comprehensive guidelines of the sentences to be imposed in all indictable crimes.  In the normal course of events judges were to be expected to impose sentences within the guidelines established by the Law Commission and to state their reasons if they imposed sentences outside the guidelines.  The defence was to have a right of appeal against sentences above the guidelines and the prosecution the right of appeal against sentences below the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Section 5 established a Long Sentence Review Committee which is now meeting under Whitaker.  Section 6 provided that the Courts Commission was to be the body responsible for making representations to the Minister for Justice for Rules of Court.  Section 7 provided for a method of appointment to the Judiciary.  There were to be two separate methods, namely, career judges and direct appointments.  All lawyers with ten or more years experience were to be eligible for appointment to any court.  The Courts Commission was to be empowered to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice on the filling of any judicial vacancy.  The Courts Commission was to be empowered to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice on the making of recommendations for a career Judiciary.  In addition, the section provided that judges may be appointed for a fixed period of time rather than until retiring age.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provided that all appointees to judicial posts should undergo suitable training on appointment and it was to be a function of the Courts Commission to provide such training.  Section 9 provided that the Courts Commission may make recommendations to the Minister for Justice for the extension of on-the-spot fines and other minor fines.  Subsection (2) provided that in the event of non-payment of on-the-spot fines within three weeks the fine should be doubled, and if a summons is issued and there is a conviction the fine should be trebled and court costs added to the fine.  Subsection <Col N="587" /> (3) provided that the Courts Commission should make recommendations about the operation of on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provided that in civil litigation notifications of settlements must reach the courts at least three weeks before the day on which the case is scheduled for hearing.  Subsection (2) of that section provided that litigants who failed to settle prior to that deadline but who did so before the actual hearing of the action should be liable for the full court costs arising out of the delay in the settlement.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provided that in any civil proceedings a written statement by any person should, subject to specific provisions contained in the section, be admissible as evidence to like extent as oral evidence to the same effect by that person.  Subsection (2) stated the conditions under which evidence is admissible. In particular there was to be no objection from the other party.  A similar provision already exists in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>I wanted to read that onto the record because what we need is a law reform Bill, a Bill to reform both elements of the legal profession and the courts, not a solicitors Bill which, in many ways, ties down the solicitors profession, does little for the client and lets barristers off scotfree. I will return to many of these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome this Bill.  It has been commented in the media that this Bill which substantially reflects measures introduced under the 1991 Bill is Law Society-driven. Having read and considered the Bill, I see it as consumer-driven.  We should be open to full consultation with the Incorporated Law Society or the banks in order to reflect their concerns about this Bill because the measures in it will fundamentally impact on the practices of its members.  We should at all times be able to cast a cold eye on those submissions, implement those which are in the best interests of society and critically assess those other recommendations <Col N="588" /> which might be based purely on the vested interests of those professions.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to effect a major reform of the law relating to solicitors.  The legal profession has been much criticised, but politicians are equally criticised, so we have that in common.  I should say that I am not a solicitor and have never practised as a solicitor, although I did read law in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces new procedures for dealing with complaints against solicitors, an area of general concern to the public for many years.  There is an unequal relationship between a solicitor and his or her client and lay persons may find themselves intimidated by a basic lack of knowledge which they feel prevents them taking issue with their solicitor either on the conduct of proceedings or on the costs charged.  For this reason it is appropriate that we are now tilting the balance of the law in favour of the client as a consumer of the service.</P>
      <P>The Bill also increases the Law Society's powers to intervene in solicitors' practices and the High Court's supervisory functions over the profession. This is an area in which I have great interest and the proposal to amend the society's function relating to the education and training of young solicitors is very important.</P>
      <P>The genesis of this legislation was in 1984 when the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism at the time requested the Restrictive Practices Commission&mdash;ultimately the Fair Trade Commission &mdash; to undertake a wide-ranging study under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act.  This looked into certain professional bodies and analogous services.  The Minister was particularly concerned with practices which led to increased costs to consumers and which curtailed or limited employment opportunities within those professions. In the case of the legal profession the Commission considered that it would be more practical to undertake a study in a single stage rather than in several stages. A comprehensive report was ultimately published in April 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> It is regrettable that we are only dealing with those aspects that relate to the solicitors profession and it is stated in the report that the fact that we are not dealing with the Bar indicates that very little ground has been ceded on the possible fusion of the two professions.  We are here to deal with solicitors and the other element of the profession will have to be left to another day.  Perhaps it would have been better to deal with the two professions at the one time.  However, this is a comprehensive Bill and we will have enough on our plate dealing with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Central to the report of the Commission was that the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council should be requested to delete certain clauses from their rules or codes of conduct, failing which a restrictive practices order could be introduced which would make such clauses illegal.  It also provided that a legal ombudsman should have powers to prosecute solicitors on behalf of clients. An interesting recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission was that the Irish language requirement should be removed by a revocation of the Legal Practitioners Qualification Act, 1929 and that there should be a statutory obligation placed on the Bar Council to arrange representation for persons who wish to present a case through the medium of Irish.  It also recommended that there should be a direct contractual relationship between a barrister and a client whether or not a solicitor is involved.  Various other recommendations were made and only some of them are incorporated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I read the debate which took place in 1991 when there was no time limit on Deputies.  There was a lengthy debate on all aspects of the Bill and a special committee of the House debated it.  Much intellectual investment has brought us to this point and more work will have to be done on Committee Stage.  It is not possible to deal with many of the sections now but I wish to comment on several aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with disciplinary matters and will be welcomed <Col N="590" /> by the general public because it provides for the investigation of complaints about inadequate services, not only in relation to possible negligence, but also to shoddy work and complaints about clients not receiving notice of the excessive fees charged by solicitors.  Another important aspect relates to the appointment of lay members to the disciplinary tribunal and confers powers on that tribunal to summon witnesses, take evidence and impose sanctions in cases of misconduct. It also provides for the publication of information on complaints received by the Law Society.  There is a range of measures in the legislation, the main priority of which is the protection of the consumer as a client of a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Who will pay for the measures proposed in the Bill?  For example, have the costs of the proposed internal audit been assessed?  There is a danger that the costs involved in the three areas of redress, namely, complaints to the new Ombudsman, the taxing of Bills and complaints about the negligence of solicitors could turn out to be uncontrollable.  What are the Minister's views in that regard?  Is it envisaged that the Law Society will pick up the Bill or will the Government provide funding?  It is proposed that the State should take over the payment of the Ombudsman, but I would like the Minister's view in that regard.  I am sure the matter will lead to some argument.</P>
    <P>If the profession is allowed to be self-regulatory it probably should foot the bill for the protection of the client.  The Ombudsman is required to be a non-legal person, but he or she would at least have to have an understanding of legal machinery. The requirement of a non-legal background is included to ensure that the process is seen to be above reproach and squeaky clean.  In my view the person appointed should have some legal training.</P>
    <P>The lay assessor provided for the disciplinary committee will at times need to be legally advised.  It is desirable that advice sought by the lay assessor should be sought from an independent or outside source, rather than from the two professional persons on the disciplinary committee, <Col N="591" /> to ensure that he or she is not steamrolled into accepting their view.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains additional proposals for the protection of clients, including a welcome provision for compulsory indemnity cover for solicitors against civil liability claims and a new power for the Law Society to intervene in the interest of clients where a solicitor is guilty of dishonesty or a sole practitioner ceases to practice, dies or abandons his or her practice.</P>
    <P>The proposal to cap payments from the compensation fund will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.  The Minister stated that the £250,000 allocation should cover most normal claims on the compensation fund.  There is concern that if there is an unlimited draw on the fund by individuals for large amounts of money, the fund could be drained and ordinary members of the public might not have any redress.  Perhaps the allocation of £250,000 should be increased.  This element of capping refers only to allegations of theft or dishonesty by solicitors and in no way relates to ordinary negligence claims.  Section 29 proposes that the cap can be extended in certain circumstances, but the matter must be teased out further on Committee Stage. Perhaps the Law Society should also have the power to require solicitors, either generally or in individual circumstances, to produce an indemnity bond insuring against claims on the compensation fund arising from the conduct of a solicitor. The motivation behind the Law Society's request to cap this fund arises from its experience and threatened proceedings in respect of extremely large claims and because the fund is becoming unsustainable in terms of the contributions which individual solicitors have to make to it.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with educational requirements for solicitors, an area in which I am particularly interested.  It should be compulsory for all solicitors to take management practice training on a regular basis as insufficient education on how to deal properly with the management of their practice is provided for solicitors in <Col N="592" /> the prequalifying stages.  Their practice is, essentially, a business.  Many lawyers may be extremely intelligent and have published books before being accepted as apprentices in large firms, but they can be ignorant about the management of a practice and client accounts which can lead to shoddy workmanship and give rise to claims of negligence.  I accept that legal training involves many years of study; one must have a degree and then do the Law Society examination.  Nevertheless, the Law Society should introduce compulsory business management training in the prequalifying stages.  It should not be a small incidental module but comprehensive training.  It is not inconceivable that solicitors can become fully qualified with only a cursory knowledge of business matters.  That is particularly important in the management of a client's money and in the proper functioning of a credible solicitor's practice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that a solicitor may not go into sole practice until he or she is qualified for at least three years, but in my view that period should be increased.  That may sound restrictive given the length of time it takes to qualify, but many young solicitors need to be protected from their own zeal in setting up a sole practice without adequate experience or good business sense.</P>
    <P>Has the Law Society any statistics on the number of young solicitors who get into trouble when they cannot deal with their workload or find themselves bogged down in the handling of clients' money? I do not believe the profession is packed with corrupt and dishonest solicitors, but there are many incompetent solicitors who, through incompetence, become negligent and by trying to cover up that negligence, turn to dishonesty and fraud. There is a human aspect to that problem which could be resolved if solicitors, in the course of their prequalifying training, were adequately grounded in business systems.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains miscellaneous provisions, including the computerisation of the roll of solicitors, a requirement on the Law Society to maintain a register of solicitors who are prepared to act for <Col N="593" /> clients against other solicitors.  That is an important measure because many solicitors would refuse point blank to take an action against a colleague.  It would be much simpler for the Law Society to have a register of solicitors who are prepared to take on what might be regarded as somewhat distasteful work.</P>
    <P>The requirements on solicitors to give clients some idea of litigation costs is a welcome provision.  Litigation is very expensive and its cost is not helped by the delays experienced because of a badly funded and inefficient courts service. Funding for the courts system has been the Cinderella in terms of resources from various Ministers for Justice.  Delays caused by administrative deficiencies and in an inadequate team of Circuit Court and High Court judges undermine the administration of the law and contribute to the high cost of litigation.  While solicitors may charge high fees, we cannot ignore the contributory factor of the inherent deficiencies in the administration of the courts system.  That also impacts on the efficient conduct of commerce and industry.  If we get our courts system right and impose proper regulatory controls on solicitors in respect of costs we could solve many of the problems. They go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister allocated £66 million to her Department for the law and order and crime package.  The prevention measures she proposes, including the building of jails, are badly needed but will be rendered useless if we do not strike a balance in terms of resources for the courts system which is unable to function because of its workload.  Litigants are suffering because costs are escalating and at the end of a court case the client is presented with an outrageous bill.  Many of those costs are incurred due to the lack of administrative systems in the courts.  The Family Law Bill introduces a range of measures to deal with problems associated with marriage breakdown and recognition of foreign divorces.  The Circuit Court's jurisdiction has been extended to deal with nullity proceedings.  A nullity case may take up <Col N="594" /> to one week in the Circuit Court and the courts are bogged down.  It is crazy that a new wave of family cases will be dealt with in the Circuit Court without providing resources to deal with the present backlog.</P>
    <P>Many clients are upset about the cost of their legal fees because they are not forewarned by their solicitors.  Costs are very high and out of reach of many litigants who do not have access to free civil legal aid.  They should be raised at the first interview although many solicitors are culturally averse to talking about money.  They deal with the issues and advise the client but they should be compelled to forewarn clients about costs and that there is a possibility they may lose the case.  All litigants are optimistic and go to court because they believe they will win the case.  However, only one person can win and a client has a 50:50 chance of being presented with a large bill at the end of the case.  Solicitors should be straight with their clients and discuss whether it is worth while to go to court or if a settlement should be negotiated.</P>
    <P>The provision in Part VII permitting solicitors to advertise their charges may give rise of concern.  Already solicitors are taking out large advertisements in the Yellow Pages which, although expensive, are obviously worth while.  Some solicitors may spend a large amount on advertising, in America one sees advertisements offering a free bicycle with every conveyance.  It would be appalling if such advertisements appeared in the Yellow Pages.  The Minister said that conveyancing services may be advertised.  In the past conveyancing was straightforward but today a good conveyancer must also be an excellent family lawyer. One cannot quantify conveyancing costs until one knows details of the case.  A conveyancing case may appear straightforward but may involve problems with titles, broken marriages and a whole range of other matters.  Rather than conveyancing advertising being in the best public interest it may result in the public being misled.  The proposal for advertising those services must be carefully considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> Sections dealing with the provisions empowering banks, building societies, insurance companies and credit unions to prepare wills and provide probate services and banks and insurance companies to provide conveyancing services have proved controversial.  Much of the controversy arose following a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting and a subsequent statement from the Minister that he intended to delete those sections.  I regret that because it demeans this House if the Government or Ministers issue statements about published legislation prior to a constructive debate on the issues involved.  Our focus should be to preserve the public interest and seek the common good.  It would be undesirable if the House was reduced to going through the motions of dealing with legislation on Committee Stage.  Having considered all the options, possible conflict &mdash; or coincidence of interests as it is now called &mdash; it may be in the public interest to delete those sections, but that decision should be made on Committee Stage, not on the airwaves.  I look forward to a comprehensive debate on those sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The solicitors' profession object to banks and trust corporations dealing with probate work because such work is complex and should be carried out by solicitors. However, the banks could employ solicitors to do such work.  Solicitors raise many arguments about the matter as it is in their interest to protect their monopoly of services.  Their main point is that there is a risk of a conflict of interest in the management of such matters and conveyancing by banks.  That is a key point on which we must deliberate.</P>
    <P>Under the 1954 Act it is mandatory for intending solicitors to pass two examinations in Irish.  That provision should be repealed.  The Progressive Democrats have a real interest in the Irish language and culture but question the mandatory nature of that provision.  There is a legitimate motivation behind it, to provide solicitors with an adequacy in the Irish language to enable them to <Col N="596" /> handle cases for litigants who wish their cases to be dealt with in Irish.  In reality, few solicitors can deal with a case comprehensively and fluently in Irish.  It would be more appropriate to prepare a list of solicitors fluent in Irish who would be pleased to deal with litigation cases in Irish.  It would be honest to provide a proper module for the training of solicitors. It may be correct for the exam to be compulsory as part of that module, but passing the examination should not be compulsory.  This happened to a friend of mine from Northern Ireland who had not learned Irish in school before he attended Trinity College.  He learned about Peig Sayers, phonetically mouthed syllables, and struggled through the Irish exam.  Everybody knows it means nothing, it is a totem pole and undermines the respect we should have for the Irish language.  He failed his examination and had to wait another year to repeat it.  He wasted a year that he could have practised as a solicitor.  It is disgraceful that the examination discriminates against English people and members of European states who might like to study here.  The examination is discriminatory and should be reviewed.  My resignation may be called for having raised this matter.</P>

      <P>We will debate that matter on Committee Stage.  Under an international agreement solicitors who <Col N="597" /> qualify in another jurisdiction and come here are not required to pass that examination, but for solicitors who train here it is a requirement.</P>
      <P>On the question of equality there is a very good gender balance throughout the legal profession.  Women have been to the fore in passing examinations and have proved to be excellent solicitors in all specialties.  As a result of very good anti-discrimination legislation, there have not been many complaints from female solicitors as to possible discrimination against them in terms of furtherance of their career.  The Law Society in England introduced an anti-discrimination code to deal with a whole range of issues not only in respect of women but on general principles to be adopted by practitioners on discrimination on the grounds of race, sex and sexual orientation and disability. These guidelines relate not only to staff but also to services to the public.  The Law Society there has agreed a far-reaching package of measures for implementation by the 60,000 solicitors practising in England and Wales.  At the end of 1993 there were approximately 4,000 solicitors practising here.  I am not sure of the percentage as between men and women but there is a healthy gender balance throughout the profession.  It would be in order for the Law Society here to draw up guidelines similar to those applying in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect relating to women in law must be raised, that is the question of maternity rights.  We have excellent maternity legislation to deal with employees.  As is the case with all employees, solicitors are entitled to maternity leave, maternity pay and security in returning to work.  However, no such provision relates to women in proprietary partnership in practices through the country.  There are not many women in this position but given the numbers coming through the system at present, the Law Society will have to plan for protection for these women.  It is important that the Law Society develop standard maternity clauses for partnerships to cover the various aspects.  This has been done by the Law Society in Britain <Col N="598" /> and it would be reasonable to ask that the Law Society here provide for these women.  It is not a matter that can be legislated for; it would be up to the society to introduce such guidelines.  The question of flexibility of working arrangements also needs to be considered by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill.  The main sections relate to the opening up to other bodies of services which were traditionally the monopoly of solicitors, and we will have to decide the best way forward.</P>

      <P>Before bringing the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill before the Dáil the Government had an important and fundamental choice to make between the rights of citizens and the privileged position of the tiny élite who control the legal profession.  To its shame, the Government has chosen to leave undisturbed the tiny privileged clique at the top of the legal profession and has turned its back on the public who needs and demands fair open and affordable access to the law.  This Bill is a surrender to the lawyers' lobby.  The decision to abandon key sections of the Bill is testimony to how well that legal lobby is functioning on the Fianna Fáil backbenchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with the banks in due course.  The debate on this Bill goes to the heart of our understanding of democracy and our commitment, if any, to equality of opportunity and equality before the law. This country prides itself as a democracy, with the rights of its citizens guaranteed in a written Constitution and with our laws democratically decided by a freely elected Legislature.  However, no democracy can be circumscribed by the laws and constitution alone.  The law is only as good as its application, and the application of the law here leaves much to be desired.  Although our citizens, in theory <Col N="599" /> have equal rights, in practice they can assert those rights only if they can afford the cost of lawyers, if they can afford to risk losing and if they have the confidence to subject themselves to legal procedures and practices which are obscure and intimidating.</P>
      <P>We have inherited a legal system designed to subject a colonised people and which was never changed to meet the needs of a free people living in a modern democracy.  Our legal system is comprised of practices and procedures which maintain the privileges of the few who dominate it at the expense of the ordinary citizen.  Our courts are ghastly places, designed to dominate and intimidate those who appear in them.  They are under-resourced and function inefficiently. At best, they dispense legal decisions rather than impart justice.  A total overhaul of our courts is badly needed, as is the introduction of new court legislation.</P>
      <P>The judges who make the real decisions in court are selected, usually on the basis of political patronage, from the lawyers who in turn tend to be a privileged cast of well connected professionals, drawn from the privileged minority who can afford third level education. In a small country this means that for the most part those who administer justice and practise the law are drawn from an even smaller upper crust.  They belong to the same social class, go to the same schools, play rugby and golf together, are members of the same yacht clubs and are often from the same families. Is it any wonder they sometimes end up tripping over each other in the Horseshoe Bar on Friday evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our law has been well and truly privatised by self-perpetuating cliques in both wings of the legal profession.  The whole idea of having two divisions of lawyers, solicitors and barristers, is archaic, duplicates work and adds to the cost for the citizen.  Both wings of the profession govern themselves in a way that restricts entry and unevenly apportions work and reward.  Why is it so tortuous to become a solicitor or a <Col N="600" /> barrister?  Why, in order to become a solicitor, must one not only be able to pay the cost of education but have the connections to get an apprenticeship and subject oneself to a futile system of indenture? Why is practice at the Bar based on hanging around the Law Library waiting for a solicitor to hand one a brief, regardless of whether it contains a cheque? What is the point of having to wear a dandruffed black cloak and an unhygienic matt of horse hair in order to practise in the courts?  Why, as part of one's education at the Bar, must one eat on so many occasions at the Kings Inns?  What does eating have to with knowledge and practise of the law?</P>
    <P>Looking at both wings of the profession, it is striking that within a profession which is drawn virtually exclusively from the better off sections of society there exists a further degree of class and earning distinction.  We hear very often that we have too many barristers and solicitors.  I do not think the problem is the number but rather the uneven distribution of the spoils and work between them.  Many barristers and solicitors cannot make a living at their chosen profession.  Some receive only a modest reward for their work, but at the top the sky is the limit.  The obscene levels of legal fees paid at the Beef Tribunal exposed to the public the injustifiable fees commanded by a select band of lawyers.</P>
    <P>The message within the legal system is that in order to win in court one must have top lawyers.  To afford top lawyers one must be either rich or, if one qualifies for free criminal legal aid &mdash; the only way of getting top lawyers &mdash; accused of a crime.  The first law in the legal system is that if one cannot pay one does not win. For the average citizen, going to court means putting the house at risk.  This is why so many people decide to suffer injustice silently instead of pursuing their legal rights.  For the vast majority of people legal rights exist only in theory as going to court is too expensive and too intimidating.  Becoming a lawyer, or at least one who can make a living at this profession, is only possible if one has <Col N="601" /> the money and the connections.  George Bernard Shaw must have had the Irish legal system in mind when he described professionals as a conspiracy against the laity.</P>
    <P>My criticisms of the legal profession are not directed at individual solicitors or barristers, the vast majority of whom are honest, honourable, competent and do a good job.  My criticism is of the way the system works and of the failure of our political system to legislate so that people will have a legal system which is fair and open at the point of access and delivery.</P>
    <P>It was public disquiet at the cost of legal services and practices in the legal profession which ten years ago caused the then Government to ask the Fair Trade Commission to investigate the legal profession and to report on possible remedies.  There was also the problem, although limited, of malpractice in the profession.  It says something about the power of the legal profession that although the problem was acknowledged by the Government as far back as 1984 it has taken ten years to bring this revised Bill before the Dáil.  Admittedly the Fair Trade Commission took until 1990 to make its comprehensive report, many of the key recommendations of which have been ignored by the Government.  The first version of the Solicitors Bill appeared 18 months later and even though it had been given a Second Reading in the Dáil and was in a special committee it was withdrawn for substantial redrafting.  The redrafted version of the Bill appeared approximately one month ago and since then the Minister of State has announced in the media that the Government will drop the sections on competition for conveyancing and probate work.</P>
    <P>From the first day the Bill was, as the Minister of State described it, minimalist and conservative reforming legislation. It was a far cry from the more fundamental legislation called for by the Fair Trade Commission.  That minimalist legislation has been watered down and some of it abandoned in the face of the onslaught from the powerful legal lobby.  It is little surprise that when <Col N="602" /> speaking on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 13 February last the director general of the Law Society, Mr. Noel Ryan, stated:</P>
    <P>This Bill, in fact the vast majority of it, 99 per cent of it, has been sought by the Law Society and is welcomed by the Law Society, and is in fact Law Society driven and in fact very largely drafted by the Law Society, so we have no problem with most of the things in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which will help the clients of solicitors and will hopefully reduce the incidence of rogue solicitors ripping off their clients or badly representing them.  No doubt these are measures which the Law Society and the vast majority of solicitors would welcome. Apart from these minimal reforms, the powerful legal lobby has ensued that the legislation will go no further.</P>
    <P>The entire legal system is the one area of life most in need of fundamental reform.  The legal profession is a closed shop, operating the most outrageous restrictive practices.  It needs to be opened up.  The cost of law is excessive and must be subjected to the market competition to which most lawyers are ideologically committed except when it is applied to their profession.  If democracy and equality before the law are to mean anything then every citizen must be enabled to use the law.  The class-based cartel which is our legal system must be opened up from the top to bottom and radically restructured.  Legislation on the legal profession should have had that as its objective.</P>
    <P>In its report the Fair Trade Commission stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that there is a fundamental requirement that the public should have available an adequate supply of legal services of sufficient quality with a wide degree of choice among practitioners and delivered efficiently at a reasonable price. It accepts also that it is in the public interest that the suppliers of legal services should maintain a high standard <Col N="603" /> of competence, conduct, integrity and independence for the protection of consumers.</P>
    <P>That should have been the mission statement of this Bill.  Unfortunately, the Government has turned away from the basic approach taken by the Fair Trade Commission and has effectively rejected the key recommendations in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The first failure of the Bill is that it only addresses the solicitor's branch of the legal profession.  In fairness to solicitors, their profession has been the subject of a number of Acts, for example, the 1954 and 1960 Acts.  Further solicitors legislation was certainly necessary, but it is remarkable that the Bar, the wigs and gowns branch of the profession, has managed to avoid legislative regulation of any kind.  The Bar, from which our top judges and top law officer are drawn, will apparently continue to operate as a club, monopolising the top of the legal system without any democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>Why do we need two branches of the legal profession?  In a small country such as ours the maintenance of two branches in the legal profession is surely wasteful of resources, confusing to the public and adding to the enormous cost of the law. It is hard for citizens to understand why, for even relatively straightforward matters, a visit to a solicitor may result in seeking an opinon from counsel.  If the matter proceeds to court it may be necessary to have not just one lawyer but a solicitor, barrister and senior counsel representing the client.  Even in the lower courts and on relatively minor matters solicitors are now advising their clients to engage counsel.  Clients feel under pressure to accept this advice and the cost goes up.  This is a handy little arrangement to generate increased income for the legal profession.  Even in areas which were not intended for lawyers in the first place, for example the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Rent Tribunal, it is not now uncommon to find both arms of the legal profession representing the one <Col N="604" /> client and maximising their take from the case.</P>
    <P>The two arms of the legal profession should be fused into a single modern body of lawyers.  This legislation should have begun that process.  In fairness to it, the Fair Trade Commission did not specifically recommend fusion but it did indicate that its sympathies were with the fusion argument.  In summarising the case for and against fusion the commission concluded:</P>
    <P>The Commission does not consider that it would be unfair or contrary to the common good if there were to be a single fused profession.  Indeed it believes that a fused profession might, without being a cause for concern, evolve gradually over time.  In its view nothing should be done to frustrate such a development.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that in introducing this legislation the Government has completely ignored the barristers' profession. Perhaps this is due to the sounds which emanated from the Law Library when the Fair Trade Commission published its report.  The message was clear &mdash; do not legislate for the Bar &mdash; and the Government dutifully complied.</P>
    <P>It is not a solicitors Bill which should be before us this morning but a Bill on the entire legal profession.  The vast majority of solicitors who do a good job may be forgiven for wondering why their arm of the profession should have required three doses of legislation since the foundation of the State while the other arm does not require any.  In so far as the Bill addresses only solicitors it is also a failure, certainly in comparison to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission.  The intention is to strengthen the rights of the consumer, protect the clients of solicitors from abuse and establish an effective complaints mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission recommended that the position of a legal ombudsman be established.  That office would deal with complaints not only against solicitors but also against barristers and would be independent by <Col N="605" /> definition.  It is a familiar concept because we have an ombudsman dealing with the public authorities, another dealing with the insurance industry and an ombudsman in this area would, by definition, be independent of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of this Bill, which is as close to that recommendation as we will get from the Government, proposes not an ombudsman but an independent adjudicator who will be paid through the Incorporated Law Society.  This undermines the concept of independence because he who pays the piper calls the tune.  The functions of the independent adjudicator are not those normally associated with an ombudsman; they are simply functions to make reports to the Incorporated Law Society.  The subsections of section 15, which deal with the functions of the adjudicator, circumscribe what the adjudicator may or may not do.  Subsection (4), for example, lists a number of matters with which the adjudicator may not deal.  Paragraph (f) states that the adjudicator &ldquo;may not measure or determine costs as between solicitor and client or make a recommendation as to the level of such costs,&rdquo;.  Paragraph (g) states that the independent adjudicator &ldquo;may not examine or investigate a complaint made to him under this section after the expiration of two years following the determination by the Society of a complaint made to the Society&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The independent adjudicator is really no more than a glorified research officer for the Law Society and its disciplinary committee.  It is certainly not the legal ombudsman that the public has been demanding which would be entirely independent of the professions and which would have real power to examine complaints.</P>
    <P>The second problem is in section 9 which sets down time limits within which a complaint can be made.  That again places a great restriction on the rights of the public to make complaints against the legal profession.  Time limits should not be set down in this way because frequently a person's contacts with a solicitor or barrister may take place over a protracted period and the incident complained <Col N="606" /> of may have arisen quite some time before these time limits came into play.</P>
    <P>Section 16, which deals with the appointment of lay members to the disciplinary committee, provides only for minimal participation by the lay members in the working of the committee.  These sections which deal with the rights of the client to make a complaint are written in such a way that the Law Society and the solicitors profession are protected to a greater extent than the public.  If the Minister was serious about allowing the public the right to have complaints pursued, she would establish a genuinely independent mechanism and she would not circumscribe it with restrictions, rules and time limits.</P>
    <P>Section 29 puts a cap of £250,000 on the claims which can be made against the compensation fund.  I accept that sum is likely to be more than what most claims against the compensation fund will be.  It does not, however, tax the imagination too much to understand that, for example, a transaction dealing with, say, the sale of a farm or a business, a substantial inheritance or a substantial personal injury award would considerably exceed the £250,000 figure.  The conveyance of a residential property, in the type of location where one might expect top lawyers to live, might exceed £250,000.  This section has been designed to protect the fund and the interest of the members of the legal profession who, understandably, would be reluctant to make the necessary payments to enable a larger fund to be made available.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about Parts V and VI because although they are represented as opening up access to the solicitors profession, the right of access to the profession continues to be restricted.  I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Sections 78 and 79 have been the subject of some public comment.  I was interested to hear the Minister's retort when I, in passing, raised this issue in my opening remarks.  It is an issue that is <Col N="607" /> being represented as a struggle between the banks and the legal profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a titanic battle between the wealthiest and the most powerful lobbies in the country.  It was certainly represented in that way on a television programme last night on which the Minister of State featured prominently. I do not see the issue in that way &mdash; and I have no brief to tout for additional business for the banks or financial institutions &mdash; but the idea of opening up the area of conveyancing and probate was articulated here by the then Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, who argued strongly, when he introduced this Bill in his first manifestation, that this was needed in order to introduce competition to an area where solicitors enjoyed a statutory monopoly.  I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day Government Ministers talk about the advantages of competition and deregulation.  It seems everybody is to be subjected to competition and deregulation, from airline pilots to telephone operators, but not the protected species in the legal profession, although the Fair Trade Commission recommended very strongly that this area of activity should be opened up to competition. For example licensed conveyancing should not necessarily be done solely through the banks or building societies; it could be done through credit unions or perhaps through local authorities. However, the concept is, in the interests of the public, to introduce competition into this area and to reduce costs, the area of conveyancing and probate should be opened up and the monopoly of solicitors broken.  Therefore, it is not a back-up between the banks and the legal profession.  Indeed, the legal profession, the Incorporated Law Society in its submission and the Minister of State in repeating it have very cleverly converted it into an issue of the banks trying to engage in some kind of greedy grab in this area of activity.  It is a very clever tactic <Col N="608" /> because nobody will rush to the defence of the banks; they are probably the most disliked institutions in the State.  Therefore, to turn an issue essentially about competition and reducing costs into some kind of a struggle between the banks and the legal profession is disingenuous and misrepresents the whole idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to his commitment to competitiveness.  He referred to it more colloquially when he spoke on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a couple of weeks ago and said you can have too much of a good thing and that there is plenty of competition in the legal profession. Competition is singularly lacking in the legal profession although the Minister also stated that there was already enough competition to keep prices at rock bottom.  People who avail of legal services here would hardly support that statement.  The Incorporated Law Society having got 99 per cent of what they sought then, through some of its profession represented in the Fianna Fáil Party, set to work to lobby for the deletion of these two sections.  It appears they have got their way.</P>
    <P>I read this Bill and compared it with the original Bill and the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  I read the debate on Second Stage of the Bill when it was introduced in 1991.  When the Bill was reissued I read it carefully to see what signs it contained of the Labour Party's influence in Government.  It seems to be a negative influence because as far as clients of the legal profession, the general public &mdash; that whole excluded mass of society who will never become lawyers and most of whom cannot afford to engage lawyers &mdash; are concerned there is very little evidence in this Bill that the Labour Party has done a great service in endeavouring to include measures to protect the public.  Indeed, the Bill originally introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, was far better than the one now before us.  The only contribution the Labour Party seems to have made to this Bill is so negative as to make Deputy Ray Burke read and <Col N="609" /> look like a socialist when he introduced the Bill initially.</P>

      <P>Most people avail of the services of the legal profession at some stage in their lives.  Sometimes one requires legal advice on relatively routine matters, such as requesting planning permission for building a property, finalising the purchase of a house or making a will.  On a more contentious level, such consultation might arise through a civil law problem, a road traffic offence or a criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the nature of the problem the vast majority of people have little knowledge of the technical details of the law.  As a result, people who may be quite reserved about their personal affairs among friends and even family members, have little option but to place an almost total degree of faith in the competence and integrity of their solicitor.  Therefore, it is essential that legislators and the Incorporated Law Society, as the profession's controlling body, make every effort to ensure that the trust placed in a solicitor by his or her client is honoured to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While legislation in this area is comprehensive, the provisions of the Bill are welcome on two fronts as they consolidate a number of existing provisions while adding some valuable extra features. <Col N="610" /> I should like to highlight elements I consider of particular importance.</P>
    <P>Because of the high level of technical detail in the definition of our laws, and consequently in the everyday language of the practising solicitor, perhaps it is inevitable that there is a distance between the legal profession and the lay consumer. I welcome a number of provisions of this Bill which afford a greater degree of participation by lay people in the supervision of legal practice here.  For example, section 7 facilitates the involvement of lay people in the work of the various committees of the council of the Incorporated Law Society.  Similarly, section 16 facilitates the appointment of up to five lay members of the Disciplinary Tribunal.  An increased involvement by lay people in these key areas can result only in establishing a more positive link between the legal profession and the community it serves.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of its provisions which will enable a dissatisfied consumer to have his or her case against a solicitor fully considered.  For example, section 8 confirms the duty of the Incorporated Law Society to investigate all reasonable cases of complaint brought to it by an unhappy customer.  There is a necessary limitation to these provisions which allows the Incorporated Law Society to label some complaints as frivolous or vexatious. It is important that that provision is used only in clearcut cases.  When processing a complaint, obviously it is necessary for the Incorporated Law Society to obtain and collate all relevant evidence. The provisions of sections 10 and 14 will play an important role in this regard since the law allows for comprehensive access to appropriate documentation.  The examination of complaints by the Incorporated Law Society does not always guarantee satisfaction to an aggrieved party.  For that reason I particularly welcome section 15 providing for a system of independent adjudication of the society's performance in the handling of any given complaint.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a number of sections allowing for substantially increased fines, where considered appropriate by the <Col N="611" /> Incorporated Law Society.  Some of the previous upper limits on fines were of a token nature.  At a time when a poor person can be given a custodial sentence for petty larceny, it is not acceptable that professional people convicted of wrong-doing should be so lightly penalised.  Not only must the intention of our laws be fair and just, their application must also reflect this aspiration.  I welcome the more realistic scale of fines contained in sections 11, 15 and 18.  While even higher rates might be appropriate in certain cases, the changes are in the right direction. Another deterrent to poor practice by the profession as a whole is provided by section 22 which requires the society to publish annual information in its gazette regarding complaints received about solicitors. Such reports will clearly identify the extent of complaints and consequently the size of the challenge facing the profession.  In the case of a solicitor being either struck off or suspended, section 23 allows for such a decision to be carried in the gazette.</P>
    <P>If a solicitor is struck off or suspended, a number of provisions in the Bill either prevent or limit further involvement in legal work.  Thus the individual solicitor is restricted by section 21 while potential employers are restrained by section 20. One must keep in mind that in any particular instance the potential employer may have at least two difficulties in this regard.  He or she may not be aware that the solicitor has been struck off or suspended.  The person may not be aware of the existence of the detail of this Bill. The only solution to these problems is increasing consumer education regarding both the operation of business and the protection offered by the law.</P>
    <P>Malpractice by a solicitor can often lead to extreme hardship for the affected client.  It is very important that provision is made to cater for adequate and immediate compensation for offended parties.  A number of aspects of the Bill should assist in this regard.  For example, section 26 deals with the need for professional indemnity cover.  Increased access to relevant documents should <Col N="612" /> result from section 27 while the freezing of the solicitor's bank assets is provided for in section 28.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 29 which deals with the establishment of a compensation fund from which losses sustained due to the dishonesty of solicitors, or their employees, may be recovered.  Lost interest as well as capital may be paid to the innocent party.  This provision brings to mind the need for the society to deal more effectively with the many reported instances of excessive delays in the processing of civil cases.  Most politicans have encountered constituency clients who have waited many years for the resolution of their legal problems.  This is particularly common in the area of administration of disputed wills.</P>
    <P>Often long periods of inactivity are combined with brief adjourned court hearings.  In many instances the people involved may be elderly and have their final years of life clouded by their legal problem.  I urge that either we, or the society, should consider the annual formal registration of cases which have been active for a period greater than three years.  Particular attention could then be paid to ensure that all except the most difficult of these cases should be resolved within a year.  The benefit of such a provision would be substantial to many long suffering clients of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>When a solicitor ceases to practice either through severe ill health or death, the practice's clients are often placed in a highly vulnerable position.  I welcome the various sections which should ensure the timely and proper transfer of business in such tragic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the range of measures aimed at ensuring that the education and training of our young solicitors is of the highest possible standard.  Similarly the provisions facilitating barristers to register as solicitors should eliminate a certain degree of unnecessary bureaucracy. The sections allowing easier registration of suitably qualified foreign solicitors are equally welcome.</P>
    <P>One matter which may not be adequately catered for is education.  This <Col N="613" /> relates to the vital need that qualified solicitors keep themselves fully informed of the implications of new legislation for their clients.  It is becoming increasingly common throughout Europe for professional bodies to insist that members take part in some form of continuing education.  While such involvement is standard for professions such as doctors and teachers in some countries, the need is equally pronounced in the case of solicitors. With the ever growing amount of new and amended legislation on both national and EU statute books, the continuing education needs of the legal profession are probably greater than those of most other groups.  Failure to deal with this problem can only ultimately be to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The need to ensure that clients are not over-charged by their solicitor is catered for by a number of provisions in the Bill. Section 68 is particularly valuable in this regard.  Similarly the value of allowing advertising is acknowledged in section 69.  These two sections should prove to be of great benefit to the prospective client.  The need for solicitors to handle their clients' money properly is noted in section 73.</P>
    <P>The fact that a written agreement between solicitor and client can override the protection offered by this section emphasises the old warning that one should never sign a document without fully reading its contents.  If a client has any further doubt regarding the matter, he or she should not sign until the matter has been clarified.</P>
    <P>While the practice of over-charging by a certain proportion of solicitors may be due to a degree of greed on the part of the guilty individual we must accept that the ever increasing number of practising solicitors is having the effect of reducing the market share available to each firm. As a result many legal firms are finding it extremely difficult to remain solvent. It is important that more emphasis be placed on manpower planning if we are to maintain a balance between providing competitive rates for the consumer with ensuring the viability of the vast majority <Col N="614" /> of our legal firms.  The smaller and younger practices are particularly vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Sections 67 and 74 contain two further vital elements.  Section 67 allows for the maintenance of a register of solicitors willing to act in cases directly against other solicitors charged with malpractice while section 74 limits the scope for solicitors withdrawing unilaterally from a criminal case.  These issues are often of vital importance to those with limited resources to defend their own interests adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and his team, are to be complimented on the progressive nature of the various elements of the Bill.  The legal profession as a whole play a vital role in our democracy.  In particular their involvement is central to the administration of justice to our citizens.  I urge them to fully acknowledge the need for more justice and less law as they go about their daily duties.  The increasing use of loopholes in the law to circumvent the administration of justice is neither in the profession's interest nor in the interest of the community it serves.  Unfortunately this occurs too often.  If this trend is allowed to continue it will undermine our process of government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal profession has enjoyed a privileged and almost godly status for the last 100 years or so.  For many years the profession was a closed shop.</P>
      <P>A special trust and relationship exists between a client and his or her solicitor which should never be abused but unfortunately in a few cases this has happened. Solicitors and others in the legal profession have been debarred from practising as a result.  I support the essence of the Bill which provides greater protection for the client.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced on radio that the section dealing with the transfer for conveyancing to banks and financial institutions is to be dropped.  I welcome that but such a statement should be made in the House when the Bill is introduced. An important announcement which has implications for every solicitor's office should be made on the floor of Dáil Éireann and transmitted from here to the airwaves.  To do otherwise demeans the status, importance and function of the House.  I regret the tendency of Ministers to make statements on various Bills going through the House.  It should be strict practice for all Ministers and Ministers of State to make important announcements in the House in the first instance.  People look to the House to pass good law and safeguard their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians deal with people from all walks of life and with all shades of opinion and so we have an idea of what solicitors and legal people deal with.  The cute rural syndrome is very much in evidence in a solicitor's office.  A solicitor must have an understanding of the way the human mind, in particular, the Irish rural mind, works.  One might not be told the full story and we all know of cases where hilarious explanations are given in <Col N="616" /> court and where the defence offered is equally hilarious.  However, by and large, the legal profession is competent and the vast majority of solicitors work in the interests of their client.</P>
    <P>There are many students who would like to study law but it is very difficult to find anybody who will take an apprentice solicitor.  Section 44 of the Bill reduces the minimum period of continuous practice required before a solicitor may take on an apprentice from seven to five years. That is very important.  Section 53 enables the Law Society to make regulations providing that apprenticeships may be served in Northern Ireland, England and Wales and that, too, is important. It gives scope to young students who want to go into the area of law but who cannot do so here because of the closed nature of the profession and the lack of opportunities.</P>
    <P>People who are fed up with a solicitor or who want a second opinion often find there is difficulty getting files from one office to the other.  Those in the profession usually know each other and may have represented relatives of their clients.  The special relationship between solicitor and client should never be abused.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with solicitors advertising their facilities.  The public could be made aware of the general range of services provided by the various offices but the kind of advertising I have seen in newspapers leads to people making claims for compensation.  One sees advertisements inviting those who have been involved in an accident to go to a certain firm of solicitors who will solve all their problems.  When I was a Minister of State in the Department of Labour and dealing with Teamwork schemes I was aware that three members of the same family lodged claims for compensation following accidents at a particularly bad corner in a county not far from here.  There are probably a substantial number of people who, if they are unfortunate to be involved in an accident, will see it as a chance of a few pounds compensation should they go to a particular firm of solicitors.  The perception created by these advertisements <Col N="617" /> in papers and magazines is not in the interests of the common good and I do not see it as being of benefit in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The special relationship between solicitor and client should never be abused and the Bill strengthens that.  The overall thrust of the Bill should be to ensure that the client is afforded greater protection in his relationship with the solicitor.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister of State made an announcement that was of fundamental importance to this Bill outside this Chamber.  That reduces the status of Dáil Éireann and creates the perception that this House is irrelevant. All Ministers and Ministers of State should make relevant announcements on a Bill, or on any aspect of the Department's works, as it affects the community, in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>From listening to the comments of previous speakers one would think that the Bill should deal not only with the role of the Incorporated Law Society but the whole court system. If that were to be the case I envisage it would run to 300 sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is solely concerned with the profession of solicitors.  I urge the Minister, and his officials, to take on board the comments of Opposition spokespersons, and particularly the points raised by the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society in their joint submission to the Minister for Justice in September 1993. It refers to many aspects that concern solictors in trying to enhance the service they deliver to the public.  The topics covered in the submission include the role and importance of the court service in the administration of justice; the principal shortcomings of the existing service; delays in court; courthouse accommodation and facilities; family law cases; rationalisation of courthouse venues; information technology; pleading systems and pre-trial procedures in the High Court; the listing system in the High Court; the need for additional resources; the management of the court services and the judicial commission.  That gives a flavour of how broad the judicial system <Col N="618" /> is.  Many of the comments made would more properly relate to legislation the Minister is introducing in response to the many requests in that joint submission.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to effect a major reform of the law relating to solicitors.  New procedures for dealing with complaints against solicitors, and increases in the Law Society's powers to intervene in solictor's practices and in the High Court's supervisory functions over the profession will give greater protection to solicitors' clients.</P>
    <P>An impression has been created that the Law Society should not support the Bill but why should not the Law Society support the updating of outdated legislation? The Law Society, as the body governing the profession, is unique in that it is obliged to maintain a compensation fund, unlike many other bodies that represent professions such as architects or engineers.  The experience of the Law Society is that existing legislation does not meet modern day needs and it lobbied effectively to have the control which it exercises strengthened so that clients and their property are fully protected. During its investigation it found that its hands were tied in certain respects in admonishing and penalising solicitors who had committed misdemeanours.  In the past 20 years the Law Society policed the profession because this function was entrusted to it.  It has discharged this role fearlessly.  It is conscious of the poor public image of the profession.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any profession where the organisational body has moved against its own members and taken away their means of livelihood.  Every year several solicitors are debarred and many others are penalised.  This has to be done as the compensation fund has to be protected. The impression created by some Members is that the solicitors' profession is a cosy club for gentlemen.  While that may have been the case 20 years ago, the profession has changed since then.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of practising solicitors and far from what Members suggest a substantial <Col N="619" /> number of solicitors entering the profession come from a non-legal background. Over 80 per cent of the 4,200 practicising solicitors are in one and two man practices which in the main were established in the past 20 years.  A very high percentage of these solicitors have a non-legal background and entered the profession in spite of obstacles in securing an apprenticeship and in establishing themselves in practice.  It is not the easy ride that Deputy Gilmore has tried to convey.  I have found the comfort of being a TD and receiving a cheque through the PAYE system at the end of the month a great deal more consoling than being a solicitor in the one man practice I established in 1978.</P>
    <P>I would no longer describe law as a profession but as a business where one takes risks as in any other business.</P>
    <P>The outlay in the first few years is considerably greater than income but solicitors are increasingly taking the risk. While I am not here to defend them I cannot allow sweeping statements to be made tarnishing all solicitors with the one brush as a bunch of rogues and villains. Most members of the profession are honourable and want to provide a competent and efficient legal service.  Fortunately this is recognised by their clients.</P>
    <P>While the profession may not support certain provisions, the Bill should make a contribution to enhancing the image, status and reputation of the profession which provides a high quality legal service which is client orientated and represents good value for money.  The profession has changed.  The number of solicitors has increased dramatically and now stands at an all time high of 4,200. They are providing employment for approximately 16,000 secretarial and clerical staff.</P>
    <P>Some of the tasks which were traditionally carried out by solicitors are now also carried out by accountancy firms, particularly the provision of tax advice and advice on the formation of companies.  As a result of increased competition, greater public awareness of civil remedies and the increased number of <Col N="620" /> claims the profession is now much more business orientated.</P>
    <P>The Law Society has also changed to meet the challenges being faced by the profession.  Twenty years ago there was a perception that it was a cosy gentleman's club, the rules of which were drafted solely for the benefit of its members, but this has changed radically and the society is now making a conscious effort to be more transparent in its dealings with the public and the media.</P>
    <P>This is comprehensive legislation and I welcome most of the new provisions contained in it, particularly section 8 under which the Law Society will have the power to impose sanctions for inadequate services.  This is long overdue as the Law Society was handicapped in investigating cases of misconduct.  It has to be acknowledged that a small number of solicitors provided inadequate services. I also welcome the additional powers given to the Law Society in section 9 to impose sanctions for charging excessive fees.  Despite increased competition advantage was taken of clients and excessive fees charged.  I am pleased that the Law Society will have a role to play in investigating cases where it is alleged excessive fees have been charged. It is also welcome that the person being investigated will have to meet the costs of the Law Society in investigating the case up to a level of £1,000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment under section 15 of the office of the independent adjudicator.  While the Law Society may not support this provision as the costs of the office will have to be borne by the society, the independent adjudicator will have an important supervisory role to play.  This should restore the confidence of the public in the investigation of complaints. There is a perception because complaints are investigated by members of the Law Society that they will not be fully investigated.  Reference has been made to the difficulty encountered in getting one solicitor to sue another.  This is an innovative provision and should be welcomed.  It should lead to greater transparency and openness.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 16 under which up <Col N="621" /> to five lay people may be appointed to the disciplinary tribunal.  Many of these provisions have already been implemented by the Law Society.  For instance, there are two lay members on its disciplinary committee to ensure complaints are investigated properly and fully.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 26 under which the Law Society may make regulations requiring professional indemnity insurance.  Ninety-nine per cent of solicitors have this insurance cover, which is mandatory if a solicitor handles building society loans.  This is a valued protection. This adds to the running costs of a solicitor's office which are increasing and have to be recovered by way of fees.</P>
    <P>The rules which apply when a sole practitioner ceases to practice and under which their accounts are frozen should tighten the law.  Because sole practitioners account for 57 per cent of practices it is right and proper that these rules are being updated to ensure that clients will continue to be protected if a solicitor dies or ceases to practice.</P>
    <P>Section 68 relates to charges to clients for services rendered by solicitors.  In future a solicitor will have to provide in writing the particulars of the actual charges or, where this is not possible, an estimate, and where neither is possible the basis on which the charges are to be made.  Where the legal service involves contentious business the solicitor will have to notify the client of the circumstances in which he may be obliged to pay costs to any other party and the circumstances in which his liability to meet the charges made by the solicitor will not be fully discharged by the amount of the costs recovered.  The practice of acting on the basis that the solicitor will receive a specified percentage or proportion of the award will be prohibited except where it relates to debt collection or liquidated damages.  The proposal that a flat fee be charged was opposed by the Law Society on the grounds that it contravened the offence of champerty. That was not supported by the Law Society but it crept in in the case of the solicitor and client fee.  Now any solicitor <Col N="622" /> and client fee can only be deducted if there is an agreement in writing, and that written agreement must include an estimate by the solicitor of the costs that might reasonably be recovered on a party basis in the event of the client being successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 24, 26 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The human resources element of the National Development Plan reflects the outcome of preparatory discussions with the European Commission.  It focuses on four main areas: initial education and training, continuing training for the unemployed and those in employment, social exclusion aid, supporting measures to ensure the effectiveness and quality of the investments proposed.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the submission of the plan, the European Commission expressed satisfaction with the proposals as they relate to education, training and employment measures.  Some adaptations have been suggested and these are currently the subject of negotiations with the European Commission.</P>
      <P>In addition, the human resources measures proposed have been assessed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which was retained by the European Commission to undertake that task.  The outcome of that appraisal has also found the expenditure emphasis to be worthy of support having regard to the labour market and demographic considerations which exist.</P>
      <P>An evaluation unit is located in my Department to assess the impact of expenditures on human resources measures supported through the European Social Fund and to make recommendations for change if appropriate.  A significant number of measures have already been evaluated in partnership with the European Commission and recommendations for improvements are being progressively implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully committed to ensuring that the significant investment from the Exchequer and the European Social Fund to be allocated to human resources development in the period to 1994 is effective and that objectives set are realised.  All human resources measures <Col N="624" /> will be rigorously evaluated and monitored in consultation with the European Commission and any necessary changes introduced.  The impression given in some reports that waste or inefficiency will be acceptable in the area of human resources expenditure is fundamentally wrong.  I assure the House that failure to achieve present objectives or to adapt programmes where necessary will result in the withdrawal of funding and its allocation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked specifically if the EU questioning of the emphasis on human resources was a useful input to the debate.  Any interchange in a debate is useful.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Quinn is not here to take this question which deals specifically with how he has conducted his business.  It is particularly surprising, after his comments last week, that he is not present. Will the Minister of State agree that the petulant response of the Minister to legitimate questions about the value for money of human resources was damaging to Irish interests in negotiating Structural Funds?  Will she agree that the major published work on the evaluation of human resource investment, namely, the report by Mr. Frank Roche and Mr. Paul Tansey as part of the Culliton report, was far from encouraging about the value for money of much of our investment?  Will the Minister of State agree that it is hard for us to accept that an unpublished work to which the Government accords high priority deals adequately with the issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the Minister's absence is that he is at an important European meeting on Government business.  As to interchanges between the Minister and the European Union official, often much is gained in a robust exchange where one party knows the strength of the other.  At that level there are clearly areas where creative tensions can be expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the input of Tansey and Roche into the Culliton report, there has been the ESRI evaluation of the work done <Col N="625" /> which has been accepted in Brussels. Officials were able to assure us that that chapter on human resources is broadly acceptable to the European Commission and any other reports to the contrary are incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in responding to questions which are the responsibility of her colleague. However, I do not believe that a robust exchange involving name-calling of officials sheds any light on matters. Does the Minister agree that it is highly unsatisfactory that the claimed ESRI work is unpublished?  Would she also agree that the fact that the public record shows, for example, that of those on social employment schemes only 16 per cent got work and 85 per cent effectively remained unemployed, and similar poor returns on other schemes, does not give the public much confidence that 100 per cent for money is being obtained from human resource and FÁS schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If by 100 per cent value for money the Deputy means that everybody on a training programme is placed in a job, admirable as that objective would be, it can never be realised. We have a new community employment scheme operating this month, and there is need for evaluation and monitoring and for job placement as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 37, 62 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The employment incentive scheme and the enterprise scheme are currently operating at capacity level relative to the budgetary provision available for them this year.</P>
      <P>The continued relevance of these schemes is being assessed in the light of developments and initiatives in the sphere of enterprise promotion and support currently being put into place including county enterprise boards, the extended area partnership arrangements, Leader II etc. and the social welfare back to work scheme which to an extent overlaps with these two schemes.</P>
      <P>My concern will be to ensure that measures remain in place to assist and encourage unemployed people to start their own businesses or to gain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many people who were planning to create an enterprise were left high and dry by the manner in which this decision was taken, with no prior consultation and no prior notice?  Will she agree that it is extraordinary that the Government should say, in the month of March, that it has exhausted the money it set aside for a programme to create small start-up businesses which, in about every statement by the Government, is stated to be a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a dichotomy here.  We have had similar discussions before.  There are many measures in place to assist new enterprise, for example, the county enterprise boards, <Col N="627" /> Leader II, the social welfare back to work scheme, area partnership arrangements and so on, all of which can lead to the assumption that there is proliferation of such programmes and schemes.  We are attempting to rationalise throughout Government Departments the various programmes and schemes with a view to maximising opportunities for people who wish to set up a business.  I assure the Deputy that if a person has a business idea and requires funding for it to become operational, he or she will not be refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis can the Minister give such an assurance?  The enterprise allowance scheme is no longer operational and people cannot obtain funding.  That scheme was unique in that a person could get assistance following three weeks unemployment and subsequent participation in a business start-up course.  Will the Minister agree that if the Government wishes to rationalise schemes it should have the courage of its convictions and publish what it plans to do, not do it by stealth leaving people high and dry with enterprise plans withering on the vine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no withering on the vine, there will be flowering. There are many avenues open to people with a business idea and anybody who has a decent business plan and wants to put it into operation will be assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said there are a number of potential avenues through which people with a good business plan can get assistance, for example, the county enterprise boards, area partnerships, Leader II, the social welfare back to work scheme and so on. Through those avenues a good business idea can flourish on the vine.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with Commissioner Bruce Millan the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, discussed progress in the negotiations on the Community Support Framework for Ireland in the period to 1999 and exchanges ranged over a number of areas.  I understand it was agreed not to make any public comment on the specifics of those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Commissioner confirm the total amount of EU funding to the Community Support Framework for the duration of the plan or give an intimation that in an enlarging Community additional funding will be allocated to Ireland at the mid-term review?  If he did not give such an intimation, will the Minister of State agree that it is time we put in place a national plan based on reality and not on a bluff and bluster?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not privy to the discussions between Commissioner Millan and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, but I am sure they were productive because the negotiations between officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the EU have been progressing at a steady pace.  We are heartened by the positive signs emanating from the EU on the general scope of our plans in respect of human resources, a main priority in my Department. It appears that Commissioner Millan and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, gave each other a commitment not to speak in public about their meeting until the matter was fully dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State does not know and the Minister is not present, will the Minister of State at least concede that some people need to know now how much funding they will receive?  For example, people in education who are planning programmes for in-service training for teachers need to know how much funding they will receive so that the planned changes can be put in place from next September.  A number of other key training areas also need to know how much money they will receive to plan scientifically for the year ahead.  The general public should also know, if the credibility of the Government is to be maintained.</P>

      <P>The negotiations between Commissioner Millan and the Minister have been completed and general discussions are now taking place. Perhaps the Deputy might like to put a question to the Minister for Education in this regard but my Department is the parent Department for all training and education measures funded from Brussels. I assure the House that the general range of activities for education and training proposed by the Department of Enterprise and Employment to Brussels were the subject of discussion between Commissioner Millan and the Minister, <Col N="630" /> Deputy Quinn.  The general scope is being adhered to and is progressing well. I assure those outside the House who are concerned about training or education schemes commencing next September that their concerns are groundless.</P>

I am informed that the Authority did not find it possible, on the basis of the facts presented to it, to issue a certificate or a licence under the Act.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 20, 56, 61, 79, 85 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>As these questions indicate, work sharing may take many different forms.  These include job sharing, reductions in working time, reductions in overtime, career breaks and early retirement.  The basic idea involved in work sharing is the redistribution of existing work among a greater number of persons.  As such, it has a certain appeal, especially for countries with high unemployment.</P>
      <P>However, the subject is complex and for that reason I, as Minister for Labour Affairs, commissioned a comprehensive expert study into the subject which is being undertaken by the ESRI, in conjunction with UCD Graduate School of Business.  This study is considering the main forms of work-sharing and their contribution towards generating additional employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase one of the study has been completed and the second and final phase will be completed by June of this year.  That phase will include an attitude survey in 500 work-places in the private and public sector.  The results of that survey, as well as providing a valuable input into policy-making, will also help us to identify the reasons relatively little progress has been made in developing work sharing initiatives here.  Concerns in relation to cost competitiveness and income reduction are, no doubt, likely to form part of the <Col N="635" /> explanation.  The study is also examining the experience of a number of other countries, such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands, which have had recourse to a variety of work sharing measures for a number years.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government to the introduction of a national voluntary scheme of work sharing. Discussions with both IBEC and ICTU have been initiated.  We hope the voluntary scheme will be implemented by January 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the Government's record on work sharing in the public service is not a great headline in that only 5 per cent of positions are available on a work sharing basis compared with 30 per cent in the Netherlands?  Will she not agree also that the Government should develop a solidarity contract similar to that developed in other European countries, whereby instead of the tendency to opt for redundancies other options could be considered such as work sharing or other schemes and that the tax regime should be sympathetic to those arrangements in cases of redundancy or threatened redundancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a greater level of work sharing in other countries.  I have been involved in phase one and phase two of the study.  The issue is more complex than it appears.  Many people would like to job share and believe it is a good idea but when one scratches the surface one realises it is a very complex matter.  They would like to job share but would not like a reduction in income.  People have different views on job sharing.  There is a greater take up in job sharing in other European countries where there was a more open approach to it.  There are many aspects to job sharing in those countries including career breaks and overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Deputy's point on tax breaks.  I hope to introduce the protection of employment Bill in the summer <Col N="636" /> to encourage people to move away from the idea that there is only one solution to business problems, that of shedding jobs. That should be the last resort.  We hope to have the voluntary scheme in place in the public and private sectors by January 1995.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that putting in place proper programmes of work sharing is a key consideration to keep married women, particularly those in the child rearing years, in the workforce and that work sharing programmes should proceed particularly in the areas of education and health?  Teachers and nurses would be pleased to take up job sharing posts with the conditions now on offer for a number of years and to return to full-time employment or retain the option of part-time work when their domestic situation changes.  If we are serious about increasing the number of women in the workforce we must realise the urgency of putting those programmes in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shared a platform with the Deputy at the SIPTU nursing conference on Tuesday night.  Many people other than those accepted for job sharing posts in hospitals and health boards are interested in job sharing.  That arrangement suits many women who wish to keep one foot in the labour market and the other in the home.  I would like to see women and men interested in work sharing.  Even though the arrangement may suit women I would not like them to be the only participants in work sharing schemes.  Wider issues of parenting and the domestic arrangements between partners are involved.  From experience, it is mostly women who take the opportunity of work sharing, but I would caution against placing too much emphasis on women in this context.  It is not my wish that women alone take part in these working arrangements; men must also be involved.  We must have regard to the social legislation and benefits accruing from such work and ensure it does not become a marginalised activity.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Members of the Oireachtas make provision for job-sharing?  I took the opportunity of introducing job sharing in my office four or five years ago and I find it very satisfactory.  In the light of experience of a body such as CARE, will the new arrangements eliminate the resistence to taking up the scheme?  The current scheme is taken up to a very limited degree.  Does the problem exist with the employee or the employer, or is there a problem on both sides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say there is a problem.  My intention was to get greater approval for my ideas on the matter than was apparent among the major constituent bodies.  Many matters remain to be teased out in terms of tax and financial arrangements.  We spoke informally about the arrangements that have been put in place.  Lest people get the wrong impression, Deputy Flaherty does not job share with another Member of the House as those arrangements do not apply here.  The Deputy was referring to arrangements with her staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that putting in place job sharing programmes may present difficulties for employers &mdash; for example, difficulties may be created for hospital managements? In the light of the overwhelming demand, particularly from nurses, for job sharing would the Minister recommend to her colleague, the Minister for Health, that he explore the question of giving assistance and advice to hospital managers and matrons to enable them provide for job sharing for nurses on a greater scale than is the case at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to speak to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on the matter.  I hope that when the details of the scheme are announced there will be greater awareness of it among the workforce and that, therefore, greater opportunities will be created by management for it.  Employers are wary <Col N="638" /> of this whole idea and there are difficulties with the arrangements already in place.  At present 11 per cent of the workforce is engaged in work sharing. There are challenges to be met in the arrangements currently in place, but they can be overcome.  I would encourage employers to provide for job sharing.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give specific examples of the initiative she plans to take?  For example, is she planning to convert the 2,000 jobs in the Government service that are worked in overtime into job opportunities on a work share basis?  Has she plans to make available to people in the later years of their working life the opportunity to reduce their working hours without affecting their pension entitlements? There are 95,000 people between the ages of 55 and 65 who might be attracted to such a package.  Are there examples of such initiatives in the planning stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers relates not so much to early retirement but a lessening of work hours. The range of questions put down on this matter show the ideas people have in job sharing.  I do not have full details on the matter, but questions such as a lessening of activity would be involved.  I hope there will be a high take up of the scheme which is voluntary as it would have the effect of making available more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that while the scheme is voluntary, responsibility lies with her to ensure that job sharing is an attractive option?  The Minister outlined the position with nurses.  Would she accept that there is a strong argument to facilitate job sharing among doctors?  If we do not make it possible for this sector to job share the country will continue to spend large amounts of money training to high professional standards doctors who will then go to countries such as America that can well afford to pay for their own training? By not being able to keep those skills here it is costing us money.  Job sharing under the National Health Service in <Col N="639" /> England has been of benefit not only to those working in the system but to those receiving the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Deputy.  Part of the work involves compiling evidence and data from other countries and examining the reasons for their success.

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the European Council Directive 93/104 EC which was adopted on 23 November 1993 and which addresses certain aspects of the organisation of working time.  Member states are required to ensure that the provisions of the directive, with certain exceptions, are implemented no later than 23 November 1996.  However, the directive allows member states the option not to implement the four weeks minimum annual leave provision until 23 November 1999.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the commitment set out in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; P. 1. 125 &mdash; the provisions of the directive will be implemented in sufficient time to meet the relevant dates set out in the directive.

      <P>I am more than eager to rise to any challenge put to me.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment will run the show.  The directive was the subject of endless debate at Council meetings before it was adopted on 23 November.  All matters of social policy require much consultation.  It is not simply a matter of deciding one morning to introduce a directive on work.  That is not the way the system works.  All legislation, regulations or directives require adequate debate before they are implemented.  Regardless of whether or not one likes it, there has to be consensus. This is why I get alarmed when people seek to roll back social legislation which was introduced as a result of much consultation. One does not suddenly dream up such legislation and implement it in a rush.  This consensus approach has been encapsulated in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  I will play a strong role in this area and will work within a proper framework of consultation.  I will run the show but will not be a dictator.</P>

      <P>Most people are anxious to see these provisions implemented.  Has the Minister assessed whether the extraordinary decision by Britain to opt out of the Social Charter will have any damaging competitive knock-on effects on Ireland?  How can we best prevent any such damage to the Irish economy?  As a small trading economy we have to be conscious of threats of this nature.  Will the Minister outline how such threats, if any, can be minimised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a similar point during a recent debate.  The British Prime Minister, John Major, told other EU member states that they could have social legislation while Britain would have the jobs.  I do not believe this will be the case.  The UK has decided to opt out of some sections of the Social Charter for domestic political reasons. This directive comes under the health and safety remit but the UK says that it <Col N="642" /> should not come under this remit.  While the UK has cited domestic political considerations as the reason for opting out of some areas of the Social Charter the reality is different.</P>
      <P>A report in one of this morning's English newspapers states that the level of pay of UK workers is way below that of workers in southern Italy and that the productivity of UK workers is one of the lowest in Europe.  Motivated employees, buttressed by proper social legislation which includes training, are much more likely to be productive and competitive than workers who are underpaid.</P>
      <P>The UK has decided to opt out of certain sections of the Social Charter for its own reasons.  I do not regard this as a threat as the level of productivity of Irish workers is much higher than that of their English counterparts.  The level of productivity in the UK has been steadily decreasing in recent years.</P>

      <P>In view of our high level of unemployment, will the Minister agree that we should implement this directive without delay?  If the requirements of the directive were properly observed the level of overtime would be reduced substantially, which should automatically lead to the creation of very badly needed jobs.  If those jobs are to be created we will have to consider all the options, including job sharing and a reduction in the amount of overtime.</P>

      <P>As Minister Quinn said in his reply to a question on 9 February 1994, the measures already taken by the ESB to address this problem include a new invoicing system and confining the promotion of electrical appliance sales to three billing periods annually, which the Minister for Transport, <Col N="644" /> Energy and Communications considers a reasonable balance between the needs of consumers and other applicance retailers.</P>
      <P>While I do not intend to request the Competition Authority to investigate this matter I would remind the Deputy that the amendment to the Competition Act, 1991, which we will propose shortly, will empower the Competition Authority to carry out investigations on its own initiative and to act on complaints from the public.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge this matter was raised on a previous occasion.  Is he aware there is a vast difference between ESB electrical outlets in Dublin and other areas, where there tends to be more competition?  Many of the small retailers who sell electrical products in small rural towns find it difficult to run their business against this competition.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an ongoing issue.  In 1989 the Director of Consumer Affairs investigated the matter and found the ESB was not acting unfairly.  The Dirctor found that it was involved in retailing as a matter of public policy rather than competition.  The Deputy will recall that in 1992 the Minister for Energy requested the ESB to cease using the billing system for retailing purposes.  I would remind the Deputy there was upset in some quarters, namely the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, some trade unions and indeed, publicly which resulted in a decision being taken to request the ESB to initiate a new invoicing system.  Two bills could be put in the one envelope but they had to be separate bills for the product and the ESB was confined to using the bills for three of the billing periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy <Col N="645" /> and Communications is of the view that is a reasonable balance.  If the Dáil agrees on the legislation to amend the Competition Bill, members of the public who feel this issue should be addressed on a competition basis can do so directly.

We also wish to ensure fair competition and full protection for the consumer.  Has the Minister any indication of the level of complaints from the general public on this issue or is the substantial body of representations from the retailers?</P>

      <P>Most of the representations appear to be from the retailers and the ESB.  The groups involved, rather than the consumers, appear to be exercising their rights on the issue.  There is no evidence of any accumulated complaints or requests from consumers on the issue but we will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and No. 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the implementation of the Culliton report, the Government agreed with the recommendation of the Moriarty Task Force that a commercial, services oriented structure for both the Companies Registriation Office and the <Col N="646" /> Patents Office should be developed.  To this end the operations of both offices were reviewed throughout 1993.  Arising from that review, it was clear there was an urgent need in both offices for additional staff to ensure their efficient operation and maximise their revenue earning potential.  Additional staff are being recruited for both offices during the course of 1994.  The new staffing structures will help to ensure that both offices operate in a more effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government agree that the necessary decisions would be taken by June 1993 with a view to achieving a more commercial and service oriented structure for these companies? Almost nine months later the Minister is still in the process of review and examining staffing structures within those offices.  Were we misled when the Government announced it would observe the schedules set out in the Moriarty report?  Why have they not been observed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more happening than that for which the Deputy is giving us credit.  We carried out the review during 1993 and staff for these offices are being recruited throughout 1994.  Our main concern is providing a service to companies and to patent applicants. The Companies Office revenue, for example, in 1992 was approximately £2.1 million.  The anticipated revenue for 1994 could be perhaps £2.8 or £3 million. That does not, of course, include the funds going directly to the Revenue Commissioners by way of stamp duty which amount to an additional £1.7 million. Without the new staff in 1994 it would be difficult to earn this revenue.  We should have revenue of over £4 million.  The review has been completed and as a result additional staff are being recruited with the specific target of earning additional revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's intention to change the status of these offices in some way?  Will they have <Col N="647" /> greater independence from Government in future?  Will they become executive agencies?  What will be their status in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present they are self-standing units within the Department. There are no proposals at this time to make them semi-State companies.  We considered that option carefully throughout 1993 and came to the conclusion that it was not practical.  We will continue to monitor that but earning revenue, rather them the structure, is our main concern. We are not at the stage where they can be made semi-State companies, although we might examine the idea of making them executive offices with a little more autonomy.  Once the staffing situation is sorted out and the revenue is flowing, we can consider other possibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 49, 73, 91, 95 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the findings of the NESC report referred to by Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>The importance of raising the skills levels of the Irish labour force and the certification of those skills were among the main recommendations of Cullition and Moriarty.</P>
      <P>In both the Programme for a Partnership Government and its response to the conclusions of the Moriarty report, the Government gave clear recognition to the need to increase radically the focus of Irish industry towards certified training for management and all workers.  The Government has set a number of specific objectives to support this process.  These include the standards-based apprenticeship system, with which this House is familiar &mdash; particularly the Deputies opposite &mdash; and the creation of a National Education and Training Certification Board which will develop a certification system.  We hope this new board will be in place shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also working <Col N="649" /> closely with the Department of Education and FÁS to ensure that the vocational training and educational courses available are relevant to the needs of employers.  FÁS has established an industry division which was one of the recommendations of Culliton.</P>
    <P>The industrial training committee has been established and it has produced a number of reports on textiles, clothing, chemical and allied products and engineering sectors.  We will shortly have a report on the food, drink and tobacco sector.  These reports are instrumental in identifying what needs to be done to increase the level of training in those sectors.  We recognise, of course, that further follow-up action is required.</P>
    <P>Primarily, the responsibility for training those at work rests with employers. Increased investment by employers in training and retraining is of paramount importance in the context of the Single Market.  The Government will continue to play an important role in promoting and encouraging the provision of training by employers for their employees.</P>
    <P>A question was asked about training vouchers.  Deputies should be aware that references to training credits or vouchers in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment must be read in the overall context of the White Paper.  In this regard, the Commission has called on everyone &ldquo;to conduct analysis of our strengths and weaknesses and to adapt behaviour to the rapid changes taking place in today's world&rdquo;.  I can confirm that the Government will play a full role in that process.  We are not at all sure that the issues of vouchers would enhance the choice and diversity of training available but I remain to be persuaded on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that her reply is a great deal of flannel, without any proposals for encouraging a greater level of training by industrial firms in Ireland?  Will she also agree that the Government gave a commitment that by July 1993 the Department of Enterprise and Employment would produce such proposals but that has not happened. <Col N="650" /> What the Minister recited here is a rehash of projects we knew were in the pipeline.  Surely it is incumbent on the Government &mdash; if it is to pursue the Culliton agenda &mdash; to meet these deadlines and bring forward proposals as promised? The National Education and Training Certification Board, the national standards authority, which the Minister says will soon be appointed, was to have been appointed and operational by October 1993.  Therefore, we are not meeting the deadlines we set ourselves.  Will the Government admit it cannot meet its deadlines, set new ones and adhere to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we have fallen behind in the establishment of the National Education and Training Certification Board, but we hope to publicly announce the proposal for its establishment shortly.  With regard to industry training, quite an amount of work has been done, sector by sector within FÁS, the relevant reports have been published and make very interesting reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about Culliton and Moriarty; I have responsibility for that section.  On the matter of training for industry, we have commissioned FÁS to bring out a sector by sector report.  It did so in the case of those I announced on textiles, clothing, chemical and allied products and the report on the food, drink and tobacco sectors will come to hand shortly.  Based on those very fine reports we can clearly identify employers' needs and I should like to hear Deputy Richard Bruton's viewpoint.  Surely there must also be a willingness by employers to engage in training, to realise that it is essential not just today and tomorrow but for the future, not alone of their firms, but the sector in general.  We do not have that strong training ethic in any sector of our industry.  It is the Government's job to seek to cajole and persuade employers along that path but sometimes <Col N="651" /> employers are reluctant to do so.  They would prefer to be given the money to do the training.  I do not know whether that constitutes the right approach.  We are moving along, albeit at a slower pace than outlined by Moriarty, the identified path to encourage greater training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My views are not under scrutiny but the Minister's stewardship of the responsibility she was given under the Moriarty report.  Will she confirm that the Government has no proposals for encouraging a greater level of training by firms although it was promised they would be completed by July 1993?  Will she agree that citing sectoral reports FÁS may conduct, which have comprised an ongoing feature of their work, is not responding to the Department's clear commitment to produce proposals to encourage training by industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not accept what Deputy Bruton said because I was referring to new sectoral reports. Very eminent people undertook voluntarily to head the various sectors of industry, came into FÁS and gave a strong voluntary commitment to undertake those sectoral reports.  I launched them and each is now endeavouring to identify the nature of skills needed within the respective industrial sectors, which was part of the brief given to the committee and its chairman in each of the sectors.  It is my understanding that that is the proper way to progress.  The Deputy said it was the responsibility of my Department, FÁS comes within the remit of my Department which clearly has the legislative remit, and through Culliton and Moriarty, to attend to the needs of the various sectors.  I freely admit we have not adhered to the time limit for the establishment of the National Education and Training Certificate Board but I assure the House that we hope to announce those proposals very shortly.  I should like to think that one of my greatest tasks &mdash; to which end I have toured the country with IBEC engaging in various discussions &mdash; is to <Col N="652" /> foster and encourage the growth of commitment to training within firms generally. That is a prerequisite to dealing with each individual sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that Moriarty did not envisage FÁS sectoral reports but that the Department of Enterprise and Employment would lay proposals before industry which would deal with issues involved in funding an increased level of training for work, especially upgrading the skills of those at work.  It as also clear that the Government was to lay down these proposals before July 1993.  The Minister of State did not list any such proposals.  Will she agree, therefore, to set a new schedule and deliver on the promised proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Bruton because legislation clearly designates FÁS as the agency responsible for the training needs of the employed and the unemployed.  That is the nature of the legislation and that was recognised in the Culliton report.  I mean by &ldquo;the Government&rdquo;, the Government working in tandem with the agencies under its aegis, in this case FÁS under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It would be one thing if I had said we fulfilled our remit but I admitted there has been a slippage in regard to the establishment of the National Education and Training Certification Board and that I hoped to produce proposals in that respect very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned two sectors, food, drink and tobacco and the chemical industry.  Will she accept that, within those sectors, training grants and schemes have been available for the past 25-30 years?  Furthermore, will she agree that the two sectors she picked out are probably the most advanced &mdash; technologically and in training &mdash; of all the relevant sectors? Will she respond to the other element of the question, what encouragement is given to service-type industries where the <Col N="653" /> same mechanism for training was not fostered or engendered in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I picked those because they were areas in respect of which sectoral studies had been completed.  The one on the services industry is very interesting because, as the Deputy knows, there was a recent report on the overall services arena and its job-generating potential.  Inherent in that report was the need for training within the services industry also, a matter to which I have certainly given thought. Clearly we must initiate studies to ascertain how that can be delivered.</P>

      <P>There is no need for me to tell Deputy Richard Bruton, Deputy Quill or indeed others about that because we had a very full debate on the matter recently.

      <P>Resulting from meetings of the Minister of State with the Construction Industry Federation, does she anticipate that additional young people will be taken into apprenticeship schemes within the construction industry in the forthcoming year?  If so, how many additional places will there be?  Has the Minister an assurance that people who commence apprenticeship courses will complete them?  I understand the fall off rate is very high.  We are deluding ourselves if we take encouragement from the smaller number who commence apprenticeships because almost 50 per cent do not complete the course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>An unacceptable number of apprentices do not complete their studies.  When I am asked to provide more apprenticeship places I ask about the number of people who complete their studies and those who fall out of the system.  I have had four meetings with the Construction Industry Federation.  They have had many difficulties within their own industry.  Construction contracts are often broken down into subcontracts which in turn are broken down into further subcontracts.  A one man contractor may not be able to take on an apprentice. This results in many difficulties in the construction industry.  Nevertheless, they have exhibited goodwill.  FÁS tutors throughout the country literally beat the bushes to find an employer who will sponsor an apprentice.  The difficulty is to get them.  I am not happy that an apprentice can be arbitrarily let go.  I do not know what has happened to the old idea of responsibility for training a young person in one's care.  We are making slow progress.  I was pleased to note in the discussions which ended last Friday between officials of my Department and the EU Commission that the new standards-based apprenticeship system was highly recommended.  The question they asked was when it would apply in all the other spheres.  I was very pleased at that.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister meet with the industry on a regular basis or will she put some formal mechanism in place to monitor progress?  Unless that is done there will be no major change in the prospects for young people who want to get into apprenticeships.  Deputy Deenihan said some time ago that it is easier for a young person to get into university then to get into an apprenticeship.  If that continues, future prospects are grim.</P>

Arrangements have been made to commence discussions with Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, ESB, the Army and county councils, all of whom have apprentices in place, to encourage them to take on more.  I have arranged to have ongoing meetings with the Construction Industry Federation.  A measure I suggested &mdash; at which they did not demur and which is contained in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work &mdash; was that we would seek to have an arrangement whereby construction companies tendering for water and sewerage schemes, hospitals, schools and so on would, as part of their contract price, provide for a number of apprentices.</P>

      <P>Most people insure against illness.  Will the Minister agree that in most cases people who commit suicide are ill?  Will the Minister emphasise to insurance companies the importance of a sympathetic approach to the families of suicide victims?  Will it be possible to introduce legislation at some future date to compel companies to honour claims in these cases?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  I am happy that the action I have taken was the correct approach. There is no difficulty with policies taken out today as they will normally have a two-year exclusion clause.  That is a sensible clause.  Policies taken out 20 years or 30 years ago did not always have that clause; they had a clause which excluded suicide.  I have asked the insurance companies <Col N="657" /> to consider applying today's more humane approach to existing policies, whenever incepted.  If they agree there is no question of legislation being required.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in most cases insurance companies act sensibly and sensitively in this difficult area.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann unites in its condemnation of last night's IRA mortar bomb attack at Heathrow Airport, which could have resulted in serious loss of life and substantial damage to property, and calls on everybody to now commit themselves to the peace process clearly and unambiguously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and all the elected representatives of the Irish people in this House condemn the foolish and criminally irresponsible IRA mortar bomb attack at Heathrow Airport.  I have no idea what were the <Col N="699" /> intentions of those who authorised and perpetrated this attack, but they know, as well as everybody else, that a certain number of such attacks go horribly wrong and result not merely in damage to property but in human carnage with random victims.</P>
    <P>I do not think our anger should be any less on this occasion because, fortunately, there was no loss of life.  How often have we heard the leaders of related organisations profess deep regret on such occasions when there is loss of innocent life and try to pass the blame onto the civil authorities?  Persistence in such attacks, when the risks and the probabilities are well known, make such expressions of regret utterly hollow.  The only test of sincerity is for all such attacks to stop forthwith.</P>
    <P>Each day 2,500 Aer Lingus passengers pass through Heathrow Airport and there are other passengers on other flights to and from Irish airports, also including a comparable number on the shuttle to and from Belfast.  Hundreds of thousands of people of all nationalities and all ages also pass through Heathrow each day.  The loss of human life, regardless of nationality, does nothing whatever to advance any political cause, indeed it tends to dishonour it in the eyes of the world.  The vast majority of the Irish people want nothing whatever to do with this manner of making a political argument and regard such actions as utterly repugnant.  It is time that the people concerned listened to the voice of Irish democracy if they ever wish to be accepted as a true part of it.</P>
    <P>In political terms such actions as last night's are not merely criminal; they are also stupid and politically naive.  Many people, for example, have very legitimate criticisms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was renewed last night. Actions like last night's simply cut the ground from under those making the case for reform.  Actions like last night's have no contribution to make to moving forward the broader peace process.  They simply make attitudes more rigid and reinforce a common determination that <Col N="700" /> democratic society will not yield in any way to violence.</P>
    <P>Let there be no illusions.  There is a place at the negotiating table only when violence ceases for good, not before. That applies both to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and to participation in all-party negotiation.  In any case, none of the political problems of Northern Ireland can be resolved bilaterally between the British Government and Sinn Féin to the exclusion of the Irish Government and the other democratic parties in the North.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Sinn Féin, Mr. Tom Hartley, yesterday called for gestures of goodwill to move forward the peace process. What sort of goodwill gesture was the bomb attack at Heathrow?  Where is the evidence of Republican goodwill? This House utterly rejects attempts at political blackmail.  Those who talk at great length about their commitment to peace must demonstrate their bona fides by deeds as well as words.</P>
    <P>The Joint Peace Declaration of 15 December 1993 has removed the last semblance of justification for political violence.  It has removed any conceivable justifiable cause for continued armed conflict.  The only reminder that the bombs last night provide unfortunately are further evidence for the widespread belief that the continued activities of the IRA are one of the main causes of the continued conflict.</P>
    <P>A fair and honourable framework for a democratic resolution of the problem of Northern Ireland without coercion and without physical force vetoes on any side has been laid out in the declaration.  In the tree months I have heard no coherent case made against the declaration.  Nor do I believe there is any genuine failure to grasp or understand its implications, some of which may be disliked.  Its terms have been amply clarified by both Governments at this stage.  We in this House do not recognise that there is any valid electoral or any other sort of mandate North or South for continued violence. People cannot expect full recognition of their democratic role when they are associated with, or involved in <Col N="701" /> justifying, anti-democratic activities like the bomb attack on Heathrow.  The time has come for a clear decision on peace to be made and for an end to prevarication and procrastination.</P>
    <P>Democracy is indivisible.  If parties want to play a full part in the democratic process and to take part in direct negotiations, armed struggle by associated organisations must be definitively disowned and ended clearly and unambiguously. That is the unanimous will of this House, representing two-thirds of the Irish people on this island.</P>
    <P>The two Governments remain fully committed to the peace process and to the Joint Declaration which will not be changed or discarded.  I remain confident that peace will sooner or later be embraced by all as I do not believe there is any real alternative.  It can be clearly seen that violence is the biggest cul de sac of them all.  In the meantime, we are continuing to work with the British Government to speed up progress in the talks process and to enable their full-scale resumption.</P>
    <P>The declaration will remain the basis for peace and for finding a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  I call on everyone to recognise the utter futility of attacks such as last night's and to join in addressing the real and difficult challenge of making progress by political means and by democratic persuasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to my proposal that this House express, on an all-party basis, its condemnation of this new low in the IRA terror campaign.  The Heathrow bomb attack maximised the international embarrassment of Ireland and of all who are proud to call themselves Irish by inconveniencing and putting at risk the lives of travellers from all over the world using one of the world's busiest airports. One must consider in particular the fears of tourists and infrequent travellers some of whom may have been on their way through Heathrow to visit this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Heathrow attack by the IRA increases the likelihood of broad political support for the renewal and rigorous <Col N="702" /> enforcement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain as it affects the Irish community living there.  This IRA attack will result in the maximum harassment of Irish people, from the North and the South, living in Britain and, because of the pressures on the police, will further increase the risk of miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>This IRA attack on Heathrow has demonstrated that the so-called peace process as envisaged by the Republican movement is not a peace process but a war.  This war process of the Republican movement is accompanied by hypocritical speeches which incant the word peace without showing any discernible intention of making peace.  The Heathrow bombing yesterday was part of the armed struggle of the so-called Republican movement.  All Sinn Féin councillors and candidates for office, both here and in Northern Ireland, are bound by a Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis resolution to give support to this armed struggle, of which the Heathrow bombing was a calculated part.  That resolution remains in place.  Avowed supporters of this armed struggle are allowed to speak on Irish radio and television and granted visas to visit the United States, unhindered by any negative representations from the Irish Government.  I am looking forward, now that section 31 has been suspended, to seeing Sinn Féin spokespersons on television unreservedly condemn this attack on Heathrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far such Sinn Féin persons as have appeared on the media have refused to condemn this attack.  I call on Mr. Adams, Mr. Hartley, Mr. McGuinness, Mr. McLoughlin and all these recently discovered household names in the Republican movement to use their access to the mass media, for which they agitated for so long, to say in plain and simple language without any need for supplementary questions or prevarication that they condemn without reservation this appalling attack which <Col N="703" /> put at risk the lives of thousands of tourists and travellers from all over the world passing through this great cross-roads of the world, Heathrow Airport.</P>
      <P>What possible contribution to the good name of Ireland or to the rectification of any injustice could this cold and calculated attack be?  These people have their chance to speak and to condemn but so far they have remained silent.  I am worried that the hopeful prospects that followed from the Downing Street Joint Declaration are now evaporating. As every day passes party positions in Northern Ireland are moving further apart.  I regret the apparent Unionist reluctance to re-engage in the three strand talks process as it is only in a three strand context that all the problems can be addressed.  We need a radical departure to get this faltering process back on track.</P>
      <P>A vacuum is opening up and it must be filled by constitutional politicians taking responsible action.  Politicians on this side of the Border should take the lead.  That is why I propose that an all-party commission of the Dáil parties be established to undertake two separate but interdependent tasks.  The first is for those on this side of the Border to identify the steps that must be taken to enhance the Nationalists' identity in Northern Ireland in the cultural, social and political life of that part of the island.  Evidence should be taken in the Dáil by that commission from Northern Nationalists on matters such as the status of the Irish language in schools, in public offices and on all public signs throughout Northern Ireland.  Their views should be taken on the teaching of history in Northern Ireland and the attitudes of the security forces on a daily basis and all aspects of daily life affecting Nationalists in Northern Ireland where the principle of equality of esteem is not being fully met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political structures are, of course, important and participation by politicians is important but many other aspects of daily life affect people who never wish to become politicians, where improvement <Col N="704" /> can be made to the equality of esteem of both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>North-South links could also be studied by such a body and practical ideas could be put on the table.  I regret that in spite of all the talk on North-South links, the Irish Government has so far tabled no proposal in Strand II of the BrookeMayhew talks process in regard to North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>The second task of the all-party commission, which is interdependent on the first, would be to study simultaneously Unionists' concerns, particularly their worries about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The Unionists' concerns need to be heard clearly on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The all-party commission could look at alternative wordings to those Articles of the Constitution.  This work, done on this side of the Border, would be useful in preparing the ground for the eventual outcome of the three-strand talks process when we will have to consider definitive changes to Articles 2 and 3.  By looking in advance at Unionists' concerns about these Articles, while at the same time looking at Nationalists' problems in Northern Ireland, we would be showing a balanced approach and creating the conditions for acceptance by both communities of the adjustments necessary to meet the concerns of the other.  This process on this side of the Border on an all-party basis would help create broad acceptance of the constitutional changes we will eventually have to make.  It would also convince Unionists that we are really serious about this matter and would encourage them to be more full-hearted in the interim in getting back into the talks process.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the all-party commission would put the emphasis on making practical progress by constitutional methods and would avoid the situation where constitutional politicians, who have a democratic mandate from the people, seem to be hanging on every word and syllable of people who have never been elected about the possibility that they might be about to adjust their <Col N="705" /> position in regard to their continued support for the murder campaign.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are elected have to take a back seat while everybody is waiting for the word from Gerry or some other gentleman who is not an elected representative.  That is not good for democracy.  It is not right that by our inaction we create a political vacuum that puts those people, whom it would appear support yesterday's bombing at Heathrow, at centre stage.  Let us occupy that ground by taking action.  I propose that an all-party commission that would look simultaneously at Unionists' and Nationalists' concerns and come up with a proposal to deal with them would be more likely to be accepted because their viewpoints would be addressed.</P>
    <P>The proposed all-party commission could be put to work during the four month period between now and the European elections as it would appear that no inter party talks will take place in Northern Ireland on the three-strand basis.  We should be using that time to do something constructive on this side of the Border.  It would assuage the growing pessimism about the process and would demonstrate that constitutional politicians and not men of violence ultimately set the political agenda.</P>
    <P>The all-party commission would pave the way for the wider forum on peace and reconciliation proposed by the Government.  We must have all constitutional parties in Northern Ireland taking part in that forum if it is not to institutionalise rather than reduce the division between the two communities on this island.  An all-Nationalist forum would be a step backwards and not a step forward.  I believe that the all-party commission I am proposing, by addressing both Nationalists' and Unionists' concerns, would increase the likelihood that Unionists would be willing to take part in some way in Government's forum when it is ultimately established.  I put this proposal forward as something supportive of what the Government is trying to do.  I realise it is difficult for a Government to accept a proposal from the Opposition party but if we are to make progress in <Col N="706" /> regard to Northern Ireland we will have to accept other people's ideas.</P>
    <P>I give the Taoiseach credit for signing the Downing Street Declaration and I hope he will show a willingness to accept the proposal I am making in good faith. My proposal is that this House agree to establish an all-party commission on Northern Ireland to consider the concerns of both Unionists and Nationalists so that the vacuum now being filled by the IRA will be filled by constitutional politicians working in public to find a constructive settlement to this difficult issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by the Taoiseach.  The mortar bombing of Heathrow Airport yesterday amply demonstrates that the Provo murder campaign will continue in support of the Provo agenda unless it is faced down by democratic politicians. The policy being pursued by the Government on Northern Ireland since the Downing Street Declaration was signed, which this party values, is failing badly. The Government is making a fundamental strategic error in its dealings with the Provisional movement.</P>
      <P>It was an error to allow access to the airwaves without a renunciation of violence, although I concede the policies pursued in the United Kingdom undermined the policy conducted in this State. It was an error to use the language of the Provisionals such as demilitarisation which implies an acceptance that they had legitimate belligerent status.  It was an error to undermine the British opposition to the granting of a US visa to Gerry Adams.  It was an error to signal an open-ended time-frame for a decision by the Provisionals and it was an error to engage in a pretence at clarification which only encourages the view that negotiation by another name is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these errors it is a matter of regret that the Taoiseach has played a leading role and must take political responsibility. It gives me no pleasure that this failure was predicted, that the approach now being adopted to the Provisionals was challenged, and that the Government's <Col N="707" /> failed policy was chosen and implemented in the face of the facts and in the teeth of historical and political logic.  The Government should understand that the Provisionals will not embrace the Downing Street Declaration. Unless the Provisionals can see a tangible and painful downside to continuing their present strategy of violence coupled with propagandist politics it is illogical to expect them to end that strategy.</P>
    <P>The centre stage position in the political process accorded to the Provisionals by the Government and the media suits them well; it is a reward in itself and carries no downside.  In politics being centre stage is upside; marginalisation is the dread of every politician, even those who combine murder with politics.  The Government's approach carries no threat of marginalisation for the Provisional movement and by putting in abeyance all other forms of political activity on the Northern issue we are sending a clear message to the Provisionals that they are in no danger of being marginalised or excluded from any other political agenda.</P>
    <P>When the leader of the Alliance Party, Dr. John Alderdice, came to Dublin and took the courageous step of indicating his willingness to participate in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation he specifically warned the Taoiseach that the Unionist position on the Downing Street Declaration was under strong internal pressure and was likely to crumble.  He suggested that the Government should demonstrate there was a process and an agenda which could be pursued independently of Sinn Féin but unfortunately the Taoiseach ignored this advice.</P>
    <P>The recent Unionist retreat, although regrettable, was predictable and predicted. They have given up on the process because it was represented by Dublin as a process that was centred on Sinn Féin participation and, therefore, predicted on rewarding Sinn Féin's political agenda in exchange for a cessation of violence and because they suspect that the Government's real agenda is some form <Col N="708" /> of joint authority.  There will be no reengagement by the Unionists this side of the European elections and probably the marching season.  The reality is that the Provisionals have now created a political and propaganda space of considerable size, of at least six months duration, which would implode immediately if they renounced violence.</P>
    <P>The Provisionals are determined to bring about the <i>de facto</i> negotiations on the issue of ultimate British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.  That remains their sole political agenda.  They remain convinced that Britain will signal withdrawal, either long term or short term, leaving the Unionists to come to terms with the rest of the people on this island. That agenda ignores the inevitable political reaction of the Unionists, that is, if violence produces such results for Nationalism it can do the same for Unionism. Such thinking is the stuff of which another Bosnia is made.</P>
    <P>Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Mr. Roy Bradford, a former Unionist Minister, told us that the only available stick is cross-Border cross-community internment.  He was wrong. The internment option is fraught with risks.  To sustain a settlement it might in certain circumstances be justifiable but to sustain a political vacuum it would be a ghastly mistake.</P>
    <P>Rather than hope that some new security initiative will suddenly and abruptly curtail the Armalite element of the Armalite and ballot box strategy both Governments would be better advised to confront the other element of that strategy, the continuing participation of the Provisionals in politics.  If both Governments made it clear that, say, from January 1995 the democratic process at every level on both sides of the Border, from local authorities to national parliaments, from access to the media to participation in public affairs, would be denied comprehensively to those who combine politics with murder the Provisional movement would be confronted with a real choice as distinct from the bogus debate which they are pretending to conduct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> No one has the right to combine democratic politics with murder and violence; no democracy should have recognised this right and those democracies which have allowed people to combine murder with politics in the past, such as Weimar Germany, have paid the price in the long run.  What the Provos need is a clear indication from democratic politicians that the days of the Armalite and ballot box strategy are coming to an end.  If they want to concentrate exclusively on violence let them do so but they will realise the futility of this.  Democratic politicians should now close the door to those who intend to combine murder with politics into the indefinite future if they are not given their way.</P>
    <P>If the only alternative to abandoning political violence was abandoning the political process and engaging exclusively in paramilitarism the Provisionals would have to doubt whether they would have any future.  In that context the question of internment might then arise.</P>
    <P>In short, the great value of the Downing Street Joint Declaration is that it forms, in political terms a backdrop in which both Governments can put it up to the Provisionals: choose violence or politics but rest assured we will deny the political option to those who do not renounce murder.  This is an offer the Provos can hardly refuse.</P>
    <P>The Armalite and ballot box strategy has thus far worked well for the Provos and the reason is that democratic politicians have tolerated that strategy in what is now evidently the forlorn hope that the political side of the Provisionals would grow out or away from the violent side of that movement.  They cannot and will not because it is the physical force principle that has created and sustained the political face of Provisionalism and without that factor there simply would be no message to be delivered next year at the Killenarden Community Centre, if a meeting is held there.</P>
    <P>There is a positive political agenda which needs to be implemented and there is a potential settlement available based on the cornerstone of the majoritarian principles set out in Article I of the <Col N="710" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Within that principle a viable settlement requires that Northern Ireland be transformed constitutionally into a society owned by both communities.  As long as the constitutional link with Britain is sustained by a majority it must be complemented by a set of institutional links between North and South.  There must be devolution and a sharing of Executive power.  The institutions of Northern Ireland, including the police and courts, must be radically transformed to pursue that end.</P>
    <P>Incremental change will not suffice. The old pattern of Unionist irredentism must be confronted.  If they are accorded as of right the maintenance of the union as long as they represent the majority in Northern Ireland the price they must pay and the price which must be exacted from them is an irreversible shift to a society which is demonstrably open to Nationalists. That process of radical political transformation in Northern Ireland will have to be sustained from outside because Unionists seem to believe &mdash; and yesterday's presentation by Mr. Bradford confirmed this &mdash; that as long as Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom its political and institutional character must be exclusively British.  In that they are deeply mistaken.</P>
    <P>Finally, the tragedy is that a failure of political judgment and will at Government level has let the opportunity which existed 12 weeks ago trickle through our fingers.  The Taoiseach said that the time has come for a clear decision on peace and for an end to prevarication and procrastination.  He did not say that last week, the difference this incident in London made is amazing; now, apparently, we have arrived at the momemt for decision.  The Downing Street Joint Declaration has not lost its value but its value only exists in the hands of decisive politicians who, on behalf of democratic and constitutional values, have the courage and the judgment to face down violence and irredentism.  So far it appears that such a political resolution is sadly lacking.</P>

      <P>The IRA mortar attack on Heathrow Airport last night is just the latest &mdash; and perhaps most ominous &mdash; sign that Gerry Adams and his colleagues are not genuinely interested in the peace process and that their prolonged process of consideration of the Downing Street Declaration is a device to keep their discredited organisation at the centre of attention.  Sinn Féin and the IRA talk peace, but continue to wage war.</P>
      <P>It is hard to imagine a more dangerous, anti-civilian action, than this attack on the busiest airport in Europe.  This is the airport where 'planes take off and land every 30 seconds and through which tens of thousands of people pass each day. If one of these mortars had struck an incoming plane or hit a terminal building, the carnage would have been unimaginable. What last night's attack shows is that, at worst, the IRA wanted to kill large numbers of civilians and that, at best, they did not care if large numbers of people died.</P>
      <P>The attack and its aftermath has all the hypocrisy that has been a feature of so many other IRA actions in Britain. Vague and imprecise warnings were given, but the statement issued by the IRA claiming responsibility for the attack, a statement issued not in Belfast, or Derry or Crossmaglen, but here in Dublin, as usual tries to blame the British authorities for failing to act speedily enough.  No doubt if there had been casualties, the IRA would have attempted to divert blame and responsibility to the British authorities for &ldquo;failing to heed the warning&rdquo; or &ldquo;failing to respond quickly enough&rdquo; as they claimed was the case, for instance, in the Warrington bombings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also no coincidence that this attack was timed to coincide with the vote in the British House of Commons on the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  This was not some act of defiance <Col N="712" /> on the part of the IRA, but a cynical attempt to ensure that the Act would be renewed and to undermine the position of those in Westminster who were seeking changes to the Act.  The fact is that Sinn Féin/IRA do not want to see measures like the Prevention of Terrorism Act ended.  Its sweeping provisions provide them with a propaganda weapon and enables them to paint a totally distorted picture abroad of the situation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although this was the first major attack in Britain since the signing of the Downing Street Declaration, there has been no relief for the people of Northern Ireland where the IRA has continued to bomb and murder.  What it all points to is that the hard men are still very much in control of the Provos and that they do not intend to voluntarily end the violence.</P>
    <P>You will search in vain through the acres of newspaper coverage of the recent Sinn Féin Árd Fheis to find even one word of criticism &mdash; never mind condemnation &mdash; of the continuing IRA campaign. Again on RTE radio this morning Mr. Gerry Adams declined repeated invitations to condemn the attack.  Mr. Adams said it was a reminder &ldquo;that the core issues have not been addressed&rdquo;. When this &ldquo;Provospeak&rdquo; is translated in plain English what Mr. Adams is saying is &ldquo;do what we demand, or the violence and killing will continue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is now time for the two Governments to urgently reassess this indulgent approach to Sinn Féin/IRA.  The Taoiseach said this morning that his Government is not being dictated to by any violent organisation, but it has seemed to many people over the past three months that both Governments have been driven into a state of political paralysis while a violent organisation engages in what Fr. Denis Faul accurately describes as a phoney peace process.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams and his colleagues have been facilitated, promoted, encouraged and provided with detailed clarification of the Downing Street Declaration. Every speech made by representatives of Sinn Féin has been parsed and analysed and given the most benign interpretation <Col N="713" /> possible.  Indeed, the extraordinarily indulgent attitude shown to Sinn Féin/IRA is in stark contrast to the strident and dismissive reponse of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to the recent proposals made by the Leader of the Official Unionist Party, Mr. James Molyneaux, for the establishment of a devolved government in Northern Ireland, backed up by a bill of rights.</P>
    <P>I am now very concerned that unless the British and Irish Governments act urgently and decisively the whole Downing Street project will founder.  The Provos have been indulged for too long. They have had plenty of time to consider the declaration and have been given all the clarification they could reasonably require.  Yet almost three months on, they are still refusing to say whether they will accept the principles of the declaration, which is supported by 97 per cent of the population &mdash; and in the meantime the killing and violence go on.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Sinn Féin/IRA leadership have decided they will not accept the declaration, but do not want to say so because they want to retain the position at centre stage which they have occupied since December.  This was the clear message from its Árd Fheis; it is the clear message from the continuing violence; and it is also evident from the significant change in the Provo position articulated again on RTE radio today by Mitchell McLaughlin, from requesting clarification of the declaration to demanding direct negotiations with the British Government, and they are demanding this before they end violence. That cannot and must not be conceded. It was not conceded in the case of the ANC or in the case of the PLO; it cannot be conceded in the case of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>The Provos cannot be allowed to destroy the right of the people of these islands to live in peace, free from paramilitary murder and violence.  All the opinion polls taken since December show overwhelming support for the declaration and unequivocal opposition to the IRA.  Séamus Mallon remarked last week that there is a mistaken view that <Col N="714" /> the Joint Declaration was written for Sinn Féin.  It was not.  It was written for all the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The two Governments must stop indulging the Provos and, with the democratic parties in Northern Ireland, start building rapidly on the principles of the Joint Declaration.  If Sinn Féin want to be involved, it knows what is required of it.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people want peace.  All members want peace. We want to share in the Taoiseach's optimism, but optimism will not bring peace, decisive political leadership by the Irish and British Governments will bring peace.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say once more that the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, rejects the use of violence and justification of violence from wherever it comes and abhors all acts of violence, including the mortar bomb attack at Heathrow Airport.  It is important to emphasise this point over and over again so that all affected by violence in this and other countries realise that those who speak here condemn all acts of violence even though we do not suspend the business of the Dáil each time a father is shot in bed or the mother of a family from another tradition is killed as she goes about her daily business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to get worked up about the hard work and bridge building across borders and cities.  However, as public representatives, we must not be distracted from the peace process by the bloody elements of society who put their faith in coercion, cowardly killing and bombing.  It is becoming clear that the peace process will be as long and painful as the act of last night was instant but horribly painful and barbaric.  It is becoming clear that if progress is to be made, it must move beyond knee-jerk condemnation.  In that regard I support the efforts of the Government to bring about an end to the violence.  It is also becoming clear that cross community organisations working through peaceful means are not receiving as much attention <Col N="715" /> from the Government and much of the Opposition as the headline grabbing people who carry out and condone murder.</P>
    <P>I hope the example of parties in this House will be taken up by the supporters of violence.  A radical transformation of politics took place here in the 1920s when the gun was almost taken out of politics. I urge those who still follow the path of the gun to see that it is possible to live another way.  It is time another transformation in politics took place on both islands and I look forward to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question approximately four weeks ago and in his reply the Minister endeavoured to be helpful.  I am concerned that it will be three weeks before we can table questions to the Minister for the Marine again, but this matter is so important it cannot wait that long.  It must be addressed immediately.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 3,500 full-time fishermen and between 4,000 and 5,000 part-time fishermen here.  Full-time fishermen &mdash; or trawler men &mdash; are in great difficulties because they have had practically no income for the past four months, yet, they must make ends meet, not an easy task without an income.  Even if their boats are not at sea they must pay insurance costs, maintain their boats and meet many other overheads.  Has the Minister submitted a plan to Brussels? How much aid will those fishermen receive and when can they expect to receive it?  I understand Bord Iascaigh Mhara has been given the job of assessing the losses fishermen have incurred in the past four months.  Has that assessment been concluded and a plan submitted to Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the aid will probably come from the national Exchequer and there is nothing wrong with that.  A combination <Col N="716" /> of EU and Exchequer funding would be an ideal solution.  The French have given large amounts of money to their fishermen over the years.  A few weeks ago the French Government allocated a sum of 300 million francs to its fishermen and that is only one in a series of aid programmes implemented by them.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I spoke to a fisherman from Dunmore East who had not earned one penny for the past four months.  He and his brother own a 35-foot boat and engage in gill netting.  They have not been able to go out to sea.  Some 90-foot boats have gone to sea, but only on a few occasions in the past few months.  Those fishermen are in despair and need immediate financial assistance.  I understand the Irish Fishermen's Organisation indicated that a sum of approximately £13 million was necessary to compensate fishermen who have suffered great losses. I do not know if that figure is realistic but millions of pounds are needed.  The position is desperate.</P>
    <P>In reply to my parliamentary question the Minister stated that he was having discussions with the Minister for Social Welfare to ascertain if legislation passed by the House some time ago could be enacted urgently, which might be of some assistance.  Has any progress been made in that regard?  The fishermen who have gone out to sea in the past week or two following an improvement in the weather have told me that they are receiving catastrophic prices for their fish.  The bottom has fallen out of the market.</P>
    <P>In a time of shortage one would think that the price should be high, but apparently the void which existed during the past four or five months has been filled by imports from third countries and EFTA countries.  A great deal of fish is being imported from and through Norway.  The markets which the fishermen had before the bad weather have been taken over by imports from the Third World countries. It is a matter of grave concern that we should be importing fish into the European Union.  Perhaps that is why the French demonstrated so vociferously. Such imports from Third World countries <Col N="717" /> are destroying markets in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The livelihoods of 350,000 men and their families are at stake.  Will the Minister give them an indication immediately of the financial support they will receive from the Government and the Commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in reply to a parliamentary question on this subject I stated that I have asked Bord Iascaigh Mhara to report on the nature, severity and extent of hardship experienced by fishermen as a result of the extended period of bad weather.  Its initial findings confirm that a considerable amount of fishing activity which normally would take place during the winter months, has been prevented due to the prevailing weather conditions.  This has been particularly evident in respect of the demersal or whitefish fleet which fishes off the north-west and west coast.</P>
      <P>BIM is urgently assessing the position with a view to identifying the vessel owners who have been hardest hit and the board is to report back with a detailed analysis in the next two weeks.  It is important to state that this is the first time in the history of the State a Minister for the Marine addressed this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the worst weather in living memory, as far as fishermen are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, we have not; the weather was also bad in bygone days.  This is the first time such an issue has been addressed by a Minister for the Marine and I am concerned about the matter.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that until I study the report of Bord Iascaigh Mhara it would be neither appropriate nor helpful to speculate on the level of assistance which may be deemed necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the figures which have been mentioned in relation to the level of assistance necessary are simply unrealistic and may have given rise to unfounded expectations on the part of <Col N="718" /> some fishermen.  From the outset, therefore, it should be understood that only those vessels which would normally fish during the period in question will be considered. Small vessels which do not fish during the winter months will not be considered within the scope of any package that may be put in place.</P>
    <P>The problems experienced by fishermen, especially those who fish for whitefish, have been compounded by the recent poor market conditions which have been due mainly to cheap third country imports.  I have pressed the Commission on the matter and, as a result of my efforts to highlight this problem, minimum prices and stricter entry controls at points of entry have been imposed in respect of imports of whitefish into the European Union.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to closely monitor the market position and will continue to seek the introduction of more effective measures by the Union to combat what amounts to the dumping of fish on the market.  However, any aid measures introduced will be specifically designed to address the problems arising from the poor weather conditions.  The market position is a separate matter requiring a long term resolution at European Union level.</P>
    <P>I have written also to the European Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr. Palleokrassas, drawing his attention to the problems and seeking his assistance to deal with short term difficulties as well as a debate on the setting up of a long term mechanism to handle this type of exceptional occurrence.  I understand a response from the Commissioner is likely to issue shortly.  Sometimes one may have to ask the Commissioner three or four times for a resolution to a problem.  I hope to place on the agenda of the forthcoming Fisheries Council meeting the provision of ease and aid to fishermen who are in financial difficulties resulting from the bad weather of the past four to five months.</P>

He informed me that the response to any such proposal is mainly negative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is so kind. I asked the Minister for Social Welfare to examine all the existing mechanisms under the social welfare code and supplementary welfare allowance scheme so as to ensure that where the relevant conditions are met income support will be provided to those in special need.  I assure the Deputy also that in devising any scheme to aid fishermen the financial difficulties of crew members as well as those of the vessel owners will be carefully considered and that the process of helping those who genuinely need assistance will be given the highest priority so that the effects of the bad weather will not cause prolonged hardship in the industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report highlighted the counter-productive effects of the widespread existence of grants which encourage a hand-out mentality, instead of fostering the market-led and product oriented enterprise which is needed. At the same time, Culliton pointed to the existence of financing gaps for Irish industry, especially the venture capital type.</P>
      <P>With a view to getting the county enterprise initiative operational as quickly as possible, the county enterprise boards were established, as an interim measure, on an informal basis.  Given this informal status it is not possible for the boards to give loans and take equity in their client firms and they are largely restricted to non-repayable grant aid for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> The question of giving boards power to make loans in lieu of grants is under consideration by my Department.  Conferring such powers upon the State development agencies can present some legal difficulties.  In addition, the administration of loans and equity can prove difficult and requires an extended timescale for the monitoring and recovery of funds.  These matters will be addressed in the context of the decisions on the legal status of the boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The main criteria applied by IDA Ireland in sanctioning grants for new overseas firms are as follows:</P>
      <P>To secure projects at the minimum cost to the State;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To recognise that in virtually every case there is competition from other countries for projects and that this <Col N="661" /> competition effectively sets the level of incentives which have to be offered to secure the projects; to ensure that the economic benefit to Ireland of the project substantially exceeds the cost of securing the project.</P>
    <P>In addition to these criteria IDA Ireland endeavours as much as possible to secure projects which are multi-functional i.e. include research and development, marketing etc., as well as manufacturing.  A good example of this is the XILINX project which Minister Quinn announced on Tuesday 8 March.</P>
    <P>With regard to the percentage of gross output devoted to the purchase of Irish produced goods and services, I presume the Deputy is referring to the gross output of new overseas firms.  The position is that while these firms are actively encouraged to invest in Irish produced goods and services, any compulsory requirement would be contrary to the spirit and letter of the free trading provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  That being said, under the National Development Plan there is an emphasis placed on maximising linkage opportunities which will include the development of networks of complementary indigenous suppliers that can give a comprehensive, integrated supply service to large corporations located in this country or to their associated companies abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I support the extension of the remit of the county enterprise boards to enable them to offer loans for viable projects as part of a range <Col N="662" /> of financial assistance measures for startups and small enterprises.  My Department is considering the financial management systems which would be required to enable county enterprise boards to establish local enterprise funds in the context of the local development programme.  The basis for conferring such powers on the new boards will be addressed in the model memorandum and articles of association which will serve as the basis for their incorporation as companies limited by guarantee.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, county enterprise boards have been urged to review the structure of the financial assistance available in their areas and to consider the possibility of agreeing mechanisms with the financial institutions to act as intermediaries on their behalf in regard to loans and other financial instruments.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the provision of equity capital to Irish industry rests with the private sector but where high risks are involved the State is willing to consider the sharing of that risk. Indeed, State agencies such as Forbairt and SFADCo already provide loan guarantees to manufacturing and internationally-trading services companies as part of their support programmes.  CEBs in turn will be expected to explore the prospects for maximising the resources available for particular enterprise projects from other sources of funding such as those pledged by the banks and other financial institutions in support of the Government's plan for local economic development.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware that the private sector has established a number of loan or venture capital funds to assist small businesses, as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Smurfit job creation equity fund;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the AIB group venture capital fund;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the preferential loan scheme operated by the main banking institutions;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the business innovation fund, which is operated by a private sector commercial management company, provides seed capital for enterprises at <Col N="663" /> the earliest stage of business development. </P>
    <P>Finally, a report recently completed on the potential for venture capital investment by the pensions industry recommends investment by pension funds in commercial type enterprises.  I understand that steps are being taken to give practical effect to this new source of venture funding.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that the provision of opportunities for young people under 21 years and for Youthreach progression participants will now be examined following a review of the FÁS/Department of Social Welfare Options initiative for school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that the eligibility <Col N="664" /> criteria specifying an age limit of 21 years in respect of receipt of unemployment assistance may preclude some younger people who would have been eligible for participation on Teamwork.  However, there is no age limit in respect of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit or lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that Teamwork was designed to provide opportunities for young people on projects of a finite nature.  It was not intended to provide funding for projects on a continuing basis and projects requiring such funding should seek to secure their state resources from the appropriate agencies, which, in the area of health care, would be the Department of Health and the health boards.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the recent UNESCO report, World Science Report 1993, which found that Ireland spends less on research and development, employs fewer researchers and produces fewer inventions than most developed countries; the steps, if any, he intends to take to address these shortcomings, in view of the report's findings that the most successful economies spend more on research and development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reported findings of the UNESCO report referred to by the Deputy.  In fact the organisation for economic co-operation and development have been producing such tables for many years.</P>
      <P>In that context I would have to point out that recent OECD data shows that Ireland's Gross Expenditure on Research, Development (GERD) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has risen steadily, if modestly, in the past 6 years.  In 1987 our GERD/GDP ratio stood at 0.87 per cent, by 1992 it had risen to 1.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the same period the <Col N="665" /> GERD/GDP ratio of the EC as a whole fell from 1.96 per cent to 1.89 per cent. The ratio for North America also fell (from 2.72 per cent to 2.64 per cent) over the same period.  This downward trend is probably due to factors such as a reduction in military research, general cutbacks due to recession etc.</P>
    <P>Overall, however, I accept that, relative to other developed countries, Ireland's spend on research and development is still too low.  This is, in fact, pointed out in the Government's National Development Plan where it is made clear that a further sustained effort is needed to increase the innovative capacity of Irish firms and researchers. Indeed, to the extent that as a country we are investing less in R&amp;D, this places an even greater onus on us all to ensure that funds are deployed to maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>As the House knows I have recently set up a Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council to carry out the most fundamental and far reaching review of science and technology ever conducted in this country.  The Council has been asked to report, in the form of a draft White Paper, before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I would expect that, in their examination they will address, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of funding for R&amp;D and the Government will take this into account in determining future national R&amp;D priorities.</P>

      <P>It would be difficult on my part even to attempt to put figures on what the Deputy is seeking.  Sustainable employment is generated as a result of demand for products or services whether in the public or private sectors. Additional sustainable employment is <Col N="666" /> not generated solely as a result of pay restraint &mdash; there are other factors involved, including non-pay costs and prices, productivity, technological developments, innovation and quality.</P>
      <P>The centralised approach adopted towards pay since 1987 has been beneficial in terms of underpinning improved competitiveness and the generation and maintenance of employment.  It has been advocated by the National Economic and Social Council and has the support of the social partners and the Government.  In addition, the various agreements have allowed for the economic and commercial circumstances of individual firms, employments and industries to be taken into account in local negotiations for the application of centrally agreed pay increases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Linkage Programme exists primarily to assist in expanding sales by Irish suppliers to overseas companies located here.  The IDA (now Forfás) Survey of Irish Economy Expenditures, which is carried out annually, is the main measurement of linkage activity.  The <Col N="667" /> survey relates to companies employing more than 29 people and covers the SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta areas as well as Forfás regions.  The latest year for which survey results are available is 1992.</P>
    <P>The survey estimated that, in 1988 &mdash; the base year of the current National Development Plan &mdash; overseas industry (other than in the food sector) spent £612 million on Irish-produced raw materials and components, £688 million in 1989, £753 million in 1990, £781 million in 1991 and £811 million in 1992, giving a total increase of £199 million over the period to 1992.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a key element of the approach to maximising the benefits of inward investment in the course of the new National Development Plan will be to seek to achieve an increased level of linkages between indigenous and foreign owned industry; in this regard, the objective for the period of the new National Development Plan will be to increase significantly on the 1992 level of such purchases.</P>
    <P>While the National Plan itself does not contain specific targets in relation to linkage, the recently published <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> targets the generation of an additional £200 million in sales from the development of linkage opportunities mainly to electronics companies during the lifetime of the programme, 1994 to 1996 inclusive.  As a means of achieving these targets, the programme advocates the development of networks of complementary indigenous suppliers capable of giving a comprehensive integrated supply service to large corporations located in Ireland and their associated companies abroad.  In addition, the programme proposes that Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála adopt strategies which will address issues of scale, capability and technology levels of Irish companies, as well as encouraging such firms to adopt increasingly demanding standards in areas such as customer service and new product development.</P>

      <P>Most of the sections of my Department deal directly or indirectly with EU matters, as the EU impinges on most areas of their work.  Two sections in my Department, dealing with Structural Funds, are engaged exclusively with EU matters.</P>
      <P>The staffing in those sections is as follows: Principal Officer, 1; Assistant Principals, 4; Higher Executive Officers, 6; Executive Officer, 1; Clerical Assistants, 5. Part of the time of one assistant secretary and of one further principal officer is also devoted to the Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the IDA that since 1990, they have reported on their activities on the basis of actual job creation, actual spending by industry in the Irish economy and the actual payment of grants to client companies.  Grant approval figures are no longer made available as they have tended to confuse <Col N="669" /> the situation in relation to actual payments to companies and hence the actual cost of industrial projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy is probably aware, information in relation to total grants paid by the IDA in 1991 and 1992 is contained in that organisation's annual report and accounts which were laid <Col N="670" /> before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 June, 1992 and 15 July, 1993 respectively. While copies of the reports are available in the Library, I am arranging for copies of a tabular statement giving these details to be circulated with the Official Report.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Taoiseach to Deputy Mary Harney on 22 February last in this connection.  As explained by the Taoiseach, the increase of more than 60,000 over the three years 1994-1996 would be in line with our best performance achieved in the recent past.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the increase is expected to be in services (45,000) while manufacturing will yield a net extra 15,000 jobs and construction a net extra 10,000 jobs. The total net projected increase of 60,000 allows for a continued contraction in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those increases are attainable if the economic conditions underlying the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are maintained particularly as regards competitiveness and operating costs including operating costs for the whole economy, public and private, the <Col N="671" /> removal of inefficiencies and rigidities that may threaten the long-run viability of employment; and the capacity of Irish firms and business to innovate and adjust to the most demanding and changing requirements of markets and of customers, at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>I understand that in response to a question put to my colleague the Minister for Education last month by Deputy Crawford, a breakdown of the national statistics on early school leavers is being compiled.  That information will be given to Deputies O'Hanlon and Crawford as soon as it becomes available.</P>
      <P>I am not clear what Deputy O'Hanlon means with regard to inequity in the system.  Inequity in the education system would be a matter for the Minister for Education.  If he is referring to inequity in the provision of opportunities under the Youthreach programme which is specifically designed to deal with the problem of early school leavers, I would advise the Deputy that the programme is jointly operated by FÁS and the Department of Education.  It provides foundation and developmental type educational opportunities for early school leavers lasting for up to two years and the objective is to enable young people to then return to mainstream education, progress to a mainline training programme or obtain employment.</P>
      <P>The level of provision is determined locally by the FÁS regional director and the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee in the light of the information available on early school leaving patterns from second level schools in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The Deputy may be aware that additional resources were provided in the budget for the Department of Education for the provision of extra Youthreach places in the education sector.  Consultations are taking place with regard to the allocation of these extra places.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 87 which are identical.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contains, within section I, details of initiatives aimed at the maintenance of jobs.  I will not list here everything contained in the chapter on employment protection, but I would draw attention to some particular measures that address the issue from a joint or partnership approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is proposed to amend, in 1994, the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, arising from an <Col N="673" /> EU Council Directive.  The main purpose of the amending legislation, as set out in this directive, is to strengthen the Act's provisions concerning consultation with employee interests about collective redundancy proposals.</P>
    <P>Second, a review will be undertaken, in consultation with the social partners, of the strategies in relation to job retention and specifically of the operation of the Competitiveness and Employment Protection Unit.  The review will address: (a) strategies that can cushion short term economic downturn and structural problems, (b) factors inhibiting early warning of impending closures or redundancies and (c) staff levels and expertise of the unit.</P>

I regard it as important that development workers should not be penalised because they choose to work for a period in a developing country.  My colleague, Minister of State Joan Burton has been active on this issue and I am pleased at the introduction of the Social Welfare No. 2 Bill 1993 which puts in place arrangements extending full social welfare cover to returned volunteers.</P>
      <P>In this context the superannuation entitlements of APSO volunteers are a most important consideration.  This matter is the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and APSO and with other Government Departments.

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, overall, these schemes are considered to be reasonably successful and beneficial and that they have assisted in reducing the levels of the use of alcohol by persons under the age of 18 years.  I am also informed that plans are underway to establish new schemes in other centres.</P>
    <P>However, identity card schemes on their own will not solve the problem of underage drinking, and as I indicated in my reply to a question on 10 November, 1993 (Dáil Debates Volume 435, Cols. 1344-1345), the economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors also need to be considered.  In this regard, the Minister for Health in response to Question No. 183 of 1 March, 1994 outlined the initiatives being undertaken by the Health Promotion Unit of his Department to combat the problems of alcohol abuse.</P>

      <P>Exchequer funding is not available in my Department to support this project after it ceases to be eligible for financial assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>Funding allocated by the European Union Human Resources Initiative &mdash; NOW &mdash; provides for the piloting of innovative approaches to facilitate greater access for women to training, education and employment opportunities in which they are currently underrepresented. Accordingly, projects are assisted only for a predetermined period of time.  The positive experiences gained in implementing projects should subsequently inform mainline training, education and employment policies.</P>
      <P>The current round of funding under the NOW Initiative ends in December, 1994.  The European Commission agreed its overall approach on the future of the Community Initiatives 1994-1999 on 16 February, 1994.  Draft guidelines for the Employment and Development of Human Resources Community Initiative were also adopted.  This initiative will include three strands; one of which will represent a continuation and deepening of the present NOW Initiative.</P>

      <P>Following upon the commencement of operations by county enterprise boards, project applications of the order of £4 million have been approved by the boards.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the abridged version of the Estimates for Public Services 1994 contains a provisional allocation of £9 million for the local enterprise development fund.  I should point out that this initial allocation is based on a calculation of the rate at which commitments made in respect of current applications will require the release of cash payments within the next twelve months.  Therefore, it is not directly related to the aggregate level of commitments taken on by the boards in the same period.  The experience of other local economic initiatives confirms that the rate at which commitments convert into matured liabilities can be fairly slow during the early, start-up phase.</P>
      <P>In the interests of clarifying the position as regards the approval capacity available to each board in the current year, I have set a figure of £500,000 as a ceiling on new commitments to be considered by each board over the next twelve months.  In the meantime, I will be prepared to consider fixing a higher limit for particular boards should circumstances so warrant.</P>

Direct expenditure of £68.634 million was incurred on these programmes in 1993.  In addition, FÁS offers a broad range of evening courses on a self-financing basis.</P>
    <P>FÁS will shortly provide a new programme &mdash; community employment &mdash; which will replace the existing social employment scheme, community employment development programme and Teamwork.  Direct expenditure of £105.933 million was incurred on these programmes in 1993.</P>
    <P>FÁS and my Department monitor all FÁS programmes on a regular basis and any identified shortcomings are rectified as necessary.  I am satisfied that those programmes which are specifically geared towards assisting persons obtain sustainable employment adequately meet this objective bearing in mind the level of employment opportunities available in the economy.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise boards have been established on the basis of the major local authority boundaries.  Their role is to facilitate local enterprise development and to act as a catalyst where no enterprise group is currently active at community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise board initiative <Col N="685" /> is a key component of the local development programme which is an innovative feature of the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i>.  Within the context of the operational programme which will form part of the new community support framework, specific arrangements will be made to ensure co-ordination and a sufficient degree of integration between the range of local initiatives involved in the interests of achieving maximum impact and synergy in their implementation.</P>
    <P>This will be achieved at both the national and local levels.  At the national level, an inter-departmental policy committee on local development has been established, with senior officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Its role will be to promote awareness of and commitment to the programme on the part of the whole range of public agencies.  It will also address issues of co-operation and co-ordination which cannot be resolved satisfactorily at local level.  At a local level, co-operation and liaison with other elements of the programme will be maintained, so as to ensure the appropriate degree of integration in terms of structure, strategic planning, operational and financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the county enterprise <Col N="686" /> boards have been urged in the context of preparing their county enterprise action plans to consider the prospects for developing co-operation in the form of networking between the boards themselves, between the boards and other agencies and between the boards and my Department.  In addition, I would expect the boards to maintain contact with each other on matters relating to their common mandate; to share ideas; to assist each other in solving problems as they arise, particularly where counties are contiguous; and in the promotion of trans-county initiatives.</P>

      <P>The provision and management of services, in the Western Health Board are, in the first instance, a matter for the board. <Col N="692" /> This responsibility necessarily involves the identification by the board of staffing and service needs in the board within the context of the overall resources available to it.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the filling of new and replacement posts in a permanent capacity are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>As essential part of this process is the requirement that agencies prioritise their manpower proposals.  Accordingly, the Western Health Board was requested by my Department towards the end of last year to make a formal submission prioritising its current consultant manpower proposals for its acute hospitals, for consideration in the context of the financial resources available to the board in 1994 and having regard to personnel and service criteria.  The board recently sent to my Department a formal prioritised submission detailing 22 additional consultant posts for its acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>My Department is giving consideration to this submission.  As part of this process, discussions have been initiated and are ongoing between officials of my Department and the Western Health Board in the matter.  The approval of additional consultant posts is being considered in the light of available resources in this context.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by students of the Business and Legal Studies (BBLS) degree course in University College, Dublin, with getting exemptions to facilitate easier access to both Blackhall Place and Kings Inns in view of the fact that a similar course in the University of Limerick has been granted such exemptions; if her attention has been further drawn to the fact that since the inception of the BBLS degree course in 1991 the students have been consistently promised the necessary exemptions, that many of the BBLS students are particularly aggrieved that UCD should initiate such a course without firstly securing exemptions which the course deserves; that the commerce stream of the degree fulfils the requirements necessary to pursue any career in the commercial field but that it is impossible for BBLS students to pursue a legal career notwithstanding the fact that they studied five of the eight obligatory subjects for entrance to Blackhall Place and Kings Inns; the steps, if any, she can take to ensure that the BBLS students get the exemptions for the five particular subjects and that the Law Faculty of UCD provide a short term intensive course which would allow them to study the remaining three subjects; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Both the Kings Inns and the Law Society are autonomous bodies and receive no State funding in respect of their educational activities.  Entry requirements to courses of education and training at these institutions is a matter for the authorities of the institution concerned.</P>
      <P>As a constituent college to the National University of Ireland, University College Dublin is an autonomous self-governing institution.  The Minister for Education has, accordingly, no function in its day to day operation.  Exemptions which professional bodies would give in respect of degrees from the National University of Ireland would be a matter for private negotiation between either the university or college and the bodies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, had the matter taken up with the UCD Law Faculty by the Higher Education Authority.  I understand that the business and legal studies degree course commenced in October 1991 and the first students will graduate in the summer of 1995.  I have also been informed through the Higher Education Authority that the course was not <Col N="694" /> designed to qualify people for the legal profession.  The intention it seems was that graduates with both business and some legal training would be useful to commerical companies.</P>
    <P>The UCD Law Faculty has assured the Higher Education Authority that at no stage were students given to understand that exemptions would be given in respect of this degree by either the Law Society or the Kings Inns.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that because of the extent to which legal matters are covered by the course many students have decided that their future lies in the legal profession rather than in the commercial world.  Accordingly, I am informed that the UCD authorities have applied to the Incorporated Law Society for exemption from the legal elements of their courses.</P>
    <P>Given that the Incorporated Law Society is an autonomous body, however, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in their day to day operations particularly in regard to the qualifications required for entry to training as a solicitor.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Kings Inns, I am informed that the UCD authorities have not applied for exemptions.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in August last I decided to engage independent consultants to review the case for a second level school in the Castleknock area of Dublin 15.  I have accepted the consultants updated report and recommendation that a new school should be provided in Castleknock.  I have also decided, after careful consideration of all the factors involved that the new school in Castleknock will be a community college under the aegis of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>In reaching this decision I had regard also to the views of the parents which were communicated to me through meetings and correspondence with the local action committee, public representatives and the Church of Ireland community. The primary concern expressed in these communications was that a non fee-paying school would be provided in Castleknock as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I cannot at this stage give a definite time scale for the provision of a new school building.  Unlike the Hartstown situation in 1992 a suitable site for the school in Diswellstown, Castleknock has yet to be acquired.  My Department is in discussion with a local land-owner in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am examining the feasibility of providing either temporary or semi-permanent accommodation on a site in the area before the completion of the permanent building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> My Department will be in touch with County Dublin Vocational Education Committee shortly regarding the establishment of the board of management and other arrangements.</P>
