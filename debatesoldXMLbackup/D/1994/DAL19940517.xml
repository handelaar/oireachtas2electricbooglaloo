      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, noting the out of court settlement by the Department of Social Welfare of a case taken by FLAC on behalf of 1,800 married women claiming arrears of social welfare payments as required under EU equality directives,</P>
      <P>&mdash;calls on the Government to make full payment to all other married women who were similarly discriminated against.</P>
      <P>&mdash;deplores the refusal of the Department of Social Welfare to inform women of their rights, thus forcing many to take legal action, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;calls on the Minister to make a full disclosure on all such cases settled and claims pending.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion is about justice in matters of social welfare.  It is also about the right of women to equal treatment in all areas of life, the failure of this country to live up to its obligations as a member of the European Union, the right of Members of the Oireachtas to information, the expenditure of public money and openness and accountability in Government.</P>
      <P>The matter before the Dáil has its origins in the botched implementation by successive Irish Governments of various European directives which required that men and women should receive equal treatment in regard to social welfare payments. The key decisions were, in many regards, those taken by the Coalition Government in the mid-1980s and the then Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Barry Desmond, must share a great deal of the blame for the problems which followed and which we continue to encounter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original European directive was <Col N="1636" /> adopted in 1978 and gave member states six years to phase out sex discrimination in their social welfare systems.  Any Government faced with the problem of implementing a directive requiring equal treatment had two options, given that men in general received preferential treatment under the social welfare code as it then operated &mdash; the Government could achieve equality by bringing women up to the level of rates paid to men or reduce men to the level of rates payable to women.  Barry Desmond and his colleagues opted for an approach which, while benefiting many women, also involved substantially reducing the incomes of many families.  In other words, he decided to equalise downwards rather than upwards.</P>
    <P>Although the directive was to be implemented by the end of 1984 the Government failed to meet the deadline. The Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1984 was published nine days before the deadline but was not passed into law until July of the following year. That Act gave the Minister for Social Welfare power to bring in, by order, the various sections of the original Bill.  Some of them were brought in during May 1986 but others which involved, in some cases, losses to families of between £20 and £40 per week came into operation in November 1986.</P>
    <P>When thousands of families realised their incomes were to be substantially cut there was a public outcry.  The Dublin Council of Trade Unions organised a public demonstration.  Local meetings were held in many parts of Dublin and Members were lobbied on the issue.  Such was public anger that a number of backbenchers in the then coalition Government threatened to vote against the Government on the issue.</P>
    <P>As a result of that pressure the Government introduced a series of what were called transitional payments to cushion families to some degree from the losses they faced.  These were paid to men only. Originally they were worth £20 per week. Over the years they were reduced to £10 per week and ended altogether as part of the McCreevy dirty dozen cuts in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, who is not present but who has built up a considerable political record as being concerned about the rights of women, told her party conference two months after taking office that the McCreevy cuts were gone for a burton.  This is one cut, like many of the remaining dirty dozen, that did not go and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has been untypically silent on this issue.  This clearly discriminatory decision to breach the directive by making transitional payments to men only continues to anger women and they continue to seek justice.</P>
    <P>I accept that the area of social welfare equalisation is enormously complicated and has been the subject of several legal cases both in the Irish and European courts.  Given the complexity of the issue, it is not surprising that it has received relatively little media attention and only a handful of Deputies pursued the matter in the Dáil after it was initiated by Deputy De Rossa.  The Minister and Minister of State have used the complexity of the issue to befuddle and confuse the public and the House and deny women arrears of the transitional payments to which they were clearly entitled under EU rules.</P>
    <P>The common thread running through the reaction of successive Ministers to social welfare equalisation has been a determination to duck, weave, obfuscate and do everything possible to avoid living up to the spirit of the directive and, where this was not possible, to delay meeting obligations for as long as possible.  Time after time women were forced to go to the courts or threaten legal action to get their entitlements.  The Coalition failed to meet the deadline for implementation of the directive on equalisation and this was the subject of litigation in the Irish and European courts.  The Government resisted this case all the way but eventually the European Court ruled that the women were entitled to arrears and certain benefits for the period December 1984 to November 1986.  The Department made the payments due to the women concerned and made reasonable efforts <Col N="1638" /> to identify women who qualify for these benefits.  That is not at issue although the Department is using the payments, as is evidenced by the amendment, to convince the public that all the requirements in respect of equalisation are being met. This is clearly not the case.</P>
    <P>A separate case was taken on behalf of two Irish women, Ann Cotter and Nora McDermott, claiming they were also entitled to the transitional payments which operated between 1986 and 1992 but which were paid to men only.  The matter was referred to the European Court which, in a judgment given on 13 March 1991, found in favour of the women.  It referred the matter to the Irish Supreme Court but the Government settled the case on June 6 that year before the court could consider it and paid the women in question.  It clearly follows that if Ann Cotter and Nora McDermott had a valid case then thousands of women in similar circumstances were also entitled to these payments.  However, unlike the case involving the arrears between 1984 and 1986 where the Government paid all qualifying women, in this instance the Government refused to make payments to other women in similar circumstances and made no effort, contrary to what the Minister suggests in the amendment, to notify those who might qualify.</P>
    <P>By settling out of court before the Supreme Court could give its judgment the Government was clearly hoping to avoid a legally binding precedent and thus keep the lid on the whole affair.  This has been the pattern with all subsequent cases taken.  The Government resisted the claims, warned they would fight them through the courts but settled before they came to a hearing.</P>
    <P>The Government's attempt to draw a veil of silence gradually broke down.  By word of mouth, women began to learn they were entitled to substantial arrears. Organisations such as FLAC and the lobby group Married Women for Equality, initiated in Cork, took up the issue.  My party raised the matter and made an issue of it in the House but still the Department resisted the claims and only conceded where legal action was <Col N="1639" /> threatened.  They denied information about settlements made to the Dáil and the public.  We still do not know the full extent of the payments made by the Department.</P>
    <P>I understand that prior to the recent FLAC case 2,000 people in Dublin and 800 in Cork received arrears in cases where solicitors intervened on their behalf.  In some cases, the payments are reported to have been £13,000.  However, information is hard to come by as a condition of payment is that women will not disclose the amount received.</P>
    <P>What Deputy De Rossa described last year as a virtual mini-industry for the legal profession grew up around these claims.  Solicitors in Dublin, Cork and Limerick advertised in the newspapers and offered to take cases on behalf of women who may be eligible.  One such advertisement, carried regularly in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last summer was headed &ldquo;Equality Payments&rdquo; and stated &ldquo;married women in receipt of social welfare benefits between 1984 and 1992 should seek advice on their entitlements&rdquo;.  It gave a free telephone number and invited people to contact them.  I saw a letter which a woman who responded to such an advertisement received.  She was asked to sign an authorisation form allowing the firm to act on her behalf and was then told:</P>
    <P>In the event of our being successful we will be looking for fees based on the amount we collect.  If we collect £2,000 we will be looking for £200 plus VAT at 21 per cent.  (It is a bit like the chimney's precedent.)  If it is £400 we will be looking for twice that.  In the unlikely event that we are not successful we will not look for any fees.</P>
    <P>The system operates on a no win-no fee basis.  Clearly women were being forced to go to the courts to secure justice, and a number of solicitors recognised that there were substantial sums to be made in fees from these cases.</P>
    <P>The biggest single case was initiated by FLAC, the free legal aid centres, on behalf of 1,800 women.  FLAC is a voluntary organisation which does not <Col N="1640" /> charge fees.  It also played a key role in earlier cases taken and its record in this area is an outstanding tribute to the commitment of its young members to the principles of justice and equality. Although Minister Woods repeatedly told the Dáil that the Department would fight all these cases in the courts, the Department settled the FLAC case out of court on 12 April before it came to a hearing.  I should like the Minister to explain how this can be reconciled with his earlier statements.  By settling out of court the Department clearly hoped to avoid a judgment which would be legally binding.  By settling the case, the Government has acknowledged its validity, and justice demands that all other married women who were similarly discriminated against should now be paid.</P>
    <P>Having said before that it would contest all cases through the courts, the Department changed its position following the settlement of the FLAC case. The Minister now says that the Department will settle only those cases initiated prior to the introduction of the European Communities Social Welfare Regulations in June 1992 and that cases taken after that date will be contested all the way. That policy will give rise to all sorts of anomalies.</P>
    <P>Take an imaginary case of two married women living in the same estate in any area of Dublin.  Mrs. A who lives in No. 50 was discriminated against because she was denied the transitional payments paid to men in similar circumstances between 1986 and 1992.  She was lucky; she heard about the issue from a friend in Cork, went to a solicitor who initiated action prior to June 1992 and she recently received her entitlement of approximately £6,000.  Mrs. B who lives up the road in the same estate, in No. 108, was also discriminated against because she was denied the transitional payments paid to men in similar circumstances between 1986 and 1992.  However, she only heard about the matter in late 1992. She has now initiated proceedings despite the fact that the Department has told her solicitor that the case will be fully resisted in the courts.  These two women suffered <Col N="1641" /> the same degree of discrimination, yet one will receive £6,000 in compensation while the other will get nothing if the Department gets its way.  This is justice and fair play courtesy of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has once again made a bad calculation.  I do not believe the European Courts will accept this further discrimination, this division of women into two categories &mdash; those who initiated claims prior to June 1992 and those who initiated claims after that date.  It will probably take another case in the European Courts to establish that the Government is once again likely to bring embarrassment and humiliation on this country by being found to be in breach of EU directives on social welfare equalisation.</P>
    <P>The Government likes to pat itself on the back, to say how positive it is about Europe and to boast about what good Europeans we are.  The Government is happy to go looking for money from Europe, but it has been totally reluctant to live up to the obligations of membership of EU when it comes to fully implementing directives or judgments of the European Court which would benefit those on low incomes.  One can imagine how different the story would be if the tens of thousands of women involved in this case happened to be tens of thousands of farmers.  The front page article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> tells about the £138 million paid to farmers in compensation for a price increase which never took place.  That supposed increase plus the 10 per cent devaluation which was added, gave farmers a £138 million bonanza to which they were not entitled. One can only imagine what Minister Woods and his strident Minister of State, Deputy Burton, would do in this case if these women, the vast majority of whom, if not all, are on low incomes, had the IFA lobby behind them.</P>
    <P>The Department's record in this area has been appalling.  Successive Ministers have made us the skinflints and begrudgers of Europe.  Whenever Government has had the choice of ending inequality by making some people better <Col N="1642" /> off or cutting the living standards of those already in need it has chosen the latter, the easier option.  It did this when equalisation measures were first implemented in the mid-1980s and again in 1989 when the Supreme Court found in the Hyland case that the State was discriminating because non-married couples were receiving more in unemployment assistance than were married couples.  Rather than increasing the levels of payments to married couples to bring them up to the level of payments to non-married couples, the then Government cut the incomes of unmarried people, thus plunging people in need even further into poverty.</P>
    <P>This entire affair raises another issue of fundamental importance, that is the accountability of the Government, the Executive, to this House.  The manner in which Minister Woods and his Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, have engaged in what amounts to a virtual conspiracy of silence on this issue makes a mockery of the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government about &ldquo;encouraging greater openness and improving public accountability, transparency and trust&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not just the married women concerned who have been denied information about their entitlements. Members of this House have also been refused details on the number of claims settled and the amounts paid, information to which we should be entitled &mdash; it is public money.  I have a file of questions tabled by Deputy De Rossa and some others of my colleagues going back over a number of years which have drawn a virtual blank in terms of extracting information.  On some occasions the Minister has simply ignored the questions and replied to matters he was not asked about, a favourite gambit of his.  At other times he claimed he could not comment as matters were before the court.  Extraordinarily, on one occasion he claimed that his Department did not maintain statistics on the number of solicitors' letters received claiming payment of arrears of transitional payments.  On other occasions he refused to give information <Col N="1643" /> about settlements, claiming that they were subject to &ldquo;conditions of confidentiality&rdquo;, conditions which his Department had insisted on setting.  This is a shameful episode in the history of Irish public administration and it is especially regrettable that the victims should be women, and predominantly women on low incomes.</P>
    <P>So determined was Minister Woods and his new adjutant, Minister of State Burton, to deny information to Members of the Dáil that officials of the Department, presumably acting on the instructions of their political masters, refused last October to attend the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights to discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>As Members of this House we have a fundamental right to the information we have been seeking.  How many women have applied for and how many have received the transitional payments due to them?  What was the average payment made in these cases?  How many claims are outstanding?  How many women would have been entitled to transitional payments between the years 1986 and 1992 had they been paid to women on the same basis as to men?  What legal expenses has the Department incurred in preparing to defend court cases which never went to hearing?  Various estimates have been made of the numbers of women who might qualify for the transitional payments, varying from 40,000 to 75,000.  We do not know how many women have received settlements but it is likely to be considerably fewer than 5,000, leaving a substantial number of married women still being discriminated against.  The treatment of these women and the attempts to keep them in the dark are an outrage.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government to have included among its members a Minister with specific responsibility for equality. What is the value in having a Minister for Equality when he is prepared to turn the blind eye to women being treated as second-class citizens?  I share a constituency with the same Minister for Equality.  I can assure the House that the <Col N="1644" /> lustre that surrounded him when he was so indignant in Opposition is fast disappearing in the minds of women in Dublin South-West, in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Walkinstown who are involved in this very issue and have been denied their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Is this the best the Labour Party can do, especially when they have a Minister of State at the responsible Department who would claim to be particularly committed to the rights of women?  I am reluctant to comment further on the political performance of the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, in this area because, almost alone of the 30 Ministers in the House, she seems to take any criticism of her lamentable political performance as some kind of personal comment, gives interviews and writes letters to the papers complaining about members of the Opposition doing their job in exposing this kind of injustice.  She takes it as an attack on women, an attack on her; she has not yet learned the adversarial system that obtains in this House. Since I am a considerable admirer of the woman as a woman, I regret that I cannot deal with her as firmly as I would like.  It is a lamentable record that, as a Labour Minister in Government, with this particular brief, and professing a commitment to equality for women, she has sat beside the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, since she came into office, yet nothing, but nothing has happened on this issue.  We still encounter the same obstacles to basic information to which we are entitled and the women affected are still being obliged to resort to legal action to prosecute their case.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to inquire why there is such a deafening silence from the Labour backbenches on this issue.  Various Labour backbenchers with whom I have had the privilege of appearing in radio broadcasts or whatever tell their constituents and the country at large about the new committee system we have in the Dáil, about how hard they work at it, but always they have been in scant evidence at any of the committees on which I have served.  On an issue like this that affects women in their constituencies one would <Col N="1645" /> expect them to be in the House, to offer tacit support if they feel they cannot stand up and say that they are defending these women.  Yet what we get is deafening silence, no sign of the Labour Party at all in the House this evening on an issue that affects tens of thousands of women.  Is it just that they do not care, or are they embarrassed by the role of their colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, in failing to make any attempt to resolve this saga which continues for perhaps up to 75,000 women?</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage the Government should do the decent thing.  No more women should be forced to resort to the courts to secure justice.  The Government should do what it should have done after the judgment of the European Court in March 1991.  It should take steps to notify all those married women &mdash; I presume that the Department has already identified those eligible &mdash; and inform them of their entitlements and set about the phased payment of the moneys due to them.</P>
    <P>If it is acceptable to the House, I should like to share my time with Deputy De Rossa.</P>

      <P>It is not a legal issue, it is a political scandal, a political decision this Government took not to pay more than 75,000 women payments to which a European court found they were entitled.  That is not merely my opinion. It is the opinion of Mel Cousins, barrister-at-law, writing in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> in October 1992.  He referred to transitional payments in his analysis of the regulation which the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, introduced in June 1992, a regulation running into more than 66 pages, which was not even brought into or debated in this House, but introduced at a time when the House was in recess.  Mel Cousins stated:</P>
      <P>In contrast to the rest of the Regulation, the treatment of transitional payments is simplicity itself in that the Minister has completely ignored them. The Regulation only applies to the list of specified payments which does not include transitional payments.  This is also in breach of the decision of the Court of Justice in <i>Cotter and McDermott II.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been asked.  For example, who might qualify for these payments?  If at November 1986 a woman was married, living with her spouse, claiming in her own right unemployment benefit, disability benefit, injury benefit, disablement benefit or invalidity pension and had an unbroken claim, the likelihood is she will qualify for these transitional payments when the Minister and <Col N="1647" /> this Government finally agree to give her her rights, as inevitably they must.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment to our motion this evening continues this policy of misleading the House and the public when he seeks to pretend that all women who are entitled to money have been paid and that there is some distinction to be drawn between women who have already been paid these transitional payments prior to June 1992 and those who claimed subsequently.</P>
    <P>How can a Government justify treating women in this discriminatory fashion? The women of this country are not taking this matter lying down; they have already gone to Brussels with a petition.  It is interesting to note that in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 25 April 1994 Commissioner Flynn indicated that he believes the women have a just claim.  They lodged a petition with the Petitions Committee in Brussels, in which they pointed out that the regulations and payments thereunder are restricted to the years 1984 to 1986 only and do not address arrears due to married women up to 31 July 1992.</P>
    <P>The regulations do not adequately repay married women for payments they would have received in the years 1984-86. Payments to spouses and children are restricted by reference to criteria which were not applicable to married men during this period.  These are breaches of a European Court of Justice decision. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, have an obligation to respond, not by resorting to sleight of hand to deny them this right but to pay them the money due as a result of that court decision. The Minister makes the point that if the money was paid in some cases it would result in double payments.  If that is the case in relation to those women who applied after the regulation was made in 1992, can the Minister explain why this principle does not apply to women who applied prior to the regulation being made?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not simply discriminating against women on the basis that they did not know and that he failed to inform them of their rights? The way the Minister's Department deals with claims by women is disgraceful.

      <P>The Minister will get his chance to reply.  There is no specific information officer &mdash; not staff &mdash; to give information to women who telephone or go into their local labour exchange to inquire about this manner. They have refused to provide an information officer in Limerick and Waterford. In Waterford claimants are given a box number in Dublin to write to and the information from the box number is to the effect that the person has got all their entitlements and are not getting any more, which is misleading.  Many women who ask for their record of contributions and claims are refused on the basis that they are not entitled to them.  When they argue that point they are told that records do not go back to 1984.  A curious case which has come to my attention is of a woman who was refused her record of claims going back to 1984, because they were not available, yet her husband was subsequently able to get a record of his claims going back to 1951.  This is the disgraceful way in which women who believe they are entitled to these payments are treated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Presumably they are not doing it off their own bat, but on the basis of instructions issued by the Minister which I call on him to withdraw.</P>

The question of possible prejudice to the State's position cannot be ignored and it is irresponsible of anyone to suggest it can.</P>
      <P>The background to this whole problem is that in 1984, the then Government failed to implement the measures necessary to give effect to the equal treatment directive by the required deadline.  The manner in which equal treatment was to be implemented was effectively determined by an inter-departmental working group set up by Fianna Fáil in Government in 1978 which reported as far back as 1981.  All the homework was done for the implementation of equal treatment. In spite of this, the then Government did not introduce the necessary legislation until December 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been in the Department of Social Welfare for seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was enacted in July 1985 but the then Government delayed even further by not bringing the legislation into force until May and November 1986.</P>
      <P>This catalogue of delay, procrastination and inability to act has led to the situation we have today.  Tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been paid out rightfully to women, in accordance with the terms of the legislation and as determined by the courts. As a result these moneys had to be found by the Exchequer and by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1985 legislation could have been made retrospective but this was not done. By bringing in legislation from a current <Col N="1654" /> date only, equal treatment was not provided for in respect of the period of delay. The then Government inadvertently compounded the problem even further by introducing well meaning transitional payments to cushion families from a sudden reduction in their payments on the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986.</P>
    <P>The first of the proceedings arising from the delay in implementing the measures necessary in accordance with requirements of the directive were taken in early 1985.  The proceedings were already underway in 1984 and it was decided at that time that they be defended.  Subsequently court proceedings were initiated by other married women seeking retrospective payments in respect of the period of delay.  These proceedings gave rise to complex legal issues and on three occasions the Irish courts made references for preliminary rulings to the European Court of Justice. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that it is an enormously complicated issue.</P>
    <P>In the light of clarification of the legal issues provided by the European Court, the Government introduced retrospective legislation in 1992 which provided for equal treatment in respect of the period of delay.  This was done by way of Statutory Instrument under the European Communities Act, 1972, which was laid before the House of the Oireachtas in June 1992.  The retrospective legislation made good the default arising from the delay.  Subject to certain provisions designed to avoid double payments, the legislation entitled married women to the payments which they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time in December 1984.</P>
    <P>My Department made extensive efforts to identify all potential beneficiaries under the retrospective legislation and issued personalised claim forms to the women concerned.  All claims have been processed and over 70,000 women with an entitlement under the retrospective legislation were paid in full by the end of 1993.  This was six months ahead of the statutory deadline <Col N="1655" /> set down in the retrospective legislation. The work done by the civil servants in my Department in tidying up this situation and dealing effectively with the issues involved was exemplary.</P>

      <P>Subject to certain provisions designed to avoid double payments, the married women involved have already been paid the amounts which they would have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  Determining entitlements on the basis now sought would involve making double payments in many cases and that could not be justified by any reasonable criteria. For example, where both spouses were in receipt of a social welfare payment in the period of delay, it would mean paying each an increase for their spouse as an adult dependant in addition to their personal rate of payment plus the full rate of increases for children.  This would involve paying him for her as his dependant and at the same time paying her for him as her dependant and paying him and her for the children.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not want anyone to understand the issues involved.  His proposal would involve paying the same families twice &mdash; two personal rates, two adult dependant allowances and double payments for the children.  It would also mean paying people compensation payments in the form of transitional payments for a loss which they did not suffer.  The payments made to those involved were increased on the implementation of equal treatment in 1986.  They received a higher personal <Col N="1659" /> rate and also qualified for increases for dependants.</P>
      <P>The people involved in these proceedings are making claims for payments in addition to and over and above those provided for in the legislation.  My Department is defending these proceedings and three cases are due to be heard in the High Court in late June.  The point at issue is whether equal treatment has been properly provided for.  This is a matter which can be decided only through the court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The cost of any additional payments which might have to be made would have to be met by the taxpayer.  Nonetheless, the Government will honour its responsibilities in this area arising from the court proceedings.  I utterly reject the implication in the allegations being made by the Democratic Left and by certain Fine Gael Deputies.  We have handled this situation in an honourable and forthright manner.  All payments due under the 1992 retrospective legislation have been paid.  The court proceedings will decide if any further measures are to be taken.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost involved is £354 million.  Before I could make double payments to people in the same household I would have to have the matter determined by the courts because this money would have to be found somewhere.  For instance, a 4 per cent increase in the standard rate of tax would be required to raise £300 million in one year.  A sum of £155 million would be raised by way of a 1 per cent income levy if applied to all income and £135 million if applied to incomes over £9,000 per year.  A 9 per cent increase in the top rate of tax would be required to raise £300 million.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, this is a complex matter of European law on which a clear decision is required.</P>

      <P>The Minister has thrown out figures in an attempt to mould public opinion against the efforts being made in this House to get justice for the women of this country.  I am concerned about the Minister's behaviour in this House in recent weeks.  He refused to give information on the spending of taxpayers' money and to respond to questions tabled here and letters submitted to him regarding the terms of settlement of the 800 cases in Cork.  I have written to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts asking that it carry out a full investigation into the behaviour of the Minister and his Department in regard to the spending of taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only were 800 cases settled some time ago but on 12 April last a further 1,800 cases were settled on the steps of the High Court.  The Minister attempted to mislead the House today by implying that the condition of confidentiality was imposed by the solicitors or the women who took the cases.  I submit it was the Minister and his Department who imposed that condition.  That is unacceptable and there should be a full disclosure of the settlement conditions and the amount of taxpayers money spent to date.  I hope the Committee of Public <Col N="1664" /> Accounts will investigate the matter urgently.</P>
    <P>I charge that the Minister has mislead Members of Dáil Éireann on this issue and I will substantiate my allegations by citing from the Official Report of the meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs of 9 March last.  At that meeting the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Retrospective legislation was introduced in 1992 which, in general terms, entitled married women to the payments which they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  Deputies made reference to this legislation, (it was regulations, not legislation) especially regarding cases which were taken before the legislation was enacted.  The cases which the Department is defending are cases taken after that legislation was introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The free legal aid centres took 1,800 cases against the Department which were settled on the steps of the High Court. <Col N="1666" /> Prior to that, 800 cases were settled in Cork and other centres throughout the country to which conditions of confidentiality were imposed.  I fail to understand why women who took cases against the Minister prior to 1992 can have their cases conceded and women who were slow to take their cases or uninformed about the matter should be victimised by the Minister by forcing them into the courts in June.  It is merely a question of whether the women are entitled to the money, irrespective of the amounts involved.  The assurances of the Minister in the past have not promoted confidence in his judgment or the political advice he receives.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months I have attempted to get at the truth of this controversy.  I raised the matter during social welfare debates in 1993 and 1994, at Question Time as spokesman for Social Welfare, in my contribution to the budget debate on 3 February last and at the select committee. Prior to the High Court settlements last month 800 cases were settled in the Cork area, details of which were kept from the women involved.  Payments were made directly to their solicitors. I am not inferring there was impropriety on behalf of those solicitors, but women and their solicitors have been put in a difficult position because of the Department's insistence on confidentiality. There has been a conspiracy of silence on this issue.  A further 1,800 were settled some weeks ago but the Minister is refusing to concede the claims with his Department because he made regulations in 1992 which attempt to influence the rights of approximately 10,000 women retrospectively.  Thousands of women submitted claims, but because the Minister made regualtions in 1992 he will not entertain them.  Women are being denied information regarding their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Despite assurances given by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance regarding their rights under the freedom of information Bill, the Minister <Col N="1667" /> for Social Welfare refuses to give information on this issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, will recall that when I asked &mdash; in February &mdash; that information be given to women she gave an assurance that if I submitted questions about particular cases to the Department of Social Welfare it would be made available. I took the Minister's advice and the answers were similar to those I received previously, namely no information could be supplied because of the terms of confidentiality. In view of the Minister's earlier statements she should speak about women's rights and give information about their entitlements.  To date there has been a stony silence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Women are denied the opportunity to claim their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>An official of the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; whom I will not name &mdash; estimated the total liability of the State in this matter between £140 million and £180 million.  I will supply details to the Department official.  The Minister is not opposing those claims on legal grounds but because he considers the amount involved is too large.  Women are legally entitled to moneys, irrespective of the amount involved and no legal tricks or impediments should be put in their way.  The most scandalous aspect of this matter is that women who were refused their entitlements were forced to employ a solicitor and obliged to pay a portion of their settlement in fees.  That position is unacceptable, women are asked to suffer and will not receive their full entitlements because of legal trickery used by the Minister in dealing with valid claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat the questions I put to the Minister on 13 March.  Will he give details of the value of 800 claims conceded prior to the recent High Court settlement?  Will he give details also of the estimated liability of the State in respect of the <Col N="1668" /> 1,800 cases settled on the steps of the High Court recently?  He has given an estimated value of the claims submitted post-1992.  The Minister's attempts to defend the claims submitted post-1992 will fail because the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Emmet <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare No. 208 of 1990 held that time limits laid down by national law cannot run until the directive has been properly transposed into national law.  July 1992 is the earliest date on which the State can argue that the directive has been transposed into national law.  The Minister is attempting to retrospectively change the social welfare code in the treatment of married men and married women with effect from December 1984 by applying the current equal treatment code to that period.  That attempt to retrospectively change the law is unusual and I do not believe the State's argument will get a sympathetic hearing.  I had hoped the Minister would put the record straight.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer the House to the proceedings of the Select Committee on Social Affairs in March when it dealt with the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  The House should note my comments in respect of the specified grounds under which women are entitled to payments and I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to note the Minister's comments and to investigate them.</P>
    <P>As my party's spokesman on Social Welfare, I support the motion.  I and other members of my party, as well as members of the Democratic Left, have consistently attempted to get the truth on this issue but, unfortunately, we have failed to do so.  I tabled a priority question on 8 March asking the Minister for Social Welfare in view of the statements made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, if he would give up-to-date information on claims made by women arising from the decision of the European Court on 13 March 1991 in the case taken by Cotter and McDermott, and if he would disclose <Col N="1669" /> details of payments made in individual cases.  Despite assurances I received in the House my question was ruled out of order because it was a repeat of a previous question tabled on 2 February.  I regret this type of bureaucratic impediment is being put in my way and in that of colleagues such as Deputy De Rossa who has been consistent in this matter. In attempting to establish the rights of thousands of women our efforts are being stymied by technicalities and by the Minister side-stepping the issue.  The Minister and his officials are blocking access to the information we require.  The estimated figures of between £140 million and a maximum of £160 million in respect of the State's liability in this matter which I received from a Department official is a far cry from those given by the Minister. In attempting to quantify the level of claims pending the Minister tried to create a scare by giving examples of how the money would have to be raised.  In the past moneys owing to individuals have been paid, irrespective of the cost involved.  This is a matter of priorities and there is an important principle involved, namely, whether the Minister believes women are entitled to those payments.</P>
    <P>I ask that the questions I put about this episode at the Select Committee on Social Affairs in March be answered and that the comments of the Minister at that committee be investigated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given <Col N="1670" /> under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Doyle &mdash; the inordinate delay in commencing the building programme at Carrowreigh national school, County Wexford; (2) Deputy Frances Fitzgerald &mdash; the need for the urgent implementation of the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, particularly in view of the matters raised in recent court cases (details supplied); (3) Deputy Flanagan &mdash; the inadequacy of the nursing home regulations as applied to subventions in respect of persons seeking care in private nursing homes; (4)  Deputy Allen &mdash; the intention of the British Social Services Secretary to introduce an habitual residency test for foreigners claiming social service benefits, and the adverse consequences of this move for Irish people travelling to Britain for work; (5) Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; the current industrial dispute at Airmotive, Clondalkin, County Dublin, and the consequent threat to employment at the plant; (6) Deputy de Valera &mdash; the imminent closure of the Rehabilitation Board's office in Ennis County Clare, and the need to assure the disabled people of County Clare that this service will remain in Ennis; (7) Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; the need for a full report into the procedures and co-ordination of the investigation by the North-Eastern Health Board in a case involving the sexual abuse of children in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The order of the Dáil of 4 May last which governs this sitting provided that, for this day only, three matters should be selected with ten minutes available to the Member concerned and ten minutes available to the Minister or Minister of State replying.  In accordance with that order, the matters raised by Deputies Frances Fitzgerald, de Valera and O'Donnell have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <P>As the matters <Col N="1671" /> raised by Deputies Fitzgerald and O'Donnell are very similar, I suggest that each Deputy should first make her ten minute statement to be followed by the Minister for Health who could then reply to both Deputies.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      <P>Before calling on the Members concerned I remind the House that, although a conviction has been obtained in the case referred to, sentence has yet to be imposed and under the revised <i>sub judice</i> rule there is an onus on Members to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  Accordingly, Members should exercise discretion in their contributions and, if it can be avoided, should also avoid referring to persons outside the House by name or so as to be identifiable.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister for being in the House to answer.</P>
      <P>Every day the Minister's delay in bringing the Child Care Act fully into operation puts further children at risk.  It is now almost three years since this Bill went through the Dáil.  The earlier Act dates from 1908 and it is critical that all sections of the recent Act be brought into force immediately.  How many more sad and tragic cases must we hear about before the urgent need to do this is fully recognised?  I have here the contributions the Minister himself made to the Committee Stage of that Bill in 1988 and 1989 and I know how important he believes this Child Care Act to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last year we have spoken in this House about the Kilkenny case and others which have highlighted and dramatically illustrated the darker side of Irish family life.  It is crucial that nothing said here this evening should add further to the trauma already suffered by the children and mother involved in the case in question.  I raise this on the Adjournment because it raises a number of central issues which must be faced.  Many women and men throughout the country have <Col N="1672" /> been horrified as details of child sexual abuse cases emerge.  One of the most disturbing features of this and of the Kilkenny case is the feeling that somebody should have done something earlier.</P>
    <P>As yet neither I nor anybody else in this House has detailed information on the management of this case which suggests that it is the same as the Kilkenny case and I do not for a moment want to suggest that it is.  However, it is clear that this case and others raise questions and force us to ask some very uncomfortable questions about ourselves.  We are indeed horrified as a society by the crime and yet there is deep ambivalence in Ireland regarding anything that is seen as an attempt to interfere with the family.  We often see an idealisation of the family in Ireland.  It is important that we get a balance between idealising the family and assuming that child sexual abuse is around every corner.  Because we have in the past to some degree denied that such things can happen in families, we have not made adequate provision for them.</P>
    <P>I have said again and again since I was elected to this House that we are not child centred enough in our public policy. How can a political system, emerging from a Constitution which articulates a particular concern expressed in the most human terms &mdash; cherishing all the children of the nation equally &mdash; end up with such an insensitive and incomplete response to the welfare of children?  The problem is that until recently the political system in Ireland has never been more than reactive in this area and only the most outrageous and public emotive issues relating to children have received any kind of response.  The approach in public policy to the welfare of children has been nothing short of a disgrace and the evidence is overwhelming.  The Children Act, 1908 has been in operation until 1994; there has been no proper juvenile justice system since 1908.  The Department of Health should be called the Department of Health and Social Services <Col N="1673" /> because there is no doubt that policy on the welfare of children has been a hit and miss affair which has been dramatically illustrated by recent cases.</P>
    <P>We are aware, because that awareness has been forced on us, that there has been gross abuse of children in the sacrosanct shrine of the family.  We are aware that the pattern of family life is changing utterly and that the implications for children are vast and threatening.  We must, therefore, put together the scattered threads of our concern for children in a national policy of which we can be proud. There is no doubt that our collective assumptions about the roles, rights and welfare of children need to be challenged.</P>
    <P>Once again, as shown by this case, it is vital that the issues raised, the shortfall in services, the gaps in the contacts between professionals are addressed.  However, professionals working on the ground say it is extremely difficult to make the interventions which will end abuse.  The question that must be asked in this case and others like it is whether the abuse would have continued if there had been in place ten years ago a nationwide support system of rape crisis support centres and refuges.  It is only recently that women's voices have been heard and listened to in mass campaigns.  We should, therefore, not be surprised that individual women are not heard and individual children are not heard or believed.</P>
    <P>In many cases of family violence it is asked why the mother did not intervene. The Kilkenny case addressed this question very well.  We must remember that the power of the abuser over women and children is huge and, within the family, there is the added layer of complex relationships.  I hope we can learn from the UK where inquiries over many years have had a negative effect on professional morale and created a climate in which defensive practices have become the norm rather than protecting the interest of children and parents.  This is not about indentifying one bad apple in a system <Col N="1674" /> that otherwise works well.  The whole system and approach needs to be analysed.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Why have the guidelines on the management of abuse, physical and sexual, first issued in 1987 not been monitored? Is it the intention to monitor how these guidelines have worked in the past and to update them?  Have guidelines been given out to health boards on the investigation and management of child sexual abuse?  Are they working?  Have guidelines been issued for all the professional groups involved in managing child sexual abuse?  What does the Minister intend to do to ensure that at local level a wideranging programme of community education on child sexual abuse is put in place?  This is the only way individuals will find out about the avenues of help available to them, and it is the only way that neighbours and concerned citizens &mdash; and there are many &mdash; will be able to take action.</P>
    <P>We are now at a point where people may believe that there is sexual abuse but are not quite sure whom to approach or how to deal with their worries or the information they have.  If we are to intervene effectively and appropriately in families, it is necessary that there be sensitive, well-trained, multi-professional teams working together locally.</P>
    <P>Another question is the training being put in place for teachers, gardaí and others involved in this work.  It is essential to have appropriate training courses.  It is essential also to have effective intervention in families.  There must be good contact between the different professional groups &mdash; general practitioners, gardaí, social workers, teachers, to name but a few.  It is crucial that these groups should move beyond deeply ingrained professional approaches and work effectively with one another.  I ask the Minister to consider regional guidelines for proper interdisciplinary work throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> I understand also that a number of cases of child sexual abuse in residential homes are under investigation.  The Minister must ensure that there are proper standards and regulations governing practice in residential homes for children. Many cases like those coming to the attention of professionals in the community might previously have been happening in residential homes, or children might have been helped in residential care.  Only 10 per cent of cases of confirmed sexual abuse end in prosecution, mostly because no one in the family is prepared to make a complaint.  This is why the range of services I have outlined is so necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a serious shortage of appropriate accommodation for teenagers in need of residential care, for young people at risk, young people who have overdosed or who need psychological help. As the Child Care Act has not been brought into force, young people of 16 or 17 years of age who are abused in the home receive no assistance, neither is there provision for supervision orders.  It may well have been that in the case in question a supervision order would have provided an opportunity for a professional to get to know the family.  Third party barring orders, mandatory reporting and the nationwide provision of refuge places must also be examined.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition the Minister called for the Child Care Act to be fully implemented as soon as possible.  He urged the then Minister to state when the Act would be brought into operation.  It is outrageous that critical sections of it are unimplemented and will remain so for the coming years.  The Minister should outline the information available on the case in question and state when he expects the report from the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways, one has a feeling of <i>deja vu</i> in this Adjournment debate.  Almost a year ago to the day, I stood facing the Minister Deputy <Col N="1676" /> Howlin, as we debated, by way of a motion, the report of the Kilkenny incest case.  That report was a comprehensive review of how the South Eastern Health Board had dealt with the abuse referred to in the case heard in the Central Criminal Court on 1 March 1993.  The nation had been sickened by the revelations of a litany of physical and sexual abuse of a woman over a period of 16 years.  Evidence had been revealed in the case that the victim had more than a hundred separate contacts with the health services and had disclosed to various health care professionals details of the abuse suffered by her.</P>
      <P>The brief of the report was to establish why there had not been earlier action and intervention by the health board.  This was not a statutory inquiry but an informal one and the team was asked to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of cases of suspected child abuse. The report, which was a damning indictment of inaction and incompetence, of mismanagement, a failure to keep records and a total lack of integration between the Garda and the health board, was launched with indecent pomp &mdash; I criticised it at the time &mdash; by the Minister in a Dublin hotel.  The Minister heralded the report as a milestone in child care policy.  This report was to end all reports on this matter.  Millions of pounds were promised to improve and enhance resources in child care protection, particularly where sexual abuse was involved.</P>
      <P>At the time, the Minister and the report exonerated everybody and urged us not to seek scapegoats or accountability but to look forward.  There was no admission of blame, wrongdoing or bad professional practice.  There was an indecent haste to move on and learn lessons. The Minister did not take responsibility. Nobody did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 27 April last, I tabled a parliamentary question to ask the Minister for Health the changes which had been made to the reporting of children at risk <Col N="1677" /> and specifically, what measures had been put in place in the respective health boards following the recommendations of the Kilkenny report.  I requested a progress report and I expected it to be substantial.  What I got was a two page fudge.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a draft new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda.  This, the Minister claimed, is being operated on a pilot basis in a number of unspecified selected areas, with a vague intention of national application before the end of the year.  There is no indication in this reply of any sense of ugency by the Minister to deal with one of the central recommendations of the Kilkenny report.</P>
    <P>Another key recommendation of the report was the mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse to the health boards. In his reply, the Minister refers to his Department being in the process of preparing a discussion document.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of his reply to the specific question of measures in each health board area to improve arrangements for the notification, investigation and management of child abuse is a masterpiece of ministerial distraction.  The Minister said: &ldquo;this information is at present being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible&rdquo;. Three weeks later I am still awaiting a reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was too busy worrying about this incident, but I am sure the Minister hastily prepared the information. Little or nothing has been done at the front line which radically ensures that the administrative slippage, so evident in the investigation in Kilkenny, is not still happening.  The Minister may have a child care policy unit in his Department, but the front line, where the caring services interface with victims and dysfunctional <Col N="1678" /> families, remains inadequately resourced.  I am not talking only about money.  The Minister was allocated £5 million after the Kilkenny report, but no amount of money can make up for the keeping of proper records, accountable management structures, inter-agency cooperation and liaison with the Garda. These were some of the specific recommendations of the Kilkenny report. When I asked my question I expected, and I have a right to receive in the public interest, an honest audit of the status of those recommendations.  I am asking again for them now.  I hope the schedule will outline the recommendations and a progess report on each.</P>
      <P>One recommendation states: &ldquo;We recommend that linkages be established for all hospital attendances, they should be kept in summary form and should preferably be computerised&rdquo;.  Will the Minister say whether professionals in all hospitals keep a record of examinations for sexual abuse and what arrangements are in place for a report of a finding of sexual abuse on medical grounds to the Garda or health board?</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that guidelines be prepared regarding the retention by general practitioners of written records.  Is this being done?  I understand that the Medical Council has reviewed its own guidelines as to medical confidentiality in child abuse cases.  The new code of ethics allows the doctor to breach confidentiality to safeguard the welfare of the child.  What makes more sense when very often the doctor has first hand evidence of alleged sexual abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long teachers, priests, TDs, local councillors, solicitors, family friends and neighbours have been silenced by a disproportionate respect for the privacy of the family.  Violence against women and children, which may or may not include sexual abuse, is a crime and not a private family matter.  A family based on marriage, which is held in such high esteem by our Consititution, our courts and the Church, can be a place of torture, <Col N="1679" /> horrific violence and misery.  We must replace a culture of non-intervention with one of intervention and protection.</P>
    <P>With the Stay Safe Programme in our national schools, we are facilitating the disclosure by children of such violence. What procedures exist for confidential reports to be compiled and acted upon? Can teachers be assured they are not leaving themselves open to isolation and legal action?  The rights of children must take precedence over the rights of the token family.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation from the Kilkenny report is that &ldquo;Health Boards should provide, directly or in association with voluntary agencies, a minimum number of refuge places within their geographical area for victims of domestic violence&rdquo;.  It is sad that there are only nine refuges in the State.  There are more in the province of Northern Ireland than in the whole of Ireland.  There is no refuge in Monaghan or Donegal.  I would like to see a list of the refuges around the country.  We can be sure that vast areas of rural Ireland are unresourced in terms of refuges.</P>
    <P>Many incestuous families and families where there is violence against women and children share one characteristic, isolation. Incestuous families, at the behest of the perpetrator, are frequently very isolated.  Family members keep to themselves and, consequently, neighbours keep their distance.  Usually the mother, to whom children may first disclose information, will be so browbeaten and terrified, her self-confidence and self-esteem so diminished by years of living with a violent and dominant male, that she is incapable of taking action to protect her children.  I quote from the Kilkenny report: &ldquo;it is perhaps one of the most uncomfortable features of incestuous families that, other than the perpetrator, the adult closest to the child will not take action to stop the abuse&rdquo;.  That is all the more reason for intervention by <Col N="1680" /> an outside person who must be courageous and sensitive.</P>
    <P>The laws are in place for us to counsel the dysfunctional family <i>in situ</i> rather than immediately go in like paratroopers on a raid.  The Child Care Act, 1991, provided a new statutory framework for the functioning of the health services in this area.  The Minister promised to implement the remaining sections of that Act.  He promised that the deficiencies in the powers of the health boards, as revealed in the Kilkenny case, would be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 19, which deals with supervision orders, gives the health boards power to enter a child's home for regular visits where a supervision order is in force.  The wide provisions of the 1991 Act did not come into operation automatically in 1991; they awaited ministerial order.  At the time of the Kilkenny report, the major sections dealing with children at risk, under Parts III, IV, V and VI, were not in force.  Are they in force now and, if so, why were they not used by the North-Eastern Health Board?  There are many questions to be answered, not only by the Minister but by health boards.  If the Minister chooses to delegate to the health boards his statutory functions, such enormous powers and responsibilities, he must be responsible for that delegation.</P>
    <P>This time last year I criticised the report, not for its recommendations which were excellent, but for its abject failure to admit mistakes at all levels.  In July of 1993, before the Dáil adjourned for the summer recess, I criticised the Minister for the delay in responding to the report's recommendations.  He criticised me in return for being impatient and unrealistic.  He bleated and protested saying that he had set up a child care policy unit in his Department.  The time for policy units is well past.  A group of people looking earnestly around a table is not an adequate response to a child who is being raped or buggered.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently launched yet <Col N="1681" /> another expensively produced document, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i> He has paid off the debts of the health boards and plans a reorganisation of them. While he is doing that, would the Minister consider also their competence and accountability. The Minister is aware of the reply I am seeking &mdash; and I believe a reply was placed in the pigeonhole for me today, which I am sure was hastily produced. I do not want a reply by way of another expensively produced document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sufficient analysis was included in the Kilkenny report.  Action and accountability is needed now.  The Government is being paralysed by analysis.  Every day reports issue from Government Departments analysing all aspects of their responsibility.  We have had enough reports on this matter.  I want answers and action from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to preface my remarks by pointing out that the case referred to by the Deputies has not yet been fully disposed of by the courts and that I am anxious to adhere to the request of the Ceann Comhairle and avoid making any comment that could in any way prejudice the final outcome of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the widespread horror and shock that has been expressed by Deputies and my people around the country about the sexual abuse suffered by the two young children in the tragic case referred to by the Deputies.  The extremely distressing revelations of the dreadful abuse perpetrated against the two victims has touched a chord in all of us.  We all share a sense of outrage and shame that guideless, vulnerable children <Col N="1682" /> of such tender years have had their childhood innocence destroyed in this most heinous manner.  Our earnest wish and hope for the children is that they will be able to put this dreadful experience behind them and look forward to a happier future.</P>
    <P>I have asked the North Eastern Health Board to submit an urgent report to me setting out its involvement with the family concerned and its contacts with the other key agencies concerned with the case.  While I do not wish in any way to pre-empt my consideration of this fully report, I would like the House to know that preliminary information received by my Department from the health board indicates the following.  Concern about the children was first expressed to the North Eastern Health Board in 1986. However, it was the considered view of the board that there was insufficient evidence to institute child care proceedings to seek the removal of the children from the home.  They had been examined at both the Temple Street and Rotunda sexual assault units arising out of the health board's close monitoring of the case, a number of health and social problems were identified within the family. The board arranged for the provision of a range of appropriate support services to assist the family.  The health board informed the Garda Síochána about the case immediately it became aware of it in 1986; however, it was not until 1992 that the authorities had enough evidence to initiate legal proceedings in the case.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, I have asked the North Eastern Health Board for an urgent report on all aspects of the case.  I hope the House will appreciate that until such time as I have received the report and have had an opportunity to study it, I am not in a position to determine what, if any, further action needs to be taken in relation to this case.</P>
    <P>I am already on record as saying that the single biggest contribution that can be made towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are <Col N="1683" /> at risk is the full and proper implementation of the Child Care Act.  This tragic case has again reinforced me in my resolve to bring the remaining provisions of the Act into operation within the time frame agreed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that I am determined that the legislation in its entirety will be implemented before the end of 1996.  Having regard to the enormous amount of preparatory work required both within my Department and in the health services generally, I want to emphasise that this is the shortest possible time frame for full implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputies opposite to demand the immediate implementation of the Act.  In fact, the Act could be implemented tomorrow if I were to bring a statutory order before this House. I have said repeatedly that I am not prepared to take action that has no effect on the ground.  I want proper child care provision.  I worked on the Child Care Act through its passage here and in special committee and I also drafted a Bill which I brought before the House as a precursor of the current Act.  An enormous amount of work must be done before we have the proper infrastructure and regulations in place to protect children to the best of our abilities.  My Department and the health boards are working towards that at maximum speed. I asked my Department for the optimum fastest time frame for implementation of the Act.  That is what was approved by Government.</P>
    <P>The Government has embarked on a sustained programme for investment in the child care services in order to ensure that a comprehensive and integrated range of services and facilities is put in place to underpin the legislation and to enable the health boards to carry out their statutory responsibilities under the Act.  In 1993 the Government made available an additional £5 million for new services in the child care area.  The <Col N="1684" /> important new initiatives funded from this allocation include over 100 new posts of social worker and child care worker; three new consultant staffed child and adolescent psychiatric services; 20 new posts in child psychology; the expansion of the home maker and home help services to assist families in difficulty; the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of health board areas; increased financial support for pre-school services in disadvantaged areas, and 30 additional hostel places for homeless children.  Details of the full extent of the individual initiatives amounting to eight pages of documentation, put in place since the Kilkenny report, have been forwarded to Deputy O'Donnell today.</P>
    <P>This year, an additional £15 million is available for child care.  This will meet the full year costs of the initiatives begun last year and will enable a further round of new service developments to be launched this year.  The child care policy unit of my Department is currently finalising proposals for a package of major developments in each health board area.</P>
    <P>These allocations represent the largest ever investment of resources in the child care area and demonstrates my determination to ensure that the Act is not simply implemented on paper but that there is real and tangible improvement in the level and quality of services and supports to assist families and children in need.</P>
    <P>In a structured programme for the implementation of the legislation, priority is being accorded to the commencement of those provisions which will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in cases of child abuse.  The need for the early implementation of these key provisions was underlined in the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation.  When this has been achieved, arrangements will then be made for the commencement of the other <Col N="1685" /> outstanding provisions, including regulations for pre-schools, etc.</P>
    <P>Two working groups have been established under the aegis of the child care policy unit of my Department to prepare the initial draft of the new foster care and residential care regulations required to give full effect to certain provisions of the Act.  These groups include representatives of the health boards, of relevant interest groups and representatives of my Department.  Their work will help to expedite the finalisation of the preparatory work that must be undertaken before the next segment of the legislation can be brought into force.</P>
    <P>While the central recommendation of the Kilkenny incest report was the early implementation of the Child Care Act, it also contained important recommendations for improving arrangements for the reporting, identification and management of suspected child abuse.  These recommendations are being actively pursued at various levels.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, has prepared a draft new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda.  That was our first action which, happily, has now been achieved.  This procedure, which revolves around a standardised form for the reporting of suspecting abuse, is aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime.  The procedure is currently being operated on a pilot basis in a number of selected areas and, subject to any refinement that might be needed, I expect it will be introduced nationally before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this new procedure on a national basis will give effect to a major recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny investigation.  This measure represents the first step in a comprehensive review of current arrangements for the reporting of suspected child <Col N="1686" /> abuse.  At regional level, all health boards are taking specific measures to improve existing arrangements for the reporting and management of child abuse with particular importance being attached to cooperation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care programmes of the health services.  I forwarded details of these measures to Deputy O'Donnell earlier today.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny investigation report also recommended the mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse to the health boards.  My Department is at present in the process of preparing a discussion paper on this question.  Serious ethical questions arise for priests, religious, doctors and teachers in these matters.  It is not as simple as one Deputy seemed to suggest.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council, for its part, has reviewed its guidelines in relation to medical confidentiality as it relates to child abuse.  The new code of ethics allows a doctor to breach confidentiality where necessary to safeguard the welfare of another individual or patient.  This is in line with another recommendation contained in the Kilkenny incest report.</P>
    <P>Apart from improving procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse cases, it is also of the utmost importance to develop strategies aimed at preventing the incidence of all forms of child abuse.  The child abuse programme known as &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; has been of enormous practical value in teaching children coping skills in the classroom context and in increasing community awareness generally of the problem of child abuse.  While there has been some opposition to &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo;, both my colleague, the Minister for Education, and I are fully supportive of the programme, which is currently being implemented in national schools around the country.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the unequivocal support for the programme expressed by Deputies Fitzgerald and O'Donnell on various occasions in this House.  A working <Col N="1687" /> group, representative of my Department, the Department of Education and the Eastern Health Board has put the process in train for the development of suitable materials for use in an appropriate abuse prevention programme for second level schools.  It is expected that these materials will be ready for piloting later this year.</P>
    <P>The training of front line staff in the health services likely to come across cases of abuse, whether of children or adults, is also being addressed in the context of the implementation of the Child Care Act.  For example, my Department and the Eastern Health Board are supporting the Women's Aid organisation in the development of a training programme for hospital personnel dealing with women victims of domestic violence who are admitted to accident and emergency departments.  This programme is being developed in response to a specific recommendation in the Kilkenny report.</P>
    <P>From what I have said I hope Deputies will accept I have outlined a considerable progress report in building up child care and family support services and in strengthening the capacity of the health services to respond to the needs of deprived children, particularly those who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Much more remains to be done in this area and it is my firm intention that the momentum generated in the last 12 months will be sustained and that all necessary arrangements will be put in place.</P>
    <P>No matter what system, law or resources are put in place we will never be in a position to give a categorical assurance that horrific tragedies such as we came across last year will not happen again.  I am determined, as is the Government, that everything we can do to protect children from abuse will be implemented as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>There is great anxiety, annoyance and outrage at the rumour of the imminent closure of the National Rehabilitation Centre in Ennis, County Clare.  The secretary of the Disabled People of Clare, Mr. Dermot Hayes, and CPI contacted me about this matter.</P>
      <P>There are 6,000 disabled people in County Clare and the unit has been a tremendous help to them.  It is rumoured that the centre will close on Thursday and, if that is so, it will cause great inconvenience and hardship to the disabled in Clare and the surrounding area.  Disabled people are often paid low wages and incur hidden costs.  They would experience great hardship and inconvenience if they were asked to travel from Clare to Limerick, as those interested in promoting work for the disabled are aware.</P>
      <P>The Government has always placed great emphasis on equality for the disabled. The Ministers for Health and Law Reform have emphasised that equality must be sought at every opportunity through our laws.  Society's attitude towards the disabled has changed and the new directive on access to buildings has been implemented.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board should be facilitated in every way to continue their work in County Clare.  The board may feel it has no option but to move to Limerick for financial reasons.  I hope the Minister will give as much support and assistance as possible to ensure that the office remains in County Clare. We would like the office to be manned by able bodied persons and by a member of the disabled community to give practical advice and help.  The Disabled People of Clare have promoted this positive development.</P>
      <P>The issue of integrating the disabled into the workforce has been raised in the House and in committees.  We have not yet reached the 3 per cent quota for the disabled in the public service.  I hope we will do so as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> The NRB in Ennis provides an important service which needs to be continued. In County Clare 6,000 people avail of the service.  I acknowledge their work and the help they have given to people on a national, regional and county basis.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure the continuation of the NRB office in Ennis.  I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board operates under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for providing or arranging for the provision of a range of services for people with disabilities; advising the Minister for Health, public authorities and other organisations providing services to people with disabilities; and taking initiatives to increase awareness of disability issues among decision-makers and the general public.</P>
      <P>The principal services provided by the NRB include the provision of information to people with disabilities and the public on all disability related issues, occupational guidance for people with disabilities, psychological assessment, links to training and further education for people with disabilities, employment supports for people with disabilities actively seeking employment and the State audiology service, i.e. hearing testing, hearing aids and repairs, to all hearing impaired children and all adult medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The NRB is also responsible for managing the effective disbursement of European Social Funds for training and other initiatives aimed at the occupational integration of people with disabilities.  It is also involved in the creation of awareness of disability issues through conferences, competitions, training, and the media and conducts an ongoing programme of research into disability and rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services are provided through a network of eight regions with a total of 17 offices based in 16 counties.  The NRB <Col N="1690" /> has neither the financial nor human resources to have an office in each county, nor is this deemed necessary by the board.  The 17 offices are situated in the locations which the NRB considers to be most strategically positioned for the delivery of services.  I had the pleasure of opening a number of new offices during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Services to ten counties and many significantly sized towns are provided from the NRB offices located outside the county.  Among these are Longford, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Drogheda, Roscrea, Portlaoise etc.  The NRB's western region covers Limerick city and county, north Tipperary, Clare and Galway city and county.  Services for the region emanate from two offices, one in Galway city, and the other in Limerick city which is its western regional headquarters. In the past year the Galway office has been extensively upgraded and a new custom built office has been provided in Limerick city which is specifically designed to respond to the service needs of all disabilities.  All NRB administrative services for counties Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary are based in the NRB's Limerick office.  The NRB is satisfied that this arrangement represents the most effective use of resources as well as providing the best possible level of customer services.</P>
    <P>The NRB does not have a public office in County Clare.  It has had an informal arrangement for the use of a small room in the Mid-Western Health Board training centre in Ennis.  Due to an expansion of the training centre the health board requires the room used by the NRB. NRB services for people with disabilities in County Clare will continue to be provided from NRB Limerick and will not be diminished in any way.  This arrangement is identical to that already operating satisfactorily in other counties without NRB offices.  Many of these counties and towns would have a customer population in excess of County Clare.</P>
    <P>The NRB is satisfied that the arrangements <Col N="1691" /> in place for the provision of services in County Clare are on a par with those available throughout the country and that the level of services will not be affected in any way by the unavailability of the small room in the health board training centre.  The board will endeavour to continue to improve its services to people with disabilities in all its regions.</P>

      <P>Under the local development programme 33 areas have been designated as disadvantaged areas. The objective in these areas is through an integrated socio-economic action plan to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) improve the chances of the long <Col N="1542" /> term unemployed of obtaining employment, especially where opportunities arise in their own areas, or of setting up a business,</P>
    <P>(ii) help those at risk of early school leaving to get the maximum benefit from the educational system,</P>
    <P>(iii) enhance the capacity of local organisations-communities to participate fully in local development,</P>
    <P>(iv) help the development of effective community based organisations,</P>
    <P>(v) result in substantial improvements in the physical environment.</P>
    <P>In the designated areas, a partnership structure will be put in place.  This involves establishing a partnership company, limited by guarantee, with a board of directors comprising representatives of the State agencies operating in the area, the social partners and the local community.  The task of the partnership company is to draw up an action plan based on the needs and resources of the area in the context of the objectives of the local development programme and then act as the catalyst to have the plan implemented.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the action plans and the specific priorities within that plan are entirely for the partnership company. Funding will be available under the National Development Plan through the operational programme for local development with matching funding provided through the Vote of my Department. In addition, private sector funds such as from the enterprise trust, will be available to partnerships.</P>
    <P>The process of identifying the specific boundaries of each designated area is proceeding.  This involves consultation, including at local level, and the process will also involve identifying relevant social partner, State agencies and organisations or groups who would contribute effectively to the development of the areas with a view to forming a Partnership structure.  The State agencies, where relevant, are operating in each of the designated areas.  I do not have details <Col N="1543" /> of the voluntary organisations currently operating in these areas.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>in view of the Disabled Drivers (Motor Taxation Concessions) Regulations, 1989, if he will grant a concession to a person who satisfies all the criteria but as this person is only three years of age adaption of vehicle is not required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers Scheme, established under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, provides significant tax concessions to disabled drivers and passengers with severe mobility problems.  To qualify under the scheme, drivers and passengers must satisfy specified medical criteria and have adaptations carried out to the vehicles involved.  In the case of qualifying disabled passengers, the adaptation requirement <Col N="1583" /> is that the cost of adaptation must amount to 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of the vehicle &mdash; this limit was reduced from 30 per cent in the 1991 Finance Act. This requirement stems from the fact that, generally speaking where qualifying passengers are concerned, the nature of any adaptations which would be required to the vehicle would be quite different from those required for qualifying drivers. It must also be borne in mind that the vehicles involved are not likely to be used exclusively for the transport of the disabled passenger but will also be used by others e.g. family members.</P>
      <P>Against that background, the adaptation required is considered a fundamental control mechanism of the scheme which is designed to ensure that, within scarce budgetary resources, those most in need of help benefit.  While I sympathise with the case referred to in the Deputy's question, I must, in order to protect the wider interest, reiterate that, however desirable it may seem, complete abolition of a minimum adaptation requirement &mdash; even in limited circumstances &mdash; could open the scheme to abuse and could, in the long term, be excessively costly to the Exchequer.  I regret, therefore, that I am unable to see my way to waiving the adaptation requirement.</P>

      <P>I should explain that, as a general rule, commercial fishermen have the option of registering for VAT.  Where they do so, they are entitled to recover in full the VAT borne on their business inputs including fishing boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freshwater fishermen are treated as farmers for VAT purposes.  This means that unregistered freshwater fishermen <Col N="1584" /> are entitled to add the 2.5 per cent flat rate addition to the supplies they make to registered persons.  The purpose of this arrangement is to compensate them, in a general way, for the VAT borne on their business inputs.</P>
    <P>Where sea fishermen are concerned, zero rating applies to the supply, repair and maintenance of sea-fishing vessels of a gross tonnage of more than 15 tons as well as to fishing nets.  VAT charged on the supply, repair and maintenance of sea fishing vessels of less than 15 tons is refundable where the purchase of the vessel in question has been assisted by a grant or loan from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>Provision also exists for the refund of VAT charged on the repair and maintenance of most ancillary equipment and on marine diesel used in the course of a commercial sea-fishing business, whether or not the vessel has been the subject of assistance from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the car in question was <Col N="1585" /> seized by officers of Customs and Excise on 12 April 1994 for a breach of the Finance Act, 1992.  The Act, inter alia, makes it an offence for any person to be in possession of a vehicle that is not registered in the State unless the person is authorised by the Commissioners or is normally resident outside the State. Breaches of this provision renders the person in charge of the vehicle liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of £1,000. In addition, the vehicle is liable to seizure and forfeiture.</P>
      <P>The officers of Customs and Excise who stopped the vehicle being driven by the person concerned established that it was owned by her son who is normally resident in Scotland.  It was also established that one year previously she was encountered by officers of Customs and Excise driving a different non-State registered car.  On that occasion she was given an official warning that she was committing an offence but, beyond that, no further action was taken and she was allowed to proceed.  On this occasion the car was seized.  She agreed to pay a compromise sum of £200 to gain release of the car in lieu of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that on the date the car was seized the person concerned was aware both of her obligations and responsibilities under the law and of the consequences of being found in breach of the law.  Consequently, the Commissioners are satisfied that the correct procedures were followed and that the seizure of the car and the sum paid for the release of the car were appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a Special Task Force based at Mountjoy Station, consisting of three sergeants and 20 gardaí, was set up to deal with an increase in crime in the area.  This unit, which operates in the North Central Division, pays particular attention to the Iona-Drumcondra area. In addition, a special Crime Prevention Unit has been established to work in conjunction with the Detective Unit at Mountjoy Station.  This unit has targeted particular streets and roads in the area.</P>
      <P>As a result of measures taken by the gardaí, the general level of crime in the area has been considerably reduced and many offenders have been arrested and dealt with in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>As regards traffic law enforcement, local gardaí take all possible steps to control the parking of vehicles in the general locale, on major sporting events.  On such occasions, two or three tow-trucks are allocated to the area.  The gardaí are satisfied that this allocation of tow-trucks&mdash;in conjunction with other traffic restrictions and control measures &mdash; is sufficient to deal with instances of illegal parking which come to their attention on match-days.</P>

      <P>The persons in question were <Col N="1591" /> issued with certificates of naturalisation on 15 December 1992 by the Minister for Justice in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the 1956 Act which was inserted by section 5 of the Act of 1986 provides that the Minister for Justice may in his-her absolute discretion grant a certificate of naturalisation where the applicant has Irish associations &mdash; even if the other conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not fulfilled.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy and practice of successive Governments, from all sides of the House, to give favourable consideration to applications for naturalisation in the case of persons making or facilitating substantial investments in the State, where such investments have the aim of job creation or the preservation of jobs that might otherwise be lost.  The consistent view of successive Governments has been that, by being prepared to make a substantial investment in jobs in this country by purchasing a residence and spending a reasonable amount of time in the country, applicants for naturalisation, assuming of course that there are no serious impediments to naturalisation on other grounds, should be deemed to have the &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; necessary for the grant of citizenship.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that certain other countries follow a similar policy and I believe that it would generally be considered to be more in accordance with the intention of the Legislature that we should, as a matter of normal practice, grant applications in such cases rather than refuse them in the knowledge that the grant will secure investment and the refusal may see the investment move elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many favourable naturalisation decisions under the legislative provisions I have mentioned have been made over the years by successive Governments. The critical issue in all cases is whether proper procedures have been followed and whether the standard of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;, accepted by successive Justice <Col N="1592" /> Ministers and Governments, has been met &mdash; as of course happened in the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy would presumably agree that it would be an odd situation if a policy were to emerge whereby naturalisation would be refused, and the opportunity of inward job creating investment spurned.  I doubt if the people who are looking for work or concerned about the future viability of their jobs would regard that as sound policy change.</P>

      <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, gives the Minister for Justice power to make regulations providing for a national age card scheme.  I have no plans at present to make such regulations for the principal reason that I consider the way forward lies in the development of voluntary local age card schemes.  The indications are that such schemes backed by a strong community involvement can make a greater contribution to tackling underage drinking than a national scheme with all that that entails.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that eighty local schemes are in operation throughout the country and that plans are under way to establish new schemes in other centres.  I am also informed that, overall, the schemes are considered to be reasonably successful and beneficial and that they have assisted in reducing the levels of alcohol use by persons under the age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are four Garda districts serving the Cork city area, Anglesea Street, Togher, Mayfield and Gurranabraher.  The total current Garda strength at these stations is 572.  In addition, there are currently 39 civilian clerical staff, performing administrative work for the gardaí and their recruitment has led to the release for operational duties of an equivalent number of gardaí.</P>
      <P>At present, one sergeant and 14 gardaí are involved on community policing duties in Cork city.  In addition to the foot patrols carried out by these gardaí, both foot and mobile patrols are carried out throughout the city on a regular basis by both uniform and plainclothes gardaí. While the final crime figures for 1993 have not been compiled, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the indications are that the number of crimes reported in Cork city over the past two years has remained static and there is no indication of any increase in crime levels in Cork city to date in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for Cork city are adequate to meet the needs of the city.  They are keeping the situation under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>In practice a considerable number of &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo; establishments have operated for many years without any specific planning permission and the need for such permission did not become an issue until quite recently.  Against this background, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, clarified the position of &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo; accommodation by providing that development consisting of the use of not more than four bedrooms in a dwellinghouse as overnight guest accommodation will be exempted development for planning purposes and will not require planning permission. This exemption will not apply, however, if that use would contravene a condition of the planning permission for the house, or be inconsistent with any use specified or included in the permission.</P>
      <P>The exemption provided by the 1994 Regulations relates only to planning permission requirements.  It does not detract from the application of other statutory codes &mdash; including the Fire Services Act, the Building Regulations and the Food Hygiene Regulations &mdash; to &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo; premises.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a formal planning exemption for small scale &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo; operations will not have significant effects in terms of the proper planning and development of the areas in which they are located and will not involve a significant change in the situation which has existed <i>de facto</i> until now.  The exemption relates solely to planning requirements.  I do not believe that it will have adverse implications for the hotels sector or for tourism generally.</P>

My Department provides technical advice and assistance to groups in such cases, including, where appropriate, assistance with the preparation of designs for major improvement works or extensions to schemes.  My Department has also compiled a number of information leaflets to assist groups in the maintenance of schemes and in planning new works to replace or improve existing schemes. County councils provide advice on matters relating to the take-over of group schemes.</P>

The role of my Department's Information Office and the cost of entertainment extend to the Department as a whole and are not specific to my office.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question concerning a comparative figure for 1991, my Department's functions changed in January 1993 with the amalgamation of the forest service.

      <P>The recognition of the qualifications of Irish registered psychiatric nurses in other European Union member states is a matter for the competent nursing authority in each of those member states.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently taken steps to increase the theoretical instruction component of psychiatric nurse training to bring it into line with that required in general nurse training under the terms of Directive 89/595/EEC which concerns the mutual recognition of qualifications in that discipline.  On foot of this development I can see no reason why Irish registered psychiatric nurses would not have their qualifications recognised and accepted in all EU countries. From inquiries made by my Department to An Bord Altranais, I understand that this is in fact the position.</P>
      <P>Directive 89/48/EEC introduced a general system for the mutual recognition of qualifications for all regulated professions which require a minimum of three years higher education and training and which are not already covered by sectoral directives.  Steps have been taken to have psychiatric nursing qualifications brought under the scope of this directive. This is being done by way of amendment of the relevant implementing Statutory Instrument which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned. I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital and I have been informed that this person has been on the waiting list for cardiac by-pass surgery and aortic valve replacement surgery since 11 February 1994.  The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for his operation.  However, if the person feels that his condition has deteriorated he should contact his general practitioners who would be in the best position to highlight his case to his consultant.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital.  In addition, in 1993, I provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>The major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre is ongoing.  I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development which is nearing completion includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This development, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of <Col N="1622" /> open heart surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent.</P>

      <P>The provision of speech therapy services in Ballinasloe is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Speech therapy services for children with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe area are provided by the Brothers of Charity on behalf of the board.</P>
      <P>Speech therapy services in the Ballinasloe area were provided on a five day a week basis for a period earlier this year. However, due to a shortage of speech therapists in other areas in Galway, it became necessary to reduce the level of speech therapy services which were being provided in Ballinasloe.  The ratio of speech therapists to the caseload in Ballinasloe still compares favourably with other areas in the western region.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the inadequacy of the speech therapy sevices in general is the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists.  My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin, commencing in the 1992-93 academic year.  The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96. The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>

      <P>Following the publication in September 1991 of the Reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, which was also chaired by Professor David Kennedy, monitored and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of the &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations contained in these reports.  The advisory group also pursued the implementation of the recommendations in relation to out-patient services and in-patient waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The group found that the implementation of the &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations was broadly satisfactory, although it was recognised that to put these fully into effect would take some time.  Certain recommendations required the provision of additional resources and these will continue to be addressed in the context of individual hospitals' development priorities and the funds available for improvements throughout the health services as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> In relation to the waiting lists and out-patient services the advisory group was satisfied that the broad thrust of the recommendations concerning these areas had been accepted and that steps had been taken to pursue their application at national level.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of the Government's £20 million Waiting List Initiative last year, the numbers waiting in the acute public hospital sector at June, 1993 were reduced from 40, 130 to 25,373 at December, 1993, a reduction of 37 per cent. Furthermore, there was particular success in reducing the numbers of adults and children waiting for periods in excess of 12 months and 6 months in the problems specialties.  These numbers were reduced from 14,624 at the launch of the Initiative to 6,240 by December, 1993, an overall reduction of 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>Among the speciality areas covered by the Initiative were those which include cardiac procedures, hip replacements and cataract procedures.  The target of 17,254 additional procedures announced at the launch of the Initiative was, in fact, exceeded and the overall number of additional procedures performed in 1993 was 18,768.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Aidan's national school there were 390 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus 12 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  It is recognised that the school is serving a designated area of disadvantage as a concessionary disadvantaged teacher has been allocated. In addition the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a home-school liaison teacher and an assistant in charge of a special class.</P>
      <P>There were 344 pupils enrolled in ordinary classes in the school on 30 September 1993 and 15 pupils enrolled in the special class.  This gives an aggregate enrolment of 351.5 for staffing purposes under the new arrangement whereby half of the enrolment in special classes is added to the ordinary enrolment to determine the quota staffing of a school in 1994-95.  This aggregate enrolment warrants a staff of principal plus 11 assistants for the 1994-95 school year.  The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 367 pupils in order to retain the post of 12th assistant in 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or <Col N="1630" /> where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.

      <P>As stated in my announcement on the 1994 education budget, I propose to allocate 15 additional co-ordinator posts to the home school community liaison scheme at primary level with effect from September next.  These extra posts will facilitate a significant expansion of the service and the schools to be targeted will be selected from among those already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and, as such, has been allocated a concessionary teaching post.  It also receives additional capitation funding at a rate of £17 per pupil.  The process of selecting schools for inclusion in the expanded home school community liaison scheme is currently under way in my Department and the needs of the school <Col N="1635" /> in question, together with all applicant schools, will be considered in this context.</P>
