      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises) (Member States of the European Community) Order, 1994,</P>
    <P>a copy of which order in draft was laid before the Dáil on 25 February, 1994.</P>
    <P>The creation of the internal market required that priority in the field of direct taxation be given to the removal of tax obstacles to cross-border activities of the European Community.  On 23 July 1990 the Council of Ministers adopted a package of three Community acts in the field of direct taxation on parents &mdash; subsidiaries, mergers and an arbitration procedure. The arbitration procedure is a multilateral convention between the member states which provides for a mutual agreement procedure between tax authorities where double taxation has occurred.  Where this procedure fails to resolve disputes, it provides for referral to an independent advisory commission. Although the convention was signed by all 12 member states on 23 July 1990 it does not come into force until approximately three months after it has been ratified by all 12 countries.  To date, the convention has been ratified by nine countries, namely, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The double taxation referred to is that which might arise when the tax authorities of one member state adjusts for tax purposes the profits declared by an enterprise of that state where such profits result from transactions between that enterprise and an associated enterprise in another member state and these transactions were at prices which differ from those which would normally apply between independent enterprises.  The adjustment of profits may result in an increased tax bill for one of the enterprises and double taxation would occur when the tax authorities of the member state in which the other enterprise is situated do not make a corresponding reduction in the taxable profits of that other enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> The mutual agreement or arbitration procedure would apply in the cases described above.  The taxes which are within the scope of the convention are specified and the tax authorities in the member states are identified.  If a company considers that there is double taxation, it may present its case to its tax authority within three years of the event.  If the tax authority considers the case to be well-founded and cannot resolve it, it is obliged to attempt to resolve it by mutual agreement with the tax authority of the other member state. If agreement cannot be reached within two years the tax authorities are required to seek from the advisory commission an opinion as to how the tax should be eliminated.  If the two tax authorities do not agree on a resolution of the case within six months of receipt of the commission's opinion, they would be obliged to accept the opinion of the commission. The commission would be composed of representatives of the tax authorities involved, together with independent persons of standing nominated by the member states.  The commission would be empowered to request information from the undertakings and from the tax authorities.  Safeguards with regard to confidentiality and secrecy are provided.</P>
    <P>The convention will become operative on the first day of the third month after the final instrument of ratification has been deposited with the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Communities and it will remain in force for a period of five years.  The contracting states will meet six months prior to the expiry date to decide on its extension.</P>
    <P>An order by the Government made under section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 is required to give the convention the force of Irish law.  Before such an order is made a draft of it must be laid before, and approved by, Dáil Éireann. The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 25 February 1994 and contains in its schedule the text of the convention.  An explanatory memorandum outlining the effects of the convention has also been circulated.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the main features <Col N="1071" /> of the convention.  Article 4 is an anti-violance provision authorising the reallocation of profits, on an arm's length basis, between connected enterprises in the two contracting states where the accounts do not reflect the taxable profits which might be expected to have arisen if the transactions between the enterprises had been subject to normal commercial terms.  The Article also provide for a <i>pro rata</i> taxation of profits where an enterprise has a permanent establishment in another contracting state.</P>
    <P>Article 5 provides for all parties to be advised of any adjustment in profits of an enterprise by one state.  Where the adjustment is agreed, recourse to the mutual agreement and arbitration process provided for in Articles 6 and 7 will not be required.</P>
    <P>Article 6 provides for consultation between the authorities of the states concerned with a view to eliminating, by mutual agreement, any double taxation which may have arisen in a case where an adjustment has been made to the profits of an enterprise.  Where an agreement is reached between the competent authorities, it is to be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws for the contracting states concerned.</P>
    <P>Article 7 provides for the setting up of an advisory commission where agreement has not been reached in accordance with Article 6 on the elimination of any double taxation that may have arisen following an adjustment of profits by one of the contracting states within a period of two years.  It also secures that enterprises may separately have recourse to the remedies available to them under the domestic law of the contracting states concerned to prevent the double taxation.</P>
    <P>The submission of a case to the advisory commission will not prevent a contracting state from initiating or continuing judicial proceedings or proceedings for administrative penalties in relation to the same matters.</P>
    <P>The Article also provides that its provisions shall not apply to a contracting <Col N="1072" /> state where a final decision of its judicial bodies has been made in a case and the domestic legislation of a contracting state does not permit the competent authority of that state to derogate from decisions of its judicial bodies.  In Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners must abide by a court ruling that applies to a particular taxpayer.  The two year time limit for the settlement of a case between the competent authorities may be waived by agreement between the competent authorities and the associated enterprises concerned.</P>
    <P>Article 8 provides that initiation of the mutual agreement procedure or the setting up of the advisory commission need not be proceeded with where one of the enterprises concerned is liable or may be liable to a serious penalty.  This is to ensure that entities involved in tax avoidance or evasion will not benefit from the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>The list of serious penalties for each country is appended to the convention. In Ireland's case there is no specific body of legislation providing for penalties in the transfer pricing area.  The penalties listed apply to all taxpayers and could be invoked in a transfer pricing case.</P>
    <P>Article 9 deals with the personnel and organisation of the advisory commission. It provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the independent persons of standing must be competent and independent and that the chairman of the commission, who shall be chosen from a list of such persons, must be qualified for appointment to the highest judicial office in his-her state or be a jurisconsult of recognised competence. Each country is required to nominate five competent, independent, persons for this purpose; these persons must be nationals of a contracting state and resident within the territory of the EU.</P>
    <P>The commission is bound to keep secret any information which it obtains as a result of the proceedings and contracting states are at liberty to select their own penalties for breach of secrecy obligations.</P>
    <P>Article 10 provides for the furnishing <Col N="1073" /> of relevant information to the advisory commission within the confines of domestic law, administrative practice and public policy in general.</P>
    <P>Article 11 relates to the workings of the advisory commission and provides that the commission shall deliver its opinion within six months from the date on which the matter was referred to it. The costs of the advisory commission procedure, other than those incurred by the associate enterprises themselves, are to be shared between the contracting states concerned.</P>
    <P>Article 12 provides for the elimination of double taxation concerned within six months of the date of the advisory commission's opinion either in accordance with the commission's opinion or by way of a common agreement between the competent authorities.</P>
    <P>Article 13 allows recourse to the mutual agreement and arbitration procedures even where assessments have become final.</P>
    <P>Article 14 details the methods for the elimination of double taxation.  The profits are either to be taxable only in one of the two contracting states concerned or else they can be taxed in both countries but credit must be given in one country for the tax chargeable in the other country.</P>
    <P>Article 17 provides that the convention must be ratified by the individual contracting states.</P>
    <P>Article 18 provides that the convention shall enter into force on the first day of the third month after it has been ratified by the last of all the contracting states.</P>
    <P>Article 20 provides that the convention will remain in force for an initial period of five years and that six months before its expiry the contracting states shall meet to discuss its extension.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this draft order, but there are one or two matters I wish to comment on.  It is interesting that a convention that was signed in July 1990 and which we were one of the last to sign should take four years to come <Col N="1074" /> before the House.  It would be no harm if we were to move more rapidly on this kind of housekeeping.</P>
      <P>This deals with transfer pricing and corporation profits tax.  It deals with subsidiary companies of multinationals set up in Ireland that are repatriating their profits to their parent company.  With regard to this Arbitration Commission I ask the Minister to be cautious in one respect.  A critical part of our attraction for mobile investment is our 10 per cent profits tax.  A level playing field in the context of industrial grants, incentives and taxes would leave precious little incentive for anyone in the multinational mobile investment business to invest in Ireland.  We do not have cheaper labour costs, we have higher transport costs and are located peripherally and therefore we would lose.  It is reckoned that there is a 10 per cent transport cost impediment to those producing here.</P>
      <P>We need to realise that a level playing field is not in our interests.  To totally equate corporation profits tax would cause difficulties for us.  If companies pay the 10 per cent profits tax here, and when the money is repatriated they have to pay the full domestic corporation profits tax on the repatriated profits through double taxation, we will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be very careful in selecting the nominees to this Arbitration Commission.  We should not be apologetic, to use the phrase of another Minister in another context, for wearing the green jersey, because peripheral countries have special needs.  My fear is that the golden triangle at the centre of Europe will develop and become stronger at the expense of peripheral regions. There is evidence that, notwithstanding the regional transfers of resources, the rich in the centre of Europe have got richer at the expense of the peripheral regions.  Although we are all for fairness, we must realise that the key selling advantage for Ireland is the 10 per cent corporation tax.  If that is undermined there will be no reinvestment here because we have no other advantage. I am told that the Scottish and Welsh agencies are giving more generous grants <Col N="1075" /> than the IDA to attract investment.  With high unemployment in the centre of Europe, it is only a matter of time before they do likewise.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the EC Commission the Irish authorities freely determined which sectors would be subject to the 10 per cent corporation profits tax. The British have made strong representations that we should not have the 10 per cent corporation profits tax for mushroom cultivation and should switch to the standard rate which, in this country, is 40 per cent.  This is because in recent years we have developed a successful mushroom growing industry, sending a fresh product into the UK market.  In my own constituency and in Cavan-Monaghan and the west there has been a huge increase in satellite growers and thousands of jobs are involved. According to the answer to a Dáil question I had down yesterday it seems that the British representations are getting through and that the EC Commission concluded its investigations earlier this year and found the application of the 10 per cent rate to mushroom cultivation to be incompatible with the common market.  I would like to see these matters which have been referred to the Arbitration Commission referred to here because it seems that small weak countries like Ireland are losing.  Unless there is a 10 per cent corporation profits tax regime for the mushroom industry we can forget about it because the cost disadvantage of transporting fresh mushrooms from Ireland into Cardiff and London would be prohibitive.  The British have all those advantages.  The one advantage we have is the 10 per cent tax rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comment about the statistics on transfer pricing.  It seemes that every 18 months the Central Statistics Office revises the statistics relating to our gross domestic product.  From speaking to international economists I gather the Irish statistics on the level of transfer pricing are questioned, that it is thought that they are not the most reliable.  We need to get to grips <Col N="1076" /> with that so that our economic planning is based on real figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also clarify the role of the International Financial Services Centre, a somewhat successful venture where there is substantial potential for growth.  I would like his assurance that this convention and the concept of double taxation will not interfere with the future growth of the International Financial Services Centre.  The German authorities and others in Europe have raised questions about their centre.  They feel that the lateral movement of financial services from their country to Ireland is the result of loopholes in the tax law within the Community.</P>
    <P>One would need to be senior counsel to go through all these conventions.  It is not possible for us on the Opposition to do it, because of lack of resources.  We need to be watchful lest these conventions become the vehicle by which business that has come to this country will move out.  I ask the Minister to bear those comments in mind and to realise that peripheral States such as Ireland have precious few advantages and that the one area where national governments have some degree of flexibility is in the tax code.  We need to be mindful of this in our approach to such conventions. However, we support this draft order setting up the Arbitration Commission and believe it should go through with the necessary speed to ensure that we are not the last to ratify this convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter arose at a meeting of the Whips, it occurred to me it is a matter which deserves discussion and not one which should be passed without debate as originally proposed.  This convention may be fraught with potential dangers for us in terms of our taxation incentive packages and the means by which service industries, in particular, are attracted here.  It is proposed to put in place at a European level a system of arbitration which will determine whether, and to what extent, adjustments can be made to taxation for companies deemed under national legislation to be engaged in tax avoidance by <Col N="1077" /> transferring prices or engaging in other transactions.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arise in this regard. By adopting this measure we are putting in place a system of arbitration at a European level which may affect the liability to taxation of Irish enterprises.  It may also affect enterprises in foreign countries, but we should be conscious that we are handing over to an arbitral commission the function of determining how much tax an Irish company pays here or elsewhere in certain circumstances.  Is that necessary because of our membership of the European Union?  I appreciate that the convention requires ratification by the national legislative bodies of each country, but is it a necessitated obligation which flows from European treaties?  Is it constitutional that the amount of tax paid by Irish companies should be determined by a non-Irish competent authority such as the arbitral commission? I look forward to the Minister's response in that regard.  In general, Irish business is entitled to have its tax liabilities determined by domestic law.  I acknowledge that there is an international law dimension to every multilateral double taxation agreement but I am wary about agreeing on the nod to a proposition that a body other than an Irish court and Legislature can determine the tax liability of an Irish enterprise. Will the Minister confirm that the matter has been examined by the Attorney General, that, in turn, he has stated this is a necessitated obligation under the treaties of the European Union and that the implicit right which is being transferred to an international arbitral body to determine the tax liabilities of Irish companies is protected by the amendment to the Constitution made on our accession to the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To what extent will this House be reported to on the workings of the arbitral commission as it affects Irish taxation? Will the Department of Finance report on the manner in which arbitrations made by the commission affect the liability and viability of Irish enterprises and Government policy in terms <Col N="1078" /> of attracting companies here by way of tax incentives?  It appears that when this order is passed that will be the last this House will hear of it.  We will hear nothing from the arbitrators and the Minister for Finance will not be statutorily obliged to tell us how the arbitrators are operating, their effects, whether Irish industry is benefiting or losing or whether our industrial policy is being advanced or retarded.  Effectively, those matters will be cast adrift when this House surrenders the functions contemplated in this order to an international arbitral body.  This measure should be implemented as part of the Finance Bill and the subject of domestic legislative provisions in respect of which a clear domestic function for the Minister would remain.  An annual report should be submitted to this House stating how the arbitral commission's activities are affecting Irish policy and taxpayers, but allowing for the right to confidentiality of taxpayers.  It would be unacceptable that a company who is the subject of an arbitral decision should have its affairs discussed in this House.  When the House agrees this order it will not be informed of the policy principles adopted by the arbitral commission.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that other countries, particularly America and Japan, are becoming very wary about the notion of transfer pricing, its effect on domestic tax buoyancy and the capacity of countries to use tax regimes, such as ours, to avoid taxation by artificial transactions.  In that context it is expected that countries will retaliate by putting in place implied arm's length provisions such as those contained in this order.  If a company locates 10 per cent of its activities here, maximises the amount of its activities across Europe on the basis of locating as much of its profit as possible in Ireland and concludes agreements with the Irish manufacturing arm of a multi-locational enterprise which are advantageous to the Irish enterprise and less advantageous to the others, will every country in the European Union be entitled to investigate the affairs of such companies and set aside for taxation purposes transactions which <Col N="1079" /> appear to be motivated by a desire to avoid tax in one country and take advantage of our 10 per cent tax rate? Have we received sufficient information about this Convention.  I would like to know the consequences of the 10 per cent manufacturing rate.  I note what Deputy Yates said about the mushroom industry, but that is only one of a number of possible instances where there will be pressure from competitors in European countries to investigate companies which have a manufacturing arm in Ireland to bring the Revenue authorities of other countries down on them with a view to ascertaining if they can prove an element of transfer pricing.</P>
    <P>What is the statutory basis for appointment by our Government of the panel of arbitrators?  It appears that the positions must be filled by a judge of the High Court, a person eligible for appointment to the highest judicial office in the relevant country.  We should introduce a measure in the Finance Bill for the appointment of such people.  Will they be appointed on a permanent basis or given independence if they are appointed on a short term basis?  What type of people will be appointed to those positions? Within our regime no qualifications are required by appeal commissioners dealing with income tax matters.  While I do not have any principle objection to the convention some aspects of it should be clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not merely about a multilateral convention to provide relief in cases where double taxation arises, it is also an instrument of industrial policy.  For that reason it is important this draft order was not nodded through the House.  To some extent we are all taking it at face value, that there are good and sensible reasons why we ought to give effect to it without having the capacity for different reasons to look behind the articles and comment on their efficacy and so on.  If the convention was introduced in the form of legislation we would have had that ability.  People are interested in the legislation but public <Col N="1080" /> attention has not been drawn to it nor have we received submissions in respect of it.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Yates' argument that the 10 per cent tax regime is the key plank of our industrial policy. Down the years that may have appeared to be the case but I, nor the representatives of multinational companies, would agree that is correct.  The 10 per cent tax regime is not the only factor that has attracted multinationals here in the past but it has been an important one. Access to the European Union, the availability of a skilled English speaking workforce and other considerations are listed in multinational studies as being important in attacting such investment here. When I dealt with multinationals I rarely if ever met a representative from a multi-national subsidiary company here who claimed that wage competitiveness was a major issue and that is still the case.  In cases where comparisons are made with Pacific rim countries the parameters of the debate changes and a wage competitiveness argument becomes important but it does not apply here.  As Deputy Yates stated, this measure is important in the context of the 10 per cent tax regime recently extended.</P>
      <P>From our view point the issue of transfer pricing is the nub of the matter.  I do not recall which NESC report dealt with that issue.  The frank conclusions of that report indicated that is an important issue for our economy.  Deputy Yates referred to the reliability of statistics.  Officials of the CSO admitted a few years ago that there was a blip in the accounting system but I understand from my membership of the Committee of Public Accounts that matter has been rectified.  The CSO would argue that its methodology is as reliable as any other, but transfer pricing is taking place and is a major factor.  As Deputy McDowell stated, it is such a major factor that the United States is so alarmed that it piloted legislation through Capitol Hill recently in this regard.  If that legislation had been passed in its original form it could have seriously impacted on our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States Government is concerned <Col N="1081" /> about the loss of revenue to its Exchequer as a result of parent companies located in the United States taking advantage of low tax regimes in countries such as Ireland.  I do not understand how this draft order affects transactions between member countries of the European Union and third countries such as the United States or Japan.  What are the implications?  What is to prevent a company domiciled in the United States, Japan or wherever with various subsidiaries in member countries of the European Union with access to the expertise that has facilitated this ruse in the first instance using that facility to minimise the tax advantage here?</P>
    <P>I have always supported multinational investment here.  I have argued that we failed to develop comparable indigenous companies.  However, if multinationals had not invested here, provided employment, training facilities and development potential for our people the position would have been unthinkable.  Until recently the corporation profits tax yield here was insignificant.  The position was visible until recent years.  I accepted during the debate on last year's Finance Bill that that position has begun to change during the past few years, but there should not be a legitimate diminution in the tax take.  The debate tonight will deal with the transfer of tax from income earned to property and so on, but if the corporate sector does not make a fair contribution there is no possibility of tax reform in the broad sense.</P>
    <P>Article 14 refers to the position where profits are to be taxable in one or other of the contracting states and states that they could be taxed in both states but credit would be given in one.  Are we vulnerable in that we may be the poor relation of such an arrangement?  What ties retain those companies here rather than in Scotland, France or wherever the lion's share of whatever contribution made is contributed.  That probably relates to Deputy McDowell's point about the competence of the arbitrators. That complex area does not merely require a knowledge of the law but of commerce, business and the expertise <Col N="1082" /> multinationals have at their fingertips if rational arbitrations are to be made on some potentially difficult cases.</P>
    <P>Without adequate back-up and without putting the measure through a committee of the House, it is very difficult to comment on the detail of a draft order such as this.  I am not competent to comment on the efficacy of the anti-avoidance and anti-evasion measures which the Minister says are provided for in Article 8, perhaps that will not come to light until it is too late.  Our experience of multinationals is that it was heresy down the years ever to raise a question about their performance in this economy. When outside consultants were brought in they told us what many people suspected.  Will it take a further ten years to bring in consultants to tell us that revenue is leaking from this economy? There are no accountability measures in this order and that is not ideal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly answer some of the questions raised.  On the 10 per cent regime that caused the increase in the number of cases referred to by Deputy Yates, we have concluded double taxation conventions with eight of the European Union member states.  All these conventions contain provisions allowing a Treaty partner country to increase the profits of an enterprise in that country where it is considered that transfer pricing involving an Irish company has occurred.  We are not aware of cases where other countries have taken this step.  The difficulties with some of our Treaty partner countries in recent years because of certain schemes in the International Financial Services Sector, which involved the avoidance of tax, have been well documented.  The authorities here have unilaterally eliminated a number of these abuses in the overall interests of the IFSC.  We have agreed safeguards with the Danish and Swedish conventions to prevent a recurrence of these abuses. In the case of both these conventions, there was no question of refusal on the part of Sweden and Denmark to continue their Treaty recognition of the 10 per <Col N="1083" /> cent rate.  The only concern expressed by those countries was to prevent abuses of the concession.  The Revenue Commissioners are in constant contact with the taxation authorities in other countries who have expressed concern and work to prevent abuses of the 10 per cent rate while protecting the concessions granted under the Treaties.  We have managed to keep ahead of those difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the 10 per cent as it relates to mushrooms, I answered questions on that matter yesterday.  I have been involved with the Deputy's county, in Cavan-Monaghan and in the west to find ways to assist companies.  The Deputy is familiar with what is necessary to deal with these cases.</P>
      <P>This convention is strongly supported by businesses.  They do not see it as creating difficulties for them.  While difficulties may arise, there is some recourse to deal with them, which was not previously the case.  The Attorney General has given his assent to all the issues involved.  On the question of difficulties with other countries, powers and rights already exist under various Treaties and domestic laws and there are procedures to be followed.  On Deputy Rabbitte's point as to whether this affects third countries, the answer is no.  Deputy McDowell asked about the procedure. The convention will be renewed after five years and at that stage we will have a report of what has happened in that period.  There is considerable data which I can give to spokespersons &mdash; if I had time I would put it on the record.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on this Bill which, apart from any considerations of an impending divorce referendum, is necessary and desirable. While it contains a number of important and welcome provisions, I am deeply concerned that a number of statements made by a member of the High Court over a period of a year or more seem to indicate a frame of mind, in that person at least, which is utterly antagonistic to what I regard as the compassionate philosophy that underlines this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives the courts a number of powers in dealing with pension schemes, the objectives of which I support but which can require trustees of pension schemes to do things which are not consistent with the rules of their schemes.  I find no evidence that the Government has given serious consideration to the implications of those proposals or to their feasibility &mdash; I will come back to that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some sections of the Bill require the courts to make judgments based on an assessment of matters such as likely future obligations on parties in family law cases, without giving directions as to how the court is to assess these obligations. These are referred to in section 16.  The courts will find it very difficult to interpret <Col N="1085" /> these powers and may choose not to use them at all or perhaps to use them very conservatively.  That is not the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed provision for notification of intention to marry three months prior to the date of marriage is absolutely absurd although I know I am out of step with a great many of my colleagues on all sides of the House in saying so.  I could not find anything in the Minister's speech to explain why the Government believes that a change in the current law and practice is required.  This is very bad because unless the Government can produce a valid and sensible reason for making a provision of this kind &mdash; it is highly unlikely that any such reason can be produced &mdash; then the provision should be dropped from the Bill.  I will come back to that point later.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the Bill and many of its detailed provisions underline once again the central importance of the Bill published in 1988 by my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, which eventually became the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  I am happy that Deputy Shatter, with my full backing and the full support of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, persisted with that Bill and overcame what was sometimes a very cynical rearguard action by deeply conservative elements in Fianna Fáil to have that Act finally placed on the Statute Book.  That Act has been a major bench mark in the development of family law and the compassionate philosophy which underlines this Bill, and should be valued as such.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increasing attention given to family law matters in recent years and the increasing public sensitivity to the many problems which still have to be resolved.  However, there are still many causes for concern, one of which must be the recent Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill. I do not for a moment question the President's decision to refer that Bill to the Supreme Court for an adjudication on its constitutionality &mdash; that was the perfectly proper thing to do &mdash; but I am worried that in its judgment the court seemed to <Col N="1086" /> indicate it sets rights to property above concerns with equality.  With a different frame of mind, the court could just as easily have come to another conclusion, setting concerns with equity above rights to property.</P>
    <P>I have no patience with the various disingenuous criticisms of the drafting of that Bill since the Supreme Court found it unconstitutional.  The number of Bills referred to the Supreme Court and adjudged to be unconstitutional or successfully challenged by individuals is not very high in terms of the total volume of legislation we pass in this House.  The provisions in our Constitution for the referral of Bills, for the right to challenge legislation and for the Supreme Court to tell us what the Constitution means were all put there with a very specific purpose in mind and it is nonsense to complain when those provisions are invoked from time to time.</P>
    <P>Having said that and taking the view that the court could just as easily have made a different decision on that Bill, I hope the Government will come back to the issue in the light of the specific judgment made by the court.  I hope the Minister agrees that, taking account of what the Supreme Court said and the reasons it has given for its adjudication, it may be possible to secure the objective this House set out when it began to debate the Matrimonial Home Bill. Regardless of what the court said, our Constitution clearly must allow us to make progress in the direction of equity and justice for the people involved.</P>
    <P>I am worried about a series of comments made by a member of the High Court, Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon, which seem to indicate a rejection of much of what has been done in recent years in family law and related areas. They indicate a frame of mind which is antipathetic to the direction family law has taken in recent years, a direction which in my view &mdash; and I think in the view of many other Members of this House &mdash; represents a belated but nevertheless welcome appreciation of the nature of many of the problems affecting families today.  It is a matter of deep <Col N="1087" /> concern to me to find on one of the Benches principally concerned with this area of family law an attitude which seems to be deeply hostile to the direction the law is taking.  I shudder to think what this might mean for the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>This matter goes further.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon recently characterised the contents of condom vending machines as &ldquo;repulsive&rdquo;.  I cannot imagine that he intended us to take that remark at face value as an aesthetic judgment informed only by personal observation or experience. I think what he finds repulsive is the fact that a woman and a man can decide and have the means to control the fertility of their union.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon has expressed other views which go far beyond the simple question of contraception; they go to the heart of many of the difficulties which cause people to resort to the courts to resolve family law matters.  I find it deeply disturbing that these views are held and expressed with such force and so publicly by a member of the Judiciary who may be called upon to preside over hearings of family law matters in our courts.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Hanlon is perfectly entitled to hold whatever views he thinks proper, but I am worried that a member of the Bench would resort to the kind of nonsensical claim, which we will hear more and more in the coming months, that in some way Members of this House are involved in a conspiracy to sap the moral fibre of our nation.  That is the last thing we want to do.  We are trying to find a way through the difficulties which beset people in our society and to find compassionate and just means of resolving their difficulties.  I would have expected a far higher degree of analytical competence to be shown by a member of the Bench of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Some provisions of the Bill call for particular comment or question.  The provisions on pensions and succession rights in cases of nullity show just how precarious the concept of nullity is.  Section 2 (3) deals with the issues of nullity and voidability from a definitional point of <Col N="1088" /> view.  I do not for a moment question the necessity for those references in the Bill but the very fact that those contortions have to be included in the definition section shows very clearly that it would be much more logical to provide for divorce than to have to go through the kind of legal and mental gymnastics involved in making those types of provisions in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>The matter becomes even clearer when we conside the concept of nullity of marriage in the precepts of our principal Church.  It is incomprehensible for anyone to pretend to determine the state of mind of a couple on the day they married when looking at their situation after perhaps 20 years of family life.  The entire concept goes far beyond the limits of credibility.  I have enormous sympathy for the people on tribunals dealing with these cases &mdash; I know some of them &mdash; who find their work intellectually, emotinally and spiritually draining.  The work they do rests on what I would regard as a conceptual fallacy and it puts them and, more tragically, the people who come before them in an appalling emotional wringer, all for the sake of avoiding the concept of divorce.  It makes provision for the very same thing at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this area was well illustrated, perhaps inadvertently, when the Minister introduced the Bill.  At Volume 439, column 618 of the Official Report, when speaking of succession rights in section 13 of the Bill, the Minister said: &ldquo;The position is different in the context of nullity.  As pointed out in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, following nullity, succession rights must end because the parties are no longer spouses&rdquo;.  The Minister should have said that no succession rights ever existed in such a case because legally the marriage never existed.  The fact, however, is that the Minister, the Government and the Committee on Marital Breakdown recognised what the Minister described as &ldquo;possible hardship involved in loss of succession rights&rdquo;.  The fact that the Minister recognised that in such cases must surely indicate that for some time <Col N="1089" /> at least couples involved in such situations believed they were married and believed that the marriage gave rise to the duties, obligations, rights and expectations that are normally associated with marriage.  Any hardships arising &mdash; and hardships undoubtedly arise in situations of that kind &mdash; should be dealt with on the basis that is appropriate to divorce.  We should not put people through mental contortions by saying that something is a nullity when in fact it clearly existed in their minds, in their behaviour and even in their hearts for a period of years.</P>
    <P>Section 11 proposes to empower the courts to give directions to the trustees of pension schemes and in subsection (3) such directions may even go to the point of requiring trustees to act in a way which does not comply with the rules of the pension scheme in question.  Has the Government reflected on the possible implications of empowering the courts to give such directions?  What will be the legal situation of the trustees of a pension scheme who, after representation, are ordered by the court to do things which are clearly outside the rules of the scheme of which they are trustees?  Has the Minister given any attention to that matter? If not, we should not make such a provision in this Bill even though the aim of the Bill in so doing is laudable and motivated by a concern for justice.</P>
    <P>In making provisions under section 16 relating to periodical payments, lump sum orders, property adjustment orders, miscellaneous ancillary orders, financial compensation orders, pension adjustment orders, the preservation of pension rights after judicial separation and orders for the provision of a spouse out of the estate of the other spouse, the courts would be required by this Bill to make a number of judgments, including judgments as to the likely future obligations and capacities of spouses.  Section 16 contains a whole series of the kinds of judgments that the courts have to make. In section 16 (2) (a) there is reference to &ldquo;resources which each of the spouses concerned has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future&rdquo;.  That reference occurs twice.  The effects on the earning <Col N="1090" /> capacity of each spouse is also mentioned. It states also that the court must have regard to &ldquo;the conduct of each of the spouses, if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would in all the circumstances of the case be unjust to disregard it&rdquo;.  We can all argue whether the court should have regard to those matters but they are areas that are likely to be very difficult indeed for the courts. Has the Government teased out all of the possible implications in connection with these kinds of judgments?</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to raise the minimum age of marriage, currently 16, to 18. Although I dislike regulations of this kind and believe the legislation should not enter further than is necessary into people's personal lives, I recognise that this question is largely a matter of judgment and I would have to go along with the proposal.  It is likely, however, to give rise to some difficulties among the travelling community and since the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has the primary responsibility also for policy in relation to the travelling community, on which he has my full support, I would be interested to hear his views on this matter.  I hope he will not tell me that the provisions of section 33 of this Bill solve that problem.  I will deal with those in a moment.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 32 requiring three months notice of intention to marry &mdash; and I say this with all the emotion of which one is capable on a Bill such as this &mdash; is an outrageously bureaucratic and intrusive provision.  That provision is &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; gone mad.  When introducing the Bill the Minister gave no justification for that proposal and I would like to know why it was thought necessary or desirable to depart from current law or practice in this area and write it into legislation.  What useful purpose, if any, could possibly be served by this provision? What defect in the present law, if any, is it proposed to address by means of this measure?  I see no reason whatever for making this provision.  It is nothing more than a piece of nonsence perpetrated by interfering, busy body socialists and it has no place in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> The nonsense is compounded, of course, when one examines section 33 of the Bill which provides for exemption from this provision and from the provision providing for a new age of marriage. If an application is made under section 33, the unfortunate Solomon on the bench must decide whether the applicants can show that they have serious reasons for the application or that the application is, and I quote from the Bill &ldquo;in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage&rdquo;.  What serious reasons can people bring before the courts to dispense with the three months requirement from the notice of marriage or to allow one or other or both of them to marry under the age of 18?  What would be required to convince the court that it would be in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage to allow them depart from these procedures?  Are the courts now to be given the job of ruling on the depth of emotion and commitment between a man and a woman? It is impossible and nonsensical to ask the courts to do that.  This Bill deals with very serious issues and this bit of comedy should be taken out of it because it has no place in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may start where Deputy Dukes left off, I have drawn attention in public to the inadequacies of section 32 and section 33.  This provision did not come from the meanderings of a socialist busy body.  It came, unfortunately, from people who should know better; a representative committee of this House and I think the Law Reform Commission were involved at one stage also. Nonetheless, the idea of people playing God with other people's lives is very dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion that a group of people in this House can lay down in the law a stupid stipulation that people must notify in advance the register of births, marriages and deaths of their intention to marry, and that if they fail to do so their marriage is void, is unnecessary bureaucracy and it will cause chaos.  What is more unfortunate is the provision that <Col N="1092" /> the notice must be published.  In some office in Dublin notice of every impending marriage will have to be displayed and the parties will have the consequent intrusion on their privacy and their liberty. There are people for whom the fact that they intend to get married is something that they have good reason to want to keep quiet.  It might not be the serious kind of reason a judge might think applies but it might be a good reason.  For example, a person in public life may want to keep secret the fact that he or she is getting married.  Perhaps somebody in the public eye, or who has been convicted of a criminal offence in the past, wants to keep their affairs secret from the prying attentions of the media.  There is no reason for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform bringing before this House a measure which will cause misery for many and happiness for none.</P>
    <P>Marriages will not improve because people send in a form three months in advance to some shabby little office somewhere, and have their names displayed on a board.  The idea that impetuous marriages will be avoided by that, or that unhappy marriages will be swept aside is so daft as to call into question the Minister's judgment.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to come into this House and say that he proposes a measure of this kind.  As Deputy Dukes said, he did not give a good reason.  A stupid Bill is being foisted on us without justification.  I do not claim to know better than anybody else in this country whether people should marry with one, two or three months notice.  As a married person, I do not claim I have any superior knowledge of the ways of the world which would entitle me to say that a couple who have been going out with each other for ten years should not decide to get married next week.  If I cannot claim that, then the Minister cannot either.  Neither do I think that any Members on the Government benches have any superior knowledge, wisdom or insight into marriage that would enable them to foist that judgment on people who intend to get married.  Why should people be subjected to the humiliation of <Col N="1093" /> having their intention of marriage displayed in a registrar's office?  Why should they be besieged, as they certainly will be, by the enterprising people who will offer them bridal cars, wedding receptions, suites of furniture, mortgages, insurance policies and all the rest of it for months before they get married?  Why should a prominent showbusiness or television personality, have their intention to get married gone pruriently into by the media just to satisfy some bureaucratic notion that their marriage somehow will be happier if they reflect on it for three months?</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to give one good explanation for the necessity for the provisions of section 32.  I agree with Deputy Dukes that our Judiciary have enough to do without engaging in the silly business of listening to applications as to what constitutes a serious reason for wanting to get married in less than three months.  Why should a judge have to listen to people who have been going out with each other for ten years say that they want to get married in one month's time because, say, the mother-in-law will be back from Australia for the wedding? What kind of rubbish are we inserting into our laws?  Why should anybody have to go to a court to say that is what they want to do?  Equally why should those who do not go down that stupid path find themselves besieged by commercial enterprises rendering their period of statutory engagement, as this Bill sets out, a period of misery?</P>
    <P>If somebody in the public eye wants to get married quietly and privately, does that constitute a serious reason for asking a judge to agree that the requirement to apply should be waived?  There is absolutely no excuse for this measure.  Nobody has asked for it.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister another thing, when I raised the issue in public, the outcry against it was huge, most people despise this proposal.  I do not believe the Minister received a single letter in favour of the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive one letter saying not to do it either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee that if the Minister persists with it this will be wrapped around his neck throughout the whole divorce campaign, with people alleging this was the man who insisted on a statutory three month's engagement, who made life miserable for most intending married couples, who caused other people to go to court to explain their domestic arrangements; that is what he believes about the power of Big Brother.</P>
      <P>A second point raised by Deputy Dukes, which I consider to be of some significance, is the whole idea of the approach of the Judiciary to matters of this kind.  The judge of whom he spoke is a person for whom I have an immense respect because he lectured me in University College, Dublin.  His intellect, bravery and courage always impressed me, he is a person of tremendous calibre. However, I am disappointed that over the past few years he felt it appropriate to express in public fundamental moral and political messages which are not his business to express.  It is not the business of the Judiciary to attempt to become leaders of the moral community; they were not appointed to be that; they were appointed to be independent arbiters between people who have disputes.  They were not asked by society, in fact it is none of their vocation, as judges at any rate, to become moral leaders of society. By reason of holding judicial office, they do not obtain any new injection of moral authority.  The fact that under the Constitution they are given particular functions to adjudicate in disputes of various kinds does not grant or confer on them some new moral authority to pronounce on social matters.  Their views are no better than the day they were appointed to the Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their moral capacity to comment on social issues is not improved by donning a judicial wig or sitting on the Bench. The members of the Judiciary do not have any peculiar insight which allows them to comment on constitutional reform when it comes to basic matters of morality or policy.  Their views on taxation, sexual morality and theology are <Col N="1095" /> private and they were not put on the Bench to express them publicly.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the sad fact is that it is not their fault alone because some institutions and organisations seek their public support for propositions on the mistaken notion that, because somebody was appointed a judge five, ten or 15 years ago, people will have more respect for their views when they speak, to use the phrase used about NATO, &ldquo;out of theatre&rdquo;.  They do not have any peculiar beneficial insights into moral matters.  It is unfortunate that some members of the Judiciary, however bona fide their belief, feel they should use their office to propagate views when their office is designed, by definition under the Constitution, not to be used for the propagation of personal views of that kind.  I will not comment any further on that except to say that my fondness for the man in question does not outweigh my strong feeling that, if his behaviour in support of his propositions is acceptable to this State, if other people of equal and opposite views on the same kinds of issues began weighing in, we would have chaos.  Therefore, on basic moral principles, a judge who feels called upon, by some inner voice, to express moral sentiments in public, and organisations which give the Judiciary moral pulpits from which to speak, should hesitate because what they choose for themselves, they choose for others.  Indeed they cannot complain if all the Judiciary joined in every moral bun-fight of every kind expressing views.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Judiciary to remember that in suggesting, as was done, that people who engaged in sodomy were of such a personality that their immorality must infuse all other aspects of their life &mdash; that was the message contained in the last judicial encyclical &mdash; it suggests prejudice.  It suggests that if a well known homosexual came before a court he would be less credible and would probably be disbelieved more than somebody who did not exhibit those tendencies or was not known by the judge to have them.  We need an independent <Col N="1096" /> judiciary which keeps to the function which the Constitution gave it.  Those who feel impelled by inner moral voices to trespass out into other territory, reserved for politicians and clergymen, should make the choice which is appropriate; they should choose either to lay aside their judicial office and throw themselves fully into a moral crusade or accept the necessary constraints of independence, impartiality and continence of the mouth and mind that follows being appointed to a judicial position.</P>
    <P>A point I would like to raise in the context of this legislation is the fate of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I do not accept what Deputy Dukes said about it. I do not think it was a question of the Supreme Court deciding that property rights overrode equality rights.  As I understand that decision, the Supreme Court said that it was people's moral autonomy to decide their own affairs in relation to property matters, but in relation generally to the nature of their marriage &mdash; in the Constitution we find that property rights arise by virtue of man's rational being.  People's autonomy was not to be infringed.  It was not a question of property being more important than equality but that autonomy is more important than external control. That is a reasonable viewpoint for the Supreme Court to have arrived at, but that should not be the end of the issue in relation to the family home.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court saying that mandatory formula infringes matrimonial autonomy does not mean nothing can be done for people in Irish society for whom the Legislature can intervene and provide equality.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, expressed the view that this is something which the Legislature should revisit.  The Supreme Court decision in L. <i>v.</i> L. could be reversed without any of the constitutional infirmities found in the Minister's legislation. The Judiciary could be given a competence to determine that a woman who works within the home as a wife has implied rights of some form to share in the family home.  That can be done on a judicial basis in a satisfactory way, even <Col N="1097" /> though it cannot be done on a legislative mandatory basis in the way in which the Minister attempted.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposition which Deputy Dukes enunciated that it is ridiculous <i>ex poste</i> to attack the Minister for introducing the Bill because the Article 26 reference exists on the basis that this House will make decisions which conflict with the Supreme Court's view of the Constitution.  None of the participants in the debate in this House, myself included, zeroed in on the point on which the Supreme Court decided the matter, that is, the issue of matrimonial autonomy. While some people thought in terms of a property rights and equality rights conflict that was not the basis on which the Supreme Court eventually turned it down.  Since no Member thought of the point the Supreme Court made, it is not fair to attack either the Minister or the Attorney General for failing to see it.  It is not correct to pretend there is something wrong with the legislative process or the people who initiated the legislation just because the Supreme Court rejected it on grounds nobody in this House foresaw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember it ever being raised as an issue.  A considerable number of Deputies envisaged that there could be a constitutional conflict between property rights and the model of equality but nobody foresaw that there could be some infirmity with that legislative approach by virtue of the family provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell is right in saying there is room in this legislation to redress the evil sought to be dealt with by the Matrimonial Home Bill; that is that many people live an entire life as part of an economic community and, as a matter of law, have no right in the chief asset which is sustained by that economic community of marriage.  There is plenty of room, without in any way infringing the view of the Supreme Court in the Matrimonial Home Bill case, to reverse the <Col N="1098" /> effect of the Supreme Court decision in L.<i>v.</i> L. and to provide that a woman, but a spouse in general, can earn an equity in the family home simply by performing the role of partner within a marriage.  I do not see any reason that should not be done.  As long as it is done on a basis that enables the Judiciary on a case by case basis to evaluate the contribution I do not see any constitutional infirmity with such a proposition.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept amendments towards that end on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to deal with is the issue of nullity.  I have grave doubts where a relationship is determined never to have existed, about the idea of conferring succession or other rights on the non-parties to that non-relationship. That is confused thinking and philosophically there is something very wrong with it.  I accept that in marriage law there is a difference between void and voidable marriages and that some relationships can endure for a while and be recognised by the law until such time as they are voided.</P>

What Deputy Dukes said about divorce being the answer to that problem is entirely correct.</P>

      <P>This Bill should be read in conjunction with the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, <Col N="1099" /> 1989.  They enable the courts to make the necessary financial, property, pension and maintenance arrangements required in cases of marital breakdown where separation, nullity and foreign divorce orders have been made.  These measures rationalise the financial position of the dependent spouse and children in the event of marital breakdown.  A sum of £750,000 was provided this year for voluntary marriage counselling organisations and funding for the family mediation service nationwide was doubled. However, the major problem highlighted in the Law Reform Commission report on family courts published recently is that the present court structure is inadequate and unable to cope with the growing pressure of family law litigation. New or improved family law remedies require a new court structure with essential support services.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation in the report to establish a system of regional family courts functioning as a division of the Circuit Court and located in eight or ten regional centres.  These courts should be presided over by Circuit Court judges nominated for their special ability to deal with such matters.  They should operate within the context of a range of support and family services.  They should be persons who, by reason of training, experience and personality, are suitable to deal with matters of family law.  The proceedings should be held in camera.</P>
      <P>Where proceedings for a judicial separation have been instituted, a family court advice centre attached to the court should make information concerning the various support and mediation services available to the parties involved.  In all family proceedings before a regional family court the judge should recommend that the parties attempt to resolve outstanding issues through negotiation or mediation.  The courts should be given wide powers to review and, if necessary, vary, on the application of either party, the terms of agreements concerning maintenance and property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper on marital breakdown which will come under consideration <Col N="1100" /> shortly due to the legislation required in connection with the constitutional amendment, five possible approaches to a constitutional amendment on divorce have been proposed.  My strong preference is for the fourth option which provides that where a marriage is irretrievably broken down and the judicial separation or entitlement thereto has been in existence for over two years, the court may grant a dissolution of marriage provided it is satisfied with the provisions being made for the dependent spouse and children and there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the spouses.  The great merit of this option is that it would merely extend existing law on judicial separation which has been in operation for four years to permit dissolution and remarriage.</P>
    <P>In most of these cases the financial, property and other details which caused such controversy in the last divorce referendum would have already been decided in the separation proceedings. Those involved would have been operating under current legislation and the separation Act for two years so the proceedings to provide for the dissolution of marriage would be at minimal cost.  I recommend that option to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a constructive and mature debate on this issue and one designed to ensure that we will have a legislative environment which will strengthen society and human relations and enhance care for children and the family.  It should be looked at in that constructive light rather than in terms of the negative debate which some elements in society seem anxious to stir up.</P>

      <P>It will be between consenting adults I am sure.  I support the Bill particularly in the context of the divorce referendum.  My preference is for going ahead with the referendum this year.  There was some media speculation, based on the comments of some Members, that we were not ready for it and perhaps it could fail, as in 1986. Underlining this is the suggestion that there is some magical legislative formula which, if in place, would make it easy. This is not the case.  No matter what we do between now and October there are many people who do not believe in the right to remarry.  The Roman Catholic Church takes a particular view of marriage with which I do not agree.  They will not change between now and October irrespective of what legislative provisions we put in place.  I do not believe we will persuade any of the groups who successfully defeated the 1986 referendum that they made a mistake, nor do I believe that the Members who opposed the referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who addressed the House during the debate and I greatly appreciate the general welcome for the legislation.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Currie on his new portfolio as front bench spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory address I referred to the Government's commitment to a caring society and a system of laws and administrative measures which deal comprehensively with marriage breakdown. What is being proposed in the Bill is clear <Col N="1103" /> evidence of the Government's commitment in that regard.  A range of issues was raised by Deputies in the course of the debate but as there will not be enough time to deal with all the points raised I shall deal with as many as possible.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate it was stated that much of what was being proposed in the Bill was already in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, The judicial separation Act was very significant legislation and I acknowledge the work of Deputy Shatter in initiating the Bill which led to that Act.  The Special Committee which discussed that Bill was in many ways a prototype of the committee system we now have as a standard way of dealing with legislation before the House.  I had the privilege of being a member of that special committee on the judicial separation Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Family Law Bill is to consolidate those important ancillary provisions in Part II of the 1989 judicial separation Act concerning maintenance and property orders with the new ancillary measures relating to nullity and foreign decrees of divorce, nullity and separation provided for in the Bill. However, the Bill goes much further in that it introduced a range of new provisions. It provides for the automatic attachment of earnings in certain circumstances where periodic payments are ordered; new provision is being made for certain property orders to be varied; there are significant new provisions relating to financial compensation orders and pension adjustment orders; also in nullity cases there is provision for the court to order that a dependent spouse be provided for out of the estate of the other spouse where necessary.  The law on declarations of marital status is being amended; the age of marriage is being raised to 18 years and a new three months notice of intention to marry is being introduced. Maintenance provisions in existing law are being strengthened and jurisdiction of the District Court and Circuit Court is being extended.  These provisions are very significant and timely.</P>
    <P>Deputies Currie, Keogh and McManus <Col N="1104" /> welcomed the inclusion of the provisions on pensions.  The pensions provisions were subject to extensive and full discussion with the pensions industry and the Pensions Board and I take this opportunity to thank them for their very helpful and valuable contributions and assistance. In the course of drafting valuable fine tuning has been done on the provisions and this would not have been possible without assistance, much of it voluntary, from those who specialise in this important and complex area.  I was also delighted to read reports in the media that the Irish Pensions Trust in general welcomes the pensions provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus raised the question of the different approaches taken to pensions in cases of judicial separation and nullity.  The treatment of pensions in cases of nullity differs from their treatment in cases of judicial separation.  In cases of judicial separation the parties remain married.  Consequently, on the death of the spouse who is a member of a pension scheme, the surviving spouse, though separated, may still be entitled to the survivors' benefit.  In other cases the terms of the pensions scheme may preclude survivors' benefit being paid because the spouses may not be residing together at the time of the death of the member spouse.  In such circumstances, there is the difficulty that following a judicial separation the surviving spouse may not receive a survivor's benefit. Section 12 of the Bill is designed to deal specifically with this problem and it ensures that the court can, where necessary, override the rules of the pension scheme with a view to justice being done to a surviving spouse in need of financial support.</P>
    <P>However, following a nullity decree a former spouse would not generally, if at all, be entitled to benefit under the former spouse's pension scheme.  Section 11 of the Bill is designed to deal specifically with that and where necessary, power is being given to the courts to make an order to either &ldquo;split&rdquo; or &ldquo;earmark&rdquo; a portion of the pension.</P>
    <P>The court in deciding whether to make <Col N="1105" /> such orders must first have regard to the feasibility of making adequate and reasonable provision under the other financial and property provisions &mdash; that is section 7-10.  For example, it may be decided not to make a pension adjustment order but to compensate for any loss of pension benefit by adjusting other assets.</P>
    <P>In cases of nullity and judicial separation, while the member spouse is alive he or she can, where necessary, be ordered by the court to make payments out of his or her retirement pension to the other spouse and under the Bill, these payments may be subject to an attachment of earnings order.</P>
    <P>While the provisions in the Bill to raise the age for marriage from 16 to 18 and requiring persons intending to marry to give three months notice of their intention to marry were warmly received a number of Deputies raised certain concerns about the three months notice provision. The notice requirement reflects the belief that marriage is an institution of the greatest importance and one that should not be entered into lightly.  It also reflects the view that the taking on of marriage requires both maturity and reflection.  Deputies will of course be aware that many churches already impose waiting periods.</P>
    <P>The question of notice of marriage was addressed in the White Paper on Marriage Breakdown which concluded that the balance of arguments favoured a minimum waiting period before marriage and the provision in the Bill is in line with the three month waiting period recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the evidence available the notice provision in the Bill is not an unreasonable requirement or a restraint on the right to marry.  It is a provision framed with a view to safe-guarding and protecting the institution of marriage.  I appreciate the point made by Deputies Currie, McDowell, Dukes and others that the commercial interests such as florists, hotels, and so on might exploit the circumstances where notices of intention <Col N="1106" /> are open to public inspection and I will consider that view very carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie also referred to the provision in section 33 which allows for exemptions from the notice and age requirements.  The Deputy cited several examples where the exemption provision, as respects notice of intention to marry, might prove necessary.  I would agree that the examples he gave are likely ones where exemptions might be given and indeed there may be many others.  In any event, the decision to exempt parties from the age and notice requirements will be a matter for the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus queried the form that the proposed constitutional amendment on divorce will take.  The White Paper on Marriage Breakdown has helped to focus attention on various options for amendment of the Constitution and it sets out the details of possible divorce legislation including the substantial powers which the court would have to make orders in support of dependent spouses and children.  In the preparation of the White Paper views from interested groups and individuals were sought and the wide range of submissions which have been received are being taken into account in the context of finalising my proposals.  All aspects of divorce are being looked at not only in my Department but in other Departments which are also involved.  The clear intention of the Government is to deal with matters as comprehensively as possible in the lead-up to the referendum and to face all issues in a considered and responsible manner.</P>
    <P>The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment of the Constitution on divorce will be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill in the House.  It is the Government's intention to proceed with the necessary legislative framework as quickly as possible with a view to holding the referendum in the autumn.</P>
    <P>There is a number of matters to which I wished to respond but having regard to the time constraint I am afraid we will have to leave it until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> I look forward to a constructive and detailed debate on the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Solicitors like politicians have been described as good, bad and indifferent. Those who embezzle money or give bad service give the rest a bad name.  Solicitors are in a position of trust.  Once they were family friends who advised the family at times of crisis.  Because of the nature of their work they are told secrets, given valuable documents and are asked to decide on property issues.  It is serious when clients are stung by solicitors but it <Col N="1108" /> is not fair to label all solicitors as being bad.  Two or three days ago I contacted a solicitor about a person who was getting a raw deal and awaiting free legal aid and he agreed to advise him free of charge. Solicitors have to charge fees, but some go beyond the call of duty and are an example and a credit to their profession.</P>
    <P>At a different level fees at the Beef Tribunal were raised but it is the system which is at fault.  If I was offered £1,000 a day by the Taoiseach or a Minister to attend Dáil Éireann I would gladly do so. The system must ensure that people who stand by an arrangement do not have to take the blame when they are not at fault. I am glad that the Incorporated Law Society will have the power to deal with difficulties that may arise.  Solicitors carry the blame for matters outside of their control, for instance delays at the Land Registry.  While the process at the Land Registry has been speeded up delays are still being encountered.  The absence of Circuit Court judges also causes delay. When judges go on circuit one case can hold up a whole sitting.  For justice to be administered effectively it must be administered speedily.  I raised this point with the Minister before and asked her to appoint more judges.</P>
    <P>Solicitors have to deal with judges who at times get carried away with their own importance and display arrogance not in keeping with the setting in court.  Innocent God fearing people dread the thought of having to give evidence under oath and are very careful in what they say &mdash; criminals probably do not care. On one occasion a High Court judge insisted that a person give a yes or no answer when only a fool would have expected such an answer.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When the fool happens to be a High Court judge what can one do?  A barrister tried to run rings around a friend of mine giving evidence in court by suggesting that he had said something he had not said and when my friend replied that he <Col N="1109" /> had said no such thing the judge rapped the desk and warned him to be careful of his language when replying to counsel. The court system has to be modernised as judges can be very arrogant in dealing with people.</P>
      <P>Methuselah was a wise old man who probably lived beyond his time.  Judges should have to retire at the age of 65.  I do not know why they are considered to be wise old men.  A former Taoiseach thought he could compete with the Chinese but judges do this all the time. Age should be considered and judges should undergo psychological assessment every few years.  On a Bill earlier today reference was made to the views of judges on the question of divorce.  With all due respect to judges many are probably not in a position if they hold certain views to impartially judge the middle of the road legal position.  While they are entitled as private citizens to hold these views they should not be allowed make judgments weighted by these views.</P>
      <P>Section 69 deals with advertising.  Now-adays people are very much aware of the possibilities for suing for compensation. Solicitors advertise their services on a no foal, no fee basis and encourage people to pursue compensation cases.  Why would a person not pursue a case if he does not have to pay any fee?  The Bill provides that if advertising brings the profession into disrepute the Law Society may intervene. Such advertisements should be banned because we have to dispel the notion that the first thing a person should consider when an accident happens is who should they sue for compensation.</P>
      <P>It was never right that solicitors could take a percentage of the compensation paid.  I am glad that that practice will be prohibited.  This should apply to other professions also.  I fail to see why architects for example should be given a percentage of the total cost of a project for doing a drawing.  This is a crazy system which should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a welcome provision that the solicitor and client will have to agree a fee. It is important that a client should know what he or she will have to pay.  It is only <Col N="1110" /> fair to the solicitor who I am sure would also like to be paid promptly.</P>
    <P>On the question of probate, the Minister appears to have changed her mind about allowing the banks to provide this service.  Solicitors are qualified to do the job.  If a person owes money to the bank they are the wrong people to give advice on what a person should do with his property or money or in making his will. A bank to whom one owes money might coerce one into doing something to suit it.  It would be far better if a person sought advice from an independent solicitor.</P>
    <P>Many people with a law degree cannot quickly become apprenticed to a solicitor and may have to wait perhaps 12 months for an apprenticeship and when qualified they cannot get work.  In one recent case because of the number of applicants two people were taken on and the salary split. This is a form of slave labour.  Will the Minister look seriously at the question of allowing people to qualify as solicitors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides a welcome opportunity to debate issues of public concern.  Many of the provisions in it will not be pleasing to some solicitors. Indeed, they have been successful in getting the Minister to back down on sensible and overdue proposals.  That is a great pity and I hope the Minister will consider and stand her ground.  There may be a case for phasing in some of the provisions but the Minister should not cave in so easily to the pressures of the solicitors lobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Minister has caved in is evidence that legal reform is fraught with great difficulty and bound to run into opposition from powerful forces which are not always the best guide to their own long term interests.  A case in point were the scandalous fees charged by and readily conceded to barristers for acting for the State in the beef tribunal.  The Committee of Public Accounts was told that the fees conceded were dictated by market forces, yet Part III of the Bill proposed to permit investigations into complaints about excessive fees charged by solicitors.  The beef tribunal episode <Col N="1111" /> demands that similar provisions be urgently enacted in relation to barristers.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the beef tribunal are also deeply troubling and reflect badly on the Attorney General.  It was the Attorney General who, without any advice from his senior legal assistant &mdash; the equivalent of a Secretary of a Department &mdash; set the astonishingly high daily legal fees without any provision for scaling them down as the timescale of the tribunal increased.  It was the Attorney General who nominated the four barristers, two senior counsel and two junior counsel, to the State's legal team.  All of them, like himself, were affiliates of the Fianna Fáil party.  Moreover, economic and public relations consultants were appointed to advise the State legal team, unknown to the Ministers of the other party in Government at the time, and these consultants were also connected with Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> By arranging or permitting these acts of folly the Attorney General has allowed a situation to develop whereby the entire presentation of the State case at the tribunal can be categorised as a mere one-sided party-political presentation.  This behaviour by the Attorney General must cause enormous problems for the tribunal which was established for the purpose of adjudicating between serious political charges by major political personalities of different parties.  The question that arises is how could a totally Fianna Fáil team of barristers impartially represent &ldquo;the State&rdquo; when &ldquo;the State&rdquo; included Ministers of four different political parties in three different Governments. In the course of the tribunal did some Ministers and former Ministers query what they saw as hostile questioning from the very legal team which was supposed to be representing their interests?  Were applications for separate legal representations turned down by the Attorney General to whom the matter was referred?  The performance of the Attorney General in relation to the tribunal was such as to call into question his fitness for office.  There is an even greater and more fundamental point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading up to what I consider to be an important point. An even greater and more fundamental point arises from the experience of the beef tribunal.  If the legal officer of the two-party Government at the time could act in such a blatantly one-sided party-political way in relation to a tribunal which, above all else, should have been totally neutral politically, can his advice be trusted on such other important matters as judicial appointments and promotions? The public should be forgiven for thinking that judges depending on the Government for promotion may not be as independent as they should be in discharging their duties, especially when the behaviour and performance of current Ministers in office are the subject of their <Col N="1113" /> judgment?  A case in point is the upcoming vacancy in the post of Chief Justice. Can any of the potential contenders already on the Bench be independent or be seen to be independent of the Government? The President of the High Court is an illustrious judge and is only second in rank to the Chief Justice.  It would not be unnatural for him to expect promotion to a vacancy in that office.  For such promotion he is depending on the nomination of the present Ministers, some of whom have a vested interest in his findings as sole member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just a headline, it is a very important fact.  The time has come to change the method of appointing judges.  At present judges are appointed without the need to have regard to their track record and, once appointed, they cannot be held accountable even if they are grossly inefficient or ineffective in their court.  I am not referring to their individual decisions; there can be huge delays in the courts. Recently the Tánaiste proposed that the role of the President should be expanded. Article 35.1 of the Constitution provides that judges should be appointed by the President.  In reality the appointments are made by the Government and merely rubber-stamped by the President.  I do not see why that role cannot be reversed, even under the Constitution.  Article 35.1 is superseded by another provision which states that the President shall act on the advice of the Government except where it is specified that she has absolute discretion. She does not have that in realation to the appointment of judges.  The President should be given power to initiate the appointment of judges.  She should nominate appointees to the Government and if the Government does not accept that person she should nominate another.  It is important to remove the appointment of judges from the political arena so that there is total separation of the Judiciary and the Legislature.  Even within the constraints of the Constitution it should be possible to do so and if the Tánaiste is serious about expanding the role of the President he should take this on board.  A judicial commission should be established to vet the effectiveness and efficiency of the courts.  When I was Minister for Justice there was a long delay in hearing a particular case in court but nothing could be done about it.  The judge was old and doddery.  The case went on for years and judgment was reserved.  Such problems need to be addressed.  A judicial commission could oversee the efficiency and effectiveness of our prosecution service <Col N="1115" /> in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which also must be independent of the political process but should be accountable to somebody.  At present that office is not accountable to anybody.  I hope the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1994 is a first step in major judicial and legal reform because much more needs to be done urgently in this area.</P>

      <P>When the last Coalition Government introduced a similar Bill I expressed a fair and balanced view on the legal profession. I stated that it was easy to criticise a profession with whom we as legislators are often at loggerheads.  Solicitors are the foot soldiers of the legal system and easy targets for the heavy artillery of the Government and all of us in this House.  It is obvious that they do not have as many friends in this House as the Bar.</P>

      <P>The fees to barristers in respect of the beef tribunal are sufficient evidence of that.  Why should there be a difference in the treatment by both Government parties of their friends at the Bar and their apparent enemies in the solicitors profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will not benefit the legal profession.  It is negative and does not contain any positive steps to assist that widespread profession.  There are approximately 5,000 solicitors employing 10,000 people.  In Kerry, more than 250 <Col N="1116" /> people are employed in solicitors' offices. The 15,000 people who are gainfully employed by that profession make a meaningful contribution.  In our local constituencies we know these hard working and dedicated men and women whose work frequently brings them into conflict with others.  The losing party in such conflicts often blames the judge and then the solicitor.  The party cannot take its defeat and targets the solicitor for complaint at no cost to himself or herself, but at enormous cost and loss to the solicitor involved.  Clients are entitled to make complaints and take proceedings against solicitors who do not carry out their duties properly, but if a person loses a case the trend is to blame the solicitor for everything.  This Bill does nothing to redress that wrong.</P>
    <P>The cost of controls and the complicated procedures with which a solicitor's office must comply ultimately falls on the public.  The Government and the Law Society should explain the need for the many loosely worded controls.  I am not familiar with all of them but I will outline some.  An accountant's certificate must be paid for by the solicitor every year.  This involves an outside accountant checking the books for several days at considerable cost.  A Law Society accountant must carry out a spot check, again paid for by the solicitor through his or her substantial compulsory payment to the Law Society.  Control is also exercised by the Law Society's various committees, inspectors and accountants.</P>
    <P>A member of the public can make a complaint, no matter how trivial, unjust or irrelevant to the Law Society, who investigate it.  Under legislation a solicitor, if found guilty of misconduct, excessive charges or shoddy work, can be severely penalised.  This Bill does not contain any provision for redress for frivolous complaints made against solicitors. They may be put to endless trouble, frustration and expense but the complaining party does not pay anything. That is most unjust and should be redressed especially if there are no grounds for the complaints.</P>
    <P>Solicitors can be sued in all our courts, <Col N="1117" /> similar to the rest of us.  We are appointing an ombudsman for the Law Society and law observers, but who will pay for these services.  There will also be compulsory expensive indemnity insurance and the press will monitor court performance. Is all that bureaucracy necessary? Is there a need for everyone to be the big brother at a substantial cost to the public?  The sophisticated public can avoid the few disreputable solicitors. People are aware of the solicitors who do a good job and if a solicitor has a bad reputation people will avoid him or her. Such solicitors should be answerable for their shoddy work.</P>
    <P>Clients and the public in general are well protected by the compensation fund, again paid for by solicitors.  Honest solicitors carry the cost for dishonest ones. That is unacceptable and results in higher costs for honest solicitors.  I understand that those and other administrative costs to a practising solicitor in a busy office amount to approximately £30,000 per annum.  For that reason we should not be surprised at the high cost of legal fees, especially when one considers the 21 per cent VAT levied by the Government.  It is interesting that the Government should criticise the 10 per cent fee imposed by solicitors for handling a High Court case that can take up to five years to get to court due to the inadequate court system while the Government levies a 21 per cent VAT rate.  Are widows, orphans or poor clients exempted?  They are not. Everybody is charged at the 21 per cent rate.  Is a legal aid system available for private solicitors and injured clients to get a case to court?  There is not, but under this legislation a restraint is being put on solicitors' fees.  This is dangerous because it will protect the Government's friends in the insurance business.  If the independent solicitors' profession is starved of funds those multimillion companies cannot and will not be tackled. The public not only understood but welcomed the 10 per cent levy if a case is run on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  Because of the delays and expense of court proceedings, most cases cannot be taken by <Col N="1118" /> people against major insurers.  This Bill should contain more positive aspects.</P>
    <P>Why can solicitors with ten years' practical experience not be appointed to the District Court, High Court or Supreme Court?  Those solicitors have daily contact with clients and if appointed to the courts would make them more user friendly at a time when we need more Circuit Court and High Court judges.  If they are not provided people may take the law into their own hands.  Why are honest solicitors compelled to contribute to a compensation fund to provide compensation for those who suffer as a result of the dishonest dealings of some solicitors?  No other profession is compelled to contribute to such a fund.  Why is there not a private practitioners legal aid scheme here as in England?  The so-called legal aid scheme here is public and is an expensive disaster.  The provision of better court facilities to deal with family matters is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  In analysing such an important Bill we should reflect on what is perceived to be its consumer ethos.  The difference between perception and reality is often stark.  Undoubtedly the legal profession is perceived by the general public as being an avenue to fame and amassing a fortune. Members of this House should be extremely cautious of using that premise as a reason for legislative initiatives.  If we accept that perception as reality without careful analysis, logically we should next turn on ourselves to satisfy public perceptions because, as with the legal profession, politicians are perceived also to bask in the lap of privilege, fame and fortune.  In reality we know that is not the case and it behoves us to familiarise ourselves with the reality of the legal profession before taking legislative initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law has an enormous influence on our lives and it is logical that the legal profession, especially those in its vanguard should become almost household names.  This is all the more reason those <Col N="1119" /> people should act with prudence and propriety and should never act in a fashion that would bring the law or the legal profession into disrepute.  Unfortunately, that has not always been the case.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the beef tribunal.  The most public manifestation of the descent into disrepute of the legal profession emerged during the beef tribunal. The public were entertained daily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference to it is relevant to the Bill if the Chair will allow me develop my point.  During the beef tribunal the public were entertained by high drama, the cost of which has been the subject of enormous public criticism in recent weeks.  By any standard the fees charged by the legal profession at the beef tribunal, albeit agreed by the State and endorsed by the political system, constitute a scandal of enormous proportions and have served to undermine the law, the legal profession and other institutions of the State.  The concept of an honest day's work for an honest day's pay was stretched beyond all credibility. The perception of the legal profession with their snouts in the trough of the State, with the blessing of the political establishment, was firmly based in reality.</P>
      <P>It is ironic and regrettable that the legal profession may end up hoist on its own petard in this regard.  Many people want to enter the legal profession and that is not only confined to leaving certificate students.  The numbers swarming around the entrance doors to the legal profession, having arrived by a variety of routes, is enormous.  Many of them are driven by a perception, which has little basis in reality, that a fortune is to be won if they could only turn the key to that door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is very different.  Recently I spoke to a solicitor in a small rural <Col N="1120" /> practice who receives a number of applications weekly for apprenticeships.  Law students apply to hundreds of law firms around the country to secure an apprenticeship. Invariably in that environment, it is inevitable that market forces will take over and the reality for many apprentice solicitors is very low wages.  Many law students and law graduates fail to get any apprenticeship.  Another reality must be recognised also.  In the absence of a meaningful extension nationwide of the civil legal aid scheme there does not appear to be a market demand for additional solicitors nor for the numbers currently embarked on a course which they hope will lead them into the legal profession.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister made an intervention into this vicious circle which deserves the closest scrutiny.  In sections 40 to 53 the Minister proposes wide-ranging changes to procedures governing admission to practise as a solicitor.  The most serious consideration must be given to those proposals and their impact on the profession.  As a rule of thumb it is questionable to advocate a shorter education period at a time when the needs of society are for greater specialisation. It has been claimed that this legislation was needed to protect the consumer but that proposal does not pass the consumer test.  It is not in the interest of the consumer to lower educational standards so as to satisfy more people wishing to qualify as solicitors.  That is a short-sighted approach which will not improve the lot of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not give consideration to the obvious alternative route to resolve that problem which has much to recommend it and indeed which can be more easily adapted to changing circumstances, namely, the intake into law faculties of our universities?  In this instance, it would appear the legal academics had the ear of the Minister and carried more political clout than the legal practitioners.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in the Bill, wrapped in the consumer ethos, will, in view of the impending influx to the profession, amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy of <Col N="1121" /> doom.  Those measures include proposals to grant powers to the Law Society to deal with complaints of shoddy work; proposals to appoint an independent adjudicator to consider complaints about the society's handling of complaints against solicitors and the establishment of a disciplinary tribunal to investigate allegations of professional misconduct. In the new environment in which solicitors will have to operate if the Bill is passed unamended, those measures will be widely availed of.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that we have too few solicitors.  With a fixed amount of business to be carried on, an underdeveloped civil legal aid scheme and the anticipated influx of a large number of solicitors, an unhealthy competitive streak will emerge and with it an inevitable lapse of standards.  I urge the Minister to further consider these proposals with a view to regulating entry to the profession through the low faculties of our universities.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about section 59 which proposes to prohibit the Law Society from preventing solicitors from advertising their fees.  That proposal is wrapped in the consumer ethos and designed to make it difficult to challenge. It is also important to differentiate between public perception and reality in that regard.  The public perception is of uniform high earnings across the board whereas in reality many members of the legal profession charge no fee or a small fee for clients in needy circumstances. That should be acknowledged and the best approach to that issue should be based in reality and not ill-considered views based on solicitor-bashing stereotypes. We must concern ourselves with substance and not image or form.  We must not fetter the legal profession so as to satisfy some perceived consumer need which on examination may be unworkable or undesirable.  That has particular relevance in the areas of advertising.</P>
    <P>On the publication of a number of reports on the legal profession there was a debate in this House on the need for advertising legal services in the interests of the consumer.  Yet when the Law <Col N="1122" /> Society introduced regulations permitting limited advertising there was criticism of the nature of such advertising and it was suggested that it encourages litigation and a claims conscious society. What message are we giving to the legal profession?  What do we want of that profession?  If the fee advertising provision in this Bill, which solicitors have made clear they do not want, is implemented, will we criticise solicitors for offering bargain rates?</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to extend advertising to fee advertising, apparently in the interests of consumers, but how will consumers be assisted by this measure? Legal services cannot be compared to purchasing soap powder or to the provision of a service of a short duration. In the legal service there are too many variations so as to make comparison real.</P>
    <P>Even the legally uneducated can consider innumerable variations in legal transactions.  The Minister should give serious consideration to deleting this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great temptation to be as disorderly as previous speakers in this debate and to dilate on matters in which I have a close interest, but I will stick to the issues that arise in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Creed that it is tempting to adopt the view taken by the Fair Trade Commission and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions that it is uniformly beneficial to encourage price competition in the practice of law.  It is tempting to articulate the view that the consumer is best served by rigorous price competition which should be the sole purpose of Government intervention in the market for legal services.  Without apology, I take the view that, unlike window cleaning, litigation is not universally beneficial.  To increase the number of litigation cases does not benefit society. Litigation involves a person winning and a person losing.  For the party who loses, litigation is involuntary and can spell disaster. It is a mistake to adopt the view that the more litigation that takes place and the cheaper it is the better.  Obviously the cheaper litigation is in general terms, <Col N="1123" /> the better, but the views that the more litigation that takes place the better is one with which I cannot identify.</P>
      <P>I spoke here previously about the effect of the present regime in terms of solicitors advertising.  As a practical experiment I rang the Golden Pages to ask the cost for a solicitor to place a full page advertisement in that directory.  I was told it is in the region of £10,000 and if a spot colour is used on the page it would be up to £11,000.  In the Golden Pages, at least for the Dublin area, there are many full page advertisements by solicitors seeking clients, largely on the basis of a creative image.  What is the purpose of such advertising?  Is it to the benefit of society or does it create a claim conscious society?  I believe the latter is the case.</P>
      <P>Under the present advertising rubric most people know they can go to a solicitor and bring a claim in court.  Advertisements do not improve the quality of service to clients.  In large measure they are aimed at the gullible.  They do not bring work to those who are most qualified to do it, but are used to bring about litigation where cases would not otherwise be taken.  That may be done by way of an advertisement of a clever, intelligent looking solicitor posing in an arm-chair in front of a case of books, with an impressive standard lamp on his desk and with a statement underneath the picture that the person specialises in such matters as &ldquo;slip and fall&rdquo; cases.  It always amuses me that solicitors claim to specialise in &ldquo;slip and fall&rdquo; cases.  If solicitors specialise in such cases as opposed to &ldquo;dive and sue&rdquo; cases, the question must arise as to whether society benefits from such advertising. The number of litigation cases taken is not necessarily an indicator of the well-being of society.</P>

    <P>The absence of comprehensive civil legal aid is often decried here by people who take a pro-solicitor view.  As a person who engaged in litigation for a living outside this House, I do not believe the establishment of a comprehensive civil legal aid scheme of the kind that exists in Britain would be for the benefit of our society.  Hundreds of millions of <Col N="1124" /> pounds are spent in that country on litigation. Our system is probably better.  I accept that law centres deal with unremunerative areas, but in most cases the divergence between Irish and English legal practice in the last century which permitted contingency fees to be charged here by solicitors and counsel on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis was a practical form of legal aid which is slightly more beneficial in terms of use of public resources than a system which operates on a bureaucratic basis whereby if a person does not have a certain income, society must award them legal aid.</P>
    <P>In an interesting memorandum to the Pringle report on civil legal aid a civil servant who was a member of the advisory committee dissented in very trenchant terms from the proposal to establish a comprehensive system of legal aid.  He did so on a very unfashionable basis in that he said that every penny spent on legal aid could also be spent on old age pensions, poverty amelioration and so on.  On balance he took the view that such application of the funds is likely to do more social good than funding legal advice and litigation.  In our society the case does not exist for a system of comprehensive legal aid.  The limited legal aid that exists at present through the legal aid centres, if it were made available without delay, would probably be a correct focusing of limited resources on social issues.  It would be foolish to bring consumer law and personal injuries litigation within the remit of State-sponsored legal aid because it would divert resources which ought to be applied to much more meritorious ends.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the present regime of advertising because it does nothing to cut costs.  The question arises whether one should extend the liberty to advertise to cover fees in the hope that it will reduce them or whether one should simply say it is not worth the candle and leave things more or less as they are or even try to limit the capacity of people to seek work and litigation by using ambulance chasing type advertisements?</P>
    <P>There are good grounds to be worried about price advertising by solicitors.  It is <Col N="1125" /> not in the interests of the ordinary punter that a solicitor of very limited competence should be able to prey on gullible people and those who are not aware of his limited competence by promising to do work at a fee which seems attractive at first glance.  I do not think in most cases that such a solicitor will promise to do a good job or that its net effect will be to bring work to people who are competent to do it.  Rather it will give rise to more of the present &ldquo;slip and fall&rdquo; style of advertising which has the effect of diverting work to those with a neck rather than to those with competence.  I make that point subject to my acceptance of the proposition that people are entitled to know what going to law will cost them.</P>
    <P>Litigation is much too expensive. There are a number of reasons for this, many of which have to do with court procedures and the inefficiencies in our system.  We could make our system of litigation much cheaper.  The present system of determining barristers' fees is most unsatisfactory.  This statement may lead to me being hanged in the Law Library, but the system of recovery of costs at any rate is conducted on the basis of fiction, that is, the solicitor negotiates a reasonable contract on behalf of his client with a barrister and negotiates a reasonable professional fee with his client before the case starts.  The client has at all times been aware that the case will proceed on that basis and since the fees are reasonable the other side can pay the cost if they win the case.  The entire notion of the taxtion of costs, when married to the &ldquo;no foal, no fee system&rdquo;, gives rise to inconsistency.  Is it reasonable for me to say that I will represent Deputy O'Donnell in the Four Courts in a libel case, to agree in advance a fee she will pay if I win the case and then go to the other side and say I had won the case and I wanted them to pay the fee Deputy O'Donnell and I independently agreed if I won without regard to the fact that Deputy O'Donnell might have no intention of paying me the fee if I lost her case?  There is a problem on that front at present.  Marrying the notion of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; representation with what is effectively <Col N="1126" /> a system of assessing costs based on a completely different principle, that is, people dealing with each other on an arm's length basis and deciding the fee irrespecive of the outcome of the case, needs to be visited in a way which is fair to litigants.</P>
    <P>It used to be the case, and still is the case in theory at any rate, that every barrister who appeared in a case stipulated in advance to the solicitor the fee he would charge, the idea being that every brief sent to a barrister would be marked with a fee and the barrister was entitled to say he would take the case on the basis of the fee offered or not.  Unless one is appearing at a beef tribunal that does not happen.  In the vast majority of cases no prior agreement is reached with the barrister or solicitor for his professional fee.  All these matters are in abeyance until the outcome of the case is determined.  It is futile to pretend that the fees are not determined in the light of the outcome of a case and by reference to the amount of damages recovered.</P>
    <P>In that context, if there ever had been a desire to moderate barristers' fees and if insurance companies had really been serious about this matter they would have fixed, at least on their own side, the fees they were offering the barrister to take the case.  This would have been determined in advance of a case, it would be up to a barrister to say he would take the case for a £500 brief fee and that if the case went on for a second day it would cost so much more: the costs would have been decided before the case began. However, for some reason it has become more convenient for solicitors and insurance companies to abandon the notion of pre-marking fees and to adopt a results-based negotiating system which gives rise to disquiet.</P>
    <P>As far as the relationship between solicitors and barristers is concerned, the Fair Trade Commission in its report examined the possibility of fusion of the two professions.  However, it was able to come up with what would have been the only justification for fusing the two professions, a cast iron guarantee that if there was an American style fused profession <Col N="1127" /> in Ireland fees would be reduced. A fusion of the two professions would, generally speaking, increase the monopoly of lawyers in dealings with their clients and turn market forces, reputation and the like into an even greater monopoly which could be used against the smaller person involved in litigation. The one great virtue often mentioned but sometimes cast aside as self-serving rhetoric, the one great benefit of having a split profession, is that in most cases Joe Soap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who has a case against a large multi-national gets more or less equality for forensic fire power when it comes to a court case.  If anyone wants to see the opposite situation they should look at the Paul Newman film &ldquo;The Verdict&rdquo; in which the Joe Soap was faced with a massive legal machine on the other side which tends in American law to give a tremendous advantage to those who have the resources to coach witnesses, to put vast amounts of money into research and to get the very best advocates at very large fees to confront the little man or little woman engaged in litigation.</P>
      <P>Litigation is a disaster for most people involved in it and is a most unpleasant experience even for those who apparently do well out of it.  Most people never become involved in litigation more than once or twice &mdash; they find the entire experience unpleasant and unnerving. People involved in litigation are vulnerable and have to rely on the quality of the advice they get on a once off basis. Litigation is almost like going to an undertaker &mdash; it will happen to you once if you are lucky.  The notion that a person will say he is wise after the event and will never go back to that solicitor does not apply to the vast majority of people who engage in litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debating a Bill which seeks to apply market principles to a situation of this kind one has to be conscious of the fact that people are extremely vulnerable to <Col N="1128" /> market forces and, as Deputy Allen would undoubtedly say, to monopolistic forces.  I agree with the proposition that monopolistic forces must be broken down as far as possible but that market forces are not always the answer.  From my experience &mdash; my views are entirely subjective but I offer them for what they are worth &mdash; increasing advertising is not the way to deal with the abuse of people on a financial basis by the legal profession. On the contrary, making the financial dealings of the legal profession with their clients transparent requiring, as this legislation proposes, a statement to be made available to every client about where every last halfpenny went to stop people being abused and to allow them in those circumstances a redress on the basis of overcharging is the right way to proceed.  Putting trust in competitive cost advertising is more likely, on the American experience where bicycles are given away with conveyances and holidays are given away if one does well, to bring misery to people in the long run than decent professional standards with transparency enforced from the outside and a healthy contempt on the part of the public for the monopolistic practices of the legal profession.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 14, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward, in the course of this year, equality legislation covering employment and non-employment areas and dealing with discrimination on a wide range of grounds including age and disability. This legislation is complex and both Government Departments and outside interests have to be consulted fully.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the commission on the Status of People with Disabilities require the commission, <i>inter alia</i>, to advise the Government on practical measures necessary to ensure that people with disabilities can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life.  In the course of its deliberations, the commission will take account of the situation of carers.  On receipt of the commission's recommendations, I shall re-examine the position to see what further action, in addition to anti-discrimination legislation, may be necessary to strengthen and promote the rights of people with disabilities and their carers.</P>
      <P>I have not undertaken any survey of clubs.  My Department does not administer any grants for social or sporting clubs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has replied to a question I did not ask and about <Col N="1130" /> which we have heard before in the House.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the carers were the central point of my question.  Is he aware that many of these people deserve the epitaph of living saints?  The caring that many of them engage in is effectively a vocation and we should do what we can for them.</P>
      <P>Society will never be able to repay the debt it owes to these people.  Would the Minister agree also that many carers are treated unfairly by the State despite the fact they are doing a job which, in many societies, would be the responsibility of the State?  Is he aware, for example, that approximately 50,000 people applied for the carer's allowance when it was first introduced and that about 4,500 were granted the allowance?</P>
      <P>In at least one health board region some of those who are in the caring category, namely, the home helps, are paid less than £2 per week despite the fact that if the people they are looking after had to go into an institution it would cost approximately £200 per week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <P>As this is the first occasion Deputy Currie participated at Question Time in his new position as his party's spokesperson on equality and law reform, I welcome him and look forward to debating many issues with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy and wish to pay tribute to the magnificent work carried out by so many thousands of carers. They make a great contribution to the social life here and fulfil a critical and essential role.  Some aspects of the working position of both carers and home <Col N="1131" /> helps are matters for the Ministers for Social Welfare and Health.  If Deputy Currie tables questions to them on the treatment of carers and home helps they would be happy to reply.  The equality aspects of their work will be dealt with in the legislation on equality being prepared and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be examining all aspects of the position of carers, including the social cultural and economic aspects of their work with disabled people.  The recommendations of the commission will be given sympathetic consideration in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his remarks of welcome.  I look forward also to a long association but with the roles reversed; the Minister on this side of the House and we on the Government side.  That would be a fair exchange after a comparatively short period.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's remarks about tabling questions to the Ministers for Health and Social Welfare, there is an inequality aspect to this that is worthy of his consideration, particularly in the case, for example, of the respite care scheme which allows carers take a few days off from their arduous work.  It is very unequal that due to a lack of funds or isolation local voluntary groups cannot help carers.  Something should be done about this equality issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the implications for equality policy arising from recent studies (details supplied) on poverty and childcare facilities for working parents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications for equality policy arising from the studies cited by Deputy Currie are quite broad and will warrant in-depth reflection, consultation and action.</P>
      <P>The ESRI study on <i>Poverty and Policy in Ireland</i> edited by Nolan and Callan addressed an issue which is primarily one for my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, however, it does raise gender inequalities as factors in poverty. With regard to labour market participation by women it links the impact of children with much of the gap between men's and women's earnings.</P>
      <P>The implications of the wage gap differential is one with which I am particularly concerned.  A study on male-female wage differentials by the ESRI which was commissioned jointly by the Employment Equality Agency and the Department of Labour and published earlier this month suggests that among other productivity-related characteristics a sustained rise in the duration of women's participation in employment over the working life cycle would be the single most effective factor in reducing the gap between male and female wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This finding is wholly consistent with the main thrust of the second study referred to in the question, namely the report of the Working Group on Childcare Facilities for Working Parents.  This report was published last week and took as its starting point the need to improve childcare supports for working parents. It readily recognises the imbalance in society in the sharing of parental responsibilities between men and women.  It profiles very clearly the benefits of greater efforts by employers and public authorities to reconcile family and <Col N="1133" /> work commitments of working parents especially mothers.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on equality already acknowledges the importance of progressing these issues.  Both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> include commitments to address them.  Already Government has agreed to initiate a number of pilot projects in disadvantaged areas involving partnerships with employer, community and other groups.  My Department has been allocated £1 million for this purpose this year.</P>
    <P>The reports to which the Deputy refers have only just been published and merit in-depth consideration.  As I have said, matters relating to poverty are not the remit of my Department.  I will, of course, actively pursue my programme to combat discrimination and achieve greater equality of opportunity in the workplace by legislative and other means.  In doing so I will work closely with the social partners and community interests generally, all of whom have key contributions to make in this area.  The Employment Equality Agency will also play an important role in progressing equality policy in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I too recommend this ESRI study on <i>Poverty and Policy in Ireland</i> which is a very useful publication. What has the Minister to say about the implications for equality of the finding of this report that Government policy over the past five years at least in targeting resources at disadvantaged areas has been wrong and has helped only a minority of poor and unemployed people, particularly a minority of women?  What has he to say about the finding that overall Government policy has been wrong, particularly in view of the fact that this &ldquo;mistaken&rdquo; policy is being carried on into the National Development Plan and that yesterday the Taoiseach told us of the 33 areas on which this assistance will be focused?  Why carry on with the plan in view of the findings of this study that it is targeted in the wrong directions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quoting a broad, sweeping comment.  This Government has been in office for a little over one year, not for five years.  The thrust of the Government's policy on equality and childcare issues is clear and will be enunciated again in the course of further questions on the Order Paper today.  The Government intends to tackle these issues in a very positive way.  These reports have been received and all will be examined in the fullness of their implications. The policy of targeting disadvantaged areas is a sound one and, to that end, my Department has secured £1 million to initiate a number of pilot projects in disadvantaged areas to provide childcare arrangements which will enable single parents, in particular, to avail of employment and education opportunities.  That is very worthwhile and will produce results and it is just one of a number of measures that will be taken.  The childcare report has just come to hand as well and contains a number of worthwhile suggestions.  All of these reports will be considered fully over the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that this Government has been in office for 15 months.  This study contains a specific criticism of Government policy over the past five years and the inclusion of this policy in the National Development Plan by this Government is a very recent development.  What has the Minister to say about the specific criticism that the targeting is absolutely wrong, that Government policy ought to concentrate on poor households, on the use of child benefit and reform of the tax and welfare systems rather than the concentration which has obtained to date and, specifically in relation to women, that the policy has been targeted in the wrong direction?</P>

It would be quite inappropriate to do so and that kind of information never would be given without the consent of the groups concerned. I do not know what vibes the Deputy is talking about.  All kinds of vibes are circulating on the divorce issue, some favourable, some not so favourable.  That is what the divorce campaign will be about.  It will be up to those groups and Deputies who support the issue to make their position clear, regardless of which side of the House they are on.  I have no doubt they will do so.  As far as the Government is concerned the Programme for Government clearly lays down support for a referendum on divorce and advocates that position as I do. The Deputy, her party and, indeed, all <Col N="1137" /> parties and Deputies will have an opportunity when the campaign gets under way to state clearly their position rather than fobbing off the issue as some are doing.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he will introduce effective equal pay legislation in view of the fact that the United States State Department's annual report on human rights worldwide found that the average hourly wage for Irish women workers was 60 per cent of that of men.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent statistics available which relate to March 1993 indicate that the hourly earnings of women in manufacturing industry are 70.3 per cent of the corresponding male rate &mdash; female weekly earnings are around 60 per cent of the male rate.  However, industrial workers as a group include less than one third of all employees and the statistics so based may not necessarily be representative of the labour market generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has recently completed research <Col N="1140" /> on male-female wage differentials, sponsored by my Department and the EEA, which shows that when all male and female employment sectors are included in the analysis, women's hourly earnings are approximately 80 per cent of men's &mdash; a higher ratio than the quoted one. The study provides a more comprehensive analysis of this wage gap, by taking account of several essential factors, including educational qualifications and length of labour market experience.</P>
    <P>It concludes that length of labour market experience plays the most important role in the maintenance of the gap in that half of the differential, i.e. 10 per cent was attributable to differing lengths of work experience, arising from women dropping out of the workplace at quite a young age &mdash; on marriage or following childbirth &mdash; and returning to the workforce in middle age, with a consequential relative lack of workplace experience, relative to their male comparators.  The source of the remaining half of the wage gap is uncertain, and a matter for some conjecture, although it may be due to a combination of factors, such as sex discrimination or residual attitudes of this nature.  A further possibility includes the greater likelihood of male employees being more available to perform overtime than their female comparators.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government and re-affirmed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, I intend to introduce legislation to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977. The proposed legislation will seek to improve the effectiveness of the anti-discrimination pay legislation and a range of proposals related to such improvements are being considered for possible inclusion in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The solution to any differential in pay between men and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone. Considerations such as composition of the labour market, the differing educational and training choices of men and women and the unequal distribution of family and <Col N="1141" /> domestic responsibilities between women and men are all relevant to an understanding of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is more than equal pay legislation involved in this issue.  What legislation is proposed in that regard?  As the Minister identified overtime as being a factor will it form part of the legislation?  Is the Minister aware that failure to act quickly in this area may bring us nearer the scenario which exists in other member states, such as Portugal, where, in the textiles industry, companies are letting men go because they are demanding higher wages?  Women and children are also being exploited in the workforce.  I want the legislation brought in quickly so we will not be forced into that position which seems to be part and parcel of the <i>laissez faire</i> free market in the Community. What is the timescale for this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the legislation as urgent and it is in the course of preparation in the Department.  It is complex and will cover more than gender based issues.  It will cover other disadvantaged groups in society such as members of the travelling community, people with disabilities and so on.  A number of its provisions will relate to the kind of criteria mentioned by the Deputy.  I am not in a position to give details of what will be in the legislation but he and I are at one on the objective.  Every possible step will be taken to publish the legislation at the earliest possible date but I am not in a position to give a timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is customary to give a vague indication of the timescale.  Otherwise it sounds as if it might or might not happen.  Will it be in this session, this year or during the lifetime of the Government?  The problem is worsening as companies are forced to look at their costs.  If they can get away with this discrimination, as happened in other member states, they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am cautious about giving commitments on matters over which I <Col N="1142" /> have no personal control.  With this kind of legislation one is dependent on a number of outside factors.  There must be extensive consultation with a wide ranging number of outside organisations representing the various interest groups receiving protection under this legislation, which is time consuming.  Framing the legislation is complex.  However, I assure the Deputy it is well progressed in the Department and should be published this year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the annual report of the Cork Catholic Marriage Advisory Council which states that men are violent towards their partners because of the gain in power and control experienced; and that there is little social sanction or consequence involved.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council throughout the country for its excellent work in counselling and assisting the increasing number of couples who are experiencing marital difficulties of one sort or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have not had the opportunity of studying in detail the report to which Deputy Harney's question refers, the conclusions reached in the report appear to be similar to those reached on the question of violence against women at the Third European Ministerial Conference on Equality which I attended in Rome in October 1993.  That conference pointed to a common thread in the cultural attitudes in all countries which is linked to violence against women.  Basically, it is the idea that women are <Col N="1143" /> inferior to men and, therefore, subordinate to them; that the woman is in some sense the &ldquo;property&rdquo; of her husband or male partner.  The conference concluded that violence is an expression of a power relationship, though it may also be the result of a specific psychological disorder.  While the view was also expressed at the conference that such factors as education and media portrayal of male and female stereotypes have a role to play in addressing this problem, it was acknowledged that the main focus has to be on having a proper legal framework, civil and criminal, to deal with the offender.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislative provisions have been put in place in this country over the past number of years by way of legislation on barring and protection orders, child care, rape and indecent assault and the giving of evidence by spouses.  While the civil law aspects, that is to say the law on barring and protection orders are the responsibility of my Department, criminal law aspects are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and the law on child care is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  There is considerable co-operation between the relevant Departments in these areas and the law is under continuous review to ensure that it provides an adequate response.</P>
    <P>The recent establishment of the woman and child unit by the Garda Síochána is evidence of their commitment to the involvement of the gardaí in cases of domestic violence.  As recently indicated by the Minister for Justice the question of amending the criminal law to strengthen the powers of arrest of the Garda in such cases is being considered by her Department.</P>
    <P>The most widely availed of remedy in cases of domestic violence is a barring order.  The remedy is limited at present to situations of interspousal violence, including violence against children by either spouse &mdash; it does not apply to the increasingly common situation where couples, although not married to each other, are living together as husband and <Col N="1144" /> wife.  While women in this situation have at their disposal the remedy of an injunction, the procedure is more expensive as jurisdiction in these matters is confined to the higher courts.  The Government is committed to extending to these women the right to apply for a barring order.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to amending barring order legislation to further strengthen its provisions. Proposals in this area are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and the details will be announced in due course.  The legislation will take into account representations by interested groups and recommendations contained in reports of the Law Reform Commission, the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Kilkenny Incest Investigation.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill, 1994, which I initiated recently puts the role of the probation and welfare service and health boards in family law cases on a statutory footing.  This provision will be of particular importance in the context of cases involving domestic violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a fulsome reply. What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;?  When can we expect the legislation? The matter is urgent.  A report from the Northern Ireland Women's Aid stated that a similar policy implemented by the RUC did not make the impact for which they had hoped.  They point to a number of areas that must also be covered and these include ensuring the woman's safety between the time of the man's arrest and the trial; dealing with verbal and emotional abuse; alternatives to prosecution where the woman wants the abuse to end but not the relationship; group therapy or other measures which would reduce the likelihood of the man abusing other women and counselling for women at the early stages of abuse.  This is quite a big package.  We need the legislation quickly and the package that must come as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparation of the legislation is at an advanced stage but I doubt if it will be brought forward this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> I hope it will be introduced next session and receive a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's question referred to the role of the Garda and giving them new powers to remove the aggressor from the home.  That matter will be dealt with in the Bill.  It is not a matter on which the support agencies are in universal accord and it would have limited relevance.  I am determined to provide for women, spouses as well as those in non-marital relationships, the maximum possible protection in violent situations.  I am concerned that as the law stands they are confined to seeking an injunction, which in most cases is useless, because it involves a great deal of expense and delay.  I regard it as particularly important that the barring order procedure should be extended to their situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he hoped to extend the barring order procedure to cover women in non-marital relationships.  What is as important, if not more important, is the enforcement of the legislation.  It is all very well for the Minister to read from his lengthy reply and refer to initiatives to be taken at some time in the future but will he deal specifically with the enforcement of the law during a breach of the barring orders? Do the Garda Síochána have a code of practice to deal with domestic violence? Is the Minister satisfied that gardaí throughout the State operate a uniform system in dealing with domestic violence and that the gardaí in Dublin do not act differently from those in other parts of the country?  Is he prepared to allay fears in the community that gardaí may have different regulations depending on the attitude of the local superintendent or inspector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If a court, normally the District Court, makes a barring order and the gardaí are notified of a breach of that barring order, the man is supposed to be immediately arrested by the Garda.  I have no information to suggest that the procedure which is laid down is not operating other than in a proper manner <Col N="1146" /> throughout the country.  If the Deputy has reason to believe that the Garda are not operating in accordance with the procedures laid down I suggest he communicates with the Minister for Justice who has responsibility for the operation of the Garda Síochána.  I have no information that this is not working well and from my days in practice, I know it certainly worked well in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his statement on extending barring orders to include relationships other than that of spouse?  I suspect that in cases of domestic violence spousal relationships are probably now in the minority or certainly close to 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting it too strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister will include cohabiting couples but does he intend to include domestic violence between siblings or between parents and their adult offspring?  I know of a case where a mother experienced considerable domestic violence from her grown up son.  It would be a great pity if cases were excluded because of a new definition of who is eligible to seek a barring order.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that different views are taken on removing the aggressor.  What are his views on this subject?  It would fundamentally challenge the culture where women are considered to be inferior, if the aggressor was removed from the house rather than the women and children having to leave the house in a time of crises when domestic violence occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he intend to put in place a strategy that will encompass the Department of Justice and other Departments to deal with the crime of domestic violence?  I recommend that the Minister examines <Col N="1147" /> the role of the gardaí in this instance because in many cases they may not be equipped to deal with a very difficult situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All aspects of the matter raised by the Deputy are being considered by my Department in consultation with the Minister for Justice who deals with criminal aspects, I deal with the civil and family law aspects.  The question of extending the barring order procedure beyond the couple is being considered but I cannot give any definitive response yet.  The issue of the involvement of the gardaí is being considered seriously and I am consulting the Minister for Justice to see how it could usefully be of assistance in cases of serious domestic violence in certain circumstances.  Normally the person who has been assaulted would apply for a barring order quickly but in certain situations that may not be possible for one reason or another, for example in cases of serious intimidation and in that case other remedies might have to be provided.  All these matters are being considered and will be included in the legislation to deal with domestic violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that his involvement relates to the civil aspects of the problem.  Do barring orders have implications for the ownership of the matrimonial home or dwelling?  If the object of the barring order is to remove the aggressor from the property following a violent incident could the aggressor contend that as it is his house the women has no right to be there?  How do ownership rights dovetail with the desirable right of the State to remove the aggressor from his home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell has highlighted one of the potential complexities in legislation and it is one of the aspects we are considering.  No question of ownership arises from seeking a barring order and where a husband is barred from the family home it does not <Col N="1148" /> affect his ownership as he is simply barred for a period of time.  The question of his title or ownership of the dwelling does not arise in connection with the legislation we are discussing here.  That is a different aspect of the law.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce legislation to establish a national body with statutory powers as proposed in the interim report of the task force on the travelling community which the task force recommended should have three functions, namely, the setting of targets annually for traveller accommodation in respect of all local authorities, monitoring the achievement of those targets and applying to local authorities to meet those targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>In framing the terms of reference of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, it was my intention to ensure that an in-depth and comprehensive examination would be undertaken of the needs of the travelling community and the extent to which these needs are being met by official policy, both at central and local level.  I understand that the task force has already commissioned research to facilitate this process in order to formulate detailed and precise recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> When I received the interim progress report of the task force on 14 January 1994 I undertook to consider it carefully to see what improvements and recommendations could be acted upon in the meantime, pending receipt of the final report.  Arising from this, I have been in consultation with my colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for housing, to identify the recommendations on which it would be possible to take action in the near future.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that provision for children with special needs is being considered in the context of the report of the Special Education Review Committee and, in the specific case of traveller children, the interim progress report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  A group of officials within that Department is considering the question of developing appropriate supports for these children.</P>
    <P>On 18 March last, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment announced that the special grant for travellers purchasing their first house for their own occupation had been increased from £1,500 to £3,000.  He expressed the hope that the increase would encourage more travellers to look at the option of home ownership.  He also stated that the increased grant was in accordance both with the Government's policy of securing accommodation for travellers and with the interim progress report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
    <P>I understand that the task force is currently reviewing its recommendation for a national body dealing with accommodation for the travelling community with the object of elaborating on the role and structure which the task force would envisage for the national body.  I shall await with interest their further recommendations on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is an urgent need to implement a national strategy?  While the Minister is consulting his ministerial colleagues the programme of local authority activities is <Col N="1150" /> proceeding.  For example, in the Dublin region the burden is being carried equally by the different wards.  Does the Minister agree, given that there is goodwill between the settled and travelling communities, that it is essential a national strategy is implemented and a guarantee given to the settled communty on the question of the maintenance of halting sites?  This matter should not be left to the local authorities; the Minister should adopt a pro-active role, as recommended in the report, to monitor compliance by local authorities.  The local authorities in Dublin are taking the lion's share of the responsibility; that is unfair.  There is a danger that we will tip the balance of goodwill away from the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there has to be a careful and controlled interplay between the Ministers with primary responsibility.  Environment, Health and Education, and the local authorities which provide the sites in meeting the immediate needs of the travelling community.  In its interim progress report the task force suggested that a national body should be established.  It is carrying out research and considering in-depth the role and structure such a national body should have as opposed to a national policy.  In further progress reports it will advise me if it is necessary or appropriate to introduce further legislation or redistribute responsibilities. Some progress has been made on the two matters raised in the interim progress report, namely, the question of traveller children &mdash; I have outlined the steps being taken by the Minister for Education &mdash; and that of accommodation. Improvements have been made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment in doubling the grant for travellers purchasing their first home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have the figure for the number of houses brought by travellers?  It has been reported that they rent local authority houses in my constituency when they go on the road in the summer.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that all <Col N="1151" /> local authorities face up to their responsibilities in the provision of halting sites for travelling families to ensure that the burden is not carried by local authorities such as in Galway and, according to Deputy O'Donnell, those in Dublin?  It is a very delicate task to get the various wards to share the responsibility but we managed to do this successfully in Galway.  There is a need for the Minister to introduce guidelines to ensure all local authorities play their part and travelling families are not attracted to areas such as Galway and Dublin where the local authorities are playing their part in the settlement of travellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the position in Dublin and Galway where the respective local authorities which have adopted a pro-active role in the matter, are carrying an unfair burden?  Due to the geographical location of the various wards in Dublin sites are located no more than a mile from each other in south Dublin and as a result there is a danger that we will tip the balance of good will in the settled community away from the project.  This cannot be allowed to continue given that other local authorities are not carrying their fair share of the burden.</P>

      <P>I have nothing further to add.  All these issues are being examined by the task force.

Its recommendations will be carefully considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the travelling community attached to the training centres in Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West in County Limerick are visiting the Houses of the Oireachtas today.  I extend a warm welcome to them. As the chairman of the task force is aware, there is a preponderance of travelling families in that area.  I would welcome the establishment of a national body as some local authorities are carrying an unfair burden in the integration of travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Newcastle West a large number of people have been integrated in the community and that is better than providing halting sites.  I would like to hear the Minister's view and perhaps the task force would also look at it.  Sometimes integration brings other problems.  For example, horses are a natural part of the traveller's retinue and this is a huge nuisance when integrating travellers in the community.  I would like that to be addressed because, on balance, the travellers <Col N="1153" /> must bear some responsibility if they want to achieve effective integration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the members of the travelling community have responsibilities just like the settled community. I also agree that integration within settled communities is important. Integration and the provision of halting sites are required because many members of the travelling community are not interested in being integrated in the settled community.  They wish to preserve their way of life and they must be reasonably facilitated in that regard.</P>
      <P>These issues are being ably dealt with and vigorously researched by the task force under the chairmanship of Deputy McManus.  The task force has three subcommittees working on aspects of the lives of travelling community.  I am making the maximum resources available to the task force to enable it to carry out its functions with the greatest possible speed.  I pay tribute to the chairman and all the members of the task force who are giving voluntarily of their time, energies and knowledge to enable us to make substantial progress in providing reasonable living conditions for members of the travelling community to which, I am sure, all Members of the House subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the initial report of the task force issued on 14 January. When will the final report be published? I am concerned that the Minister says he is setting up groups to look at this or that aspect and that we must wait for legislation.  The local authorities will not be able to sustain their campaign unless there is an overall balance throughout the country.  It may require legislation to hold back allocations for local authority housing where local authorities are not playing their part.  In the context of integration, it should be illegal to hold animals. I was reared in a culture which included the keeping of horses. However, when I went to live in the city I could not bring the horses and allow them out on the open spaces.  It would not be long before my neighbours would <Col N="1154" /> have objected if I had done that.  I do not see why the travelling community should be treated any differently if they wish to move from rural to city living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy misunderstood me.  The subcommittees I referred to are those set up by the task force to expedite their work so that various aspects of the lives of travellers could be dealt with simultaneously.  I cannot say when the final report of the task force will be furnished to me.  I know there are regular meetings of the task force and of the sub groups.  They all know of the need to make progress and, as soon as they can complete their work thoroughly, their report will be furnished to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 22 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> Figures relating to the cost per head of persons who avail of civil legal aid and advice from the Civil Legal Aid Board's law centres are not readily available and could be obtained only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of the board's time and resources.  Official figures relating to the amount spent on civil legal aid and advice per person eligible for legal aid in this country are also not available.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid of £5 million which I secured from the Government for the Legal Aid Board for 1994 will allow the board to open ten new full time centres and four new part time centres in 1994. On that basis the total number of full-time centres will be 26 and the total number of part-time centres will be 17 &mdash; a total of 43 centres.  By the end of the year every county will have either a full or part-time law centre.</P>
    <P>Two of the new full-time centres are being provided in Dublin &mdash; one in the city and one in Blanchardstown.  Outside Dublin, new full time centres will be located in Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Monaghan, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Wexford and Wicklow.  The existing law centre in Galway will be provided with an additional solicitor.</P>
    <P>The four new part-time centres will be established at Carrick-on-Shannon, Cavan town, Navan and Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made by the Legal Aid Board for the leasing and equipping of premises for the new centres. The centres will be opened as quickly as possible within the next few months.</P>
    <P>When I took over responsibility for the Legal Aid Board just over 12 months ago there were 39 solicitors and 40 support staff employed in the board's law centres. In 1993 an additional 12 solicitors and 29 support staff were allocated.  A further 24 solicitors and 34 support staff will be employed this year to service the new law centres.  When these additional staff are recruited the Legal Aid Board will have a total of 75 solicitors and 103 support staff.  Staff numbers in the board's head office will also be augmented in 1994 to <Col N="1156" /> enable them to deal effectively with the additional work generated in the law centres. These increases mean that, since coming into office, the Government will have more than doubled the number of staff employed by the board.</P>
    <P>The scheme of civil legal aid and advice covers most areas of the law including personal injury.  Legal advice on labour law matters is available under the scheme at present and legal aid is available where court proceedings are concerned.</P>
    <P>A very limited number of areas such as proceedings before labour or social welfare tribunals are not covered by the scheme.  The question of extending the scheme to cover these areas is being considered in the light of the impact of the additional resources, being provided this year, on reducing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The legislation to put the scheme on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the expansion of the scheme.  Is this a once off expansion or does the Minister expect it to continue?  If not, does he agree with the chairman of the Legal Aid Board who is reported as saying that the original aim of providing a nation-wide service will never be fulfilled?  Does this not underline even more forcefully the need to put the Legal Aid Board on a statutory footing and to extend the scheme to other areas?  The Minister says the legislation is at an advanced stage.  Perhaps he would clarify what that means.  There is such a thing as &ldquo;Minister speak&rdquo; and it is hard for Opposition Deputies to know precisely what is meant when such terms are used.  People who cannot afford to get legal representation should be able to avail of the services, limited through they are, in areas which are not now covered. Does the Minister intend to include those areas in the next six months or what timescale is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting the scheme on a statutory basis will require a Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting.  The service will not be altered by that legislation, <Col N="1157" /> but it will formalise the operation of the scheme.  I hope the Bill will be published soon.</P>
      <P>The service has increased greatly since I took office.  The level of increase since then more than matches the development of the scheme since its foundation.  By the end of this year there will be a law centre in every county and a large increase in the number of staff, both solicitors and support staff, is provided for. There have been substantial reductions in the waiting lists at many law centres and further improvements will be made when the new centres come into operation later in the year.  The position will be reviewed from time to time.  I cannot say what the budgetary position will be in 1995 or 1996, but I am anxious that the maximum possible resources are made available for the legal aid service.</P>
      <P>In addition to law centres we have established a pilot scheme under which private practitioners participate in certain categories of family law matters in the District Court.  That scheme is being reviewed to ascertain how it operated in 1993 and depending on the outcome of the review I will consider whether it should be continued or extended.  The scheme plays an important role for people living in remote areas far away from a law centre, even though the centre may be located in their county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion of the legal aid system must be acknowledged and I hope the waiting time will be reduced. The waiting period for first time consultations can be up to six or seven months.  As the majority of cases dealt with by the board involve family law issues and bearing in mind that a Family Law Bill is going through the Oireachtas and we anticipate divorce legislation following the referendum, will the Minister review the position again and indicate if there are sufficient resources for free legal aid?  Will he comment on the newspaper report that the service is not free because of a minimum payment of £19? Can that charge be eliminated in certain circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1158" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before the new law centres come into operation there have been substantial reductions in waiting lists in many centres.  For example, in Castlebar and Cork North Mall the waiting time has been reduced to two months, in Cork South Mall it has been reduced to ten weeks, in Clondalkin to seven weeks, Ormond Quay to two months and Dundalk to six weeks.  In Galway it has been reduced to three weeks, in Letterkenny and Limerick to two months, Sligo to one month and in other places to five or six months.  When the new permanent and part-time law centres come into operation those waiting lists will be reduced further, but the volume of work may increase as time passes.  It is difficult to prognosticate how the position will develop.  It will be kept under review and all necessary steps will be taken.  I am glad the Deputy acknowledges the substantial progress made during the past 15 months. When I took office the waiting lists in most law centres was 12 months and upwards.  Substantial progress has been made since then.  I have great hopes for the private practitioners' scheme which will assist in reducing waiting lists and, more importantly, provide a service for people in remote areas.  I understand there is a sliding scale and, depending on the person's income, some contribution is required but that will also be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear there is only one month's waiting list in the Sligo area.  When a person from an area which has a legal aid service does not wish to use the services of that office can he or she avail of the services of an office in another area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware he or she can.  If it is a family law case it might be possible for such people to avail of the private practitioners scheme. Approximately 100 solicitors have agreed to serve on a panel of private practitioners and it might be possible for such people to avail of that service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 13, 18, 27, 42, 85, 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Working Group on Childcare for Working Parents was published on 15 March. On 9 March, 1994 I presented the report for the information of Government highlighting the recommendations and the plans for consultation.</P>
      <P>A list of the working group's recommendations have been circulated to Deputies.  The working group made a number of recommendations which will involve some response by Government Departments and public service bodies. Some recommendations are directed at private sector, community and parent interest groups.</P>
      <P>My Department has begun its contacts with other Departments as a part of the follow up consultative process to establish a Government response to the report's recommendations.  In view of their implications across a large number of Departments and public bodies, detailed consideration of the recommendations will be necessary and it is not possible at this stage to indicate the nature, cost or timescale of a Government response.  It must be remembered that the working group address non-Government groups including employers, trade unions, community and parent interests.  Effective progress on many recommendations will require a partnership effort on the part of all interest groups and the relevant public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the report of the Working <Col N="1161" /> Group on Childcare for Working Parents refers to the potential for job creation in the area of child care, no indepth analysis of this subject was available.  However I expect future child care developments can lead to worthwhile job creation opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the question of child care is a joke? We have received a document which has taken four years to publish and repeats many of the recommendations of a report published 11 years ago.  We are now told that the consultation process is about to begin.  Will the Minister also agree that child care, like charity, begins at home, that the Government should retrieve some of its tattered credibility in the area of child care and give a commitment to provide a child care facility in Leinster House to provide for more than 600 people employed here, many of whom are parents?  Will he agree that the position is a disgrace, that a child care facility would not cost the taxpayer money and would make the statement that children are welcome within the portals of this great building?  Will he accept he has a responsibility as Minister for Equality and Law Reform to ensure that parents are not discriminated against, particularly in the centre of Government, where the needs of children are not considered? If the fiasco of providing facilities for children continues it will be a joke and will discredit the Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the provision for such a facility and I am sure it will be considered by the Ceann Comhairle.  I am serious about the provision of child care facilities and secured £1 million to set up a number of child care projects around the country in consultation with local partnership group interests.  That is <Col N="1162" /> an indication I am serious about the issue. Under the National Development Plan provision has been made in training and work programmes for the provision of child care facilities.  I am hopeful they will provide opportunities for women to participate in many of those programmes. I agree the report of the working group has taken a long time to produce, it was in gestation when I took office.  I made every effort to secure its production and it has now been circulated to Deputies.  Child care provision will not be solved by simply pressing a button, the co-operation and involvement of the Government, private sector, trade unions and employer organisations, IBEC and other organisations, is necessary. I will undertake necessary consultations with other Government Departments, the trade union movement, IBEC and partnership and enterprise groups to ensure that the maximum possible provision for child care is secured in accordance with the various recommendations of the report received in the past few days.</P>

      <P>The report may have been received in the past few days but we have heard of its gestation period of many years.  Will the Minister give a commitment on a timescale to respond to the recommendations?  It is frustrating for Members of the Opposition to be continuously fobbed off by being told matters are in train and under discussion. One of the recommendations of the report if to encourage the county enterprise boards to provide grant support towards start-up costs of nursery and family day care networks.  In the light of vibes I received from some county enterprise boards we will be waiting for a long time for such work to be recognised as proper work.  That view underlines the attitude towards work which women in the main perform in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various aspects to the provision of child care facilities including the public sector aspect, the extent to which the public sector should become actively involved, the role of the <Col N="1163" /> private sector, the provision of child care facilities on a joint partnership basis between industry and local groups with Government involvement and what the incentives should be.  There are a number of issues to be determined.  I am not prepared to give a commitment date on matters for which I do not have personal control.  The report has just come to hand and it makes interesting reading in the context of 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have begun work on the recommendations of the report in respect of my Department in a practical way by securing £1 million from the Government to set up facilities.  That is an appreciable sum and it will be a practical start from the Government's viewpoint to set up practical facilities.  The private sector must be involved and consideration must be given to how other Government agencies, local authority agencies, enterprise centres and partnership groups can be involved.  We will consult them to ensure that the role envisaged for them in the child care area will be provide.  From the point of view of inducement the National Development Plan provides for this. A child care element is written into the plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  Those issues will be monitored and the progress of those agencies in that area will be noted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the time for debate on this Bill is restricted.  On 3 April 1992 I made a lengthy contribution on the last Bill dealing with this subject to come before the House.  My views at the time caused disquiet and anger among members of the Law Society.  The leader of my party received a protest at what I said about aspects of the workings of the profession.</P>
      <P>I was not surprised that this Bill was watered down since its publication and before it was brought to the House.  I refer specifically to the proposals to open up conveyancing to solicitors employed by banks and other financial institutions. The powerful Law Society lobby in this House was very much in evidence when commitments to change were given before Second Stage of the Bill was taken.  While I agree there are inbuilt dangers in allowing financial institutions to deal with conveyancing on behalf of clients, I am basically pro-consumer.  The consumer should have a choice on this.  I very much regret that the crocodile tears shed by the Incorporated Law Society, on behalf of consumer interests, on the erosion of this restricted practice with regard to conveyancing were heeded by the Minister as a result of pressure from his party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The elimination of a restricted practice should be applauded, but the powerful legal lobby in Dáil Éireann brought about an anti-consumer heave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> I realise that house conveyancing is an essential part of the business of many solicitors' firms.  I understand that difficulties will arise for small offices if the business is opened up but that must be balanced with the rights of the public to have a choice, and that right has been eliminated.  The might of the legal lobby in this House is much in evidence in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>When the last Solicitors Bill was with the Select Committee, Second Stage having been agreed in this House in April 1992, a determined effort was made to have some of its provisions substantially watered down.  There was a large number of solicitors on that committee and a cross-party attempt was made to erode many of the provisions of the Bill. Members of the public and of this House must be vigilant in this matter as the provisions of this Bill, when it goes to Select Committee, may be eroded too.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of solicitors are honest, hard working people who try to do their best for their clients.  Where I differ with the profession is that it is self-regulatory, is unwilling to face up to the fact that there is mismanagement and, in a minority of cases, corruption in the profession.  The self-regulatory powers should be taken from the profession and that should be done by an independent body with representation from the consumer.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House in 1981 I encountered many problems, but where I detect the most exploitation and the most serious problems is in the legal profession.  In the early eighties the Incorporated Law Society refused to face up to the problems and rejected allegations by me and by many excellent journalists who courageously raised the issues of corruption and mismanagement in the profession.  People who complained to the Incorporated Law Society about problems with solicitors went through a fruitless exercise as the society denied that problems existed. When I raised this issue publicly the reaction was unprecedented.  The Law Society now accepts there is a serious problem with a minority of its members, <Col N="1198" /> agrees that privileges have been abused and that allegations by me have, in many cases, proved correct.</P>
    <P>The Law Society, as a trade union and a regulatory body, puts its own interests first and has done so for years.  If people decided to take their problems to the courts they faced high costs and were quickly swallowed up in a jungle of a court system in trying to have their complaints dealt with.</P>
    <P>This Bill had a long incubation.  It was drafted in the Department of Justice in the early eighties and came before the House in early 1992, but because of the election in that year it was withdrawn at Select Committee stage.  It has since gone through hibernation and has now resurfaced. I hope the Bill, having passed Second Stage, will be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in this area are so widespread that an effective group was set up to represent victims of solicitors' activities, namely, the Irish Family Farm Therapy Group, who have highlighted injustices in recent years.  This group was formed as a result of the Incorporated Law Society's failure to respond to criticisms of its members and structures and its practice of dealing with complaints in an arrogant and aggressive manner.  Only in recent years, because of the weight of evidence and the volume of public opinion on this issue, has the Law Society moderated its views and finally accepted that there is a problem.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the continued policy of self-regulation and the basic principle underlying this Bill is that the Law Society will continue to regulate itself.  Despite provisions to protect the public interest, a powerful group which controls the legal system cannot offer the public adequate safeguards.  The Bill is flawed because of the retention of the self-regulation principle.  The Incorporated Law Society has been half-hearted in dealing with cases of alleged misbehaviour and mismanagement by its members and people who protested to the society were informed that if they wished to take civil action against solicitors they had a right to do so.  However, they were often not advised on how to <Col N="1199" /> proceed and they found it almost impossible to get a solicitor to act on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Incorporated Law Society set up a panel of solicitors to deal with complaints from the public about the behaviour of solicitors.  That panel operated in theory only.  The most recent evidence available shows that the panel does not work in the majority of cases. The Incorporated Law Society is aware of a recent case in Cork where a member of the public who had his case referred to a disciplinary committee of the High Court found it impossible over a period of months to get a solicitor to represent him before the committee.  He ended up on the defensive when the committee warned him that unless he appeared before it at an appointed date and time the case would proceed without him.  It was only after intervention by public representatives &mdash; I warned the committee that I would highlight the matter in the Dáil &mdash; that some flexibility was shown. The person eventually got a solicitor and the matter was settled before it went before the disciplinary committee.  This recent example demonstrates the way in which people who use the present system are disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to unemployment and legal costs.  One of the major impediments to job creation is the cost of liability insurance.  The costs of employer liability, personal liability and car insurance are so high that individuals with financial resources find it more attractive to deposit money in a bank account where it will earn interest.  The Government should consider the introduction of price control on the level of professional fees.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society and bodies which represent the medical profession can come together and unilaterally decide on the level of fees for their members.  This type of closed shop decision-making impacts severely on the level of insurance premia.  Neither the Government nor the public has any input into the decisions on the level of these fees.  We have seen many recent media <Col N="1200" /> articles about the level of fees paid to solicitors involved in the beef tribunal. Consideration has to be given at some stage to the level of lawyers' fees and the fees paid to doctors who attend court hearings.  The closed shop decisions on the level of these fees is one of the main factors driving the level of premia through the roof.  The role of the taxing master must also be examined and some effort made by the Government to introduce a degree of control on legal costs.</P>
    <P>We all know of examples of ambulance chasing where people are encouraged at the drop of a hat to take frivolous cases against companies and local authorities and pursue them to the limit.  The practice of ambulance chasing is anti-jobs, against the common good, deplorable, unpatriotic and impacts adversely on the level of awards paid by local authorities. Cork Corporation has been stung so many times by claims that it has had to open up a personal liability fund &mdash; it could not afford to retain the services of an insurance broker.  Much of the annual budget of the corporation is allocated to the projected costs of civil litigation.  The Minister must make an attempt to eliminate this irresponsible practice.  Unfortunately the Bill does not adequately address this issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill purports to provide greater protection for the clients of solicitors. However, the reality is that the Bill will reinforce the dominant position of solicitors. It appears that the Bill was largely drawn up by the Incorporated Law Society.  This point was made very effectively by Mr. Noel Ryan on a recent radio programme.  Recent newspaper articles have stated that the Incorporated Law Society and solicitors breathed a sigh of relief at this Bill, indicating that it is not as bad as they expected.  This can only mean that the Bill is not as good as the ordinary citizen expected.  The root and branch changes required have not been provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will attempt to highlight the provisions which fall far short of what people expected.  On sections 9(6) and 15(4)(g), I reject totally the concept of any time limit on complaints by clients against solicitors. <Col N="1201" /> The imposition of time limits on complaints of any nature constitutes an amnesty for rogue solicitors, whether it be in terms of bills of cost, fraud, negligence or delays.  The very idea of passing into law a provision which would effectively exonerate solicitors, officers of the court, from wrongdoing purely on the basis of a time limit is so outrageous that it has to have been thought up by solicitors.  If legislators allow solicitors to commit wrongdoings within a certain time frame to the detriment of clients they will be enshrining in law the right of solicitors to practise premeditated wrongdoings.  The above sections ignore the position of the aggrieved client, concentrate on planning an escape route for solicitors and will put the client at risk. The relationship between a client and his solicitor is, by its very nature, an unequal one, where the client puts his trust in his solicitor and must not be taken advantage of.  Legislators should do everything to ensure that the weaker party, the client, is protected.</P>
    <P>Section 15(1) proposes the appointment of an independent adjudicator.  The provisions in this section are a contradition in themselves.  This section highlights the ridiculous and misdirected nature of the Bill.  The provisions in this section are so bad that they can only be termed appalling.  Legislators and the parliamentary draftsman have failed to see the contradictions in this section.  In essence, the section proposes that the Incorporated Law Society will establish, maintain and fund the office of an adjudicator, supposedly independent, to investigate the society.  How could an adjudicator appointed under these circumstances be independent?  As the Incorporated Law Society will be paying the expenses of the office, the adjudicator could not possibly be independent.  The Incorporated Law Society is <i>de facto</i> the trade union for solicitors and as such could be neither impartial nor independent in dealing with complaints against members of its profession.  If, as proposed in section 15(1), the adjudicator is an employee of the Incorporated <Col N="1202" /> Law Society then his independence will go out the window, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society has repeatedly said that the number of complaints is very few, a statement which I reject.  If the society's claim is true, it should not have any problems with the appointment of an ombudsman.  Despite all the promises, there is no reference to an ombudsman in the Bill.  Why is this the case?  We can see the clear hand of the Incorporated Law Society at work in the Bill and the so-called legislators have failed to rectify this appalling situation. If the Bill is implemented in its present form it will be incestuous and amount to what I would term &ldquo;angels incorporated&rdquo; where the members will clip their wings within their society.  The Incorporated Law Society may have managed to fool some legislators but it certainly has not fooled the ordinary citizen.  The society seems to be wide awake while the Minister and his Department are fast asleep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Bill.  I recommend the appointment of an ombudsman who is totally independent of and separate from the Incorporated Law Society and who will be able to deal directly with complaints from clients.  The 1990 report of the Fair Trade Commission stated that an office of legal ombudsman should be established to deal with complaints concerning solicitors and barristers.  The Department missed a golden opportunity to act on this recommendation in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On section 16 (5) and (6), I am opposed to limitations imposed on lay members of the disciplinary tribunal.  The provisions in the Bill ensure that the powers afforded to the lay members would be disproportionate to those afforded to the legal members; it would be two to one against.  This means that for every one lay member there will be two who will ensure that complaints go nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many years I have lodged dozens of complaints with the Law Society to no <Col N="1203" /> avail.  I found it a non-effective way of dealing with complaints but there was no other way of doing so.  I do not want to deal with the society in the matter of complaints but, unfortunately, this legislation forces people like me and members of the public to continue to deal with the Law Society.</P>
    <P>There should be an independent ombudsman which would mean that the existing system and that proposed in the Bill would be superfluous.  Only the removal of self-regulation will overcome the obstacles to fair play for the public. The presence of an ombudsman would eliminate the necessity for a complaints committee, a disciplinary tribunal or any dealing with the Law Society as a complaints body.  On the last occasion a similar Bill was before the House I highlighted many examples demonstrating this.</P>
    <P>Section 29(6) deals with the capping figure of £250,000 for claims against solicitors. The suggestion of capping to £250,000, in reference to what the Law Society may have to pay out, cannot be acceptable.  A report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 27 February 1994 stated:</P>
    <P>The fixing of a cap of £250,000 per claim on the Law Society's compensation fund has been welcomed, as it is in line with the figure most individuals and firms in the profession would have advocated.  It is seen as having two merits &mdash; it will keep down solicitor's costs and will enable the fund to be topped up following several large claims in recent years.</P>
    <P>This is typical as it shows that the profession's main concern is its own self-interest and the state of its fund, while it confines and sets limits which are disadvantageous to the public.</P>
    <P>These who drafted this Bill must have been asleep.  To entertain the concept of capping is wrong.  The aggrieved client must be allowed to recover his or her loss in full and this should be the primary concern.  This Bill asks us to accept the Law Society as the complaints vehicle but, for example, what if one of the <Col N="1204" /> society's members absconded with £2 million of a client's money?  Under the terms of this Bill the Law Society will only have to pay out £250,000.  What will happen to the remaining £1,750,000? Will the solicitor be allowed to keep that money and, perhaps, entertain some of his colleagues in the Bahamas?  As legislators we must realise that this use of capping encourages fraud, grand larceny and other offences.  It is short-sighted and foolish and the Minister must listen to what the public is saying.  The whole issue of capping must be reconsidered.  I hope to make a more detailed contribution on Committee Stage but I oppose any suggestion of capping because a client, must be compensated in full for his or her loss.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with all my reservations about this Bill because of time constraints.  People, however, must never forget that the power is vested in Members of Dáil Éireann and not in the courts, in the Minister for Justice or her officials.  This House, therefore, must ensure that the interests of the public are protected in this Bill and if they are not it must be opposed.  Legislators have a duty to fulfil the wishes of the people and what goes into law can become bad law. Members of the public are, at times, expected to abide by bad law.</P>
    <P>I will conclude my contribution with the following quotation: &ldquo;A society of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves&rdquo;.  I reserve the remainder of my remarks for Committee Stage.</P>

In a House that is empty, and where the two Government parties with an enormous majority make no contribution to this debate, it is wrong that somebody like Deputy Allen or myself is constrained by time to make short <Col N="1205" /> speeches on a complex Bill that is difficult to read and assimilate and to understand the various nuances of it.</P>
      <P>In general terms I welcome this Bill because it was obviously needed.  It has been in preparation for many years.  A solicitor's Bill was finally published in 1991 and, as far as I recall, received its Second Reading in this House and was beginning its Committee Stage when the last Dáil fell.  It is unfortunate that we had to wait until 1994 before it was reintroduced. There are no major changes in it, although there are some changes since it was introduced in 1991, and it is unfortunate that it was not published sooner because many of its provisions are badly needed.  The public's right to protection has certainly been affected by the fact that there has been no legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>I wish to declare my interest or, perhaps more accurately, my non-interest in this matter because, of course, it will be alleged that anything I say is in the interests of solicitors.  I am a solicitor, I practised full-time for approximately eight years before I was elected to this House.  I practised intermittently on a part-time basis on a number of occasions since then.  I have not practised for many years and if I am elected to the European Parliament next June &mdash; and every election is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; it is unlikely that I will ever practise again.  For that reason I have no vested interest in this matter one way or the other.</P>
      <P>I have some experience, however, because as well as practising full time for some years as a solicitor I was Minister for Justice when I tried to deal with various problems, including problems that arise under this Bill.  I was also Minister for Industry and Commerce for a long time when I again tried to deal with many of these problems.  I have, therefore, some considerable experience in these matters and I hope that any views I express will be expressed in an objective way for the benefit of the general public and not for any particular sectional benefit or any particular sectional reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solicitors branch of the legal profession has experienced severe difficulties <Col N="1206" /> in terms of its public perception in recent years.  I would date those difficulties to the time when the numbers within the solicitors' profession began to proliferate enormously.  When I qualified in 1961 there were less than 1,500 solicitors in Ireland.  Today, there are approximately 5,000, an increase of almost a factor of four in a period of a little more than 30 years.  Most of that increase has occurred in recent years and the Law Society is faced with a dilemma because there are more solicitors in Ireland in private practise than are needed.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Incorporated Law Society seeks to control their numbers they appear to get into difficulty with the courts who have struck down many of the limitations imposed on the numbers entering the profession.  From one point of view I welcome the lack of limitation on those entering, but at the same time we must face the reality that the numbers are so great there is no way many of them can be usefully employed.</P>
    <P>One of the regrets I have always had &mdash; and I have expressed this view to the Incorporated Law Society on numerous occasions &mdash; is that they seem to prepare and educate their students or apprentices only on the basis that they will go into private practice.  We are one of the very few countries, if not the only one, that does that.  In nearly all other countries study of the law is regarded as a worthwhile end in itself, whereas here it is regarded only as worthwhile in so far as it leads to a professional qualification. That is wrong.  I am an example of someone who has spent most of his life not practising law as a private practitioner but who nonetheless has benefited from a legal education.  The country as a whole could benefit, as do other countries, from a far greater input by trained lawyers in areas other than private practice.  In the United States, for example, less than 20 per cent of those who qualify in the law actually practice it as private practitioners either on their own or in a firm.  That is the way it should be here.  Many of the difficulties encountered by the Incorporated Law Society in recent years would have been avoided had we not had the huge proliferation <Col N="1207" /> of numbers.  That proliferation has strongly influenced my thinking in regard to competition.  I am all for competition and I agree with the Minister of State who was quoted recently as saying there is very strong competition within the legal profession because of their numbers.</P>
    <P>I predict that those practitioners who will cause the Incorporated Law Society difficulties by having large claims made against them are people who will be cutting corners in every sense of the word in order to get and retain business.  For that reason, I do not disagree with what the Minister of State has said in regard to sections 78 to 80, inclusive.  On reflection, they were a mistake and the Minister of State was right to take them out.</P>

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;mature reflection&rdquo;. I do not like to remind the Minister of State of the genesis of that remark.</P>
      <P>I should like confirmation that they are being taken out.  While I heard the Minister of State make an announcement outside the House that they would be removed, on looking at the Official Report of Thursday, 10 March 1994, I note he said that their removal was being considered.  I want to know whether they will be removed on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  On balance it is right although it is open to criticism but in present circumstances I doubt whether those provisions in sections 78 to 80 are wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My thinking on that is coloured by the numbers in the profession and, second, by my experience and that of others with banks.  If people other than solicitors or lawyers are to be allowed to practise conveyancing and probate, the last people in the country I should like to see doing it are the banks.  I have been frightened by <Col N="1208" /> the way the banks approach their clients, the manner in which they deal with them. My thinking is coloured by my experience when the two main banks were granted life assurance licences under the Insurance Act of 1989 or 1990.  In spite of all their protestations to the contrary, the clear evidence in each case is that the banks gave huge amounts of information about clients to their insurance subsidiaries and forced their customers to take out insurance cover with those subsidiaries. There is no doubt that that happened, although the banks will go through the ritual of denying it.  I dealt with it as Minister for Industry and Commerce. I fear that, since it happened in a matter like that, certainly it will happen if the banks are allowed provide legal services.  The bank manager or official will make it clear to a customer of the bank that, unless he or she uses the bank's legal services, the bank will be displeased with him or her and will withdraw or reduce their facilities or otherwise inconvenience the customer.  That is not good enough and the banks have only themselves to blame for it.</P>
    <P>There is another section whose provisions prohibit any limitation or prohibition on fee advertising.  Some years ago I would have greatly welcomed that, but from my experience of some of the advertising since 1988 it would be very dangerous to allow fee advertising.  The Minister and the Government should think about this again before Committee Stage.  Had I been asked this question three or four years ago I would have said there should be no prohibition or limitation on fee advertising.  That was recommended by the Fair Trade Commission and, to the best of my knowledge, operates in some other countries. The type of advertising we have had, the ambulance-chasing type of activity Deputy Allen has just described, is so widespread and prevalent, and in my view so dangerous, that to allow it be extended further in relation to fees would be wrong and contrary to the public interest.  That sort of garish advertising by a very small minority of firms, encouraging people to make claims they would <Col N="1209" /> not otherwise make, particularly against local authorities, arising out of contrived motoring accidents and other spurious activities of that kind, is so dangerous and costly to society as a whole that in the public interest the controls on professional or legal advertising should be greater rather than less.  I have no objection whatever to a neutral type of advertising, but certainly I would object to the kind of advertising on some radio stations, for example, encouraging people to take claims they would not otherwise take.  The public at large would be badly advised to avail of the services of people who engage in that type of extreme advertising.  If it is like that now, what would it be if there were no restriction on fee advertising?</P>
    <P>There are serious difficulties with the overall administration of law that go much deeper than the solicitors' profession. The reason the solicitors' profession receives so much publicity is that it is the part of the profession which has direct contact with the public.  One of many artificial restrictions placed on barristers is that they cannot talk directly to the public, to their own clients; there has to be a solicitor present as an intermediary. That kind of restriction should not exist.  It is one of many such restrictions.</P>
    <P>The Law Society and solicitors generally bear the brunt of public criticism. While they do not deserve to be immune from criticism, far from it, as they have handled many of their affairs badly, including investigations into complaints, nonetheless, I know enough about it and have seen enough from the inside to know that the problem is far wider and deeper than the solicitors' profession. Some aspects were touched on the last day by Deputy Gay Mitchell when he referred to the relationship between the Judiciary and the barristers' profession. There is truth in some aspects of what Deputy Mitchell said.  The Minister of State would be well advised to consider the ramifications of that situation.  It was summed up in a recent judgment of Mr. Justice Kinlen in a case relating to costs. It is a tricky area and one I am loath to <Col N="1210" /> dwell on because any remarks you make about it tend to be misunderstood and represented as a direct attack on the Judiciary.  Nonetheless, it is necessary to say that we will not put things right until a much broader approach is taken than in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If you are trying to reform the whole legal administration here it cannot be done by simply picking out one of the three elements involved and legislating exclusively in relation to it, you also have to look at the other two.  The Minister of State mentioned in his opening speech that the principal legislation relating to the profession dates from 1954.  There has been legislation relating to solicitors since the 18th century and many Acts throughout the 19th century but there has never been, to the best of my knowledge, any legislation relating to barristers.  It is, therefore, artificial to pick out one of the three necessary constituent elements and say you are on a zealous crusade of reform.  You cannot do that unless you are prepared to take them all on.  There have been numerous failings in the Law Society from time to time &mdash; not least the interview given by its director general on RTE recently &mdash; in which he said the Law Society wrote 99 per cent of this Bill although I believe that is untrue. However, whatever the failings of the Law Society, and I do not defend them, to deal with it in terms of reform is a joy compared to dealing with others.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I tried to improve legal education, which in those days was in an appalling state, and to unify professional education.  I asked the representatives of the Benchers of the Kings Inns to come and see me but they refused.  I continued to send requests and finally after about six months they deigned to come.  Two elderly gentlemen arrived and I said my piece to them for five or ten minutes.  They told me they had received their charter and motto from Queen Anne in 1703 which reads <i>nolumus mutare</i>.  They said, in case I was not a Latin scholar, that it could be read transitively or intransitively.  It meant they were unwilling to change and unwilling to be changed.  As far as they were <Col N="1211" /> concerned I could take it either way because they would not change and would continue for the next 250 years as they continued for the last.  Happily much of that has gone since 1970 when that meeting took place but there is still an extraordinary reluctance to change and reform, which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>A time limit of 20 minutes in which to speak on a topic such as this is completely inadequate as it means one can only touch on certain aspects.  It is a great pity because Deputy Allen, the Minister of State and I are the only people in the House, apart from yourself.  Nobody is offering to speak.  If Deputy Allen and I had been allowed develop the various points this would be a more useful debate rather than this artificial limitation of debate into tiny segments which render it quite useless.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the Bill is welcome and is useful.  There is much detail.</P>
    <P>

It is a pity I can only contribute briefly when there is a great deal of detail I would like to go into on the Bill.  The Minister should have an open mind to any amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <P>One change has been made which is welcome even though it may be misunderstood or misrepresented and there are others which could usefully be made. The Minister of State should bear in mind the need to look at administering the law in general rather than simply trying to reform it all through one branch which happens to be the subject of legislation for 200 years when the remainder is not subject to any legislation and see how that difficulty might be faced up to in the future.</P>

      <P>The freedom I spoke about can only be maintained if we have a strong, independent and vibrant legal profession.  That is part of our democratic structure.  This legislation is a response to the need for such a strong legal profession whose standards will not be called into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold a practising certificate issued by the Incorporated Law Society and have a vested interest in this legislation although it will not colour any of my comments.  It is high time we had reform of our legal structures.  I compliment the Minister, and his predecessors, for bringing this legislation forward.  Legislation was published three years ago but never enacted.  Over the years the profession instituted some elements of reform but nothing of the type required.  It is difficult for any Government to engage in a programme of radical reform of a profession such as this.  I disassociate myself from the comments of Deputy Mitchell who, <Col N="1213" /> in the course of his contribution, said the Bill was drafted by the Law Society.  That was not a fair comment and not too many people would believe that to be the case. It is right that the profession should have been consulted by the Government.  They are the professional body regulating the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>This is complex legislation and I do not intend to deal with many of the technical aspects of it which would be more suited to a Committee Stage debate.  I welcome the processing of Bills through select committees but I am not sure which committee will debate this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate centred on discipline, the practice of solicitors and the way they earned their livelihood.  It is unfortunate that in recent years a number of cases have been highlighted in the media.  However, that cannot be taken as an indication that there is widespread improper practice in the profession.  In any walk of life some people will be more diligent than others and it is not fair to tarnish any profession because of the actions of a small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a compelling argument for introducing regulations as far as fees and discipline are concerned.  Many aspects of the way fees are earned have given rise to concern none more so than the practice of creaming off a percentage of an award in a personal injuries case or in any case where a claimant is successful in obtaining compensation.  I am pleased the Minister has decided to regulate that area.  There is a strong argument for allowing lawyers to fight cases on a no win, no fee basis.  This should be accompanied by limits on the amounts <Col N="1214" /> solicitors can expect their clients to pay. A system along the lines of that in the US where lawyers take a large percentage of damages would be against the public interest.  The 10 per cent practice is to be outlawed and that will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Certain costs are not covered by the scale of fees agreed by the Taxing Master or by insurance companies. An element of costs will always have to be met by the plaintiff but as long as he is aware of what he will have to pay there will be no problems.  The problem arises because consumers are left in the dark.  They are told they have been awarded £X,000 but what they get is £X,000 minus a considerable amount of money.  That has &mdash; rightly &mdash; given rise to public concern because there was a feeling that the practice being engaged in was not above board.  It is quite right that the practice should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering allowing lawyers to take cases on the basis that costs will be paid only if they win, and that a proportion of the damages awarded will have to be paid in certain cases to encourage actions by clients in the lower socio-economic groups.  It is a fact of life that as long as we do not have a comprehensive system of legal aid, people will be denied access to the courts.  That is fundamentally unfair in a democracy.  Lawyers have a duty to take on speculative actions but in current circumstances that is not always the case.  Unfortunately many plaintiffs do not have redress through the courts simply because the risk is too great, that is the difficulty.  We must have a system that will encourage people who cannot afford legal costs to seek redress through the courts, even when there is a risk of failure.</P>
    <P>There has to be an incentive for consumers to shop around for the best deal. Advertising is important in encouraging the legal profession to operate in an efficient manner.  People say that the legal profession is above ordinary commercial transactions, but that is old hat and a relic of bygone days.  We are living in a commercial world where the accepted rules of commerce must apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> There has to be an element of competition and consumers have to shop around to get the best possible deal when engaging in legal transactions.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that many solicitors will cast aside a less viable case.  It compounds the injustice the plaintiff feels is being perpetrated against him.  This brings me to the question of legal aid.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, recently reaffirmed the Government's commitment dating from the early 1980s to put the legal aid service on a statutory footing.  The system is neither adequate nor free and I hope that when the legislation is published the Pringle report will be adhered to.  The legal aid system in the United Kingdom is terribly expensive and Irish taxpayers could not foot the bill for a similar service in Ireland.  We have to accept that we do not have a bottomless pit from which to resource the legal aid service.</P>
    <P>The condition of courthouses throughout the country and the operation of the list system for cases need to be addressed but I am not sure they are within the jurisdiction of the Minister of State.  Long delays in the High Court are a feature of our legal system in spite of a slight improvement over recent years but it is unacceptable to have to wait four or five years for a case to reach finality.  Some sittings of the District Court are in licensed premises and I do not think that is in keeping with the concept of acceptable justice but, unfortunately, some of our courthouses have fallen into a poor state of repair and cannot be used.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV of the Bill deal with the protection of clients.  It is essential to have compulsory indemnity cover; although the vast majority of practitioners have such cover, the fact that it will be enforceable by way of statute gives a greater level of protection to clients.  It is important that the certificate of indemnity should be on display in the waiting room or other public area of the office that the Minister deems fit.  The powers that will be vested in the Law Society to withdraw the practising certificate and to institute criminal proceedings in respect <Col N="1216" /> of malpractice are of particular importance. We can deal in greater detail with these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the future of the Bar?  By and large the Fair Trade Commission report of 1990 has been neglected.  The then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, invited recommendations on that report but where does it stand now?  Is it under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, her Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, or the Minister for Equality and Law Reform Deputy Taylor?  It is important that this report, which is very wide-ranging in its recommendations, becomes the focus of attention.  In this Bill we are not addressing what direction the legal profession should take in terms of numbers and whether the professions of solicitors and barristers should be fused &mdash; this is being hit on the head by the various sectoral interest groups &mdash; as we approach the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the concept of reform or rationalisation was clouded by the label &ldquo;fusion&rdquo;.  While I do not see this happening there is a need to streamline the system.  This has not been encouraged by way of a public debate.  I ask the Minister of State to consider publishing a Green Paper on the legal profession to follow on the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>It is important that we consider the questions of training for members of the Judiciary and the necessity to maintain two distinct arms.  I can think of no reasons, other than reasons of history there should be two distinct arms as in the United Kingdom.  It is not the case in the United States and in many other democratic states.  It is only in those countries which were handed the British system of justice that one finds two distinct arms.  This gives rise to public concern. The &ldquo;cattle market law&rdquo; practised outside the door of the Law Library is not always in the best interests of the consumer.  The unfortunate punter does not have direct access to barristers who can change briefs with one another.  This <Col N="1217" /> gives rise to a lack of public confidence in the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should be complimented for saying the right but not always the most popular things.  The professions should be more consumer friendly and more efficient as this would lead to greater public confidence.  It is easy to blame the legal profession but should we not blame the system?  The Minister should publish a Green Paper on the legal profession to initiate a public debate which would be in the interests of the consumer.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate which was informative and constructive.  Deputy Flanagan's suggestion that we publish a Green Paper is most useful and I will discuss it with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the question of fusion.  He will be aware that the Fair Trade Commission considered this matter but was unable, as Deputy McDowell said, to reach a conclusion that fusion would be to the benefit of the consumer.  It recommended instead that it should be made easier for people to change from one branch of the profession to the other.  The Bill contains a number of measures to facilitate this process.  Perhaps fusion will evolve over a period of time.  Neither the Fair Trade Commission nor I have been persuaded that fusion would be in the best interests of the profession.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a comprehensive reforming measure which raises many issues of vital concern to the public and the solicitors profession.  Many constructive views on these matters have been expressed.  To respond to Deputy O'Malley, I will be open to reasonable amendments when the Bill is discussed on Committee Stage. For Deputies' information the Bill is to be referred to the Select Committee on Security and Legislation and every Member of the House will be entitled to attend.  I have not approached the legislation with a closed mind and I do not intend to do so at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell alleged that the Bill <Col N="1218" /> was drafted by the Incorporated Law Society.  Deputy Gilmore echoed this point.  I refute that suggestion.  During the preparation of the Bill the parliamentary draftsman consulted the Incorporated Law Society.  This was right and proper because our objectives are similar to those of the Law Society which has a vested interest, as the regulatory and representative body for the profession, in ensuring that there are remedies available for the public when members of the profession operate below par.  I thank the Law Society for making many useful suggestions during those consultations.  The suggestion that this Bill was drafted by the Law Society is farcical and absurd and I reject it.</P>
    <P>The proposal to amend sections 78 to 80 of the Bill has been the subject of some comment.  Deputy Mitchell said that these provisions were jettisoned following the intervention of lawyers in my party.  Deputy Gilmore said I announced in the media that the Government would drop these sections.  He also said that these provisions were necessary to introduce competition in an area where solicitors enjoy a monopoly and argued that there is a need for more competition in the profession.  Deputy Kenny, the Chief Whip of the main Opposition party, was in favour of the proposal to delete these provisions.  The views of Deputy Mitchell were at variance with those of Deputy Kenny in that regard.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but at that time several members of the Deputy's party strongly opposed these provisions. During the debate on Second Stage Deputy Shatter stated, at column 579 of the Official Report of 3 April 1992: &ldquo;It is in the interests of the general public that banks do not start conducting probate work&rdquo;.  On the question of conveyancing, he stated at column 581:</P>
      <P>It would be dangerous to give the banks conveyancing work because, again, they have no expertise in this area.  The proposal is designed to give the banks a total monopoly and this could prove detrimental to the interests of the customer.  I hope I have given some additional reasons as to why they are dangerous and are not in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan, at column 510 of the Official Report of 2 April 1992, and former Deputy Barnes, at column 652 of the Official Report of 3 April 1992, were also opposed to these provisions.  Deputy Barrett stated, at columns 37 and 38 of the Official Report of 4 December, that he did not understand why the banks were being empowered to provide probate services and that he was not happy that this was the correct move.  He described these proposals as part of &ldquo;a trendy concept of opening things, weakening <Col N="1220" /> the professions and letting other people work in areas where heretofore only professionals worked&rdquo;.  He was not happy that these provisions were in the interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was in favour of the proposal that section 79, which deals with conveyancing services, should be dropped. Deputy Mitchell was not present in the House for the contribution of his colleague, Deputy Allen, who is a member of the front bench.  If Deputy Mitchell did not oppose the deletion of these provisions, Deputy Allen did so in the most trenchant terms.</P>
    <P>Sections 78 and 79 were included for the purpose of increasing competition in the provision of probate and conveyancing services.  However, I have been considering these provisions having regard to representations which I have received, not solely from politicians, and it may be that they are not the best way forward.  In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the numbers qualifying as solicitors.  Within the profession, therefore, there are many more solicitors competing against each other for available business, including conveyancing and probate services.  This competition will ultimately benefit consumers.</P>
    <P>In reviewing these provisions, I am concerned about extending further powers to the banks and other large financial institutions.  These are economically powerful organisations which already exercise considerable power and influence in our economy.  Having considered the matter carefully, I deem it may not be in the best long term interest of consumers to grant further powers to financial institutions in relation to property and interest in property.  If greater competition is needed in these areas it can be provided and is being provided within an expanded profession.</P>
    <P>My concern is not to protect the interests of solicitors or to preserve the alleged monopoly which they may enjoy but to do what is best in the interest of the consumer.  If any Member or anyone else thinks the best way to protect the interests of consumers is to extend and <Col N="1221" /> expand the powers of banks and large financial institutions, I urge them to think again.</P>
    <P>Competition in the provision of probate and conveyancing services will be further enhanced by section 69 which lifts the Law Society's prohibition on price advertising of legal services.  The increase in the number of solicitors and the changes in advertising arrangements should ensure adequate competition in the provision of these services to the benefit of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The concerns which have been expressed about sections 78 and 79 do not extend to all financial institutions equally.  I regard credit unions as being in a different category to other financial institutions.  In general, they are relatively small organisations operating at local or community level and they function on a non-profit-making basis for the benefit of their members.  It seems appropriate that they should be enabled to provide will-making and probate services subject to safeguards being introduced by way of regulation to ensure the playing pitch is level as between them and solicitors. I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage on these provisions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that there should be an independent body to hear complaints about barristers and solicitors. There was concern that the adjudicator would not be independent in the carrying out of his or her functions if the scheme were funded by the Law Society.  Deputy Gilmore suggested that the functions of the adjudicator were not those usually associated with the Ombudsman scheme. He also alleged that the adjudicator's function would be to report to the Law Society and that he or she would be no more than a research officer for the Law <Col N="1222" /> Society.  Section 15 is confined to complaints about solicitors.  Complaints against barristers have not been included because the Bar Council, in response to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission, introduced new machinery some years ago for dealing with complaints against barristers.  It comprises an investigation and disciplinary committee which includes two lay persons nominated by trade unions and employers' bodies and a further appeals tribunal which can review any decision by the committee.  It is headed by a retired Circuit Court judge.  The machinery is available to anyone who wishes to complain about the handling of a case by a barrister.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a copy of the first report of the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal concerning the period from January 1992 to August 1993 which I am considering.  I intend to wait until there has been adequate experience of the operation of these new arrangements for dealing with complaints against barristers before considering the need for legislative intervention in relation to this aspect of legal services.  I would not, however, rule out extending the powers of the independent adjudicator to include complaints against barristers if the arrangements introduced by the Bar Council were not to command public confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take the powers to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted an editorial in the <i>London Times</i> of 14 March 1994 describing how the Bar in the UK have a self-regulatory system similar to our Bar and up to now, had similar terms of reference for the complaints machinery.  It decided to radically reorganise that machinery to enable people to make complaints about matters such as we are dealing with in this Bill, for example, shoddy service, overcharging etc.  It is interesting that the legal affairs ombudsman in the United Kingdom, referring to the existing disciplinary system which is the same as the one the Bar here has, <Col N="1223" /> said that it was primarily a disciplinary system that exists for the benefit of the profession rather than a complaints system.  I propose to write tomorrow to the Bar Council bringing that matter to their attention and asking them if it is their intention to look again at their complaints machinery in the light of what is happening in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed about the independence of the adjudicator because the Law Society is required, under section 15, to fund the operation of the scheme. I have explained why the Law Society should fund the running of the scheme. There are at least three important safeguards built into the provisions of section 15 to ensure that the adjudicator will be able to operate in a completely independent way as is required under the section.  First, the Minister's consent will be required for the appointment of any independent adjudicator by the Law Society.  Second, the adjudicator will be required to report annually to the Minister on the discharge of his or her duties. As he or she will be under a statutory obligation to act independently in the exercise of functions, it will be open to the adjudicator to raise any issue of interference with his or her independence in the course of the annual report.  Finally, the Minister shall be requiring publication of the annual reports and shall lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any difficulties encountered by the adjudicator in discharging his or her statutory functions will then be a matter of public record.  Also, it is not unusual for the bodies who are covered by an ombudsman scheme to fund the scheme.  That is the case in the ombudsman scheme for the credit institutions which establish arrangements for an independent adjudicator to consider unresolved complaints about participating credit institutions, including all commercial banks and building societies.  It is also the case in the insurance ombudsman scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that the adjudicator's role would be limited to making reports to the Law Society is <Col N="1224" /> entirely wrong and misplaced.  Under section 15 the adjudicator will be empowered to investigate complaints and to reinvestigate a complaint made to the society about a solicitor if he or she is not satisfied that the Law Society has adequately investigated the complaint. The adjudicator is also empowered to direct the society to apply to the disciplinary tribunal for an investigation into the conduct of a solicitor.  Where the adjudicator reinvestigates a complaint he or she may require the production of documents relevant to the complaint and require persons to attend before him or her.  Any person who fails to comply with such a requirement or any person who interferes with the adjudicator in the performance of his or her duties will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Deputies Mitchell, O'Donnell and Gilmore about the cap of £250,000 being put on awards from the statutory compensation fund. Deputy O'Donnell stated that it might need to be increased.  The Government considered this matter in some detail before deciding to provide for a cap.  In recent years the fund has had to meet a number of substantial claims from large business institutions.  The purpose of the cap is to ensure that the fund is not depleted by further large claims, particularly by financial institutions.  Financial institutions have large resources available to them and are experts in financial matters.  They are, therefore, in a very strong position to protect their own interests without having recourse to the compensation fund.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the fund is to provide compensation for private individuals and the smaller business clients who suffer loss at the hands of fraudulent solicitors. It was never intended that the fund should have an open-ended liability.  For the past ten years the Law Society has not paid an amount in excess of £250,000 to any private individual who suffered loss because of the fraudulent activity of a solicitor.  However, claims in excess of £250,000 have been made by bodies corporate in the past ten years.  If a cap is not placed on claims there is a serious <Col N="1225" /> risk that the fund will be depleted by very large claims, thereby depriving the people it is intended to protect.  I note Deputies do not object to the principle of a cap; concern is about the level of the cap.  The Law Society has a discretion to grant in excess of £250,000 in cases of hardship.  However, I am disposed to consider reasonable suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell noted that section 30 does not contain a power to enable the Minister for Justice to increase the monetary level of the fund which must be maintained on a fixed date at £1 million or such higher level as the Law Society may provide by regulation.  The requirement to maintain the fund at £1 million is not absolute.  However, it is an indication to the Law Society of the minimum level at which the fund should be maintained and it does not limit the total amount of claims which the society may be required to pay out of the fund.  That is governed by section 29 of the Bill, to which I already referred, under which the society is required to maintain the fund at a level to meet claims arising under the provisions of that section.  Section 22 of the 1960 Act simply required the society to maintain the fund at £25,000.  Of course, the Law Society currently maintain the fund at a substantially greater sum than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue of funding for complaints procedures under sections 8, 9 and 15.  It is intended that the Law Society will pay the costs of the investigation of complaints under those three complaints procedures.  The Law Society has sought the provisions of sections 8 and 9 to strengthen its regulatory control over the profession. Section 12 empowers the society to recover a contribution of up to £1,000 from a solicitor who has been the subject of a complaint under sections 8 and 9 to offset the cost of investigating the complaints. The cost of establishing and running the office of an independent adjudicator will be funded by the society, provided for under section 15.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed doubts about the proposal in section 69 to allow <Col N="1226" /> solicitors to advertise their fees, as recommended by the Fair Trade Commission and she and Deputy Kenny were also concerned about the standards of advertising by some solicitors.  Deputies McDowell and O'Malley made an interesting contribution in that regard. Solicitors in the United Kingdom have been allowed to advertise their fees for some time.  The general feeling is that it has contributed to reducing the levels of fees although it is difficult to provide statistical evidence to prove this proposition. If solicitors can advertise their services it is illogical to argue against advertising their fees.  If one is opposed to something in principle, one should be opposed to it in totality.  Deputy McDowell was opposed to it in totality and Deputy O'Malley expressed grave reservations about advertising in general.  In the absence of the other provisions in this Bill the right of solicitors to advertise their services in an unregulated and uncontrolled manner might cause difficulties and those difficulties could be exacerbated if their powers were extended to advertising their fees.</P>
    <P>Two difficulties arise in that regard. The unregulated and uncontrolled advertising in the United States &mdash; referred to by some Deputies as &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo;&mdash; could take place here.  The provisions of the legislation will enable the Law Society to prohibit such advertising and provide effective remedies for solicitors who engage in that type of advertising. A second difficulty will arise when people try to get a market share, for example, when people come into the profession for the first time.  Young solicitors may advertise bargain basement prices and provide a bargain basement type service. If people receive a shoddy service at present they do not have any redress and if they lose money as a result their only alternative is to take an action for negligence.  People who are victims of a shoddy service provided by a solicitor will not be disposed to consulting another solicitor, going back to court and taking an action for negligence when the outcome is doubtful and they consider the losses which they may incur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> For the first time in section 8 of this Bill we are allowing ordinary members of the public to make a complaint about such matters to the Law Society.  That will be a simple, speedy and effective remedy involving no cost for the client. If clients are unhappy with the way in which the Law Society deals with the matter they will have recourse to the independent adjudicator.  By inserting those safeguards we are justifying the fact that solicitors are allowed to advertise their services and their fees.  It is generally felt that the provision which allows solicitors in the United Kingdom to advertise their services and fees has contributed to a general reduction in fees. However, I concede it is impossible to measure that statistically and state that it is a fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the difficulties experienced by intending solicitors in obtaining apprenticeships, a number of significant proposals in the Bill address this matter.  Section 47 allows a solicitor to have two apprentices instead of one and to have one apprentice for every two assistant solicitors in his employment, with the written consent of the Law Society.  Section 44 also reduces from seven to five years the period of continuous practice required before a solicitor may take on an apprentice, but the society may agree to a shorter period.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the 1954 Act, terms of apprenticeship of up to five years may apply depending on qualifications and experience.  Section 42 reduces the period of an apprenticeship to a maximum of two years and enables the Law Society to prescribe a shorter period if it sees fit.  There is also provision in section 53 to allow apprenticeships to be served in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.  Taken together, those provisions should have a significant impact in alleviating the difficulties faced by intending solicitors in obtaining apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and Mitchell were critical of the present statutory Irish language requirement which will continue to apply to all solicitors qualifying in the State.  They argued that the compulsory <Col N="1228" /> requirement should be dropped and replaced with other arrangements to facilitate people who wish to obtain legal services in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Irish is the national language and first official language of the State.  There are, therefore, good policy reasons for retaining the statutory Irish language requirements for solicitors here.  Our courts are public institutions and it is appropriate that provision should be made to enable individuals to have their cases conducted in the Irish language.  The Constitution provides that in a case of a conflict between the texts of any copy of the Constitution the text in the national language shall prevail.  The courts have from time to time considered the Irish text of the Constitution for the purpose of elucidating the corresponding English provision.  Constitutional law is the fundamental law of the State and no study of Irish law would be complete without a knowledge of the Constitution.  Solicitors who qualify here make up the great majority of solicitors practising in the State and it is not unreasonable that they should have a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  However, I take on board the points made by Deputies Mitchell and O'Donnell that the Irish language examination which solicitors must sit is rather harmless.  I am holding discussions with members of the Law Society about provisions which will enable the Law Society to provide, sometimes compulsorily, ongoing education for solicitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell argued that it should be compulsory for all solicitors to undertake management training courses on a regular basis and that such courses should be part of the training for intending solicitors.  Deputy Wallace also spoke of the importance of continued legal education for qualified solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 49 of the Bill contains substantial amendments to section 40 of the Principal Act in regard to the education <Col N="1229" /> and training of solicitors.  It specifically provides that the Law Society may require qualified solicitors to attend further courses of education and I understand that the society intends to use these provisions.</P>
    <P>The matter of pre-qualification training in business management is an issue currently being reviewed by the Law Society.  Some training in management practices is already included in the training courses for apprentice solicitors.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that lack of management training can lead to shoddy workmanship and I urge the Law Society to ensure that intending solicitors and qualified solicitors receive adequate training in management practices and techniques.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell was very critical of the high level of fees charged by solicitors and barristers.  He called for the appointment of an independent person who would not be a lawyer to decide the levels of solicitors' and barristers' fees.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill imposes an obligation on the Law Society to examine complaints by clients about overcharging by solicitors.  Where the society finds that a bill of costs is grossly excessive they may require a solicitor to refund any fees already paid by the client or waive the right to recover fees.  This provision will not interfere with a client's right to submit a bill of costs to the Taxing Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been a number of decisions by the courts in regard to the powers of the Taxing Master to adjudicate on bills of costs.  A full review of the powers of the Taxing Master seems very desirable.  I will be considering the Taxing Master's functions in the context of legislation to amend the courts Acts which is being prepared in my Department.</P>
    <P>On the general matter of legal fees there are a number of statutes governing the payment of solicitors' costs in both contentious and non-contentious matters. For example, in contentious matters fees for party and party costs are prescribed by three separate rules' committees established by statute, one each <Col N="1230" /> for the District, Circuit and superior courts.</P>
    <P>There are also other statutory rules relating to fees for non-contentious business, particularly in respect of conveyancing. The Minister for Justice is not represented on any of those committees, although in most cases her concurrence is required in the making of rules on costs.  The repeal of existing statutory scales would require legislation to amend the rules of the various rule making bodies.  The Fair Trade Commission in its report on the legal profession considered the area of fee determination in considerable detail and made a number of recommendations for change including the abolition of rules and orders prescribing solicitors' fees for conveyancing and other non-contentious work and prescribing party costs in contentious matters. However, the commission's recommendations were not unanimous in that two members of the commission made different suggestions about the payment and control of costs.  Those recommendations are being examined and any proposals to introduce changes in that area will be announced by the Minister for Justice in the usual way.</P>
    <P>Section 68 requires solicitors to give clients an estimate of charges for legal services and will make the client's obligation to a solicitor more transparent. That section will also ensure that solicitors must account to clients for all costs recovered on their behalf from other parties. It is not intended to address the level of solicitors' fees for legal services. However, the provisions to lift the prohibition on fee advertising by solicitors will lead to greater competition in the provision of legal services and better value for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell is opposed to the wearing of wigs and gowns in court by solicitors, barristers and judges.  Deputy Gilmore was also critical of the requirement that barristers should wear wigs and gowns.  My views on court dress are well known to Members of the House.  I am not opposed to barristers wearing a simple black gown, but I am opposed to the wearing of ceremonial wigs.  Horse <Col N="1231" /> hair is something one would expect to find at a race meeting and not in court.  I have contracted the Bar Council about that matter and it has been considering the matter for two years.  The dress committee of the Bar Council has not reached a definitive conclusion yet.</P>

      <P>I urge the Bar Council to respond to this matter in the near future, otherwise we will have to take action on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell was critical that the scope of the Bill did not extend to barristers. He was strongly critical of the barristers' profession.  He advocated a fusion of the profession, as did Deputy Gilmore.  I have dealt with that matter in detail, as has the Fair Trade Commission. This is a Solicitors Bill which amends the law relating to the regulation and control of the solicitors' profession.  Deputy O'Malley rightly stated that legislation dating back to the 18th century deals with solicitors.  No legislation has been introduced to deal with barristers.  An attempt was made in 1791 or 1792 by the Lord Lieutenant of the day to provide legislation for barristers but he was not successful.  The phrase <i>nolumus mutare,</i> we are unwilling to change, originates from that time.  To that extent <i>nolumus mutare</i> still rules.  I am interested in the English Bar Council's proposals to beef up its complaints machinery to make its Bar Council more user friendly and more transparent.  I will communicate with the Bar Council in that regard this week.</P>
      <P>The appointment of solicitors as judges in higher courts is a matter which is outside the scope of the Bill.  However, it will be considered in the context of legislation to amend the Courts Acts being prepared in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne favoured a retirement age of 65 for judges and he put forward his case in his usual colourful manner. <Col N="1232" /> That matter is governed by the Courts Act and I will consider it in the context of the forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan advocated that solicitors should continue to charge fees on the basis of a specified percentage.  That matter has been referred to by Deputies on all sides.  Deputy Deenihan was dissatisfied with some of the regulatory controls in the solicitors' profession.  He stated that honest solicitors had to pay compensation for the dishonest dealings of solicitors.  That is true but I am not sure what point the Deputy wished to make.  The proposed introduction of controls has been widely applauded by Deputies on all sides, which I appreciate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen strongly opposed the time limit specified in section 15 which prevents the adjudicator from hearing a complaint once two years have elapsed. That time restriction has been provided because we did not wish the office of the adjudicator to be swamped with a flood of complaints.  That would be unfair to new complainants.  If all the people who were unhappy with the manner in which the Law Society operated during the years complained to the independent adjudicator, the adjudicator would not have time to deal with the complaints submitted following the enactment of this legislation.  The inclusion of that provision despite its appearance to the contrary, is in the consumers' interest, but if people are unhappy with a two year time restriction I am open to suggestions in that regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen was unhappy about the &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo; type of advertising. I am introducing provisions to enable the Law Society to prevent misleading and distasteful advertising which may bring the profession into disrepute.  That provision will be introduced at the request of the Law Society who assured me it intends to use that provision to the maximum to prevent such unfavourable advertising.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will deal with this Bill expeditiously.  I am confident matters will be thrashed out and I look forward to an informative and constructive <Col N="1233" /> debate on Committee Stage. Deputy O'Malley regretted that he would not able to develop some points. Although he is not a member of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security he and other Members are entitled to attend and contribute to Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the introduction of this Bill will make it mandatory for the young boys who sell the <i>Evening Echo, Evening Press</i> or the <i>Evening Herald</i> to produce a tax free certificate?  Is there anything more ludicrous than that proposal?  The Bill will require all outdoor traders, including people selling newspapers, to hold a permit.  They must have a tax clearance certificate to obtain the permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be aware of the penal tax measures here, including the highest VAT rate in Europe on the newspaper industry.  This latest madness will further threaten employment of young newspaper sellers in our cities and towns. The income of many of these young people is vital to the family budget and they have shown initiative by gaining such employment.  The Government through this proposal is stating loud and clear that initiative is not rewarded.  I <Col N="1234" /> urge the Minister to let common sense prevail and allow newspaper boys to be exempt from that provision.  The Bill is aimed at mobile traders who sell their wares throughout the country and put local traders at a disadvantage.  Let us deal with that problem but let the newspaper boys be exempt from this penal imposition.  I urge the Minister not to drop the exemptions as proposed which include the selling of agricultural and horticultural products by the producer; the selling of sweets, chocolate and so on at public events such as sports and concerts; the selling of fish by the crews that catch them and the selling of ice-cream, newspaper and pious religious objects.  At the mission in my home village of Goleen, which opened last Sunday evening, the greatest attraction for the few young people who remain in that rural parish is the stall outside the church gate from which religious objects are sold.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to penalise the youthful enthusiast who goes for a day's fishing by providing that he cannot sell his catch to the local people without having a licence or a tax free certificate? If this Bill is not directed solely at mobile traders who do immense damage to the ordinary traders of towns and villages, it will defeat its purpose.  Common sense should prevail and the exemptions I mentioned should be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I am here to make their case and defend them. Deputy Sheehan is one of the few speakers <Col N="1235" /> who showed an understanding of the real implications of the Bill.  The Bill in its present form will mark the deathknell of one of the oldest traditions in Dublin city, the tradition of Molly Malone, the street trader.  While those who support the Bill will argue that it is designed to regulate the large scale trader in profitable merchandise, its immediate effect will be to crush the weak and vulnerable street traders, the women with their stalls and prams, particularly in Dublin city, who sell fruit and vegetables, cheap jewellery, newspapers and other items with very low profit margins.</P>
      <P>If this Bill made even the slightest attempt to differentiate between the traditional stallholder/street trader and the big operators, it might have some sense of fair play and validity.  The fact that there is no distinction in this regard makes the Bill a most oppressive measure which will have serious social consequences for the hardest working sections of some of the poorest communities in the State, particularly in the inner city areas of Dublin.  If the Bill becomes law, many of the most decent people struggling to supplement inadequate social welfare payments will be driven into a poverty trap.  The media reports on the Bill already caused great distress, particularly to elderly women, widows and pensioners who firmly believe that it will force them out of a traditional way of life handed down to them by their mothers and grandmothers. The Moore Street stallholders, the heart of street trading in Dublin, believe it will destroy the long-standing selling of fruit and vegetables and will result in their street being taken over by a more profitable high-tech, business dominated activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Christmas Arnott's senior management attempted to displace the traditional Christmas street sellers in Henry Street.  The big city stores have tried for years to get rid of the Christmas street traders and, having failed, they attempted to take over the street and expand their operations onto the footpath in an unashamed and outrageous <Col N="1236" /> manner, unconcerned with the effects on the families they displaced, who have depended on Christmas street trading for years to supplement very low incomes. Big stores failed on that occasion due to the efforts of a small group of city councillors, including myself.  On several occasions the affluent businesses in Grafton Street tried to get rid of the few women flower sellers there.  This Bill is part of that strategy.  It serves the interests of big business in Dublin city and completely ignores the rights and social circumstances of those families and individuals who eke out a living on the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>One of the principal provisions in the Bill is that before a trader can obtain or renew a street trader's licence a tax clearance certificate must be produced. The elderly women in Moore Street who spent their lives dealing in pennies and shillings, running up and down to the markets, are in no position to keep accounts, invoices and receipts, not to talk of employing accountants.  This is simply not practical for most women stallholders and street traders.  It is bureaucratic ineptitude and is out of touch with the realities of trying to earn a living selling cabbages or apples from a stall on the side of the street.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Department of Finance will make suitable arrangements to ensure that no casual trader is refused a tax clearance certificate, but are the Minister's assurances worth the paper they are written on?  I very much doubt it.  The Bill, once enacted, will oblige the unfortunate street trader to do precisely the same as the other categories who require tax clearance certificates to obtain licences.  When I contacted the Revenue Commissioners I was told that the only categories so obliged are publicans, restaurant owners, petrol-fuel suppliers, road haulage contractors and bookies, big, profitable businesses who employ accountants and other professional services.  The Minister is proposing to force women in Moore Street who sell sprouts to do the same.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a farce.  There can be no comparison between lucrative business <Col N="1237" /> operations and casual street traders and stallholders.  The Bill is seriously flawed because it does not attempt to differentiate between large scale traders and traditional stallholders, who are worlds apart.  This Bill will drive the poorer street trader who sells low cost perishable goods out of business.  How many times have Members argued that workers on very low incomes have little or no incentive to stay at work, that they are better off on social welfare?  This Bill will send out the message that one is better off doing nothing than trying to supplement one's income from street trading.  The people of Moore Street are not saying they will not pay their fair share; they are saying they want to be left as they are, that they have already put more into the economy than they will ever get out of it. The Government should tax the rich, the property speculators, the big financial companies and big farmers.  Instead, it gives tax incentives and tax amnesties to the rich and greedy in society and is attempting to strangle the poor with excessive, draconian measures such as this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the Minister is behind this measure &mdash; I do not know whether he is &mdash; I am saying he should withdraw, defer or amend the Bill to prevent what I have referred to from happening.  There is no doubt that big business has been campaigning for this measure for many years, but it is surely an outrage and a great shame that it is the Labour Party, in coalition with Fianna Fáil, who is bringing in this measure at the behest of a wealthy business class.  I appeal to the Minister not to put this Bill to a vote but to withdraw it, or at least adjourn further consideration of it until it can be reintroduced in a more acceptable form.</P>
    <P>Street traders, many of whom voted for the Labour Party in the last general election, were not even paid the courtesy of being consulted when the Bill was being drafted.  Instead they were met by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and told their fate, whether or not they liked it.  It is significant that in his lengthy introductory <Col N="1238" /> speech the Minister never once referred to his visit to Moore Street.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Finance met Moore Street stallholders early this morning but the Casual Traders' Association of Ireland was not consulted when the Bill was being drafted, despite assurances from the Department of Enterprise and Employment that its views would be taken into account.  The association points out that the Bill goes too far in providing that a casual trader can only work after obtaining a tax clearance certificate.  What other sections of workers are denied the right to work in this manner?  Contrast this with the tax amnesties for the very wealthy who have defrauded the State for years.</P>
    <P>The provision that the local authority must report the names and addresses of the holders of casual trading licences to the Department of Social Welfare is tantamount to casting a slur on hard working people.  The implication of this provision is clear: it amounts to placing these traders under suspicion until such time as they prove they are innocent.  Farmers who receive grants and special payments are not simiarly investigated prior to payment. Will the Minister outline the other categories of licence holders to which this requirement applies?</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the reply of the Minister for Justice to Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 8 February 1994 in which I asked if there was liaison between her Department, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners regarding known drug dealers who are purchasing houses, new cars and other such items while continuing to claim social welfare benefits.  The Minister replied that all information given to the Garda or which comes to its notice during the course of a criminal investigation is confidential and that a conviction is a matter of public record to which all State agencies have access.  The position is clear &mdash; there is no obligation to report the activities of a convicted drug pusher to the Department of Social Welfare; his record is available should the Department wish to investigate him. Under this Bill the names and addresses <Col N="1239" /> of street traders must be reported to the Department of Social Welfare.  If that does not show a farcical element in the Bill I do not know what does.</P>
    <P>Street trading in Dublin city is a way of life.  Elderly widows and pensioners are now living in fear that if they help out at a stall for a few hours, as they have since they were children, they will lose their entitlements.  The Bill is causing unnecessary distress to these people.  Its measures are seriously discriminatory, could be unconstitutinal and will kill a way of life.  The Labour Party will have been instrumental in destroying the most traditional lifestyle of the working class people of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Furthermore draconian provisions are directed against those victims of the 1980 Casual Trading Act who, even though they have licences from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, are deemed to be illegal because they have no designated trading spots and are, therefore, refused permits by the local authority.  These people, mainly women, who have spent their lives working as casual street traders were excluded under the 1980 Act because they were not organised and were unaware of the implications of the Act; they were ignored and denied designated spots from which to trade.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the illegal street trader is usually a woman who has sold goods on the street for decades and who is refused a trading pitch because big businesses in the city do not want stallholders operating on the streets.  When Dublin Corporation and the city council attempted to designate pitches, the city centre business organisation orchestrated campaigns against them.  When the corporation refused to be intimidated in designating Cole's Lane off Henry Street, big businesses appealed the democratic decision of the city council before the courts.  After a delay of several years, the courts upheld the corporation's proposals. As a result, a dozen or so elderly women now have a refuge from the police vans and Store Street Garda Station.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a further product of the <Col N="1240" /> influence of big business on Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.  It is shameful that a Labour Minister should do the dirty work of the business class and bully the poorest of our people off the streets of their city, which will be the effect of this Bill.  In a city where drug pushers sell drugs openly and unhindered on the streets, it is appallingly unjust that women who sell apples and flowers, including the red roses associated with the Labour Party, should be bundled into Garda vans, have their flowers scattered in the gutter and be humiliated in Garda stations, the District Court and Mountjoy prison.  It is little wonder that the drug problem and the level of crime in Dublin is out of control.</P>
    <P>If this degrading humiliation was not enough the Minister has proposed new initiatives which will further humiliate Dublin women street traders.  Section 13 (1), (2) and (3) provides that the flowers and produce of street traders can be confiscated by gardaí and only those traders who can afford to pay for the costs of confiscation, transport to the Garda station and administration can have their flowers returned to them.  Traders who cannot afford to pay these costs will lose their livelihoods for the following few days.  Who cares about this?  Such is the reality behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 (1) (a) and (b) a street trader who is brought to court can be fined from £1,000 to £10,000 and £500 a day thereafter and-or six months imprisonment for following in the tradition of her family and forebears.  I am sure we will be told that these are maximum fines which will not apply to flower sellers. That is what we were told about the maximum fine of £500 under the 1980 Act, yet it was applied to flower sellers. When flower sellers could not afford to pay this fine they were sent to Mountjoy Prison.  The same will happen under this Bill.</P>
    <P>These fines are far more severe than the fines imposed for the possession of drugs.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, the maximum fine on summary conviction for a first offence is £300 while the maximum fine on conviction on indictment <Col N="1241" /> is £1,000 while under this Bill the maximum fine which can ge imposed on a street trader is £10,000 or, on summary conviction, £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen fit to retain the harshest aspect of the 1980 Act under which a person who sells apples, etc. without a permit can be denied a licence for five years.  This provision is so harsh that its constitutionality was challenged in the Supreme Court.  It is noteworthy that when Dublin Corporation finally got the permission of the courts to designate Cole's Lane for street trading it was unable to allocate spaces, as established elderly women traders, whom corporation officals knew were most entitled to the spaces, all had convictions for illegal street trading.  The corporation waited a number of years before allocating the spaces to ensure that the most deserving and longest serving women traders could occupy the spaces.</P>
    <P>Under this harsh measure a woman trader who has paid two fines of £5 &mdash; the judge may have been in a good mood &mdash; will be effectively denied her livelihood for a further five years.  If any thought had been put into this measure it might have been amended so that a licence would be withheld for one or two years in cases where two or more maximum fines had been applied.  I am not necessarily advocating such an amendment as once people are convicted and fined a further penalty should not be imposed.</P>
    <P>The only just way to regulate casual trading in Dublin city is to assess the number of genuine traditional street traders and provide a small number of trading pitches on each shopping street to cater for them.  This could be done, but it would require the good will of the business community in particular.  The Minister should tell the business community that this problem must be resolved and that it cannot be resolved by driving women off the streets of this city into prison, which seems to be the intention in this Bill.  If the Minister is prepared to set this Bill aside he could obtain the agreement of members of the business <Col N="1242" /> community in the city and resolve this problem amicably once and for all.</P>
    <P>The tax clearance certificate requirement for traders such as the stall holders in Moore Street must be abolished.  It is simply farcical to expect women to change their lifestyles in that manner.  It would be of considerable help in alleviating poverty in the city and would remove any need for the appalling waste of Garda resources whose manpower and time is spent out of all proportion on this activity.  It is a public scandal that Garda resources are wasted on chasing women and bundling them into vans for selling apples and flowers when we have such a serious crime problem in Dublin city.  It is on this problem that the bulk of Garda resources from Store Street Garda Station and other city centre Garda stations is spent.  Legal pitches could be provided for the genuine traditional street trader and would be far more effective in eliminating illegal trading than the draconian measures in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the implications of this Bill and to consult the various interests involved, the stall holders, the so-called &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; street traders, traditional women who are as entitled to a pitch as anybody else, and the business people who have attempted for so long to destroy the livelihood of these women, to come up with a solution to the serious problem confronting women street traders, before proceeding with any new casual trading Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold a different view from that of Deputy Gregory for reasons which I will explain.  I appreciate fully that there is a specific problem with the stall holders to whom Deputy Gregory referred.  I often walked about the Moore Street area and bought some of the street traders' produce.  I realise such trading is a traditional part of the Dubin city life but it is a tradition that is rather unique to Dublin. <Col N="1243" /> There are adequate provisions in this Bill to allow the local authorities to regulate their affairs more freely.  The 1980 Bill created more problems than it solved. Not only in Dublin but also in some provincial towns and cities.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to decentralise the operation of markets and casual street traders and this can be dealt with by the local authority members who have a better understanding of the operation of the various types of trading.  Drogheda market which dates back to the 13th century is probably one of the oldest and largest markets of any provincial town here.  That market is now uncontrolled and the provisions of this Bill will allow Drogheda Corporation to regulate it fairly for street traders and other traders such as small businessmen who are the backbone of the local authority's financial support.  I am not talking about the Ben Dunnes or the large stores now located in towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk but the person who may use his redundancy plus borrowings to set up a small business in Drogheda, Dundalk or any other provincial town.  He invests all his money in the business, only to find that one day a street trader has set up a stall on the side of the road selling similar goods to those he sells.  That small businessman provides employment for a number of people, he must produce all his tax certificates for PRSI and PAYE purposes, he must register the people employed by him and pay substantial rates.  Very often small businessmen are put out of business because of high operating costs.  In urban areas, the backbone of the administration of the local authority is the shopkeeper.  He pays the money to the local authority for the bulk of the services for the local community. He also provides the bulk of employment in the wholesale and retail trade, not only in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest as Deputy Gregory did that this Bill relates to casual trading primarily in Moore Street, is wrong.  I assure the Deputy and the Minister that this Bill will receive the overwhelming support of all the representative bodies in the towns in <Col N="1244" /> Louth.  I expect the same pattern will emerge throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A farcical situation now exists in Drogheda where casual traders simply pull up at the side of the main street, open up their wagons or trailers and sell produce such as that sold in the shops. In addition, other traders are sending children to sell produce such as potatoes, onions and flowers on the footpaths which obstructs people moving up and down the main street.  This practice is creating traffic jams and is also a potential fire hazard because people may be unable to get out of the stores in the event of fire breaking out because of the obstruction created by the street traders.  That is the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of people trade in the market in Drogheda.  The corporation must bring in their workers &mdash; on overtime &mdash; to clean up after casual traders have vacated the various pitches.  They have very large trailers, lorries and stalls, some of which would not be acceptable in an organised market.</P>
    <P>As a member of two local authorities I visited a number of markets in the United Kingdom regulated by the relevant local authorities, each pitch being marked and clearly numbered.  Traders must apply to the relevant local authority and, when licensed, are allocated a particular pitch and number for that year.  They must enter these markets before starting time, unload goods from their wagons or lorries, put them on their stalls and then take their vehicles out of the market area. There is provision elsewhere for parking those vehicles.  That allows for an orderly market so that people can walk between the rows of stalls and examine the goods for sale.</P>
    <P>In our markets, some casual traders come in very early in the morning and squabble over the pitches, two or three lorries are parked in the middle of a market area without any control.  Many casual traders sell goods not traditionally sold in a market.  In the markets in my constituency previously the small farmer sold free range eggs, country butter and vegetables which comprised the bulk of the market produce.  Now there are all <Col N="1245" /> sorts of high-powered salespeople operating under the umbrella of casual trading which has led to very unfair competition for other traders who must put their money into the creation of employment and running their small businesses; they are not all Ben Dunnes or high-powered supermarkets, the bulk of people who operate within the business community in my constituency are ordinary working class people trying to make a living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome this Bill because its provisions will eliminate many of the weaknesses of the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  There are a number of detailed provisions I might examine but perhaps it would be more appropriate to do so on Committee Stage.  Some of the points made by Deputy Gregory had merit. For example, the penalties may be too great in the case of some of the categories to which he referred.</P>
    <P>Casual traders come here from the United Kingdom to all main town centres and hire a ballroom in a local hotel, a community centre, hall or other accomodation. They import carpets and furniture in huge quantities and compete with other traders who must pay their overheads and taxes.  They trade on Saturdays and Sundays and will have left by Monday morning without paying tax or insurance or giving employment.  I have received many complaints about this yet the Garda Síochána and local authorities were powerless under the provisions of the 1980 Act to move against them.  The penalties to be imposed under the provisions of this Bill are designed to tackle that problem; the provisions of this Bill will give the Garda Síochána and local authorities power to control these cowboys.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to operate markets properly because the people who trade in them will not pay the normal market fee.  For example, thousands of pounds are outstanding in the Drogheda market where the fee is a minimal weekly one, yet 75 per cent of traders refuse to pay. When taken to court by the local authority and fined £10 one trader's defence was that he was growing Spanish onions <Col N="1246" /> in his back garden.  The loopholes in the 1980 Act did not allow the courts to deal with this activity in a fair and proper manner.  I am not sure whether, in some cases, the penalties to be imposed are not too great, particularly in the case of the category about which Deputy Gregory spoke.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the section dealing with alternative facilities but, since I have agreed to share my time with Deputy Michael Kitt, perhaps I should leave my comments on the various sections to Committee Stage when I shall be tabling amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bell for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The decision to devolve the licensing function of casual trading to local authorities is a form of decentralisation I wholeheartedly welcome &mdash; and the power being given to local authorities to make by-laws &mdash; since they are the proper authority to enforce the law and can readily do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Street or market trading has been one of the lifelines of many towns in the west. One licensed trader &mdash; the type of person Deputy Bell said pays his taxes and rates &mdash; expressed the view to me that it is better to have people come into the town. Under the provisions of this Bill, if properly licensed, such activity will add life to towns.  Indeed that is the case in many small rural towns, because people who come into the markets will spend their money in shops and premises.  Of course, this carries inherent problems, not alone the question of unfair competition but the problem of litter.  It is my understanding that the authorities in many towns are now endeavouring to deal with this litter problem.  For example, one of the tidiest towns in my constituency, Mount Bellew, holds a very successful market each Tuesday, an example of a town which has geared itself to market and street trading.  The bishops in the west &mdash; reiterated in their booklet <i>Crusade for Survival</i>&mdash; have always tried to develop in smaller towns a project or focus on further development, which has been done in the case of Mount Bellew <Col N="1247" /> through the co-operative movement. Towns are fighting the ravages of unemployment and emigration in many cases through holding very successful markets.</P>
    <P>The real problem for many casual traders is caused not so much by the licensing laws but by the relevant health regulations which have prevented some people from providing even home-made brown bread to markets because the Department of Health and relevant health boards might request the maker of such brown bread to build a new kitchen for the purpose.  I understand that the Minister for Health and his Minister of State are reviewing the health regulations, I hope they will do so very quickly.  Under the provisions of this Bill I understand exemptions will apply to brown bread, horticultural and agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme in Mayo has been very successful.  A feature of the first programme was that areas could benefit from grant assistance, although grants could not be given by the IDA or the county enterprise boards.  It is interesting to note that the Leader programme has taken over the issuing of grant assistance where other bodies fall short.  When the second Leader programme is announced I hope east Galway will be included because it is already in the local partnership programme.  It is important not to hinder the development of that programme by introducing new regulations. Its success in Mayo has been evident in agricultural produce such as country butter, cheeses, free range eggs and poultry. I am glad that agricultural and horticultural produce will not be affected by this Bill.  If we are to help people through the Leader programme we cannot put obstacles in their way.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to say those few words on the Bill.  I welcome it and I hope local authorities will implement the legislation fairly.  I shall speak on some of the detailed provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, Sir, so far as I can see is entirely characteristic of this <Col N="1248" /> Government.  Whenever there are several possible ways of doing something worthwhile this Government hauls out its bureaucratic socialist sledgehammer. There was a time when the Minister, who looks amused, had an affectionate nickname.  If he does not mind my saying it, he used to be called Ho Chi Quinn. When I watch what this Government is at and look at a Bill like this, I think we should modernise and update his nickname and call him Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Quinn.</P>
      <P>This Bill starts off with a good idea.  It rests on the idea that we should give to local authorities the powers to make by-laws to regulate the business of casual trading in their areas.  That is a good idea and is perfectly in keeping with the good Christian Democrat principle of subsidiarity, which the Minister would not recognise because he does not believe in it.  Neither the Labour Party nor the Fianna Fáil Party believes in it.  They will allow the local authorities to regulate so long as they regulate in the way they lay down.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to what my colleagues, Deputy Gregory and Deputy Sheehan, have been saying about this Bill.  They have put their finger on the central fault of this Bill by pointing out that it treats all casual trading as if it were the same kind of operation.  It treats the seller of newspapers, flowers in the same way that it treats the travelling caravan that goes around the country devastating areas, and sometimes terrorising people, every summer.  They take out this huge sledgehammer to make sure things are done the way they think they ought to be done, without any regard as to people's views on casual trading.  Has the Minister stopped to think what the ordinary citizen thinks about casual trading? I like casual trading.  I like the atmosphere when casual traders are around.  I like the buzz they bring to an area.  I like the repartee and craic with them.  This Bill does not recognise any of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill starts off from the totally bureaucratic point of view that there is an activity here that we should regulate.  They take credit for the democracy of allowing the local authorities to regulate it but they treat all casual trading in the same way.  They tell the local authorities to regulate it the way they want it regulated and no other way.  That is wrong.</P>
      <P>The important sections of the Bill &mdash; sections 2, 3 4 and 7 &mdash; are drafted in such a way that local authorities have no flexibility to regulate or to make different provisions for different kinds of casual trading.  Unless those sections are substantially modified this Bill will be a straitjacket and will not do anything worthwhile for casual trading.  I am confirmed in that view by listening to Deputy Gregory.  I know the problem Deputy Gregory sees in Dublin.  He is very much to the fore in defending the interests of those people.  The problem he is dealing with in Dublin is very different from the problem of casual trading in the Thursday morning market in Kildare.  They are as different as chalk and cheese.  They will not be dealt with properly by a Bill that says there is only one form of casual trading.</P>
      <P>I am worried about a provision in the Bill that allows the Minister to change the definition of &ldquo;casual trading&rdquo;.  It allows him either to expand or to narrow the range that will be considered as casual trading.  For some strange reason, a subsection in the same section allows local authorities only to narrow the range that will be regarded as casual trading.  I do not know the reason for that subsection. I do not know the reason the Minister should keep powers if he is serious about handing over the regulation of casual trading to local authorities.  Once a bureacrat, always a bureaucrat.  Once a Leninist, always a Leninist, and once this Minister has his hands on anything he will not let go without a major revolution.</P>

      <P>Put that on a cartoon and <Col N="1250" /> let us see what you make of it.  This Bill has only one thing to recommend it, that is that it decides to give certain tasks to local authorities.  In doing that it misses a great many points, a few of which I would like to mention.  Why are town commissioners excluded from the list of local authorities allowed to make by-laws? There is no obvious reason.  Since the Government has completely abdicated on any ambition it had about properly reorganising urban local authorities, we will still have town commissioners.  I see no reason the town commissioners of Newbridge, for example, cannot make by-laws to regulate or to provide for casual trading.  I do not like the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo;.  I am in favour of the minimum possible regulation but the Minister has a totally different view.  I see no reason that cannot be done in Newbridge when it is done in Athy.  In the town of Kildare we have to rely on Kildare County Council because we have no town authority in Kildare.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (4) which deals with prosecutions is a curious provision.  I have not seen a provision like this drafted in this way before.  It provides that in a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1), it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the person being prosecuted was not the holder of a casual trading licence.  I do not know if that is in keeping with the way we do business here or with the Constitution but it is perfectly in keeping with the bureaucratic mania of which the Minister is such an expert exponent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 deals with licences.  It appears that a local authority will be able to give a casual trading licence for its whole area if it does not have designated casual trading areas.  If the person wants to trade in more than one location in the local authority's area the person will have to <Col N="1251" /> make several applications and get several casual trading licences.  It would mean a person who wanted to trade in the market in Kildare on a Thursday, the market in Athy on a Tuesday morning and the big market outside Athy on a Sunday would have to have three separate casual trading licences.  That is pushing democracy to the limits of absurdity.  I do not see why someone must go through all that palaver in order to carry out casual trading.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (5) appears to allow a local authority to ration out spaces in designated areas.  Will local authorities have to operate on the basis of first come first served?  Is there a provision for newcomers? Subsection (6) states that a local authority may refuse to grant a casual trading licence to a person who has been convicted of an offence in relation to the importation, possession or sale of goods committed while he was the holder of a casual trading licence during the period of five years before the date of application for the licence.  If one transgresses the law one may not engage in casual trading for five years.  There are very few parts of our law which go so hard on people and deprive them of their way of life for five years.  That is an extreme provision.  If one takes that in conjunction with section 3 (4) one will see that the thrust of the Bill is extremely oppressive.  It is going too far.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the powers of local authorities in the acquisition of market rights and extinguishment.  A local authority may compulsorily acquire a market right in its area.  Why does the Minister want to provide for that?  I do not mind them acquiring market rights in their area by agreement but why compulsorily? There is no evident reason local authorities should interfere if there is a market right that is being exercised.</P>

      <P>Do not try that out on me &mdash; it is coming the old soldier too much.  A local authority may extinguish a market right only if it provides an alternative location in the same area.  Why do we have all the palaver in section 8 if the only reason for it is to allow the local authority some choice in deciding one area is more appropriate for casual trading activities than another?  Why have the giving of notice, the extinguishment of market rights, the taking of representations from people who have an interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes for nice, long, bureaucratic, tortuous procedure and that is the way the Labour Party's mind seems to work.  In section 9 (4) (a) (i) a local authority which wants to extinguish a right in order to replace it with something else is required to give notice in writing of the proposal to any person appearing to the authority to have an interest in the right.  What does that mean?  Who might these persons be whom the local authority would consider to have an interest in the right?  Would they be stallholders, those with licences, those who trade there, those who like to buy there or those who just go to look around?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I am physically and in other ways a more prominent citizen in Kildare than others but if Kildare County Council wanted to extinguish a market right in Athy and move it from Emily Square to some other location they would not necessarily ask me, yet I have an interest in the matter.  It seems I would have to rely on my own perspicacity to see the notice published in the newspaper and make representations to the council.  If the object of the procedure is to allow the local authority to decide that one area <Col N="1253" /> is more suitable than a traditional area why do we have to go through all this nonsense?</P>
    <P>Is there not a simpler way to do this? Would the Minister agree to go back to the drawing board with the Bill and reflect on sections 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 and see if there is not a less oppressive way of doing the one good thing which the Bill does, that is, allow local authorities make bye-laws.  He should give them elbow room and leeway and allow them decide what we all know &mdash; there are different kinds of casual trading.  Let us not have this nonsense go solidly through a committee where amendments will be moved and where the Minister will feel he cannot alter any of the Bill because if he does so he would destroy his lovely bureaucratic construct.  It is madness to go through a Bill with 18 sections, including penalty provisions, in order to regulate casual trading.</P>
    <P>Casual trading adds colour to our towns, cities and surrounding areas. There is a market in Kildare which moves around.  It used to be in the Curragh and now it is near Athy.  It is great sport to visit it on Sunday afternoon.  The Minister should go there some day and I am sure with his personality he will be a success.  I have gone there umpteen times and one meets people from Tipperary, Waterford and Cork who go to the market for a bit of diversion.  They will not necessarily buy anything but they come to enjoy the craic.  This Bill will take all the spontaneity out of such occasions.  I challenge the Minister to look at the section that requires people who have a casual trading licence to display it on their stall in a place visible to the public.  I defy the Minister to show me how a stallholder selling shirts, shoes, jeans and working overalls will find a place on the stall where he can hang up a copy of the licence and be sure that it will be seen by the public, for example on a windy day it will be obscured most of the time by things blowing in front of it.  There is no space on which to fix the notice to the wall so that the public can see it.  Anyway, the public has not the slightest interest in seeing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> The Minister should look at the Bill with a view to ensuring the job can be done with a minimum of regulations and interference.  He should give up this daft Leninist approach of regulating everything in sight and introduce sensible proposals in keeping with casual trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of taking power from Government Departments and giving it to the local authorities, where it should be.  There is a great deal of unnecessary duplication in the present set-up and the Bill is trying to bring order and control into casual trading.</P>
      <P>I accept that if we are vesting powers in the local authority we should leave it to them to introduce the regulations but it may be necessary to guide them and standardise the regulations.  The problem arises because there are many different types of casual traders and Members are influenced by personal experience.  The main problem raised at Dublin City Council meetings is that the business people are in business 52 weeks of the year on good and bad days, they pay rates and taxes and have unfair competition from casual traders.  Against that, the traditional Dublin street trader is an old woman and it is hard to agree to a Bill that is too bureaucratic.  Dublin Corporation has tried to solve the problem but the demand for pitches seems to exceed the supply and I do not know if it is possible to satisfy it.  We do not want to turn the city into a little Bombay and there must be certain rules and regulations.  I support street trading but it must be controlled by regulation.</P>
      <P>Not all street traders are in business in a small way and the flower sellers at the junction of Grafton Street are in business in a big way.  The corporation has tried valiantly to contain them within their designated pitch but they keep spreading.  A truck comes to remove the flowers every evening and delivers them every morning and they operate a sizeable operation.</P>

      <P>They may well be.  I <Col N="1255" /> do not object to the regulation of such traders.</P>
      <P>The City Centre Business Association seem to devote too much time and attention to trying to rid the streets of the problem as they see it and it is difficult to understand why the gardaí pay so much attention to those selling a bit of fruit or chocolate on the street.  It is an extraordinary sight to see them scurrying in all directions.  It is draconian that a casual trader could be banned from trading for five years if he committed two or more offences and the 1980 Act seems out of step with legislation dealing with bigger operations.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Bill could define or categorise street traders.  Certainly the Dublin street traders are very different from those who travel to different market towns every day of the week. That is big business and it is only right and proper that they pay their taxes and prove that they are doing so.  I agree with Deputy Bell it is wrong that casual traders pull up in front of a shop and sell the same produce as the shop.  That is creaming the market.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government policies that discriminate againt home ownership, with particular reference to the budgetary changes curbing mortgage tax relief and the extension of the residential property tax; and furthermore calls on the Government to adhere to the policy of successive Governments of supporting families in providing their own homes.</P>

    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 February 1994, as reported in column 1530, Volume 438 of the Official Report, I said in the course of the debate on the budget that the Progressive Democrats would participate in an all-party select committee to examine the financing of local government.  A similar offer was put to the House by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1989. I repeated that offer last night but, unfortunately, it has been cold shouldered.  I said in February, and repeated last night, that the Progressive Democrats reject the residential property tax.  This party intends to bring the issue to the voters at the earliest available opportunity and ask the electorate to reject the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objections to the residential property tax are ten fold.  First, it is not a general tax; most people will not pay it but the means of many of those who will have to pay it will be far less than the means of those who will not have to pay it.  Second, the proceeds are not allocated to local government.  The residential property tax is a second income tax levied on those whose incomes and assets fall into arbitrary categories decided on random criteria such as location, age, family membership and health.  Third, it is a tax on honesty.  Nothing is as volatile, unpredictable and subjective as a selfassessed <Col N="1258" /><i>ad valorum</i> tax on the home. Fourth, it is anti-family.  If four members of a family each earn £10,000, which is well below the average industrial wage, and live in one house worth £150,000 they will have to pay a substantial amount in residential property tax but if they live in two houses worth £75,000 they will not have to pay anything.  Therefore, members of families with the same low incomes and asset values will pay huge sums in one house and nothing in two houses.</P>
    <P>Fifth, it is anti-urban and anti-Dublin. Identical households with identical homes in different parts of the country will pay radically different amounts. Sixth, it is arbitrary.  If a husband and wife jointly own two houses each worth £75,000 they may pay a large sum in tax but if one house is in the name of one spouse and the other is in the name of the other spouse they may pay no tax.</P>
    <P>Seventh, it does not form part of a programme of tax reform.  The Minister told the House last night that he has no plans to extend the tax.  Therefore it is not capable of providing tax reform and has no serious effect on the income tax take which, as Deputy Yates pointed out, will increase by £20 million as a result of the budget.  Eighth, it is an ideological tax.  The Labour Party has consistently published tax policies which show an intention to impose residential property tax at the rate of 2 per cent or 3 per cent on all homes except on those whom it thinks mistakenly will vote Labour.</P>
    <P>Ninth, it was widened in direct contradiction of a clear political promise given by the Labour Party in leaflet form to the voters of Dublin in response to a claim by their partners in Government, Fianna Fáil, that it intended to widen the tax in this manner.  Tenth, it is a penal and destructive tax in terms of its effect on home building and the buying and selling of houses.  The effect of the penal 2 per cent on more valuable homes will be to depress home building and inhibit home improvement to an extent which in the last analysis will cost much more than the yield from residential property tax in lost stamp duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> It is a dead letter as a tax and should have been opposed much more vigorously at an earlier stage by a number of Members.  We have to live with it until it is repealed.  I suggest that it should be repealed at the earliest available opportunity. Deputy Lawlor argued last night that the intention was to create a revenue base for local government but I suggest that that is a separate issue.  The Progressive Democrats pledges itself to participate in determining a suitable alternative to the residential property tax.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in relation to the taxation of land.  The land tax came and went.  A derelict sites tax was imposed by statute but I have yet to hear of one person who has paid a halfpenny to the Exchequer or anybody announcing the yield from this tax.  I do not know the reason for this; it may be that the registration of derelict sites has been retarded due to bureaucratic laziness but it seems that the system of commercial rates is vindictive and penalises those who make good use of the land they own and at the same time rewards those who allow dereliction and under-utilisation of their land.</P>
    <P>In this context is it right to ignore the potential, as a tax base, of houses let in multiple units for occupation and of zoned land which is the subject of planning permission for development purposes? When dealing with the family home this is a small-minded, negative and obnoxious tax which has been designed to be ideological, to raise the least possible yield and to have the greatest possible political effect.  Those who have supported it will pay the political price.  It is not seen by the electorate, rightly so, as a major ingredient of tax reform.  The Minister has announced concessions which will reduce the total yield by 40 per cent.  How could this sum make any impact on tax reform, employment and so on?  In refusing to say whether he will extend the tax in any way the Minister is admitting that it is a show piece tax which has been put in place by the Labour Party in particular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> I was surprised when I read that the Labour Party intended to impose a 2 per cent tax on family homes above the value of £50,000 and a 3 per cent tax on homes over the value of £75,000 or £100,000, depending on which documents one reads.  These proposals are foolish.  If the name of the game is, as Deputy Lawlor suggested last night, the imposition of a new revenue-gathering base for local government, the time has come for politicians on all sides of this House to admit it and set in train a process to bring it about.  This tax will not suffice and while the Government parties insist that it should remain in place it will be opposed and cause extreme damage to those who support it.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Callely, Eoin Ryan and Éamon Walsh.  In my 21 years in this House both in Government and Opposition I have discovered that in putting down questions or resolutions to be debated in the House one should be careful to retain some credibility in the context of one's words as against one's actions.  Here is a motion by Deputy John Bruton condemning the Government policies that discriminate against home ownership, with particular reference to budgetary changes covering mortgage tax relief and the extension of the residential property tax.  That is all very well, but it was Deputy Bruton who supported Deputy Dukes when he introduced the residential property tax with our present temporary partners.</P>

      <P>It is ludicrous that Fine Gael should criticise the residential property tax and organise meetings of rightly concerned property and home owners.  It is no wonder that Fine Gael is suffering in the opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell of the Progressive Democrats spoke about the property tax. We have heard for a long time that the Progressive Democrats were in favour of reforming taxation.  In the background was the idea that to do that there would have to be a property tax.  Now they are opposed to the residential property tax.</P>
      <P>I have been consistent.  I do not like the residential property tax.  It is a measure that, on its own, would adversely affect property ownership. However, our Minister has listened carefully to the views put forward by the Fianna Fáil backbenchers about this property tax and the problems it will create, particularly in Dublin, and he has made major changes to the proposal announced in the budget in January last. Those changes, together with major changes in taxation, will help middle income earners.  That is to be welcomed and I congratulate the Minister on what he has done.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the improvements made in 1993 and about what will happen in 1994.  I welcome that and I appeal for job creation as a consequence of those improvements.  However, the world did not begin at the beginning of 1993.  Again I come back to Deputy Bruton's motion.  Deputy Bruton was the Minister for Finance in the last Fine Gael-Labour Government when the national debt was doubled and inflation was rampant. Fianna Fáil got into Government in 1987 and tackled those issues and laid the foundations on which the progress we see today was built.  I encourage the Minister and his colleagues to tackle unemployment so that when we next face the public in a general election we will be able to say that we have tackled that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the height of hypocrisy for Fine Gael to put down a motion condemning property tax, having introduced it with <Col N="1262" /> Labour in Government.  It is a bit much to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate.  My views on residential property tax are well known.  So far in the debate there has been blatant hypocrisy by all political parties.  I refer specifically to the actions of the Opposition and their political propaganda in recent elections relating to additional takes by way of residential property tax and other such proposals to fund local authorities. It is sad to see the hypocrisy of Opposition Deputies objecting to residential property tax when their own parties introduced or supported the principle at a time when we have one of the best budgets ever with, for a change, a long term strategy and the economy on the right track.  In the context of overall budgetary structure and expenditure, the additional take from the residential property tax is but a drop in the ocean.  We are losing sight of our target when so much debate and attention is focused on one aspect of the budget and I regret that the Opposition parties are focusing to such an extent on it.</P>
      <P>I was happy to raise the question of the residential property tax at my parliamentary party meeting when we discussed the budget in detail.  I raised it because of the anomalies and inequities of the tax itself.  I do not want to argue about whose tax it is, whether it was put forward by one party in Government or by the other.  I would very much like to see the tax totally abolished, but it is my understanding that that is not possible. When Fianna Fáil Deputies highlighted the anomalies and inequities in it, the Minister took a very pragmatic approach. We were pleased that the Minister took the time to meet us, took on board the recommendations made by the Members and acted on them.  We are familiar with Ministers taking notes and throwing them in the dustbin when they walk out the door.  On this occasion the Minister's pragmatic response was to indicate he would accommodate our suggestions and act on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister indicated in <Col N="1263" /> his amendment that he will address the glaring anomalies in the scheme.  I am concerned at the Minister's reference to investment in homes and that people should invest in other risk ventures to create employment.  That does not apply when referring to the value of a person's home.  Many people invested a relatively small amount of money in their family home and were not in a position to make a similar investment in a risk-taking opportunity to create employment.  That matter should be clarified.  It is possible that a person who owns a home valued at, say, £200,000 may have bought it ten or 20 years ago at a cost of £20,000. That was the amount of money they had available to them with the assistance of a financial institution to invest in a family home but because of the increasing value of property or the geographical location of the house its price could have escalated to a value which they cannot realise because it is their family home.  The value of a person's home is not disposable and cannot be invested in a risk venture for employment purposes.  Those sentiments have been expressed to me by a number of people and money is not available for risk ventures to create employment.  Will the Minister indicate the monetary alterations the changes before us will make to the £5 million additional take which will give a total take of £14 million in 1994?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that this aspect of the budget has received so much attention. This year's budget was the best ever introduced in the House in terms of long term strategy.  The economy is ticking over and the Opposition parties are jealous.</P>

      <P>Since 1987 Fianna Fáil has taken on board some necessary and courageous moves to put the economy on the right road.  From 1989 to 1992, in coalition with the Progressive Democrats, further developments were made by the Fianna Fáil-led Administration.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy's absence from the House at that time was the reason it was not abolished.  Since 1987 Fianna Fáil-led Administrations and the Fianna Fáil minority Government have given us a very confident economy and great progress has been made.  The mechanisms which have been put in place have given young people in particular a future in Ireland.  I would like to see a total abolition of the property tax, but from speaking to the Minister for Finance I understand that is not possible.  I also understand from discussions with the <Col N="1265" /> Minister and others that the measure was welcomed by all political parties.</P>

      <P>In my contribution on the budget debate I indicated that Fianna Fáil backbenchers would take up the matter with the Minister for Finance and I am pleased that some changes were made.  Many more are necessary, but I assure Members of the House and those affected by the residential property tax that we will continue to lobby the Minister and bring to his attention the anomalies and inequities in relation to the property tax with a view to devising a satisfactory solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this motion.  I knew this would be a difficult issue and since the budget many people have contacted me to highlight the property tax anomalies.  They also expressed anger at the change in the thresholds.  This year's budget was excellent and widely welcomed.  It tackled the tax position of low paid workers.  A ludicrous position existed in that it was not worthwhile for people to go to work because of the high amount of tax they had to pay.  People were better off staying on the dole and availing of medical cards, other benefits such as lower rent when living in local authority houses and so on.  This measure addressed an important area in the economy and collected revenue of £330 million in one year, a substantial figure.  That measure is widely supported as a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes to the property tax introduced by the Minister.  Many of the anomalies have been addressed, particularly those in respect of elderly or incapacitated house owners, widowed house owners with dependent children or elderly or incapacitated relatives.  The extension of the marginal income tax relief to £35,000 and the introduction of the 2 per cent valuation over £150,000 have taken the sting out of the residential property tax for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not favour the tax.  It is a blunt <Col N="1266" /> instrument.  Changes in the tax highlight the anomalies in it.  As Deputy McDowell said, there should be an all-party committee set up to consider this area.  That issue is a political football and it should be examined by all parties.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to listen to Fine Gael opposing the tax.  That party introduced this tax and abolished child relief at one stage.  The new pro-family Fine Gael is difficult to take.  Some people have said this is a Dublin tax.  It is not.  In urban areas the price of property is higher for obvious reasons and many more people fall into the property tax net.  Nobody is advocating one tax for Dublin and another for the rest of the country.  That would be ludicrous.  The propaganda that this is a high tax, high spend Government is a media trick.  If that statement is made often enough people will begin to believe it.</P>

      <P>When Fine Gael was in Government we had outrageous tax rates of 58 per cent and 35 per cent and borrowing was at 13 per cent.  That is the party's record.  The party's former leader, Dr. FitzGerald, in an article recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> defended the property tax.  I do not know why &mdash; perhaps it was in the interest of a member of his family to do so.  I did not agree with all the comments in the article but he made a good case for the tax.  His decision to hand over leadership may have resulted in a slippage in the party's popularity.  He was willing to face up to difficult decisions and was not as opportunistic as present members of the party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion tabled by Fine Gael has little integrity.  As the Minister and other Deputies said, Deputy John Bruton has made many references to property tax and tax reform.  We must accept major changes are necessary to bring about tax reform.  The Taoiseach stated on many occasions that tax reform does not necessarily equal a reduction in tax.  We must be mindful of the effects of tax changes.  I do not fully support this tax but I favour tax reform.  I welcome the <Col N="1267" /> changes to the tax introduced by the Minister.  They go a long way towards helping people who find themselves in this tax net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the January budget much has been written about taxation, particularly changes in the residential property tax.  It is necessary to ensure that tax reform is given priority to increase employment and reduce inequities. The relationship between our tax policy and employment will have the greatest impact in increasing and sustaining employment in future years.  The report of the Commission on Taxation recommended a comprehensive definition of income, equivalent tax treatment of income from different sources, neutrality in respect of inflation, a minimum tax impact on individual or business choices, general reliance on direct payments to those in need rather than assistance through the tax system, no earmarking of taxes and the evaluation of compulsory social insurance contributions as taxes.</P>
      <P>The share of taxation derived from personal income is 31.9 per cent, which is significantly above the European average of 25.9 per cent.  The share of taxation derived from property has declined substantially. The National Economic and Social Council has been to the fore in advocating the introduction of property tax and a widening of the tax base.  In recent budgets the Government introduced a modest change to a tax which has been in place for some time.  It has suddenly become the most important issue in what was regarded as a successful budget.  The budget provided for the low paid and the unemployed.  Fine Gael has accused the Labour Party of being a tax and spend party and that is what it is. The statements made by members of the Fine Gael Party during Private Members' Business highlight that it is a party which advocates spending without taxation. Fine Gael does not indicate where funding may be obtained.  It wants a spending policy with no accountability for funding. Where will funds be obtained to provide for schools, hospitals and housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> A constituent who is a local authority worker has a weekly take home pay of £167 and requires an immediate pay rise to provide adequately for his family.  The finances for such a pay rise must come from taxation.  It is important that such a key worker in our community is justly rewarded for his work.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Government introduced a residential property tax.  At that time the Labour Party advocated extending that tax to cover all property but Fine Gael insisted that the tax should only apply to residential property.  The Opposition should indicate where the Government will obtain funds to operate services, to build houses, reduce hospital waiting lists and build hospitals in addition to the Tallaght Regional Hospital.  Additional resources are necessary to finance our educational system and improve it, as suggested by members of the Opposition. Additional funding is required also to provide facilities for the mentally handicapped. The £12 million required to make up the £25 million promised for that area prior to the last election has now been secured.  That funding must be collected through taxation.  Fine Gael calls on the Government to provide good services.  It cannot have it both ways. There cannot be spending without taxation. It cannot have its cake and eat it. The PAYE sector cannot be expected to pay higher tax.  The wealth of the country which is largely invested in bricks and mortar must be diverted from property and invested in people.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Left Party would have framed tonight's resolution somewhat differently from that before the House, nonetheless, we support the thrust of the Fine Gael motion for a number of reasons which were spelled out last night by Deputy Yates in proposing the motion and by Deputy McDowell.  The most important reasons for supporting the motion concern the fact that essentially the residential property tax is equivalent to double taxation. It is an anti-Dublin, anti-urban and anti-family tax.  The extent to which residential property tax contributes to real tax reform in shifting tax from earned income to property is wildly exaggerated. The only property targeted by the residential property tax is the family home. In the extension of the tax no regard was had to the reimplementation of water charges in Dublin, the area most affected, and to the diminution of mortgage interest relief.  The residential property tax disregards the duration and extent of mortgage indebtedness, and the revenue from this tax goes to the Exchequer, not to local government.</P>
      <P>Since only 5 per cent of the self-employed declare an income in excess of £25,000, PAYE taxpayers with no facility to conceal income will bear the brunt of the residential property tax.  It is essentially double taxation.  Virtually all those caught in the extended net are resident in Dublin either because they were born there or found employment here.  Many have mortgages, the discharge of which diminishes their disposable income to very modest levels.  If they were resident elsewhere in the country their homes would be valued well below the £75,000 threshold.  Many of these compliant taxpayers will be affected by the ongoing changes in mortgage income relief, VHI and medical expenses.  To argue that extending the terms of the residential property tax to such people constitutes shifting the burden of taxation from earned income to property is a wild exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> My party favours a shift in taxation from incomes and labour to property, assets and wealth.  Such a shift is desirable for reasons of equity, employment and local democracy, but property taxes defeat their purpose if they are merely additional taxes on tax compliant citizens &mdash; there are two kinds of citizens in this country.  It is not feasible and certainly not desirable to engage in piecemeal reforms of the tax system, and this is not because piecemeal reforms, even if moving imperceptibly in the right direction, may be reversed in the next year or before the next election.  A truly radical tax reform package must include the transfer of part of the burden of taxation from incomes to property, land and other assets.  If local government is not to be abandoned, a structured nationwide property tax is inevitable but only in the context of real and visible tax reform. The Government has learned that it is not possible to inflict an additional invidious tax on tax compliant citizens who, despite improvements in recent years, know that the system remains discriminatory and inequitable.</P>
    <P>Last week the leader of the tax officials' union, Mr. Mark Flanagan, told his annual conference that &ldquo;tax fraud is taking place on an enormous scale within the self-employed sector but yet the Government refuses to allocate additional resources to increase the number of audits carried out by staff of the Chief Inspector of Taxes&rdquo;.  Mr. Flanagan also said that fewer than one half of 1 per cent of declarations are subjected to audit.  Perhaps it is not surprising that only 5 per cent of the self-employed declare an income in excess of £25,000 &mdash; I would have thought that a similar number of such people would be present at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  Tax officials who work at the coalface know what they are talking about and how the system works.  The average tax compliant citizen instinctively knows that.</P>
    <P>The children of large farmers and of substantial business people mysteriously qualify for higher education grants, although there is no mystery about it.  The self-employed legally have the facility to <Col N="1271" /> contrive to artifically reduce their income for the designated year.  The PAYE taxpayer has no such facility.  There would have been no requirement for, or advantage accruing from, the introduction of a tax amnesty if tax fraud was not continuing on the wide scale suggested by the leader of the tax officials' union.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that the extension of such a tax or the imposition of new taxes on top of such a system should cause such the outcry.  At the union conference Mr. Flanagan said:</P>
    <P>The property tax reflects the ethos of the Government's attitude to taxation always take the soft option and only collect tax when payment can be enforced.  If all else fails &mdash; introduce an amnesty.</P>
    <P>That is not very far removed from the tape we heard last Sunday, courtesy of RTE, of the Taoiseach's little homily on his approach to the difficult question of taxation and his casual acquaintance with the taxman in his early days.  That ethos still pervades and that is why tax officials know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that there has been an outcry, but what is surprising is that Labour Deputies joined in it.  Apparently they clearly see the unfairness and inequity of inflicting an additional £3 million tax burden on middle income earners. However, the same Labour Deputies apparently see no injustice in the Government's intention to take an extra £30 million in taxation from the unemployed. The Minister of State involved, Deputy Burton, has stoutly defended shifting the tax burden to the unemployed. It seems our only hope is that Mr. Gay Byrne, who has been mentioned several times in this debate, might take up the cudgels on their behalf.  If that happened one could be confident that a Labour Deputy would express his concern about it, or if we were particularly fortunate, the father figure, Deputy Kemmy, might make a well timed intervention.</P>
    <P>This debate should not be allowed to conclude without querying whether the <Col N="1272" /> Government which introduced extensions in the residential property tax are in possession of all their faculties.  One half penny on the pint would have brought in £3 million, the amount anticipated from the changes in the residential property tax.  Why invite such opposition from middle income earners and cause such distress to hard working journalists and leading broadcasters?  Is it all a cruel Fianna Fáil stratagem to do down the unfortunate Labour Party which seems to have taken most of the flak?  Is it a ruse to kill off the prospect of a rational tiered property tax in the context of genuine comprehensive tax reform? Could it be that the Government convinced itself that a measure like this would somehow convey the image of a reforming Government?</P>
    <P>I am on record as giving credit to the Minister for Finance for introducing minor reforms in successive budgets in recent years.  However, the facts of history remain salutary.  Fianna Fáil has never had the bottle to risk offending its wealthy backers and has refused to tax any property other than the family home. During the 1970s we had a wealth tax which was abolished by Fianna Fáil. During the late 1970s we had a resource tax which was abolished by Fianna Fáil and the money was refunded to those who had paid it.  Also, during the late 1970s Fianna Fáil, opportunistically and for the purposes of electoral advantage, abolished rates without putting anything in their place.  During the 1980s we had a land tax which was abolished by Fianna Fáil.  Clearly, the Fianna Fáil view is that all property, other than the family home, is sacrosanct.  The real tragedy in this debate is that it appears the Labour Party has joined Fianna Fáil in that view.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of listening on the monitor to a number of contributions. We had a great old style around the house attack on Fine Gael by Deputy Ray Burke who at the same time very loudly professed his opposition to the tax.  If he was still around the Cabinet table, this tax would certainly not have been proposed, just like Aer Lingus would not have got into trouble.  I was very impressed by <Col N="1273" /> his speech.  I was also very impressed by Deputy Callely who thinks the budget was exceptional but who wanted to put it on the record, so that it can be used in the leaflets distributed in his constituency, that he is opposed to the tax. Deputy Callely, who distributes a number of leaflets every week, deserves some support because in one giant step last week his constituency colleague surpassed him and earned more notoriety than him.  I noted the warm support from Deputy Callely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I recall both Deputy McDowell and I being guests of the estimable Olivia O'Leary on, if I may modestly say, two very exceptional television programmes which not only entertained the people but which, I would like to think, probably instructed them somewhat at a time when Deputy McDowell was sponsoring the notion of a property tax.  He said at the time that I was the only socialist in the western world who was opposed to a property tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was and I made the point that I opposed the imposition of such a tax on the family home because most constituents in Dublin are in hock to <Col N="1274" /> a building society or financial institution, are already paying their taxes and are generally PAYE workers who have paid their taxes.  The residential property tax is an additional tax imposed on top of an inequitable system of taxation and ought to be opposed.  I welcome the formidable voice of Deputy McDowell rowing in behind that position.  I promise not to suggest in any way that it is a socialist inclination on his part.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eamon Walsh made what was probably the most honest speech in so far as he supports this tax.  However, he is misguided in saying that £3 million will be of major benefit to projects such as the Tallaght hospital or that it will solve the problems of the mentally handicapped. This sum would not pay for the panoply of special advisers we have imported to help the Government introduce farseeing measures such as the property tax, a measure which does not deserve any support.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Finance told us it is wrong for us to argue that this is an anti-Dublin tax, which it plainly is.  It coincides with the reintroduction of water charges &mdash; which Deputy Ray Burke was very successful in abolishing in 1986 &mdash; and service charges, the diminution in mortgage interest and VHI relief and the raising of the threshold for medical expenses, which will hit people badly.  The Minister said that this is not a real situation because the position in regard to mortgages is not nearly as bad as it was this time last year.  Anyone who would pick the middle of the currency crisis, when people did not know from where they would get the next month's mortgage and interest rates were going through the roof, and suggest that the present situation represents an improvement on that is not being very serious.  I will hand over to Deputy Gilmore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pondering the ideological possibilities of it.  The interesting point about this tax is that it is about the Government defining the new rich.  The Government has defined the new rich as those whose combined family income is between £25,000-£28,000, irrespective of the number in the household who will make up that income, and who live in houses the value of which is between £75,000-£91,000.  These people have been identified by the Government as constituting the new rich who will pay additional property tax.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the extension of the residential property tax to these categories of people.  Instead of introducing a proper property tax which would address, for example, the kind of windfall profits made by land rezoners in Dublin during the land rezoning orgy in recent years and addressing multiple home ownership, section 23 and the ways people get tax breaks rather than being taxed on the ownership of property, the Government has taken the soft option and once more sought to extract more tax from the people who are already paying the bulk of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax is now being dressed up &mdash; an ideological gloss is being put on it &mdash; as a measure which will introduce some equity into Irish society.  The last time a Government sought to make such an assault on privilege was when Barry Desmond decided to take medical cards from students in the interests of providing equity in health care.  That misguided measure probably hit the very same people who will now have to pay the property tax.  Those who in the course of the past few weeks have got their certificates of tax free allowances and seen the extent to which their mortgage interest relief has dropped, who have received bills from the VHI and seen what has happened to the relief, who have received bills from their local authority <Col N="1276" /> for local charges and who now face the additional prospect of being defined as the new rich by the Government will not support this measure.</P>
    <P>The issue is not so much about the principle of property tax because there was no issue about the residential property tax which was already in place before this budget.  The issue is the way the measure has been extended by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some speakers here yesterday suggested that the reaction to the residential property tax had been overstated, hysterical and had not been a true indication of the way people feel about this tax.  Many representations have been made to me at meetings, by telephone and by letter on this tax. People feel strongly about it; they have detailed and clear complaints to make and feel it is unjust, anti-family and anti-Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are strongly held views within the community about the inequities of this tax and the punitive imposition which it places on those striving to provide homes and standards for their families. It is not surprising there is such strong feeling about this tax in Dublin given that the Minister informed me in reply to a parliamenary question on 9 March that the Revenue Commissioners had sampled 400 RPT returns from 14,797 residential property taxpayers in 1993 and that three-quarters of those live in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Genuine anomalies remain in this tax. These include the fact that there is no allowance for mortgages, the effect on families in combining the household income, the discrimination against joint ownership of houses and the discrimination against residents of Dublin as 77 per cent of those paying the tax reside there.  I agree with Deputy Yates who said last night that this is a surtax on income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incorrect also to call this tax reform.  When we in Fine Gael attack this tax it is not tax reform <i>per se</i> we are attacking because this is not tax reform. <Col N="1277" /> I fail to see how the additional revenue envisaged under this tax can be considered as serious tax reform.  Fine Gael published detailed proposals for tax reform last November.  What is being proposed here is not tax reform, and to pretend otherwise is incorrect.</P>
    <P>This is a tax on home ownership, a letter of one of my constituents reads:</P>
    <P>I write to express my fury at the proposed arbitrary, additional income tax to be levied on me by virtue of my home ownership ... How the Government can possibly think it can get away with such an inequitably applied tax is beyond my comprehension.  This is the most inequitable tax introduced by any Government in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>The writer goes on to say that the tax takes no account of even the most basic tenets of equality, that it takes no account of the relative house values in different parts of the country, that it takes no account of the wealth of the householder or of stamp duty and it takes no account of buying a house versus putting money on deposit.  The writer made the point that when one buys a house, especially a secondhand house, there are many jobs to be done and employment can be created and sustained as a result of this. If one compares this with not buying a house and leaving the money on deposit, there is no stamp duty, tax is not payable on the money by the depositor and downstream jobs are not created.  The winners are the banks and the losers are householders and the dole queues.</P>
    <P>This tax is inequitable also because of the contrast between the recent joint ownership legislation and what is being attempted by the imposition of this tax. A great effort was made to get this legislation on the Statute Book.  Unfortunately, it was unsuccessful.  Now a tax is to be imposed on the family home. By including the incomes of all members living in the house the Government is encouraging the break up of the family once the children start to work.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for a Partnership Government under the heading &ldquo;Social Justice <Col N="1278" /> and a Compassionate Society&rdquo; states: &ldquo;Continuing encouragement will be given to people to own their own homes. This will include the maintenance of mortgage interest relief.&rdquo;  There is no hint there of the sort of changes we have seen and there was certainly no hint of this in the last general election when quite the opposite was promised by Labour during its election campaign.  Labour certainly fooled householders during the last general election and I echo the call made last night that householders in Dublin and around the country should give a clear reply to Labour for this turnabout and renaging on election promises which the introduction of this tax signifies.</P>
    <P>If we are to reinvent Government, which is urgently required, and reduce bureaucracy and the lack of access of our citizens to many services, and if we are to give people a basic belief in democracy, we must empower our citizens by returning control to the community and the individual citizen.  If we wish to empower citizens who are able and who wish to achieve, supporting home ownership should be an essential part of that philosophy.  People who have succeeded in becoming home owners through a lifetime of effort should not have to face an inequitable tax.  Bureaucracies should treat the people to whom they provide services as customers and not as numbers or impediments to their everyday work. The introduction of this tax will further alienate law abiding citizens and those who make the most effort.  This is an inefficient tax, it is not tax reform.  It is highly selective and inequitable for the reasons I have outlined.  I commend this Fine Gael motion to the House.</P>

I fully support the principle that mortgage interest relief should be given to all taxpayers at the same rate.  While this tax affects many people, including me, it is unfair that two people living side by side in similar houses with similar mortgages should pay different net mortgage simply because the householder paying the lesser amount <Col N="1279" /> had a better job.  I am glad the problem is being addressed by this measure which will be relatively painless because it is being phased in over three years.</P>
      <P>Comments have been made that people are amazed at their new tax free allowances.  One cannot obtain tax relief if one is not paying a mortgage.  There is little point in comparing present mortgage relief rates with those of last year. Obviously the relief figure has been reduced.</P>
      <P>Many crocodile tears have been shed in the past two months on the issue of residential property tax.  The concept of property tax was introduced by the Fine Gael led Coalition of 1973-77 when it introduced the wealth tax.  This had the effect of taking a great deal of money out of the country and since then various Governments have tried to attract that money back.  Last year's tax amnesty was another step in that direction.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition of the early 1980s gave local authorities the power to introduce service charges.  Then they introduced the residential property tax.  At local authority level Fianna Fáil did away with service charges in Dublin in 1985.  Therefore, it is quite clear that Fianna Fáil had a consistent strategy throughout the years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Although I was not a Member of this House then I seem to recall the Leader of Fine Gael, when residential property tax was introduced, pointing us in the direction of how to get around it.  I seem to recall him dividing his house into two units.  Perhaps that is the solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government intends to introduce an ethics in Government Bill shortly.  I understand that constitutes an attempt to put trust back into politics and I suppose very few people disagree with that aspiration. Perhaps the Government will explain to the thousands who will suffer as a result of the reduction in mortgage interest relief and the introduction of this new home tax why, in November 1992, a firm commitment was given by both parties to the electorate that a new property or home tax would not be introduced and that mortgage interest relief would not be reduced.

Indeed it is the duty of any Government to encourage those who are prepared to do so.  I have not heard one good reason for singling out homes for taxation.  Is the Government saying that owning a home provides some sort of a notional income on an annual basis?  Why tax a home and leave other items of wealth alone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we not tax vintage cars or paintings?  Why single out somebody's home for special attention? Why do we want to punish those who live in certain parts of the country where property prices are high, simply because land values are high?  If the Government wanted £12 million why did it not tax the windfalls from land speculation?  Why tax the person who has to take out a big mortgage and carry that burden for 20-25 years while trying to raise a family? Why single out somebody's home?  My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, who represents the Left in this House, will confirm that in certain parts of our constituency one would not get a standard house for £80,000, £90,000 or £100,000.  A similar house in many rural areas would cost in the region of £60,000 to £70,000.  One house will have a huge mortgage, yet both homes could have the same income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally objectionable that I and others have to pay tax on a property, 80 per cent or 90 per cent of which is mortgaged.  I do not own it; the building societies or the banks may own it.  Why not ask the banks to pay the tax on 70 per cent, 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the home?  Why ask the home maker to pay the tax?  That is what makes this tax totally unacceptable to most ordinary people.  Many persons who will have to pay these large bills, after the reduction in mortgage interest relief, will pay out <Col N="1286" /> of PAYE earnings which are already heavily taxed.</P>
    <P>There is growing resentment at the way the Government attacks those who try to get on with their lives without looking to the State for anything.  The vast majority of people do not mind paying their fair share of taxes to help provide much needed services and to assist those who are not in a position to help themselves. However, people are fed up being kicked every time they try to get on with their lives, look after their families, provide a reasonable home, take on a big mortgage, pay VHI and educate their children in many cases without assistance from the State.  The public will not forget and will use the ballot box both in the European and by-elections to send a loud and clear message to the Government.</P>

That is a little rich coming from two parties, one of which hired Saachi and Saachi to check this and threatened that if the Labour Party was returned to office, there would be household bills of £1,200 to residences.  They even wrote out the cheque.  These are the people who are lecturing us on what Fine Gael did 11 years ago.  They dredged through every record to find how Fine Gael can be associated with this tax.  I concede that my party has paid a high price for our past association with the Labour Party.

      <P>If those are the speakers the Government can rally to defend the tax then there is a consensus in this House.  We have Government backbenchers trying to run with the hare and chase with the hounds on this issue.  They are issuing leaflets and newsletters in their constituencies saying how sympathetic <Col N="1288" /> they are to the householders who voted then into office yet in five minutes' time they will vote to prop up this Government and put through this iniquitous tax.</P>
      <P>There has been little focus on the changes in mortgage interest relief.  The middle income sector who are always a volatile part of the electorate voted in large numbers for the Labour Party.  How did the Labour Party show its gratitude? It commenced by imposing the 1 per cent levy last year but it really got down to business this year.  It said that medical expenses were to be doubled.  The threshold for relief in respect of medical expenses is to increase to £300.  Therefore, if one is prudent enough to pay for health insurance, tax relief will be reduced.  Similarly, in the case of providing one's own accommodation and paying an expensive mortgage, relief and allowances will be systematically reduced.  Not satisfied with all those effects and taking £23 million more in income tax this year than last year, the Government proceeded to widen the property tax net.  All the Minister's changes have been purely cosmetic.  The simple truth is that he widened the net to bring the house value threshold down to £75,000 and the income level to £25,000. That proposal remains unaltered.  Now 40,000 families will be brought into the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suburban home owners in Dublin will face the prospect of having to comply with this unfair tax, regardless of the fact that they may have huge mortgages.  We now have taxes on debt.  In order to avoid liability for the tax parents will be put in the position of having to ask their sons and daughters to leave the family home. Individuals, teachers and those in the private sector who got their revised tax free allowances find that mortgage interest relief has been cut by £1,400. People now see the chickens coming home to roost.  They see the contempt of the Labour Party for the electorate.  I was trying to think what gem of expenditure <Col N="1289" /> would equal the change in the residential property tax, even taking account of the changes announced by the Minister on Friday last and which mean that we are talking about approximately £3 million. It occurred to me that the cost of the 43 spin doctors, the families, relatives, friends, programme managers and special advisers the Labour Party insisted on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Saturday, 12 March 1994, Fr. Felim McAllister, a Holy Ghost Missionary priest from Donabate, County Dublin, was shot dead in an ambush by rebels dressed in army uniforms in Panguma, Sierra Leone.  His last words as he tried to lead a convoy of three vehicles from the hospital compound were &ldquo;I think we are too late, we are surrounded&rdquo;.  With that he was shot dead.  A young Dutch doctor Dr. Elco Krijn, his wife Karim and their four year old daughter Zita were in the second vehicle and they were shot.  A fourth person in the second vehicle, Dr. Ann Brennan from New Zealand, managed to escape but was subsequently recaptured by the rebels and was subjected to the  ordeal of a seven mile walk until she was rescued by the official army of Sierra Leone.  She had to witness the burning of the vehicle and although local people managed to retrieve the bodies of Fr. Felim McAllister and Dr. Elco Krijn and his wife, their four year old daughter was burned in the vehicle.  Sister Madeleine Naughton, a Daughter of Charity sister from Loughrea, County Galway was driving the third vehicle with three other missionary sisters.  She watched in horror as Fr. Felim McAllister and the others in the second vehicle were shot to death. She put her foot on the accelerator and drove through a hail of bullets, thus saving her own life and the lives of the three other sisters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fr. McAllister had been in Sierra Leone for 26 years and he, as well as the other Irish missionaries contributed enormously to the communities they were working with, particularly the Kissi and the Mende tribes.  In his last letter home written a week before his untimely death he said &ldquo;Tongafield &mdash; the wider parish &mdash; is destroyed by the rebels with hundreds of houses burned and every house and store looted.  I am busy trying to feed 12,000 displaced persons from the regions.  The rebels were approaching but turned away three miles from Panguma but our place is the next obvious target.&rdquo; Little did he know that the hospital in which he worked would be the next <Col N="1293" /> target.  His letter continued &ldquo;There is real danger that the country could slide into anarchy similar to Somalia.  The people do not trust the army&rdquo;.  He then appealed to Irish people and the people of Donabate who supported his missionary work to contact the Sierra Leone Government and ask them to capture the rebels and bring peace to the country.</P>
    <P>Sierra Leone is experiencing difficult times.  It is considered to be one of the ten poorest countries in Africa, although it used to be one of the richest, with a major diamond industry.  The civil war in Liberia has spilled over into Sierra Leone and it is known that one in five children will not reach their fifth birthday.  In his last letter home Fr. McAllister appealed for resources so that people could rehabilitate themselves.  There is European Union and American aid but army protection is required in transporting food from Freetown.  Fr. McAllister's last food convoy was attacked and the food stolen.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Holy Rosary Sisters who founded the hospital and to the Daughters of Charity who are continuing this work.  I pay special tribute to their principal, Sr. Bernadette, and to Sr. Madeleine Naughton who has now arrived home.  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Fr. McAllister and to the people of the parish of Donabate-Portrane.</P>
    <P>Has the Government of Sierra Leone sent a message of sympathy to the Government?  I ask the Minister to put pressure on them to capture the rebels.  I also ask him to meet with the Holy Ghost Fathers, the Daughters of Charity and the Holy Rosary Sisters to be appraised fully on the position in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen for affording me the opportunity of making a brief contribution.  As someone who grew up and went to school with Fr. Felim I extend my sympathy to his family.  Not only is this a tragedy for his family and his Order but, above all, for the ordinary <Col N="1294" /> people of Sierra Leone who in recent times had come to depend so much on him and other missionaries, both nuns and priests, particularly from Ireland.</P>
      <P>People in my own parish have appealed to the Government to ensure that the work carried out by Fr. Felim during the years is continued.  I thank the Minister for responding so quickly to the representations which have been made to date and ask him to use his good offices with the United Nations and other agencies to ensure that further tragedies can be avoided and that the food and clothing which are badly needed are provided.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister meet at an early date with the Daughters of Charity, the Holy Ghost Fathers and the family of Fr. Felim to obtain a first-hand account of what is happening in Sierra Leone and to see what they require?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to reply to the remarks made by Deputies Owen and Ryan on this tragic incident.  I will attempt to reply to the various questions raised.  The brutal murder by rebels of Fr. Felim McAllister, an Irish member of the Holy Ghost Congregation, in Sierra Leone on 12 March was a terrible tragedy.  I am sure all Members of this House will join me in condemning this murder in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>A Dutch lay volunteer, Dr. Elco Krijn, his wife Karim, and their young daughter Zita, were also killed in the same attack as they were trying to leave the hospital at Panguma early in the morning.  Four sisters of the Congregation of the Daughters of Charity, including one Irish nun, Sr. Madeleine Naughton, were lucky to escape with their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area around Panguma has been the scene of increased rebel activity in recent weeks.  As the missionaries and volunteers tried to leave the hospital they were attacked by rebels.  The two vehicles carrying Fr. McAllister and the lay volunteers were attacked and set on fire. <Col N="1295" /> The nuns in the third vehicle had the narrowest of escapes by driving through the gunfire and managed to reach the capital, Freetown, later in the day.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I extend my deepest sympathy to the relatives of all those killed in the attack and particularly to the members of Fr. McAllister's family in Dublin.  I also offer my condolences to Very Rev. Brian McLaughlin, Provincial Superior of the Holy Ghost Congregation, and to the other members of the order on the tragic death of Fr. McAllister who worked so selflessly to help the people of Sierra Leone since he began working in that country in 1968.</P>
    <P>In addition to being parish priest of Panguma, Fr. McAllister had been administrator of Panguma hospital from 1986 to 1989.  His commitment and dedication to helping the people of the area was best expressed in his unceasing efforts in recent months to provide food and shelter for those displaced by rebel activity.  These efforts were often undertaken at great risk to his own life.</P>
    <P>Since Fr. McAllister's death, the Irish Honorary Consul in Freetown, at the request of my Department, has maintained constant contact with the Government of Sierra Leone at a high level conveying our deep concern at this incident.  He is also actively involved in ensuring the protection of the Irish missionaries who are still in the country.</P>
    <P>The head of state, Captain Strasser, who is also chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council, has written to the Taoiseach conveying the deepest condolences of the Government and people of Sierra Leone to the bereaved relatives and friends of Fr. McAllister and to the Irish people as a whole on this sad loss. Captain Strasser said that the murder of Fr. McAllister was a dastardly act which the Government and people of Sierra Leone deplore and condemn in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>The area in which the attack took place <Col N="1296" /> in eastern Sierra Leone has been the scene of increasing rebel activity in recent months.  This activity is largely caused by dissident elements in the Sierra Leone army together with rebels crossing over the border from neighbouring Liberia. We are assured that the Government of Sierra Leone is making every effort to deal with the rebel activity.</P>
    <P>Reports indicate that disturbances are continuing in areas of eastern Sierra Leone.  Because of this, I understand that most of the Irish missionaries in the area around Panguma and Kenema have moved to the town of Bo for safety.  Three Irish missionaries remain in Kenema.  If the security situation deteriorates further, they and the Irish missionaries now in Bo are prepared to move to the capital, Freetown.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Sierra Leone very closely in consultation with our European Union partners and through our Honorary Consul there.  We will also keep in close contact here in Ireland with those missions such as the Holy Ghost Fathers and the Sisters of the Congregation of the Daughters of Charity who have missionaries in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>The Deputies requested that I meet the Orders concerned and the relatives of the late Fr. McAllister.  It is my intention to meet the provincials of both Orders together with Mr. Noel McAllister, a brother of the late Fr. Felim McAllister, and with Sr. Madeleine Naughton who was involved in the incident.  I hope that this meeting can take place within the next few days.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Monasterevan (Kildare) Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The water supply in the Kill and Gurteenoona areas of Monasterevan has been seriously deficient for many years.  This has caused great inconvenience and distress for local residents. I will illustrate the difficulties by saying <Col N="1297" /> that in the period mid-January 1991 to late October last year &mdash; a period of less than three years &mdash; the water supply to that area was interrupted on 76 occasions.  In some instances the interruption lasted for up to 19 hours.  Even when the supply is restored it takes time for the pressure to build and a considerable length of time to restore supplies to residents living in the upper part of the Kill area.  It is not difficult to picture the difficulties caused by this.</P>
      <P>Imagine for a moment the situation of a mother with a young family, perhaps an infant and one or two children at school.  A family at that stage needs a lot of water every day &mdash; they need water for washing, for bathing, for cooking, for cleaning and, indeed, for refreshment. At various stages during a day anybody looking after a family would like to have one or two cups of tea.  I ask the Minister to reflect on what the situation would be during the summer time if there is no water supply and people are unable to flush the toilets for up to 19 hours in one day.  The problems given rise to are legion and in this day we should not expect anybody to put with interruptions of supply on the scale and with the frequency that have been seen in the Kill and Gurteenoona areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April of last year the Minister for the Environment informed me that contract documents for the work necessary on the scheme were being examined in his Department but he was unable to say when a decision would be made.  To get to the point required vigorous representations for several years by Kildare County Council.  Unfortunately, so far those representations have not evoked any positive response from the Minister. On 2 November last, that is, four and a half months ago, a deputation from the area met the Minister for the Environment together with myself and the other Deputies for the constituency.  The Minister listened to the case and informed us that the Estimates for 1994, were still under examination and that the budget was still in the course of preparation, <Col N="1298" /> but he felt he would be able to give us some kind of response within six to eight weeks.  Four and a half months later we have still heard nothing from the Minister or from his Department.  I call on the Minister of State to tell us not whether but when we will have a decision from the Department of the Environment to make the necessary allocation of funds to Kildare County Council so that the people of this part of Monasterevan can have a reliable water supply.</P>
    <P>Further development in the town of Monasterevan, Drogheda Street and the surrounding area, is being hindered and cannot go ahead.  Planning permission will not be given because the water supply is not up to the standard quite properly required for any further development in this area.  It is unconscionable that people in a town only about 40 miles from Dublin should have to put up with that kind of inconvenience.  I would like the Minister of State to tell me now when contract documents will be approved so that the work can go ahead and bring Gurteenoona and Kill back into the 20th century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I would thank Deputy Dukes for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the importance attached to the Monasterevan water supply scheme.  The scheme, which is estimated to cost in excess of £1 million, involves the linking of Monasterevan to the regional scheme at Old Kilcullen reservoir, thereby supplying water from the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant.  The scheme, when it comes on stream, will result in a vastly improved water supply to Monasterevan, particularly to the areas of Kill, Gurteenoona, Ballyforsoon and Drogheda Row where low water pressure and disrupted water supplies are frequently experienced.  The scheme also provides for the construction of a new service reservoir to replace the present small reservoir at Monasterevan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress is being made <Col N="1299" /> in Couny Kildare in the provision of water and sanitary services.  The Robertstown sewerage scheme, estimated to cost £1.5 million was the first of the selected schemes to be approved for EU Cohesion Fund assistance.  This scheme will eliminate reliance on individual septic tanks by providing a secondary treatment plant, thereby abating pollution of an important waterway, the Grand Canal.</P>
    <P>In recent times important water and sewerage infrastructure has been completed in County Kildare, including Leixlip treatment plant extension, Maynooth sewerage scheme southside, Kill Johnstown sewerage scheme, Newbridge sewerage eastside extension and the Lower Liffey Valley sewerage scheme extension to Collinstowns industrial estate.</P>
    <P>Investment in water and sanitary services is important both for the economy and the environment.  The National Development Plan, of which the Operational Programme for Environmental Services forms a part, is keenly focused on the need to create sustainable employment and provide a stimulus for economic growth.  This target is being achieved by providing the necessary infrastructure for the development of industry.  The provision of the Lower Liffey Valley sewerage scheme to facilitate the Intel development is an example of the Government's commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>However, this scheme is in competition with similar priority schemes on a national basis for financing under the water and sanitary services programme and the future of the scheme cannot be determined until the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, currently underway is finalised.</P>
    <P>Until this process has been completed, it will not be possible to indicate those schemes which will get to construction in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I will keep the Deputy informed of <Col N="1300" /> the position with regard to Monasterevan water supply scheme in this regard.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Belmullet (Mayo) Environmental Works.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity of raising this important local matter in the Dáil.  I am grateful to the Minister for the Environment for coming to answer it.</P>
      <P>Belmullet is a small town just over 200 miles from here at the western end of the most westerly constituency.  It is one of the most westerly towns in Europe.  It has been ravaged by unemployment and emigration over the last century and the people in the town and surrounding areas have always struggled for their existence.</P>
      <P>There is a double problem here.  One concerns the condition of the streets of the town and the other the upgrading and upsizing of the water mains.  In the last few years a substantial amount of money was spent by the Department of the Environment on regional water schemes in the area and this has provided the basis for a satisfactory supply to the town environs and the town itself.  However, the pipes are the old cast iron type which are over 50 years old and unable to take the increased pressure from the new regional scheme.  This has resulted in corrosion on the inside of the pipes.  This, naturally, causes health fears, disruption of business and great inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 12 months ago Mayo County Council sent a preliminary report for approval to the Department of the Environment and has since requested £310,000 to upsize and replace the mains throughout the town.  Nothing has been done about the report.  In reply to a Dáil Question yesterday the Minister indicated that this matter is still being considered.  I ask him to confirm that this report will be adopted by the Minister and authorisation given to Mayo County Council to go ahead.  I remind the Minister that there will be no tenders and no tender documentation required because the job <Col N="1301" /> will be done by Mayo County Council itself.  I am informed by senior sources within the council that if authorisation is given in the next few days work can start on replacing the mains within the next month and that the work will take two and a half months to complete.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second problem, that of the roads.  At this moment the main street in Belmullet is more akin to Medicine Bow, Wyoming, than to an Irish town in the 1990s.  It is nothing short of disgraceful and it is the cause of great inconvenience to shoppers and local people.  They are used to putting up with hardship but this has gone beyond the beyond.</P>
    <P>Again Mayo County Council have requested moneys from the Department of the Environment to the extent of £1.5 million to £3 million under the heading of grants for non-discretionary roads to come from the funds of £33 million proposed by the Government some time ago. If this is allowed, £300,000 could be taken from the fund to carry out these works. It would be impractical to expect the council to do the streets in the town and have to dig them up again if approval is given in respect of upsizing the water mains.  There is to be a meeting between the county engineer and his officials and officials of the Department within the next few days and I expect that authorisation will be given under the non discretionary road grant.  However, it is necessary for the Minister to authorise the preliminary report for the water scheme so that the council can proceed to replace the mains.  That can be followed by improving the streets of the town which will involve co-ordination between Telecom Éireann and the ESB in regard to burying the cables.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of the traders in the town, Belmullet Tidy Towns Association has erected signs in the vicinity of Belmullet and is collecting rates from ratepayers and lodging the money in the bank.  This is the first time this has happened. Those people are used to the <Col N="1302" /> vagaries of life and the harsh economic hardships.  Those rates are being collected and will be paid when the work is completed.  The busiest months of the year in that little western town are July and August and the people there need every penny of economic development they can get.  Will the Minister resolve this problem immediately so that the works can be completed and people can get on with their lives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this matter. Primary responsibility for maintaining the streets in Belmullet in a satisfactory condition lies with Mayo County Council, using its own resources and the discretionary block grants provided by my Department for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads.  For 1994, Mayo County Council received discretionary grant allocations totalling £3,492,000.  This amount includes £942,000 as a supplementary grant for maintenance works from the additional £15 million provided in the budget to assist councils generally in carrying out works arising from adverse weather conditions. It also includes a supplementary grant of £200,000 for improvement works.  A grant of this kind is made available only to a limited number of county councils who need additional assistance to restore roads to a satisfactory condition. It is entirely a matter for Mayo County Council to determine how best to use the very substantial resources allocated to them for non-national roads and to select the projects to be undertaken this year, whether in the Belmullet area or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As regards water, Belmullet town is served by the Erris regional water supply scheme.  The treatment works for this scheme and the trunk main to Belmullet were completed in the mid-1980s at a cost of around £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 2 of this scheme will provide essential storage and fire fighting requirements for Belmullet, a treated water <Col N="1303" /> supply to the Mullet Peninsula, and bring treated water into existing group water schemes which are experiencing water quality problems.  Phase 2 is currently nearing completion and is expected to cost in excess of £3 million.</P>
    <P>The next phase of the scheme is the renewal of the town distribution system. A preliminary report for this is under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>The most recent report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, published by the Environmental Protection Agency, confirms that the quality of all public water supplies in County Mayo, including Belmullet, is of a high standard.  I am aware, however, that the town distribution system is quite old and is contributing to problems of insufficient pressure and quality variation.  My Department will be taking up the matter with Mayo County Council in order to ensure that these problems are minimised through good housekeeping and ongoing maintenance.</P>
    <P>Given that we are still involved in construction and financing Phase 2 of the regional scheme, I cannot anticipate when it may be possible to approve further phases.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern that the next phase should proceed as soon as possible and this will be borne in mind when decisions are being made about the allocation of the overall resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Education is not present, but I have great faith in the versatility of the Minister of State.  Ballywaltrim is a new area of the town of Bray which has experienced rapid growth in population. The area now caters for approximately 10,000 people, 600 families live in local authority houses and private housing is predominately of the three bedroom semi-detached type.  The largest local authority estate has an unemployment <Col N="1304" /> rate of 80 per cent and 41 per cent of families there are headed by lone parents.</P>
      <P>Disadvantaged status has already been granted to the area by other Government Departments.  For example, the Department of Enterprise and Employment funds a scheme for Youthreach which caters for the Ballywaltrim area.  I want the Department of Education to provide similar status for the two schools in the area.  The parish of Ballywaltrim which is relatively new, has major economic difficulties.  Many parents simply cannot provide the voluntary contribution to make up the shortfall in funding even though they would like to support the schools in the area.</P>
      <P>In common with other schools in the Bray area, the two St. Fergal's schools suffer from a lack of psychological and other backup services.  Assessments carried out on children in those schools have shown that additional places are needed in the special classes and in the special school in the area, but those needs have not been met because the necessary planning is not in place.  I accept this is not related directly to disadvantage status, but it is an important element in the difficulties facing those schools. While the Ballywaltrim school may not meet the overall criteria for departmental designation, a significant number of children in the school do meet those criteria. The number of disadvantaged children make up two full classes for each level throughout the schools, the equivalent of an average size school in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the junior school the proportion of disadvantaged children is increasing.  In junior infants, 54 per cent of children live in local authority housing while in third class the figure is 42.8 per cent.  Between the two schools there are 40 classes and approximately 1,300 children.  It is obvious that many children are at a disadvantage and would normally qualify for designation status.  The fact that the serious nature of the disadvantage is disguised by the size of the two schools <Col N="1305" /> should not lead to perpetuation of the injustice.</P>
    <P>The staff of the schools and the community at large in Ballywaltrim are committed to developing resources to help the children of the area, but they require the support of the Department in their efforts.  Last year I was disturbed that when one of the schools applied for a special resource teacher, the other school was told it would get such a teacher, but the decision was withdrawn without a satisfactory explanation.  The designation status should be put in place now to maximise the chances of the staff of the schools succeeding in reaching the children most in need.  As the children grow older the gap between those who achieve and those who do not will widen. As a public representative for Ballywaltrim I have a responsibility to ensure those children receive the best our education system can provide.</P>
    <P>If those children attended a special school in the city centre there would be no question about them getting disadvantage status and it would not be necessary for me to take up the Minister's time making a case for them.  The fact that they are part of a large pool of children should not reduce their entitlements. Disadvantaged status has not been granted to the children and the Minister should recognise their needs.  If they were given disadvantage status it would make a real and discernible difference to their lives.  Will the Minister consider the matter seriously?  Otherwise the children will experience a double disadvantage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy McManus for raising this matter. There is abundant evidence that educational qualifications or the lack of them determine to a large extent the life chances of our young people.  The likelihood of obtaining educational qualifications is closely associated with social background and the children of socio-economically deprived groups constitute <Col N="1306" /> a majority of those who do not benefit from the educational system.</P>
      <P>The link between educational deprivation and unemployment is clear.  The majority of those who are long-term unemployed have few or no educational qualifications, have left school early and have not benefited from the education system.  It is clear, therefore, that education plays an indirect but important part in the perpetuation of poverty.  The children of deprived groups are themselves most likely to leave the education system early, to experience unemployment and to have limited chances. Thus the cycle of deprivation is perpetuated. Breaking this cycle of deprivation is the single greatest challenge facing our education system.</P>
      <P>The primary mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation in schools is the disadvantaged areas scheme which provides special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Schools seeking disadvantaged status are assessed and prioritised as to need on the basis of socio-economic and educational indicators such as unemployment levels, housing, medical card holders and information on basic literacy and numeracy.  In addition, in assessing the levels of disadvantage among applicant schools, account is taken of pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>Those criteria were recommended in the report, in 1990, of a representative working party which included representatives of school management, teachers and the Department of Education. A further review of these criteria is being carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency.  To date over 400 primary and post-primary schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts.  The primary schools in question also receive supplementary capitation grants at the rate of £17 per pupil.  The post primary school in the Ballywaltrim area is one of the schools which has the benefit of a disadvantaged teaching post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> As announced in the House last year, the Minister allocated an additional 68 ex-quota teaching posts to the primary disadvantaged areas scheme in the current school year.  As part of that arrangement, an additional 50 schools were newly included in the scheme.  All national schools were circularised at the time and invited to apply for inclusion in that allocation.  On the basis of information submitted, schools were assessed and prioritised in order of need.  The primary schools in the Ballywaltrim area of Bray were among the applications considered in that context.  However, the schools in question did not rate high enough on the priority list for inclusion on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> reinforces the commitment outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government to a major concentration of resources on the disadvantaged.  Additional schools will be included in the schemes for the disadvantaged, <Col N="1308" /> 50 at primary level and 60 at post primary level for 1994.  A further 30 home school community liaison coordinator posts, 15 at primary level and 15 at post primary level, will be made available for the coming school year.  This will facilitate the inclusion of approximately 41 schools in the home school community liaison scheme.  That will bring the total number of schools in this scheme to over 180 with the services of 126 co-ordinators embracing approximately 72,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools in the Ballywaltrim area will be full considered in the context of the proposed extension of those schemes.</P>

      <P>Job evaluation and pay structures are primarily a matter for employers and employees including the trade unions representing them.  The carrying out of a job evaluation exercise is certainly a matter in the first place for an employer and the workers concerned. In many cases I understand that job evaluation is a different and an unsuitable pay determining measure.</P>
      <P>While I am still examining the ESRI analysis of male/female wage differentials I am aware that the potential exists in collective bargaining on pay and conditions to reach agreements which may directly or indirectly discriminate against specific categories of workers including women.</P>
      <P>At present women who consider that they are the subject of such discrimination can pursue a case under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 or the Employment Equality Act, 1977. Such a case will go before an Equality Officer of the Labour Relations Commission who in investigating the matter take into account the need for job comparison techniques to reflect equality principles.</P>
      <P>In my review of employment equality legislation I am examining possible measures to strengthen the role of Equality Officers on this issue.  I consider that the principles of equal treatment as regards pay can be appropriately safe-guarded through equal pay legislation coupled with proactive employer and trade union politicies in this area.</P>

      <P>I represented the Government at the many St. Patrick's Day events in Savannah, Georgia, where some 18 per cent of the population is of Irish descent. The St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah, which is the oldest parade in the US, is one of the largest, next to the New York parade and attracts over 300,000 people.</P>
      <P>The events planned around St. Patrick's Day by Irish Americans afford Government Ministers the unique opportunity to promote the benefits of investing in Ireland to top American business men and women.  These visits are fundamentally important in showing solidarity with the 44 million strong Irish American community.  They also represent an opportunity to show Ireland's appreciation of the continuing interest and support of the US in Irish affairs and this year, particularly, its support for the Joint Declaration.  My programme included several addresses to top Irish American business people and prominent Irish societies and associations. Specifically, in relation to social welfare, the visit afforded me the opportunity to promote to Irish emigrants the benefits of the Bilateral Agreement on Social Security pensions which Dáil Éireann approved and I brought into effect in September last.  This agreement, which among other things allows for the payment of US pensions to returned emigrants here in Ireland, is expected to be worth some $35 million to the Irish economy annually.  It is estimated that the total cost of the visit will be approximately £12,000.</P>

      <P>I took full account of the vital and essential role played by carers in our society when I introduced the carer's allowance in 1990.  That was the first time that a basic income maintenance payment was made directly to the carer.  The carer's allowance has been improved and extended each year since and this year I am introducing a substantial improvement in the means testing arrangements which will benefit a carer whose spouse is in employment or self-employment. This will further increase the number of carers on low incomes who will receive a payment.  I will continue to improve and develop the scheme as resources permit.</P>

    <P>Supporting dependent people at home is a major objective of health policy.  I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes.  In recent years my Department has encouraged Health Boards to provide support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home. The carers' allowance, operated by the Department of Social Welfare provides a valuable source of income to many caring for a dependent relative in the home.</P>
    <P>While the main aim of health policy will continue to be support of dependent persons at home, the growth in the older population and the increase in the numbers reaching advanced old age means that the need for long term nursing care, either in health board hospitals and homes or in private and voluntary nursing homes, will also continue to grow.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of Kilkea national school there were 31 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of Principal plus 1 assistant for the 1993-94 school year.</P>
      <P>There were 23 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of Principal only for the 1994-95 school year.  The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 25 pupils in order to retain the post of 1st assistant.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.
