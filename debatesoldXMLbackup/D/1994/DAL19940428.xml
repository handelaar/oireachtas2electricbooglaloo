      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3 to 43, inclusive; 44, 48 and 45. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that (1) Nos. 3 to 43 shall be moved together and decided without debate by one Question which shall be put from the Chair; (2) No. 44 shall be decided without debate; (3) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 48, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today and (4) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 May 1994.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 3 to 43, inclusive, shall be moved together and decided without debate by one Question from the Chair satisfactory and agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal that No. 44 shall be decided without debate agreed?  Agreed. Is it agreed that the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 48, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today?  Agreed. Is it agreed that the Dáil on its rising today adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 May?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of obvious fears that the rail strike will commence at midnight <Col N="242" /> on Monday which is a Bank Holiday and the Dáil will not sit on Tuesday, what plans has the Government to try to avert this strike and, should the strike proceed, what plans has the Government to provide communter services to the public? It is important we know that before we go into recess until next Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to agree that the Dáil will not resume until next Wednesday. That will prohibit us from raising this important issue. A Private Notice Question tabled on this matter was disallowed, so it is only fair that the Taoiseach should outline to us what procedures are in place should the strike proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told by you, a Cheann Comhairle, that we can raise matters in another way, but when we put down a question to the Taoiseach on his statement in Killarney, it was transferred to the Minister for the Environment. It would avoid us having to ask questions later if the Taoiseach could simply tell us whether he intends to have the Minister for Enterprise and Employment intervene in this dispute. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, was very quick when in Opposition, as was the Tánaiste, to urge the Government to intervene in the threatened ESB strike. Given that Monday is Labour Day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I seek the Chair's indulgence to extend our best wishes for a full and speedy recovery to our two colleagues, the father of the House, Deputy Blaney, and Deputy Ferris. A message should be sent out loudly and clearly from this House condemning the sectarian killings, six in the last eight days. I would like all sides of the House to join in condemning that and to send a message calling on those carrying out such atrocities to stop.</P>

I met with the Leaders of the Opposition last week and brought them fully up to date on the information available to the Government regarding developments in Northern Ireland. Consequently I do not think it either appropriate or necessary to inquire about a debate at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated last week, there are appeals before the higher courts in the land and the Government is not in a position to speculate on the timetable for dealing with matters before the courts. It is our intention to proceed as outlined on a number of occasions but of course a change in the timetable could be forced on us by circumstances outside our control. If that happens the agenda will have to change, it not, we will continue as outlined.</P>

    <Title>Irish Horseracing Industry Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In one of my first contributions in this House on a budget debate I called for the setting up of a single authority to run the horseracing industry. Having listened to the contributions of Opposition Deputies, one would think that the Minister was introducing measures which the industry had not sought and did not want. The opposite is the case. The Minister and his officials had consultations with the various sectors in the racing industry over a long time.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to dissolve the Racing Board and establish a single authority to run the racing industry. People have objected to some minor points in the Bill for their own reasons, but by and large the racing industry is delighted with the steps being taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh. The racing industry is happy to have a Government in power which knows the industry and what it needs and is about to put its money where its mouth is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The racing industry has provided employment for many years. The Turf Club was established more than 200 years ago and the Racing Board was set up approximately 50 years ago. Until 1989 the racing industry, which has been one of our most successful industries, received no financial assistance from the Government. Those involved in the industry knew that funding was badly needed if the industry was to compete successfully with the racing industries in <Col N="262" /> Britain, France and other countries and, as a leisure industry, with other industries in Ireland. The Minister has set about rectifying this problem by giving the industry the necessary injection of capital it requires and putting it on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the Government made a contribution to the racing industry for the first time ever, and this contribution has been continued each year since then. The Minister has agreed to more than double the allocation of £3 million which the industry has received for the past four years to approximately £6.75 million this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle argued that 2 per cent of off-course betting receipts should be allocated to the racing industry each year. Last year off-course betting amounted to £350 million and the percentage of that bet on Irish racing was very small &mdash; punters bet on many other sports also. Bookmakers can see the niche in the market and sell customers the products they want.</P>
    <P>I estimate that 65 per cent of the turnover in betting shops today is on other racing activities and the remainder on horse racing. There is greyhound racing, football, golf and a number of other sporting activities, but if money was directly allocated to the racing industry from off-course betting it would merely open up similar avenues or possibilities for other organisations; there would be nothing to prevent the GUI or FAI seeking a percentage. The racing industry here, without any assistance, has provided tremendous employment over many years. As its potential is now fully acknowledged the time has come for the industry to be assisted. I am delighted that the Minister has set about doing so.</P>
    <P>While people might be very critical of the Turf Club and the Racing Board, individually they have made a tremendous contribution to our racing industry. They must have been doing something right or the industry would not be in its present good state although many ills remain to be cured. However, compared with the industry in other countries, it is not as bad as we are sometimes led to <Col N="263" /> believe. While both organisations have made a tremendous contribution to the industry, together they have not worked well, which has cost the industry dearly. The Minister's proposal to establish one Horseracing Authority is all the more welcome for that reason.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a few comparisons between the racing industry here and elsewhere. I listened to Deputy O'Malley talk here last week about Hong Kong. People sometimes tend to forget that our population is a mere 3.5 million, not 35 million or 350 million. In establishing this new Horseracing Authority, we must ensure that it will not be comprised of a group of people merely talking to themselves but of those who have been directly involved in the activities of the Racing Board and the Turf Club. These people will have a serious task ahead. It will be important that the Minister gives them the right riding instructions and ensures that they are carried out. Therefore, the appointment of appropriate members will be of immense importance.</P>
    <P>In recent times an SP office was set up on the track at Leopardstown, much welcomed by the majority of racegoers and widely used. However, because bookmakers on the track objected and said it reduced their take on the day, the office was closed. That type of confrontation cannot be allowed to continue. There are sectoral interests within the racing industry very keen to defend their little patch. We must examine the racing industry and not allow some sectors to over-influence policy. I hope that this new Authority will ascertain consumer needs, the fact that something may have worked well in recent years is not sufficient justification for its continuance. The industry is in need of a major shakeup.</P>
    <P>I might now draw some comparison between horses in training here and those in Britain. Last year there were approximately 4,750 horses in training here, not all of which would have run but there were 1,800 races during the year involving £12.5 million in prize money, giving average prize money for each race of <Col N="264" /> just below £7,000. In Britain there were approximately 11,000 racehorses in training last year involved in 7,162 races with prize money slightly in excess of £51 million, again averaging out at a little over £7,000 per race. Therefore, there is little or no difference between the prize money here and in Britain but we have a greater number of horses competing; for every race run here there are 2.63 horses whereas the corresponding figure in Britain would be 1.53. We have too many horses and the biggest criticism is that there is much &ldquo;stopping&rdquo; engaged in whereas, if the truth were known, it would be very easy to stop many of them; the greatest difficulty is to get them going. I suppose the market will sort out that difficulty but, in the meantime, it is not helping the racing industry.</P>
    <P>We have 300 trainers nationwide whereas in Britain there are approximately 550. It is nothing short of a miracle that we have so many. I do not know how some survive but it would appear they are willing to take a chance and, without knowing what lies ahead, are prepared to battle on. I wish them all well. They are a source of tremendous employment, particularly in Kildare, and we have seen many spring up nationwide. Many trainers are people who, on leaving school, become involved in racing, many of whom remain in the industry for the remainder of their lifetime. I should like to see a more professional approach to their training. The racing centre at the Curragh engages in training on a small scale but has an almost 100 per cent success rate in finding employment for their trainees at the end of each session. Perhaps the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would examine that matter with a view to providing some type of financial assistance to these apprentices.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the serious decline in on-course betting in recent years. No doubt people involved in the racing industry argue that we are very dependent on a small number of punters, big betters, who created a big stir in the ring when they moved. However, many of them are not as active as heretofore. <Col N="265" /> leading to a major decline in on-course betting.</P>
    <P>When established this new Authority should endeavour to render racing activities more attractive to families generally. It has become a very expensive outing for them with admission charges, placing a few bets and purchasing drinks and meals. If we are to revitalise the racing industry it is particularly important that admission fees are reviewed. We have seen considerable improvement in the facilitites provided at a number of tracks nationwide, which must continue, because there is enormous competition overall within the leisure industry. It is vital that the racing industry acknowledges that competition and copes with it.</P>
    <P>It must be difficult for people not involved in racing to understand some of the terms used. The word &ldquo;novice&rdquo; is frequently used &mdash; it has nothing to do with religious orders &mdash; for a young horse starting out who has not won and is normally associated with the national hunt; a maiden in the Curragh is a two or three year old who has not won a race; a short head, which has nothing to do with the size of the horse's head, is the term used for the winning margin. It would be no harm to produce a booklet explaining some of the racing terms. It may not be a best seller but it would make interesting reading.</P>
    <P>I have serious reservations about section 19 which deals with the race-fixtures committee and I wonder whether it is necessary. It states:</P>
    <P>(1) The Authority shall establish a committee (&ldquo;the race-fixtures committee&rdquo;) to recommend in accordance with the terms of reference decided by the Authority the fixing of the annual list of race-fixtures.</P>
    <P>(2) The members of the race-fixtures committee shall be appointed by the Authority and shall consist of the following members&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a chairman who shall be both a member of the Authority and a steward of the Racing Regulatory Body, . . .</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> If we are setting up a horseracing authority we ought to tell them exactly what is required rather than restrain them in this manner.</P>
    <P>The matter of race fixtures is a very important issue and has caused problems for me on a number of Sundays. Frequently hurling and football matches in Croke Park take place on the same day as race meetings. In Kildare the Moyglare stakes has clashed with the county final on a number of occasions. It is difficult to be in two places at the one time, although I would like to be. When the race-fixtures committee is setting out the list of fixtures for the year consideration should be given to other sports to try to avoid clashes. I realise it is not easy as we have only 52 Sundays in the year. While racing does not take place all the year round, summer racing is very popular. In the case of important races it is important to avoid such clashes in the future.</P>
    <P>The attractiveness of racing and what has gone wrong with it has received much publicity recently. A number of people in Kildare who are keen racegoers have no hesitation in selecting the national hunt as being much more popular than flat racing. From a breeding point of view it is important to have a number of group races to maintain the standard of Irish racing but it is not proving attractive to the customer.</P>
    <P>During the next couple of years we should try to put in more handicaps rather than have cards covered with group races and maidens in the Curragh. We must have more open racing on which punters are prepared to bet. Many of the races for two and three year old maidens have been dominated by two or three trainers and in many cases there are odds on favourites in the races which turns people off and they lose interest. We will have to restore the racing industry to a healthy state and make Ireland the greatest racing country in the world.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, on the initiative he has taken. The racing industry is indebted to him. He is a man who understands racing, knows <Col N="267" /> what it is about and knows what it needs. Despite opposition from a few quarters, the racing industry respects and acknowledges what he is trying to do. I have no doubt it will be a success but when the authority is being put in place I appeal to him to appoint people who will represent the overall industry and not to forget the consumer. I agree with the attitude of the Racing Club of Ireland, to which reference was made last week. The opinions of consumers must be sought on this occasion and acted on. I thank the Minister and wish him every success. I think he is on a winner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is close to my heart. After politics and my family my greatest fascination and passion is racing. When my political career is over, however long or short it may be, I intend to make my entire living or as much as possible from the racing industry. The views I will express are entirely my own; I am not representing my party. I admit I have a vested interest. I have a serious interest in the off-course business which I hope to further. I would like to give a broad welcome to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the future of the Irish racing industry. I go racing frequently and I hope to be in Punchestown later today. On a yearly basis I see the trend reflected in the figures. Legalised on-course betting has diminished from over £100 million to approximately £75 million. Any business that suffered that level of decline in turnover would have to ask the most serious questions about its future. If that happened in my business or in any business you would have to re-appraise your situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard this Bill being criticised. I read the <i>Racing Post</i> every day, <i>Sporting Life</i> and the <i>Irish Field</i> and I have read the criticisms by many people who are respected in the racing industry. I heard Mr. Jonathan Irwin on the radio the other day, members of the Turf Club and so on. I am conscious of the criticism that we do not want to get the State more involved in the racing industry and that <Col N="268" /> the integrity of the people who have served us for 200 years should not be undermined. The racing industry is coming to the taxpayer looking for £6 million or £7 million per year. Whether this money goes to health, education or social welfare the taxpayer is entitled to see how this money is spent. I do not believe the representatives of the Turf Club, the racing industry, can say: &ldquo;Give us the money but hands off in terms of approach&rdquo;. That is not on in the nineties. That reality has not dawned on some people in the racing industry. That is separate from the integrity of racing rules, the fairness of racing, the judges, the starting, the steward's inquiries and so on. The business of racing needs to be modernised and brought into a proper context of competing with other leisure industries.</P>
    <P>I have heard much nonsense about revenue from off-course racing being the entitlement of on-course racing. It is utter rubbish. The biggest single new produce in off-course betting offices is the Lotto. People can bet on three out of six numbers, on the first or on any combination of numbers and get huge odds. They bet every Wednesday and Saturday.</P>
    <P>Last Monday a race meeting in Sligo was called off due to bad drainage on the course. That would not have made one whit of difference to the turnover of off-course betting. The principal events that account for off-course betting turnover are (1) British racing, (2) dog racing, (3) Irish racing, with sports betting being the largest growth market, that is the betting on the snooker championships, the US Golf Open, lottery and football coupons. Paddy Power, the largest Irish chain of bookmakers, see future growth in the off course industry from attracting more women, and others who do not go racing, to come into betting offices. The off-course betting industry does not owe Irish racing anything. If six or seven tracks were to close down in the morning it would not affect turnover in off-course offices. As long as Satellite Information Service, SIS, televises racing from South Africa, Hong Kong, Sedgefield, Cheltenham and dog racing at Hackney the <Col N="269" /> punter will bet on it. If the Irish industry was really concerned about off-course betting they would have arranged for televised broadcasts of Irish meetings through the SIS. Satellite Information Service is the life-blood of off-course betting because the punter can see the racing live on television and the betting shows. If Irish racing wanted to boost off-course betting turnover the first thing it would do would be to join the Satellite Information Service and benefit from the revenue generated.</P>
    <P>I have heard the racehorse trainer, Mr. Jim Bolger, and Mr. Denis Brosnahan and so on criticise this Bill. I have the highest regard for those people and they understand what is needed to modernise the industry. They deserve a great deal more credit for the work they are doing. Mr. Moriarity and Mr. Dowling deserve our praise for trying to reach a consensus but the single failure is that the racing industry think like producers, and this is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I recall a crisis in the American motor industry and the focus on the problems of the car manufacturers instead of the consumers. Deputy Seán Power rightly raised the issue of off-course betting offices on the track. This facility is available on every track in the United Kingdom and one can place multiple bets and bets on all sporting events in these offices, but that service is not available in Ireland. Oncourse bookmakers do a limited amount of betting on an SP basis but I am told that irrespective of the Bill they will stop it; that is one example of the producer, the bookmaker, stopping what is in the consumer's interest.</P>
    <P>The racing industry is principally run for horse owners and not for consumers. A glance at the composition of race cards and fixtures shows that they are primarily geared to deal with horse owners. I can understand the plight of horse owners. Racehorse ownership is a most ill-advised investment and one should be able to afford to lose any money invested. It is not an economic proposition. I could recount a litany of stories about trainers, but I will not bore the House.</P>
    <P>If racehorse owners want to attract <Col N="270" /> more money into racing they must realise that the life-blood of racing comes from the 5 per cent levy that on-course bookmakers deduct on bets. That will be the source of revenue. They may get £3 million-£6 million from the taxpayer but that will not be the determining factor for the future of racing. The levy will decide its future. All policies must be geared to the single objective of increasing the yield from the levy that has diminished so rapidly during the past five years. The Minister should not be fobbed off by those claiming it is the result of recession. There is no recession in the off-course betting industry and turnover has grown by at least 5 per cent each year. The Exchequer returns bear out that there is no slump or decline in betting; the success of the national lottery is one example. People are betting more than ever but they are not turning up at race courses. Racing is run to suit horse owners but this is very short-sighted. Unless the levy is raised, the prize money will not make it worthwhile to own a horse. We need to modernise the industry and gear everything to increasing the yield from the levy.</P>
    <P>Those appointed to the board should have a businesslike approach. I see Irish racing going the same way as dog racing. I was at a dog track on Monday night and they price up prices only 30 seconds before the race and one could not get £200 on a dog. It is a mickey mouse business. Racing is going in the same direction, the pricing is going up later and bookmakers will tell you that they have a one horse book and the rags do not count. It is not competitive enough. The industry needs to be geared up in order to have competitive racing.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with specific matters &mdash; my colleague, Deputy Doyle, will be tabling amendments on these sections. Section 45 deals with appeals against sanctions of the racing regulatory body. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Racing Regulatory Body shall establish an appeals procedure to ensure that any appeal referred to in <Col N="271" /> subsection (1) may be heard in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;. That may sound insignificant but I can give examples. It is outrageous that there is a fine of £25 if one does not run a horse that has been declared overnight &mdash; even though the horse is dead. There is a standard fine of £25 and no excuse is acceptable. Small trainers have enough difficulties without having to put up with that nonsense. If, in error, a horse is double entered in two races, there is an automatic fine of £100. That is an outdated practice.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the racing industry. I declare a vested interest and I would like to be financially involved in on-course betting. Let us see how the system works. If a licensed, registered bookmaker wants to operate on the course, the first thing he must do is comply with the rules of on-course bookmakers. He must go to the end of the line as pitches are in order of seniority. At the end of the line one has to lay 9:4, about a 7:4 shot, to get it into the back. That causes two problems, first, there is a one horse book &mdash; the whole theory of betting is that you lay to lose each horse to the same amount and have a rounded book and anything over 100 per cent is profit. Second, one cannot get a rounded book because the flow of punters is not passing the end of the line and are all up at the busy end where the senior operators are. One may have only two horses laid on one's book and because one is laying over odds and does not have a rounded book one goes out of business. The catch is that one must wait at the end of the line for five years before being allowed to buy a pitch up the line.</P>
    <P>If I had enough money and someone was prepared to sell I could buy a betting office anywhere in this country. There are bookmakers prepared to sell pitches but they cannot do so because it is not possible for those at the end of the line with one horse books to make a living. As a result bookmakers who lay virtually nothing in terms of a stake are retaining <Col N="272" /> pitches and preventing new entrants from entering the business.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept an amendment to section 48 under which the Irish Horseracing Authority would allow those with two years' experience to buy a pitch which should go to the highest bidder. This will only arise where someone wishes to sell, if someone has a son or an employee they will not want to sell a pitch. I ask the Minister to impose a change &mdash; the five year rule is not set down in legislation, it is a bookmakers' rule &mdash; and introduce a two year rule.</P>
    <P>Unless the racing industry adopts wholeheartedly the concept of Sunday racing it will encounter further problems with the levy. I am aware that many people involved in the industry, including bookmaker clerks and racecourse attendants, do not like to work on a Sunday and that a dispute about overtime payments caused a difficulty with the fixture list last year. All the fixtures listed for last year did not go ahead and this led to difficulties with funding.</P>
    <P>Sunday racing is here to stay. Last Sunday the dog track in Kilkenny which, like many others, is experiencing difficulties, held a meeting as an experiment and it was an outstanding success. People attended who had never gone greyhound racing. Many people work a six day week and we have to focus on the consumer.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider widening the ambit of the tote. The tote in the United Kingdom has ambitious plans to develop its principal products, the jackpot and the placepot, and offer them off course. Corals has a link with its terminals nationwide. The totalisator investors operate on a credit basis &mdash; I used to be one of their clients &mdash; but this is a limited service. In respect of the main pools there should be a link with terminals and facilities.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Authority is a vexed question and has been the subject of much debate. I have already suggested that the Minister should appoint those who know how to run a leisure business given that racing has to compete with bowls, Gaelic games and other sports. It must be successful in selling its products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> The racecourses &mdash; AIRS &mdash; will have two representatives on the Authority. By virtue of the fact that the Racing Board owns Mallow and Leopardstown racecourses and that the Curragh is owned by the Turf Club, racecourses are well represented. This would give the Minister more scope if he decides to amend the Bill.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea on behalf of the Racing Club of Ireland. I have attended the annual dinner of this organisation which is non-political and genuinely interested in improving racecourse facilities. It has given awards to racecourses and to jockeys, owners and trainers to mark great achievements. It has been a good ambassador for the business. In Britain racing clubs are common; they are the next relation of syndicates of racehorse owners. Racing clubs should, therefore, be supported. The Minister would do himself much good if he appointed a representative of the Racing Club of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many myths have been perpetrated about the Bill. Those involved in off-course betting owe nothing to the racing industry; they can get on fine without Irish racing. I support the injection of cash by the taxpayer into the industry because of the 20,000 jobs involved but if the taxpayer makes that investment it is only reasonable that there should be a root and branch reform to modernise the industry to make it consumer driven and its main mission should be to increase the racing levy. Unless it thinks commercially it will not think successfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation dealing with an indigenous industry which has a wonderful tradition and great potential which has still not been realised. Our horses are the best in the world and this is a tribute to those who have been involved in the industry throughout the years, including breeders, <Col N="274" /> trainers and jockeys, especially in Kildare, Tipperary and parts of Cork, where the industry is particularly strong.</P>
      <P>This significant industry employs 25,000 to 30,000 people. If someone was to announce the creation of 25,000 jobs it would be warmly welcomed. When the industry is going well there is a boom in employment. For instance, there has been a significant increase in employment in the surrounding areas arising from the success of the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary where great horses have been produced.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of considerable concern that the industry has been in decline in recent years. Attendances at race meetings have fallen and, with the decline in on course betting, has to be addressed. The two are interlinked and it is appropriate that we are tackling these problems by putting a legislative framework in place. We need to make racing more attractive for the general public and adopt a much more businesslike approach.</P>
      <P>The Bill will not satisfy everyone and it has been the subject of much criticism. For every proposal there is a counter proposal which merits debate in the media and on radio programmes, which is desirable. While I am concerned about some of the details it is necessary to amend the legislative framework covering the industry which was put in place almost 50 years ago and modified approximately 20 years ago. There had been many changes in the meantime in relation to the production, management, care, feeding and training of racehorses which have had an impact on the industry. People's attitudes have also changed and they now expect better facilities. In addition standards have improved. It is important, therefore, to modernise the industry.</P>
      <P>When the original legislation was enacted 50 years ago there was no television. Deputy Yates referred to its impact on the industry and he is well qualified to speak about that matter. We have to face reality and make adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much criticism has been expressed <Col N="275" /> about some aspects of the Bill but I should acknowledge that it has been welcomed by many of those involved in the industry, including some of the leading trainers. Although there has been a great deal of criticism of the Bill, many people in the industry welcome it and are very much in favour of its general principles. The debate has been coloured by people's concerns about the Turf Club which has been a major influence in Irish racing for the past 200 years. They have made a major contribution and nobody would want to detract from that. However, time moves on and other interests have a legitimate right to be represented in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures that breeders, trainers and the general public will be heard at the top table. A substantial amount of taxpayers' money goes into the industry. It is, therefore, particularly important that the interests and concerns of consumers should be a top priority. Otherwise the industry cannot succeed.</P>
    <P>The growing involvement of business people in the industry in the last ten to 15 years has been important, and has resulted in new developments. It is important that the industry be run in a business-like way that is dominated by market concerns and the involvement of the public and that the interests of the punters should be represented on the Authority. I hope the Minister will take that into account in putting the Authority together.</P>
    <P>There is a rule of thumb in the industry that three wins a year are necessary to pay the cost of keeping a horse in training. However, most people in the industry do not have a chance of attaining that level of success &mdash; 95 per cent of people who own horses lose money on them. Horseracing is, in many ways, a sport for those who have money that they can afford to lose. In the context of the value of the prize money, Deputy Power mentioned that there are about 4,700 horses in training at a cost of £10,000 a year each. About £50 million is spent on training every year. That is an important expenditure and there may be some scope for lottery <Col N="276" /> type projects, although I am somewhat reluctant even to mention the term because it has become an all-purpose political joke that politicians resort to when they can think of nothing better to say.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that this country should continue to invest a significant amount of money in research into the horse industry, including improved training and management techniques, improved breeding methods and the treatment of injured horses. This has been neglected but if we are to protect our reputation as a producer of great horses, a producer of winners, it is essential that we invest in research.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the effect of section 53 on some of the people working in the industry. It could result in their having to pay to go to work because they will have to pay to get onto a racecourse. The Minister should look at this in the context of the concerns of SIPTU which represents these people.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister recently attended a race meeting in the North and met his counterpart there, the Northern Ireland Secretary of the Department of Agriculture. I hope he had a good day and that he won a few pounds. It is particularly important that he went there. There is some scope in this Bill for improving contacts between this part of Ireland and the people in County Down particularly who have a tradition of racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing his time with me. I compliment the Minister on his foray into Northern Ireland and trust he was successful on the course. I welcome the establishment of a horseracing authority to replace the racing board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horseracing industry is one of our oldest industries, one of the great sports of Irish life. Every farmer in every corner of Ireland who has or has had a horse has hoped to find himself with a winner at some horse show and that he could go on to breed. We have a multi-million pound industry and are widely recognised as a producer of fine bloodstock. Our annual sales at Goffs attract some of the wealthiest <Col N="277" /> buyers in the world and our shows at the RDS in spring and summer are the highlight of the calendar of sporting activities.</P>
    <P>The industry is most important in the context of the leisure industry, necessitating the encouragement of sporting activities, betting and the development of bloodstock that can compete with the best in showjumping, racing, etc. Ordinary farm horses, too, might have potential for breeding.</P>
    <P>The Casual Trading Bill provides that everybody who trades casually must have a licence or permit and a tax clearance certificate. I am concerned that it might have implications for the small farmer or trader selling a horse or pony at the Ballinasloe horse fair, the Connemara pony fair or the Maam Cross fair. The farmer selling an animal would not be trading in a mart but, under the Casual Trading Bill, he will become a casual trader and be obliged to have a licence and a permit from the local authority to carry on his business. It would be a shame if legislation which is intended to cover people trading in large scale electrical goods at the side of the road, some of which might be smuggled from another part of the country, were to make it impossible for people to engage in traditional horse trading. That would be very harmful to the small horse fairs around the country, not to mention the horse fair at Smithfield itself. Although that needs to be regulated in other ways, it should not be necessary to have a licence or a permit to sell an animal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rules and regulations which will help to maintain the integrity of the industry. The provision of a code of ethics is important for the Authority and its staff as is the accountability that goes with having to produce annual reports and other reports requested from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand Irish bookmakers are not as generous as our British counterparts in terms of prize money. It is not possible to get as good a starting price at racecourses here as in Britain and, proportionately, our bookmakers appear to <Col N="278" /> make greater profits. What are the Minister's views on that?</P>
    <P>Section 53 could oblige bookmakers assistants to pay an admission fee to their place of work. It is somewhat contradictory to impose that type of charge if we are trying to do something about the 300,000 people who are unemployed. Whatever about the bookmaker having to pay an admission charge, his or her assistant should be allowed free access. I fail to understand why such employees should be charged for admission. They are not members of the public out for a day's enjoyment, they are doing their work. I understand the Minister's predecessor, Senator O'Kennedy, made a commitment in 1989, when legislation on this was being mooted, that no such charge would be imposed. The Minister should discuss the matter with him and delete that provision in section 53. I understand also that it is contrary to a deal negotiated by SIPTU on behalf of bookmakers' assistants under which they were guaranteed free admission to racecourses to work.</P>
    <P>My main concern, if the charge is passed on to the bookmakers, is that it could militate against bookmakers employing assistants. Alternatively, if it is not, it might be worthwhile for assistants to do such work having regard to their low rates of pay.</P>
    <P>Section 53 deals also with having SP offices at racecourses. What is the rationale behind that? SP offices are more than adequately provided for by the tote at racecourses from which considerable benefits accrue to the State. As there has been a reduction in betting at racecourses it seems there is sufficient competion there without introducing more. This would also interfere with employment at racecourses. Will the Minister examine those two provisions in section 53, particularly that relating to bookmakers' assistants? We should do nothing to deter employment in the industry. The objective of the legislation is to enhance employment, to improve the industry, to make it more competitive, to increase standards and to ensure that it operates in a streamlined fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill. I have a number of concerns about the Bill, not least some financial concerns which the House should address. This Bill falls short of what is needed in the industry, I do not often talk here about matters relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but this matter has significant implications for our entire commercial and industry base.</P>
      <P>The racing industry owes much gratitude to the late Joe McGrath. Through his vision the racing board was set up in 1945.</P>
      <P>The scenario leading to the Irish Horseracing Industry Bill shows that Irish racing is in a poor state. There are two bodies running the industry, the Irish Racing Board and the Irish Turf Club. The Irish Racing Board is a semi-State body responsible for the collection of on-track bookmakers' levies, the running of the tote and the management of racecourses such as Leopardstown, Navan and Tipperary. Paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum states that the enactment of this Bill will have no financial or staffing implications for Government Departments or local authorities. Had this come to my attention during my period as chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would have had it examined. I understand that body is crippled by poor management, over-staffing and standards which need to be revitalised. It runs the only tote in the world which is losing money. That should be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts. I accept there is a need to overhaul the industry, but the Minister is not going about it the right way and there are reservations in the industry about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Turf Club which has been running the industry here for the past 200 years has a worldwide reputation for integrity. It is worth noting that two former Taoisigh, Mr. Haughey and Mr. Cosgrave, are members of that body. It is sometimes criticised for failing to promote the industry, but that is not its job. It is the responsibility of the Irish Racing <Col N="280" /> Board. It is strange that despite the chairman of the racing board being a member of the Turf Club, the relationship between the two bodies is dire. There is great unease in the industry that in the past 18 months communications between the two has been virtually non-existent.</P>
    <P>I have argued for some time that one of the reasons for our high unemployment level is that we do not adequately promote ourselves abroad. As Lord Mayor of Dublin I set up the Dublin International Sports Council and I am grateful for the interest shown in the work of that body by Members of this House, including the Taoiseach. The objective of the council is to promote Dublin as a city where major sporting events can be held. When people hear of Ireland it is often because of a tragedy in Northern Ireland. Dublin and Belfast appear to be neighbouring villages on a map of Ireland. It is tragic that people abroad hear about us for negative reasons. Our economic indicators have been excellent for many years. Our debt-GNP ratio is under control. Our rate of inflation is the lowest in Europe. Our growth rate over a number of years has been twice the European average. We have one of the youngest and best educated populations in Western Europe. In the light of such good indicators why do we have such a high rate of unemployment? The reason is that we have not attracted sufficient investment. Sport is an ideal opportunity for us to promote Dublin and Ireland. People would hear of us for positive reasons. When people hear such reports hotel groups such as Hyatt, who do not have a Dublin location, will begin to consider it.</P>
    <P>Our horse industry has a very high international reputation, so much so that it was able to attract the world equestrian games which will be held in the RDS and at Punchestown. We are in danger of losing our good reputation because of the manner in which our industry is organised. The Bill does not address the shortcomings in the industry. I pay tribute to the Minister for Tourism and Trade for his involvement in bringing that major <Col N="281" /> event here. I also pay tribute to the Dublin International Sports Council, particularly Mr. Conor Crowley and others involved in that success. They have shown what can be achieved. That achievement was possible because we have such a high international reputation in horse racing and the horse industry.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the divergence between the Turf Club and the Irish Racing Board has developed and why the tote is the only one in the world that loses money. That is worthy of inquiry by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. This Bill is devoid of innovation in addressing the crisis in the racing industry.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the powers of the racing authority which are almost all-embracing and allow the Racing Regulatory Body, formerly the Turf Club, to oversee the integrity of race meetings. That does not appear to be a reasonable balance or a necessary provision and the Minister should reconsider it before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many people are offended by section 27 and find its provisions unacceptable. That section states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, advance to the Authority out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine for the purpose of expenditure by the Authority in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of that type of unnecessary restriction and interference. The section is unacceptable because Ireland is the only country in which there is no relationship between the horseracing industry and the off-track betting industry. Countries in which racing flourishes are those which have struck a deal between the Government and the industry about the division of income from a levy or tax generated from off-track betting. A possible division of 10 per cent of the off-track levy is that it should be split so as to give the Government a return of 7.5 per cent and the industry 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A minority report of the Killanin Commission <Col N="282" /> suggested the betting industry should be regarded as a two island one and that if the Irish tax levy fell below that of the UK the larger UK book-making chains should site their settling house headquarters in Dublin, thereby creating an export betting market. That would be an exceptional achievement by our industry and is something that should be pursued. Nothing in this Bill suggests such thinking. It would be better if the industry had a body with such prestige located here which would greatly contribute to it. The Minister should consider that possibility.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better for the industry to rely on a fixed percentage which it could increase through its initiative and performance rather than rely on the dubious and what some people regard as the odius alternative of ministerial grants or hand-outs? The Department responsible for the industry is not the Department of Social Welfare. The mentality in the Department that addresses itself to the issues facing farmers is now addressing itself to those that face the Irish horse racing industry. The industry is full of many self-starters, innovative and capable people who do not need a hand-out mentality. It would be welcome if those people were given a greater deal of independence.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that accounts shall be produced within six months by the racing authority. The racing board has yet to publish its accounts for the fiscal year 1992-93 despite the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry sought and obtained an additional £1 million last December to make up the deficit the racing board had created in 1993, the first deficit in its history. I am sure the Minister will agree that matter should be studied more closely by the House.</P>
    <P>Section 34 (b) (ii) precludes the tote being allowed trade off-track. Many people view that as an unnecessary restriction. The Minister should consider amending that provision on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Having failed dismally to run an efficient and profitable tote it seems foolish <Col N="283" /> that a semi-State body should be allowed to set up as a book-maker in competition with the private sector, as provided for in section 35. If it cannot run a tote will it be able to run a private book-making service and will the public have confidence in it?</P>
    <P>Section 39 sets out the role of the Racing Regulatory Body whose functions are restricted to services at individual race meetings. Section 39 (d) states that officers of the former Turf Club will have to seek the permission of the Racing Regulatory Board to attend international conferences of racing authorities. That is an unwarranted interference and a humiliation for the Turf Board. Such permission is hardly necessary. The Minister should indicate the source of that request and the necessity for such a restriction.</P>
    <P>Section 44 gives the Authority a power the former body did not have and the Minister might explain the necessity for it. Perhaps it is beneficial. Why is it necessary that the new Authority should have power in respect of the alteration of rules of racing? There is a strange omission in Part III in that there is no mention of who is to be responsible for the licensing of trainers, jockeys and so on, a power that lay with the Turf Club. Will the Minister give his views on that matter, or does he intend introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with it?</P>
    <P>Section 53 deals with regulations for authorised bookmakers. All the items under subsection (1) (a) to (e) should be the commercial decision of racecourse management rather than of the Authority. If the forerunner to the Authority is anything to go by, one could not have great confidence in its commercial judgment and its ability to run a commercial exercise. That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) of this section there is a restrictive clause which should be deleted. The most successful racecourses will strive for a seven day, multi-use facility. When Croke Park is refurbished it will be used for events other than Gaelic games, and we are kidding ourselves <Col N="284" /> if we think that will not be the case. People will not take corporate boxes in Croke Park if they can attend only an occasional game in the year. The name of the game is to use the facility all-year round. Let us take Leopardstown as an example. Clients who patronise Leopardstown racecourse on non-race days will be prevented from using the betting shop facilities as, under this clause, it will be closed. Is that a necessary requirement? I ask the Minister to consider that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House why subsection (3) (a) of section 59 is necessary? That subsection states:</P>
    <P>An authorised racecourse shall be authorised for a period of five years&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) in the case of a first racecourse authorisation, from such date as the Authority may determine, or</P>
    <P>(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent racecourse authorisation, from the day after the expiry of the last authorisation.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this subsection? I do not understand why it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 60 and 61 are much too restrictive. Sections 65 and 66 seem sensible amendments to the liquor laws as they affect racecourses. In section 75, remembering that manning levels and staff relations within the Racing Board were a serious handicap to the financial wellbeing and future of the industry, it may be unwise to transfer this problem to the new authority. Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter. The offices of the new Authority will be those of the old Racing Board. Criticisms that the Authority is in reality Board II without reform and greatly enhanced powers seem to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>The formula suggested in the Schedule as the way in which the board will be formed is highly suspect. For example, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association has two nominations to the Seanad, yet it cannot select its own representatives. It has to put up a panel of those candidates, one of whom will be chosen by the Minister. The formula has <Col N="285" /> been referred to in the <i>Racing Post</i> as nationalisation in everything but name. While some utilities may benefit from nationalisation, racing is not one of them. The greyhound industry has certainly not prospered under Government control.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out two serious omissions from the Bill. If it is accepted that the horseracing industry can survive only if linked to off-track betting, it is remarkable that there is no mention of off-track betting in the Bill. Virtually all Irish racecourses face serious financial problems and will not survive on turnstile receipts, the level of which is set by the Racing Board. The Bill does not suggest how racecourses will be rewarded to enable them to prosper &mdash; for example, with a share of betting turnover on-track or inter-track returns. I hope the Minister will address the concerns I raised, which are shared by people involved in the industry. It would reflect well on the Minister and would be magnanimous of him if he were to bring forward amendments to meet the concerns of Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. A bone of contention among all those involved in this industry is that it has not been given sufficient attention down the years. The Bill presents an opportunity, which we will not get for a considerable time again, in view of the amount of legislation to be put through the House, to undertake a root and branch examination of the industry which is in need of an overhaul. Like most sporting events, the racing industry has suffered from the recession. People who do not have much disposable income will not frequently attend the racetrack. However, if we are to believe economic advisers who say that the economy is improving, we should avail of this opportunity to tackle the many problems that have existed for years in the industry. It has had to face major competition from other sporting events and leisure activities that have come on-stream in recent years, and use high-powered advertising. Perhaps the Racing Board did not take <Col N="286" /> on board the level of competition which it encountered.</P>
      <P>Even during the recessional period many changes have been made, some of which have been for the better, particularly Sunday racing. A greater number of families who, for one reason or another, could not attend race meetings on weekdays are attracted to meetings on Sundays. It has resulted in an increased interest in racing and also an increase in betting. However, there are areas of the industry that have not been improved. For example, Baldoyle racecourse in our capital city has been closed for many years and is overgrown. That racecourse was attended by and large by the Dublin racing fraternity. The greatest tragedy was the closure of the Phoenix Park racecourse. A number of questions must be asked about that racecourse and why it was closed. Perhaps the policy adopted by the owners of the racecourse did not meet with the requirement of those who attend race meetings here.</P>
      <P>We must attract and facilitate the top class horses but I am not sure that we have sufficient numbers of them to justify having two major tracks. We have the Curragh, which is known worldwide. It is sad that the Phoenix Park racecourse closed. The main reason for that was the type of racing being provided there. It did not hold the big handicap races, the maidens and various other types of races which attract the public. I realise the facilities were not available there for mixing national hunt racing with other types of racing but some of the other smaller tracks have been successful because there was a general mix of national hunt and flat racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many success stories with the festival meetings, for example, Fairyhouse at Easter and Punchestown which is being attended by large crowds this year and will continue to draw the crowds because progressive people are involved there. There are festival meetings in Tralee, Killarney, Galway, Listowel, Leopardstown as well as meetings at Christmas. The Derby meeting at the Curragh is a major attraction also. There are many problems, however, with the <Col N="287" /> meetings held between these major events.</P>
    <P>Racecourses have to be maintained to some extent 52 weeks of the year and this must be addressed. I do not want to see more racecourses close because that would damage the industry.</P>
    <P>We must give as much assistance as possible to the people who provide the horses for meetings. According to the figures we have been given, approximately 6,500 to 7,000 horses are registered each year for racing, approximately 4,700 appear on our racecourses and of those only 1,200 win races. If that is the case, many owners have had little return for their major investments. It is well known that the average training fee is approximately £150 to £200 per week and that does not include veterinary fees, travelling fees, entry fees or the many other fees that arise.</P>
    <P>The small owner who may be a breeder also may keep a foal for national hunt racing only to find after four years that the animal will not even appear on a racetrack. The same can happen in the case of someone paying a large sum of money for a yearling and incurring all the various expenses involved in bringing it to the stage at which it could race.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of people syndicating horses is welcome. It is obviously an economic necessity; the costs are shared, but it provides the same amount of enjoyment although the return is not as great. I appreciate the difficulties involved and the Minister's success in providing additional funding this year. It must be ongoing and spent properly. I am sure funding was required in many other sporting areas. However, the Government's decision to provide this funding will reap rewards in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Most betting takes place in SP offices from which approximately £31 million is collected in revenue each year. Unfortunately, all of that money does not come from betting on Irish races; the major proportion of it comes from betting on English races. If racing is not encouraged to develop there will be no need for SP <Col N="288" /> offices. Indeed, many have closed in the past few years. As against that there has been major investment in some others where British bookmaker chains bought out a number of the family owned businesses here.</P>
    <P>On-course betting in Northern Ireland is tax free. A 5 per cent tax is imposed here but that does not deter the punter. If the punter gets good value for money and is happy with the facilities to enjoy good racing, he or she will not object to paying the tax but off-course betting has a role to play, and I hope that some mechanism can be found to ensure that revenue from that source contributes to the funding of racecourses.</P>
    <P>Tote betting here leaves much to be desired. I am not happy that sufficient effort is being put into ensuring that there is a shortening of the queues at races. There is nothing more off-putting than to see people queuing to bet on the tote. The smaller punter and families prefer to bet on the tote but if they have to queue for 20 minutes or more between races, they will be put off placing bets. Major technological changes have taken place in tote betting but we have a long way to go. We should examine the British system and other systems which appear to be much better than ours.</P>
    <P>The proposal that SP facilities will be available on the tracks is welcome. It will not generate much revenue but it will provide an extra facility for the punters who want to avail of it. It may encourage punters to leave the betting offices and go to race meetings where they would enjoy mixing with the many people who attend these events, particularly the smaller meetings, at which there is a tremendous atmosphere which is what racing is all about. For instance, at Bellewstown each year &mdash; not 100 miles from where I live &mdash; the facilities are not the best but there is great atmosphere and the turnover is huge. Some of the major tracks would be delighted to attract such attendances. In Kilbeggan which is another major success story, a number of meetings are held each year.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about employment in the industry. There are excellent stud-farms <Col N="289" /> in my area giving major employment. Some of these have been taken over by the Arabs who invested heavily in them, and continue to develop them. There are also some poorly paid employees because in many cases the investment was not made when times were good and stud owners are not able to cope now. Unfortunately in some training establishments conditions are not good for the people who work there. Many problems encountered by trainers relate to owners not being in a position to pay training fees. They foot the loss and that filters down to the individual who works in the stable.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the Authority because the only relevant criterion in selecting people for membership, irrespective of what group has a right to nominate them, should be that they have a genuine interest in the industry and wish to improve it. I do not accept the arguments regarding political favours and selecting old cronies.</P>
    <P>If the industry does not survive, thousands of people will lose their jobs and Ireland will not be as well known in racing circles as it is today. I hope the racing Authority will ensure that facilities are improved. Racecourses must not be neglected. It would be damaging if we cut corners in that area and on Committee Stage we will tease out the Minister's thinking on funding. There is no point in throwing money at the industry unless it is properly spent. The Authority will have a responsibility to ensure that whatever money is provided must be spent properly in the long term interest of racing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about <Col N="290" /> that but like all racing tipsters his tips on racing need to be taken with caution. He is very interested in racing and writes a courageous column in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Evening Herald.</i></P>
      <P>The industry has been neglected over the years. Governments took a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards it and allowed it run on its own rails. That it has done so is a tribute to the standard of Irish racing. We lead the world in horse breeding. The climate, unholy as it is to most of us, lends itself particularly to the horse breeding industry.</P>
      <P>I will not mention the standard of Irish jockeys because their contribution, particularly to English racing, is extraordinary. Pat Eddery is surely the greatest jockey in the world and Mick Kinane is only a short head behind him, if that. The extraordinary contribution of Irish national hunt jockeys to English racing is exemplified by the thrilling spectacle everybody is watching this year between Richard Dunwoody and Adrian Maguire.</P>
      <P>Racing is a complex industry. I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today that 16,000 people attended Punchestown Races yesterday. Most of them were only there for the beer &mdash; socialites who like to go out for a day's racing and put 50p or £1 on the tote. I wish I was like them but unfortunately I suffer the affliction of being a gambler. Most big gamblers do not go to Irish races as a rule. I am one of them. In Ireland most of the gambling is on English races in bookmakers' offices. There are many reasons for that, one common one is that the punter does not trust Irish racing. A few years ago I contrasted it with the hit musical &ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof&rdquo; and suggested an apt name for it would be &ldquo;Fiddler on the Hoof&rdquo;. Some people in the industry resented that but it struck a chord with the punters who do not know what is happening in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a belief that Irish racing is not run as cleanly as English racing or, to put it in more acceptable terms, they do not always run &ldquo;on their merits&rdquo;. That is an opinion I hold over 40 years' punting and why my hair is white. I am glad to see <Col N="291" /> the Minister's is not. It is good to see a Minister take a real interest in horse racing.</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought which believes that the Turf Club should be abolished and that there should be one racing Authority. I do not subscribe to that view. There is a role for the Turf Club but there is need for a horse racing Authority comprised of people within the industry who earn their living from it. The bloodstock side of the industry contributes significantly to our export earnings. If the horseracing industry is to develop increased annual funding will have to be allocated to the racing Authority. Some rural racecourses are finding it extremely difficult to continue in operation and if additional funding is not provided many of them will be forced to close over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Fitzgerald referred to the success of the Galway and Bellewstown racecourses. It is wrong to compare these courses with the Curragh and Leopardstown courses. The Bellewstown course runs a three-day parochial event and it would not be as successful if it held a meeting once a month &mdash; like Galway, one could not race horses at this course during the winter. Many of the patrons who make the Galway meeting so successful and colourful are holidaymakers, socialites who go there to be seen and people who want to be part of the fun. Further consideration needs to be given to venues where racing can be held all-year round.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fizgerald, I regret the closure of the Baldoyle racecourse, where I lost a good few &ldquo;bucks&rdquo;, and the Phoenix Park racecourse. These tracks were forced to close for many reasons, one of which was a lack of interest in them by the Government. By any standards, these tracks, located in the metropolis, should have been successful. The closure of the Baldoyle course over 20 years ago was a tragedy, but the biggest tragedy of all was the closure of the Phoenix Park course in which millions of pounds had been invested by the sponsors in providing a European-style track. The type <Col N="292" /> of racing held at this course did not attract the required hordes of racegoers.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider acquiring the Phoenix Park racecourse, the turf of which is on a par with that of other European race tracks. I was recently told by a person who was connected with racing at the course that the track could be ready for racing within two months. The facilities at the course are magnificent, but a difficulty arose with photofinishes and the angle at which horses were raced, which apparently was not attractive to the public. The other facilities in the course could be made available for sports such as soccer, Gaelic football and tennis. I believe sporting organisations in Dublin would be only too willing to avail of these facilities. The Government should make money available for the holding of a different type of race meeting at the Phoenix Park. This track, which is located virtually in the centre of Dublin, could be made financially viable if proper consideration was given to its development.</P>
    <P>I am not pointing a finger at him &mdash; all Governments are guilty of making political appointments &mdash; but I hope the Minister will not politicise the appointment of the members of the Authority. He should adopt an even-handed approach to the appointment of the 13 members of the Authority, which should include a representative of the turf supporters' club. Although I have never met him, Kevin Smith is reputed to have made a meaningful contribution to the horseracing industry. The ordinary racing supporter, the punter, must be represented on the Authority together with representatives of trainers, the bloodstock industry and bookies.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the unholy subject of bookies, with whom I have had a love-hate relationship all my life. I spent too much of my time in bookmakers' establishments, which one could call houses of sin. Bookmakers do not make an adequate contribution to the horseracing industry. As Deputy Fitzgerald said, it takes between £150 to £200 per week to keep a horse. I had a horse for a short period until the bank manager told me I <Col N="293" /> would have to get rid of it. To an extent, bookies can be regarded as parasites. People are entitled to operate as bookmakers once they get a licence, which costs a few hundred pounds. They may not know whether a horse is going backwards or sidewards but they know how to make a living from the punters. The 10 per cent betting tax brings in approximately £35 million per year. How much of that money is redirected to the horseracing industry? Deputy Fitzgerald referred to horseracing as a sport. I agree with him, but it is essentially an industry which needs re-investment if it is to survive and modernise.</P>
    <P>The case for Sunday racing is undeniable &mdash; statistics show that Sunday meetings attract the largest number of racegoers. One of the obstacles to the holding of meetings on a Sunday is the intransigent attitude adopted by the people who operate the turnstiles, bookies and clerks, who almost had a veto on whether racing should be held on a Sunday. This veto should be removed from them so that Sunday racing can be held at all tracks which apply for this facility.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a race meeting was held in Dundalk on 12 July, a particularly significant day in the North. Due to the number of people who escaped, so to speak, from the North to Dundalk on that day there was a huge attendance at the meeting, which helped that track which was struggling at the time. Because of the attitude of the people in authority who decide whether racing should be held on a Sunday, this meeting was not held in subsequent years. Every track should be able to hold racing on at least one Sunday during the year. The holding of racing on a Sunday would also attract an increased number of English punters.</P>
    <P>There are constant flights from London to Paris for racing at Longchamps and other French tracks on Sundays. It is accepted that many English punters attend Sunday race meetings in Ireland which, if developed, would be a source of revenue for our racing industry and from which our economy overall would benefit. The abolition of on-course betting <Col N="294" /> tax would be a huge attraction. For example, there is no betting tax imposed on race meetings held at Downpatrick or the Maze, Down Royal, in the North which has helped those tracks enormously in recent times, they had been almost extinct some years ago as they did not receive any assistance from the British Government. I attended a race meeting at the Maze on Boxing Day last year when one literally could not move with the numbers of people attending. There are great benefits to be derived from abolishing on-course betting tax at Irish race meetings which would attract more visitors from the United Kingdom to place bets with bookmakers here from which the industry generally would benefit. We must remember that not only will such people gamble but will spend money in those areas, perhaps many taking a stake in the Irish racing industry, through the syndication or purchase of horses for training here.</P>
    <P>On behalf of punters I urge that year-round evening race meetings be facilitated which, both here and in England, proved very successful in summer months. Legislation was introduced in the House of Commons to allow English bookmakers to remain open until the very last race has been run, sometimes as late as 9 o'clock in the evening, whereas here we have denied punters and bookmakers that facility. We have encouraged gambling without having to pay tax. I sinned in that respect before with an illustrious colleague of the Minister opposite, but we confessed our sins to the nation. I do not know whether we were forgiven but certainly we were understood by many people. The fact of life is that the Revenue Commissioners lose thousands of pounds by not allowing bookmakers to open for evening race meetings whereas, in every public house nationwide, there is a bar stool bookie who takes illegal bets, if the publican is not doing so. Two meetings per evening are now broadcast on Sky Television, when punters go into public houses and place bets with anybody who will take them. It is incredible that that fact has not dawned on the Department. One does not need <Col N="295" /> to be an intellectual to realise that the State is losing a lot of money. While that might not fall within the remit of the Minister's Department but of the Minister for Finance, I ask the Minister, jointly with his colleague, to provide that facility and allow the State to reap more revenue from the activity.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to read the provisions of the Bill in detail. I welcome the Minister's interest in Irish racing. In addition to the many receptions to which the Minister will be invited by the racing authorities I ask him to remember the man in the street. Will the Minister introduce legislation to ensure equal betting rules in all betting offices because at present a bookmaker can draw up his own rules, always appearing in very small print? There is a betting column in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> widely read, demonstrating the number of people with grievances about bookmakers who sometimes like to welch. It is illogical that one betting office in a street will have its set of rules whereas another, ten yards further up the same street, will have others. Betting regulations must be harmonised. The people who should undertake that task are the new Horse Racing Authority, the Minister's Department, or both, but certainly not individual bookmakers.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for what appears to be his genuine interest in racing, in constrast with that of his predecessors, giving us a ray of hope that our horse racing industry will receive increased Government aid. We must always remember that we breed race horses better than any other country worldwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded an opportunity to discuss the horse racing industry since we seldom get that chance here. Is it not strange that, with all the Dáil committees established in recent years, none has been established on agriculture, our major industry. While there appears to be a Dáil committee for many issues, some ludicrous, there is none on agriculture. Such a committee would afford everybody engaged in the agricultural <Col N="296" /> sphere an opportunity of voicing their dissatisfaction, wishes or ideas. The main farming organisations were never found wanting in that respect but people engaged in horse racing activities have no forum within which to express their views. No doubt the Minister will appreciate the point I make. The establishment of such a committee on agriculture would be not only educational but enlightening for us all.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy McGahon made his famous contribution three or four years ago we have not had any opportunity of discussing horse racing in this House. While I may criticise some of the provisions of this Bill I hope to be constructive and give the House the benefit of my experience as a former Minister for Agriculture in charge of the racing industry. While the format of the new Horse Racing Authority to replace the Racing Board and, to a certain extent, the Turf Club may appear to be a good idea, I can tell the Minister it will not work as he may anticipate. During my term of office I established a board for the half-breed industry, Bord na gCapall, 11 or 12 years ago, and a number of members were nominated by various nominating bodies. The Minister intends to do the same in the case of half the new Horseracing Authority, have nominating bodies nominate a member from within their ranks. I found that system of nomination to be disastrous and ended up with the worst of some 12 or 14 different boards charged with different aspects of agriculture under my control. I advise the Minister not to allow nominating bodies to nominate their representatives, when the worst type of political activities will be generated within those boards to ensure that certain people are nominated. It is like selecting a team when a father, son or brother serve on the selection committee and two or three other sons seek places, when that type of tribalism occurs it will not lead to a satisfactory result at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is the person in control and he should select the board. If those chosen are bad the Minister should take the rap and if they are good accept the <Col N="297" /> credit. Having had one bad experience I will never again tolerate anybody advocating a nominating body putting forward the name of a member of a board. That is still the position in regard to CBF and some other bodies under the Minister's control. It is a disastrous recipe, you get the worst of all worlds and will not get the best people.</P>
    <P>If the onus is put on the Minister he will make sure to select the best people. I have every confidence in the Minister not selecting people on a party political basis but rather on their ability. The 14 best most representative people, should be on that board, not representatives of a nominating body. The Minister may say it is too late to change the provision in the Bill but I would not agree. He may not wish to amend it immediately but it should be done.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a practice which I find revolting &mdash; it does not refer to anybody here &mdash; that is the racist manner in which BBC and ITV commentators refer to animals with an Irish name running in England. The way they deal with the names of such horses is extraordinarily derogatory and deliberately degrading. In the languages department within the BBC all presenters, newscasters and interviewers who have a problem with a language pronunciation are coached on the pronunciation phonetically. If it is Japanese, Czechoslovakian, Arabic or Chinese and particularly French, they will have it off to a T but if it is Irish we get the greatest bastardisation of all time &mdash; that is the only word I can use which suitably describes what they do. They make no attempt to get the name right. It is a deliberate slur on the Irish. This is a matter that should have been taken up by the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I was at Linfield Park many years ago where a horse with the melodic name &ldquo;An Buachallán Buidhe&rdquo; was running. He was described by the course commentator &mdash; and he still would be described by the BBC and the ITV today <Col N="298" />&mdash; as the &ldquo;Buckalawn Buddy.&rdquo; God help anybody who gives an attractive Irish name to a horse that is sold in England as that horse will be maligned &mdash; it is not the horse that will be maligned but the Irish race. It is deliberate insult and the commentators seem to go out of their way to do so. We have all noticed this practice, nobody has ever said anything about it, but let us hope something will happen as a result of my raising it today. It is rather like the bastardisation of Irish placenames and townlands. It is only when they are translated into Irish that we realise what has happened. We say it was awful of the English to do this 200 or 300 years ago but it is happening in April 1994 and nobody seems to do anything about it. It is a deliberate insult to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I will not shed any tears on the demise or the downgrading of the Turf Club. It was a most undemocratic system. There were some very good people in the Turf Club but, due to the absence of democracy, there were serious suspicions about the calibre of some members and the nature of the decisions. Their decision-making was above board but it has got to be seen to be democratic. The selection of members over the years had much to do with their names or their background, known generally as West Britons or army types. One would not get a position of the Turf Club with a name such as Welsh &mdash; nowadays called Walsh &mdash; or Browne, you would need to have a pedigree &mdash; as is said in racing &mdash; going back over centuries.</P>

      <P>We will have democratisation of the racing industry with the establishment of the new authority and, to a certain degree, nationalisation which could be difficult and create more problems than it will solve. We may be wishing we had never got rid of the west Brits or the people with handles to their names, the Brigadier Colonels or Brigadier Generals or whatever as they had a certain <Col N="299" /> amount of etiquette. We are going from one sphere to another.</P>
      <P>Nationalisation has ruined the racing industry in France. We ought to bear in mind the parallel here. In my younger years the French won the Derby virtually every second year. I cannot recall when a French horse last won it; it is a once in 20 years phenomenon. It is more commonplace for the French to win Gold Cup in Cheltenham than to win the Derby, as they did this year.</P>
      <P>The nationalisation of the racing industry has been disastrous in France and we should be careful not to fall into the same trap. We have a particular niche in the racing world. The Irish national hunt scene is without parallel. Nowhere are there people who are as good with animals as the Irish. We make a mess of many things but with horses and greyhounds we are supreme. We should never forget that and the Bill attempts to build on that expertise. The Irish are the best when it comes to breeding, breaking in, training or riding horses, especially national hunt horses. The Chinese are a little better than us at punting. The performance of our national hunt trainers and jockeys at home and abroad has been the best. Of the top 12 national hunt jockeys in Britain this year, eight are Irish. When we compare our population of five million for the island with 60 million in Britain we can see the disproportionate excellence of the Irish when it comes to performance with national hunt animals. There are good in flat racing also.</P>
      <P>We must study the structure of the industry from the point-to-point racing, although that has not been mentioned today. As the Minister is from Cork where point-to-point racing originated and where it still is the most vibrant part of Irish racing I am surprised it was not mentioned. Every Sunday from January until the end of May there is a point to point meeting in some part of County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be up to 200 horses competing in the 13 races on the same day in Cork. That is the backbone of the racing industry. I am not trying to dismiss other counties. County Waterford produces some of the best national hunt trainers and we had three winners in Cheltenham last year and three Irish winners this year. Counties such as Kilkenny, Carlow, Meath and Kildare are the home of flat racing. In Kerry they might not have even have one horse trainer but they have three enormously successful racecourses. Point-to-point is the basis of the national hunt industry and where the bulk of people are employed.</P>
      <P>There are 26 race tracks in the country and I appeal to the Minister not to allow the Horseracing Authority or anybody else to close them down as part of a rationalisation programme. Some fine courses such as Mullingar and Baldoyle, to mention just two, were closed. That is enough. The race courses in Mallow and Tramore were nearly closed down. This should not be allowed to happen as they are the foundation of the industry. People who start out in a small way at a point-to-point use the courses as a stepping stone to Leopardstown, Punchestown and Cheltenham. One cannot get rid of the middle tier as one progresses in sequence through the system.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that we are among the best in this industry and any money spent is well spent. According to the Bill the Minister will invest £7, but we are taking £35 million in levies from the bookies annually. We are not doing justice to the industry. When my party was in Government we introduced a number of measures that revitalised it. The reduction of betting tax in betting offices from 20 per cent to 10 per cent created enormous growth in legalised betting and generated a tremendous amount for the coffers. That should not be forgotten and the Government should be prepared to plough more of that money into the racing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made significant increases in the grants available to national hunt fixtures and the prize money has never been so good. The average prize money for first <Col N="301" /> place was in the region of £1,000-£1,500, but now the winner is guaranteed at least £3,500. This tremendous stimulus which resulted in economic boom in betting offices and racecourses has meant that we are able to retain some of the best horses at home as well as continuing to export to Britain. The prize money is good enough to allow owners to keep their horses. The prize money at Punchestown is not as good but compares favourably with that in Cheltenham. The initiatives taken eight or ten years ago have paid off.</P>
    <P>The Minister's chief adviser, Mr. Gerry Dromey, was born beside the local point to point course in Dungarvan &mdash; he will be delighted to be told that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <P>If we establish a committee to deal with agricultural affairs we could discuss matters relating to racing. We are overlooking a major industry by having a debate only once every for four to five years. Leopardstown is the flagship of Irish racing. It has wonderful facilities and we should strive to attain that standard at all our racecourses. Fairyhouse has been upgraded and is a wonderful course, as is Punchestown. The facilities at some race courses are only diabolical, and in particular, the toilet facilities are pathetic. The GAA, which has its own problems with such facilities, would be ashamed of them. A significant amount of money should be invested in toilet facilities. Substantial grants should be made available to all racecourses, even those privately owned, for toilet and catering facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have probably omitted a number of important points but my time is up. I hope we are not too late to bet on the <Col N="302" /> Dungarvan horse running in the 3.45 race in Punchestown today.</P>

      <P>I will take Deputy Deasy's advice and have a little flutter on the Dungarvan horse. Tropical Lake is a good horse also. I was in Puchestown yesterday and enjoyed an excellent day's race and entertainment. There were records crowds. Members have made the point that customers want a good national hunt meeting and when they get it they turn up. We need to be mindful of what the customer wants. Punchestown has got the formula right and provides excellent racing together with excellent facilities and this is reflected in the profile of those attending. The punters as well as families enjoy themselves. At a great many racing tracks it is only the hard core supporters who turn up.</P>

I am pleased that there is agreement on how we should put the industry on a sound footing. This matter has been the subject of much debate and discussion. I am also pleased that the people who chaired the discussion groups were complimented: Dr. Paddy Moriarity; the secretary of the Department, Michael Dowling and Denis Brosnan. These people are not involved in the industry &mdash; this allowed them to be objective &mdash; and gave of their time on a voluntary basis. They deserve our appreciation. A significant number of those involved in the industry and on the periphery believe that the industry has tremendous potential. I accept that is the case.</P>

    <P>Reference has been made to the report <Col N="304" /> produced by the committee chaired by Lord Killanin. If I recall correctly, this report was debated in the Seanad. Given the impact this industry has on the economy several years should not go by without discussing it although I accept that Members have an opportunity to debate these points in the debate on the Estimates each year.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club was to the fore in initiating the study carried out by the committee chaired by Dr. Paddy Moriarity and deserves credit for this. This was followed by a further study undertaken by the committee chaired by Michael Dowling, secretary of the Department. Deputy Doyle asked what happened to the draft document produced by that committee which was comprised of owners, representatives of the Turf Club, racecourses and the bookies. Séamus Mulvanney was a member. This document was referred to the parliamentary draftsman's office to prepare the legal text which upset a number of people. I pointed out to the Turf Club and others who had expressed concern that I wanted to get the matter right and would have no difficulty in agreeing to amendments to allay their concerns. Many of the insertions were necessary to ensure the Bill conformed with legal precedent in establishing bodies such as this Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not alter the proposals. If Members table some worthwhile amendments on Committee Stage I will be pleased to accept them. Reference has been made to the 1986 Killanin report on the industry. It has been suggested there is a lack of commitment to provide funding. It is legitimate to ask that while X amount of money will be provided this year what will happen next year? One of the most serious problems is that insufficient funding is available to the industry. Tremendous work is being done by various racecourse authorities, including Punchestown, Fairyhouse and Galway. Over £250,000 is on offer in prize money at Punchestown. Yesterday the prize fund for the novice chase was over <Col N="305" /> £60,000. Tremendous credit is due to those who seek sponsorship to increase prize money. Because of this we are able to keep good horses at home. Those who take high risks by investing in racehorses need good prize money.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deasy mentioned, the tax on off-course betting was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. This was a positive development and has an impact. It was offered as an incentive to those who avail of no tax betting. The allocation of £3 million has also been of help. This year almost £7 million will be provided.</P>
      <P>A sum of a few hundred thousand pounds was made available to establish Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. This has paid a great dividend. This is a small, tightly knit operation led by Matt Mitchell and some clerical staff who have been instrumental in bringing new buyers to Goffs and other centres. They have been superb.</P>
      <P>It would not be in the best interests of the industry to link the question of funding with the question of tax on off-course betting. That is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the context of the budget. The point was made by at least two Members who have an interest in the bookmaking business that a substantial amount is taken in bets on racing outside Ireland. Deputy McGahon mentioned that there is a perception that horses running in other countries make a greater effort. Having just shaken out one's pockets to buy a horse, it is not a good idea to use the racecourse as a training ground. Betting on greyhound racing is popular. So is betting on golf and the lotto. People bet if there is some excitement and a reasonable chance of a return. It is not true that there is a depression in betting; people are betting on other activities and, if they get a fair crack of the whip, they will return to betting on horses. Some people reckon that the percentage bet on Irish horse racing could be as low as 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants to the industry this year are at least equal to the total tax revenue from off-course betting on Irish racing. However, if such grants are linked to <Col N="306" /> betting, and there is a decline in off-course betting in the next few years, they will also be reduced accordingly. To what extent can the new authority influence off-course betting especially when so much of it takes place on events outside Ireland and on other sports over which it has no control? Should the new authority's energies be expended on examining ways of improving revenue from activities which are not under its control?</P>
    <P>One might assume from the debate that if a fixed percentage of off-course betting tax revenue were allocated to the industry, it would be fixed for all time and could not be changed by a future Government. However, a future Government could include in the Finance Act a provision reducing the allocation or eliminating it altogether. If people bet on other activities like greyhound racing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;organisations governing those other activities could look for their slice of the proceeds and would be entitled to do so. What is required is a commitment to provide a reasonable level of funding over an extended period. That would provide security for the industry to plan future development on a strategic basis. I am happy to be judged on my record in that area and I will maintain this level of funding for racing into the future.</P>
      <P>The Killanin report recommended a broadening of the remit of the racing board and the setting up of a single authority for the thoroughbred industry. Killanin was concerned about the structure, organisation and financing of the industry. This Bill addresses those concerns and puts in place a strong framework which, coupled with the necessary financial commitment, should allow the industry to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the manner of making appointments to the authority was raised by a number of Deputies. Deputy Deasy said that the worst possible way of appointing an authority or a board was to select members from a panel of nominees <Col N="307" /> of nominating bodies because the politics of the organisations concerned would be brought into play in making selections. He said the relevant Minister should make the appointments and not depend on nominating bodies. The opposite point of view was also put. Some Deputies felt the Minister was too involved in making appointments and should stay out of that area.</P>
    <P>The system we have devised is a compromise between those two views. Three appointments will be made directly on the nominations of the stewards of the governing body. They have already sent in their nominations. I want the majority of the remainder to be representative of the industry. However, in making the appointments, one must and will have regard to a number of things, including the need for both a gender and a geographical balance. It would be unwise if most of the membership of the authority were from, say, County Kildare or County Tipperary because there are tracks in Galway, Dundalk, Tralee and other places. Then there must be a general balance between the interests involved. If the authority were made up mainly of people who represent flat racing it would be unfair to the national hunt. The intention is to give reasonable representation to all involved.</P>
    <P>There are some interest groups that are not specifically catered for. Accordingly, some authority members will have a wide brief. That is the reason for the system of nominating panels that I can choose from. I am asking the representative bodies to provide at least three names &mdash; one group has voluntarily provided more nominees than required. I can reasonably assume that in putting forward a panel each organisation will select people in which it has confidence. The Bill gives me no discretion to go outside those panels. Apart from the panels, one member of the authority must be representative of the industry in northern Ireland. In practice that person will be selected by the industry there. The three remaining members will be appointed at the Minster's discretion. This could hardly be <Col N="308" /> described as excessive interference in the selection process. To give the Minister some flexibility in achieving the requisite balance it was decided that the number of members should be increased from 13 to 14, giving the Minister discretion over three appointments.</P>
    <P>I accept that the new authority should be consumer-driven. In the initial stages of preparation of this Bill I stated publicly that it was my wish that consumers should be represented on this authority. It would be foolhardy for any industry to make a product without taking account of consumers about it.</P>

      <P>The Racing Club of Ireland is well known to me. It is my intention that the racing public who go through the turnstiles will be represented on the authority. I will make every effort to ensure that this industry is as market-driven as possible.</P>

      <P>In the last years the taxpayers have put £3 million into the industry. However, the industry has no more money at its disposal because the income generated by the industry itself has gone down proportionately with the amount of betting taking place. The tote should be more profitable. Leopardstown racecourse has provided ancillary facilities. The golf course there generates a substantial amount of money as does the discotheque. I have not seen the accounts, but there is probably more money generated from the ancillary activities than from the race meetings, particularly until recently when the full amount paid at the turnstiles did not go to the course. More racecourses should do that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGahon mentioned the Phoenix Park. I frequently attended evening race meetings at the course. The difficulty in relation to the finishing point and the horses almost running into the stands could have been overcome. The <Col N="309" /> finishing points at racecourses throughout the world are unsatisfactory. I attended point to point meetings at which the finishing point was several fields away and yet people attend them. Nowadays in Cheltenham or at meetings such as the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris races can be watched from a big screen in front of the stands. It is regrettable that the Phoenix Park racecourse, which was central, could not have been run profitably.</P>
    <P>Many questions were raised about the position of the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee under the new regime. Deputy Doyle, in particular, referred to the collective wisdom, experience and love of racing by those bodies in the past two centuries and I concur with her sentiments. The expertise of those bodies is outstanding, they have done a tremendous job in the past two centuries. Deputy O'Malley said they should receive taxpayers' money and be left alone. One cannot give a private club £7 million per annum of taxpayers' money and ignore it. It must be accountable to somebody. The Turf Club accepts that it has kept Irish racing to the forefront internationally for more than two centuries, but that the industry should be on a firmer footing. That body initiated the studies undertaken and supports the broad consensus of this Bill. I met members of the Turf Club a few weeks ago to discuss its concerns and, where possible, I tabled amendments to meet them. There must be accountability in respect of taxpayers' money. Providing for the functions of the governing bodies in the legislation will enhance their position. They will continue to do what they have done so well for the past two centuries. Deputies should examine section 39 in detail, it states that the racing regulatory body will be responsible for regulating horseracing, making and enforcing the rules of racing and providing for the integrity of services. The legislation also states that there will be adequate funding for the provision of those services. Despite the difficulties people may have had with members of the Turf Club, nobody doubts its integrity and it deserves our appreciation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Deputies Doyle and O'Malley asked who will license trainers and jockeys. That function is provided for in the rules of racing and under article 39 (b) will remain under the remit of the governing bodies. Deputy O'Malley's remarks about nationalisation and his reference to taking away the powers of a private club do not reflect the reality of the Bill. The powers of the private body concerned will be given statutory backing and the status of the Turf Club will not be otherwise affected. Under section 42 the Authority will guarantee the cost associated with the provision of the services of the Turf Club. I held discussions yesterday with the incoming chief steward of the Turf Club, Michael Osborne, who has an international reputation. I look forward to working closely with him and as far as possible I took into account his concerns when preparing this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley stated that the Minister's involvement is mentioned in almost every section of the Bill, but that is incorrect. The Minister's involvement is written into the Bill only where it has been shown to be necessary from experience elsewhere in the State sector. I refer in particular to the conferring of additional functions, control of public sector pay and borrowing, establishment of subsidies and appointments to and removals from the Authority. Those provisions do not confer involvement in the day to day operations of the Authority which will be given a free hand in that regard. I do not intend interfering with the day to day operations of the new Authority because its members will be the practitioners and will know how to do the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley correctly referred to the operation of the tote on the high street. That is a way of bringing racing to the people and encouraging new punters to take part in this fine sport.</P>

      <P>Many parts of the Bill contain enabling provisions. In other words, the new Authority in its wisdom will be able to avail of enabling provisions to carry out its work in the best interest of the industry and will play a major role in its future. The enabling provisions provide for the development of the tote and a menu of betting opportunities. Nowadays most betting shops are comfortable, punters want to do their punting in pleasant surroundings. Deputy Deasy mentioned the unpleasant surroundings of the facilities at many of our racecourses. People can now go to their local bookmakers and, in comfortable surroundings, bet on races beamed in from all over the globe. People can attend a meeting in, say, Limerick or Mallow and bet on a race in Leopardstown or the Curragh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not least horse <Col N="312" /> racing and point-to-point races. It is outrageous that the horse loving public in Cork have not got an up-to-date course and facilities. I requested the Racing Board to examine the position of Mallow and it arranged to acquire the racecourse, but the fine details have yet to be worked out. Deputies will be aware that we provided funding in the budget to start work on that racecourse.</P>
      <P>The enabling provisions will provide a broader base for funding for the industry. Deputy O'Malley also expressed concern about the possibility of the Authority acting as a bookmaker. That is also an enabling provision and will allow the Authority extend its revenue base to bookmaking if it is feasible. In Britain the tote acts as a bookmaker. Under section 36 the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance will be required and will not be given until detailed research and analysis is carried out by the Authority in that area.</P>
      <P>It will be up to the Authority to examine those areas and formulate and implement fair and progressive policies. For that reason it is crucial that a proper balance is achieved in appointments to the Authority and that no region or sector is isolated or over-represented.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point made about Northern Ireland. I recently enjoyed an evening's racing at Down Royal and I did not do too badly. Under the provisions of the Bill the Authority will not have jurisdiction in respect of Northern Ireland. However, the Minister's direct appointees on the Authority will be represented by horseracing interests in Northern Ireland. In practice, such an appointee will be selected by the industry there and I will make the appointment. The day I attended the race meeting, six races were held at a cost of £12,500, five races cost £2,000 and one cost £2,500. The people there asked how we could hold a festival in Punchestown at a cost of £268,000 with one race costing £60,000. The industry and the two racecourses there need a shot in the arm and I asked the Authority if it can be helpful in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The fixtures will effectively be set by the fixtures committee, the composiiton of which is similar to what has obtained until now. Section 19 (4) states that where the fixtures committee makes a recommendation the Authority will be obliged to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard that argument before and we will see if a fairer allocation can be made by the people in charge. The chairman of the fixtures committee will be a steward of the Racing Regulatory Body which is a 32 counties body. In practice those arrangements will not give rise to difficulty. I will ask the Authority to have particular regard to the potential of racing and the other section of the industry in the North, there is great interest in the non-thoroughbred industry there. I attend the Balmoral show regularly and I am delighted to meet people whom I also meet here regularly. I refer to people who are not directly involved in the industry but who have made a great impact on it. I was pleased to appoint Dr. Noel Cawley as chairman of an interim horse board to develop the non-thoroughbred end of the industry. He has an international reputation and is devoting one and a half to two and a half days per week to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy O'Malley accused me of introducing the legislation too quickly, normally Ministers are accused of dragging their feet and of using delaying tactics. I <Col N="314" /> assure the House that I was &mdash; and am &mdash; interested in introducing this legislation as quickly as possible because the industry needs such an Authority and an improvement in the financial base. Its introduction should not be delayed.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to Lord Killanin. He produced his report in 1986 and there has been a reasonable gestation period to get on with the job of giving legislative effect to the output of that commission and others that followed. Several studies were carried out and there have been exhaustive consultations &mdash; a process which has continued since the publication of the Bill &mdash; in respect of the industry. This is a well thought out Bill with a unique input from interests in the industry which will establish a progressive legislative framework for this industry which has a huge potential.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power referred to the fixtures committee which is important to the industry. The Dowling Committee felt strongly that the Bill should specify the composition of the committee. It would be regrettable if a dispute arose about the formation of the fixtures committee following the enactment of the Bill and the falling into place of all that is critical to the development of the industry. That is why I accepted the recommendations of the Dowling Committee and included the provision in section 39.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Yates's personal support for the Bill. Much of his contribution referred to the day to day operation of the industry, particularly its bookmaking aspects which will be a matter for the Authority</P>
      <P>I will propose an amendment to section 45 which should satisfy the concerns about the appeals system raised by Deputies. I will also propose an amendment to section 53 to address Deputy Costello's point regarding the admission of bookmaker's assistants to racecourses. Those matters should continue to be appropriately resolved between the Authority, the racecourses and the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell said there is no provision in the Bill which relates to the tote and tote betting. Totalisator betting <Col N="315" /> is governed by the Totalisator Act, 1929, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. However, I agree the development of the tote is one area where we can improve the lot of the horseracing sector and get a better return from it. That is why Part VII of the Bill provides for an amendment of the Totalisator Act to remove the restriction which prohibited, in practical terms, the development of tote betting on the high street. I intend to propose amendments, including one to section 39, which will satisfy the concerns expressed by Deputy Mitchell. Deputy Mitchell stated that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association had two nominees to the Seanad, but that does not give them a right to be Members of the Seanad. As former Members of the Seanad know, one has to travel around the country to get elected, and securing a nomination is only the start of your problems.</P>
    <P>The question of giving a share of the on-course levy to racecourses is a matter for the Authority, representative of all sectors of the industry, to decide on how best to distribute the pool of funds available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it needed? Tracks can survive on seven days racing a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On-course betting has decreased from more than £100 million to approximately £70 million. Of the 5 per cent of that amount the racecourses get £3.2 million to £3.5 million per annum which is helpful to the industry. We are proposing that the taxpayers put in double that amount to bring the funding up to £10 million but the industry will have to do a better job in seeking sponsorship. I asked a racecourse manager recently why he did not seek sponsorship from large companies. He said if he did some of the big trainers would wipe out his field with better horses. That happens regularly in point-to-point meetings and the proceeds have to be divided. It is a tricky situation and it is difficult to get the balance right. I am trying to give effect to the broad consensus on the <Col N="316" /> industry. I was pleased that in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 24 April 1994, two of the top trainers, John Oxx and Dermot Weld were quoted as strongly supporting what we are trying to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Interim Report, of the Committee on Public Accounts on Kilrush Creek Marina.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Kilrush Creek Marina project was brought to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts by way of paragraph 46 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 1991 report. The committee has called and examined many witnesses and has spent many hours in producing this report. I think Deputies will agree that this is a worthwhile report. It would be very easy to be critical in a negative sense but I would like to think that the product of the committee's extensive examination would be a great aid to all those embarking on similar projects in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would especially like to thank the members of the committee for the effort and time they put into this report. In the light of recent events it is a fine example of how a cross-party committee could <Col N="318" /> and did work for the benefit of the Irish taxpayer. I would also like to thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his help to the committee during its deliberation. The staff of the committee did sterling work on this report and the committee would like to express its gratitude to them.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from Dublin I am very conscious that the remote areas of the country need special consideration. Notwithstanding the criticism of this project, Kilrush and its hinterland will benefit from the project for many years. It has greatly improved the surrounding environment and I wish it every success. However, that in no way detracts from the committee's criticism of the cost of the project and its management.</P>
    <P>Underpinning what I am about to say is the cold fact that the State ended up paying twice what was originally estimated as its share of the entire project, but got only half the project originally planned. We got only quarter of the value originally projected, in other words what we got cost four times more than what was planned. How did this happen? SFADCo did not cover itself in glory from the outset. Its planning and specification of the project was totally inadequate, which led to an understatement of the likely cost.</P>
    <P>Its financing plan did not bear any resemblance to the reality of what was available. Its financial projections were wildly over-optimistic and this resulted in the subsidiary company incurring costs of £2.3 million, without having the means to fund it, with the State having to bail it out.</P>
    <P>We had the absurd situation whereby the subsidiary, SMDL, had fewer borrowing restrictions than SFADCo, its parent company, and the remuneration of the chief executive of the subsidiary was less rigidly controlled than that of the chief executive of the parent. This was not just as a result of SFADCo's hands-off approach to the management of the project. The unavoidable conclusion is that the board of the subsidiary, which was totally made up of SFADCo, <Col N="319" /> personnel, circumvented the SFADCo board which they all represented.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the lack of supervision on SFADCo's part, the subsidiary was imprudent in its own right. It is clear that the subsidiary managed the project without the traditional prudence that public servants should have when dealing with public moneys. Its approach was conditioned by an over-zealous enthusiasm to put in place a project of a scale which it viewed as appropriate, regardless of the cost which effectively culminated in an almost total abdication of their control and responsibility.</P>
    <P>The lessons we can learn from this case emphasise the need stringently to control the activities of subsidiaries where they have the propensity to expose the parent company and, by extension, the State to major financial repercussions.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications has not come out of this examination smelling of roses. It is obvious from the committee's examination that that Department had enough information at its disposal to alert the company to what was happening, but did not pick up the danger signals until it was too late. Why did this happen?</P>
    <P>Having made an inquiry the Department was fobbed off very easily and did not pursue the matter any further which seemed to give the impression to SFADCo that the Department was satisfied with developments. One representative of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and one representative from the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it was then, were on the SFADCo board and both were aware of the expansion of the project and the increase in costs, particularly during the period March to October 1989. Both representatives were aware of the revised cost of the project of £12.5 million &mdash; the original cost was just less than £7 million. For example, the board representatives from the Department of Industry and Commerce sent a copy of a brief containing the revised costs submitted to the board on 27 October 1989 to the line <Col N="320" /> division of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications with a query: &ldquo;Is it too late to stop this project?&rdquo; On the other hand, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications' representative in evidence expressed his opinion that to pass a document to the line division in his own Department was not the proper way for a departmental representative to function, even though in this case he was the senior officer of the line division responsible for SFADCo.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem was that each representative had a different perception of what his role as a board member entailed. Obviously there is some ambiguity about what their role should be. One of the lessons that has been learned from this experience is the balance that must be achieved as a civil servant board member with the need to protect the Minister's interest. The report illustrates the appalling lack of reporting procedures within the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and between it and the agencies for which it is responsible.</P>
    <P>It is salutary to note that private investors were much more careful in investing their money compared with the less cautionary attitude taken by officials in the three Departments and this is perhaps a sign of the different criteria used. In any future joint ventures between the public and private sectors it should be imperative that private funds be in place before the project is proceeded with.</P>
    <P>As a general observation, I was not entirely happy with the way certain aspects of the Department's evidence was presented. As a result the committee has proposed new guidelines for Accounting Officers appearing before it.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent experiences the Committee of Public Accounts has deemed it necessary to draft and issue, in consultation with the Department of Finance, clear guidelines as to what is expected of Accounting Officers appearing before it in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> (a) the completeness of their briefing on all aspects of the Vote for which they are accountable; (b) the completeness of the information they give in replying to questiv <Col N="321" /> tions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the Committee of Public Accounts, and the accuracy and completeness of the context in which it is given; (c) the steps they should take and the manner and speed with which they should deal with a situation where they subsequently become aware that information they gave the committee was inaccurate, incomplete, out of context or otherwise misleading; (d) the manner in which files are maintained in their Departments, and their co-operation and promptness in providing files to the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General when so requested; (e) the degree of knowledge and control expected of Accounting Officers by the committee in relation to the activities of their Departments and of semi-State bodies and other agencies for which their Departments are responsible; (f) value for money, efficiency and effectiveness, including the maximisation of assets of the Department and (g) internal departmental audit and control mechanisms.</P>
    <P>It is my view also that more up-to-date guidelines for civil servants serving on State boards is required and the Department of Finance has been called on to report back within three months on this matter. It is vitally important that speedy action is taken in respect of both sets of guidelines. We also requested the Department of Finance to ensure that subsidiaries of State companies are subject to the same criteria as their parent company.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has no power of sanction and that is how it should be. It is only right, however, to draw this report to the attention of the Government and ask it to take the appropriate action. If all concerned get away scot free it would send out the wrong signal to the entire public service. It would also reduce the impact of the excellent work being done by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>By debating this report, I hope the House will lay down markers for public sector investment projects in the future and ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> This is the first debate by this House of a report of the Committee of Public Accounts under the new legislation. Last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General Act which was promoted by the Government was passed into law. Part of that Bill requires that reports of the Committee of Public Accounts should be debated as soon as possible within the House. I want to express my appreciation that the Government made time available so readily when requested to do so in this case.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputy Mitchell's final comments, we are happy to have the opportunity to have this debate and look forward to many other opportunities which will be of benefit to the House and to the benefit of how administration, expenditure and other such matters are dealt with in the future.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, I would like to thank the Chairman and members of the Committee of Public Accounts for their incisive and comprehensive report on the Kilrush Creek Marina Project. The committee, in its report, highlighted a number of deficiencies and made some important recommendations dealing with controls on public expenditure, relationships between Departments and State bodies under their aegis and controls and reporting relationships between State bodies and their subsidiaries. Other important issues addressed in the report include controls on salaries of chief executives of State bodies, the role of civil servants as board members of semi-State bodies and the arrangements of accounting officers appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events surrounding the development of the Kilrush Creek Marina project, date from early 1988 and were dealt with by the former Department of Tourism and Transport and not by the Department of Tourism and Trade, which, since its establishment in January 1993 assumed responsibility for the functions of Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in respect of tourism <Col N="323" /> and the development of air traffic at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade fully accepts that mistakes were made in this case and hopes that valuable, if expensive, lessons will have been learned from the experience. Before dealing specifically with the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts I will outline briefly for the record of the House the history of the project.</P>
    <P>The project was first mooted by SFADCo early in 1988 when it was brought to the attention of the board in March of that year. At its meeting in April 1988, the board approved the project at an estimated cost of £7 million. Phase I, harbour and marina developments, was to have cost £3.8 million, and was to be publicly funded. Phase II, tourism works, costing £3.2 million was to have been met by the private sector.</P>
    <P>In June 1988, an application was forwarded to the European Commission for European Regional Development Fund assistance towards the cost of Phase I of the project. In November 1988, a significant development took place which was to become a major contributory factor in the problems later to beset the project. At its November board meeting Shannon Development approved the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary, Shannon Maritime Developments Limited &mdash; SMDL &mdash; to facilitate progress and implementation of the project.</P>
    <P>In December 1988, the EU Commission approved a grant of £1.78 million for Phase I of the project. In October 1989, SMDL advised the board of Shannon Development that the cost of the project had escalated to an estimated £12.5 million. The board refused to take a decision on the proposals put forward by SMDL and took steps to bring the matter under the control of the main board so as to contain proposals for expenditure on the project.</P>
    <P>At its next meeting in November the main board was advised that the views expressed at its October meeting would be fully incorporated by SMDL into its <Col N="324" /> strategy and operation. The board indicated that in any future consideration of the project a number of issues would have to be clarified including: (a) phased implementation of the project to ensure it success while minimising the financial exposure of Shannon Development; (b) options for scaling down the project and (c) the question of private sector funding for the project.</P>
    <P>In October 1990, SMDL made another presentation to the main board indicating a total funding requirement of £9.5 million and a requirement for an extra £400,000 capital from SFADCo. No decision was taken by the board on either the revised total cost of £9.5 million or the extra £400,000 requested from Shannon Development. The board had reservations about the lack of private sector funding for the project and advised SMDL to put a BES scheme in place as soon as possible. Unfortunately, this fund raising effort did not succeed.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, company executives informed the former Department of Tourism and Transport that the project was in debt to the tune of over £2 million with no moneys to meet it. That Department immediately began an investigation into the finances and management of the project.</P>
    <P>Subsequent developments included approval by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce for Shannon Development to borrow £1 million to enable payment of the creditors of SMDL, various corporate changes within SMDL and approval of £1 million European Regional Development Fund grant from the Operational Programme for Tourism. The Department of Tourism and Transport made its approval of SFADCo's current and capital expenditure in 1992 conditional on the company using £300,000 of its voted allocation and £200,000 of its non-voted allocation to reduce the principal of the outstanding loan for the Kilrush project. With the assistance of SFADCo, SMDL managed to wipe out the debt completely by the end of 1992, including £393,000 from the sale of SFADCo's shares in Rent An Irish Cottage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The marina eventually cost £6.55 million and has berthing facilities for 118 boats. No private sector investment materialised for the project.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in the controls applied to this project, as highlighted in the findings of the Committee of Public Accounts, are generally accepted. It is most important to stress what has been learned from this unfortunate experience and to outline the specific corrective steps which have been put in place in the light of that experience.</P>
    <P>The Memorandum and Articles of Association of all subsidiary companies have been amended to bring them into line with the parent company. This amendment specifically includes the rules relating to the powers of subsidiary companies to borrow. No subsidiary company now has greater borrowing powers than the parent, Shannon Development. Therefore, if the need should ever arise, any borrowings will have to be approved by the board of Shannon Development and have the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Revised financial control arrangements have been implemented for the Shannon Development group. Up to June 1991, financial control rested with each company and no formal group reporting system was in place. In June 1991, the financial control of Shannon Maritime Developments Limited was brought within the control of Shannon Development finance division, and in January 1992 responsibility for financial control of all other subsidiary companies was brought within the parent company's control.</P>
    <P>All new subsidiary companies being established by the company must have the approval of the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Finance.</P>
    <P>Revised operational arrangements have been put in place regarding the company secretarial role. The company secretary of Shannon Development is now also the company secretary for all group companies and attends all companies' meetings. In addition, all subsidiary <Col N="326" /> board minutes are copied to the main board members.</P>
    <P>The subsidiary company boards appointed by the parent company's board, have been strengthened by the inclusion of private sector non-executive directors with skills and expertise directly relevant to the activities of these companies.</P>
    <P>Within the executive structure of Shannon Development, the functional responsibilities were revised in June 1992 leading to increased focus and clarification of direct responsibilities for all activities ongoing within the group.</P>
    <P>The role of the chief executive of the main company was redefined in May 1992 which confirmed direct responsibility for all activities within the group including the activities of all subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Shannon Maritime Developments Ltd. was wound down during 1993. The fixed assets of the company will revert back to Shannon Development and a new operating company has been formed to manage, operate and promote the marina. The new company, formed in November, 1993, is Kilrush Creek Marina Ltd., and its board is made up of representatives of the board of Shannon Development, executives of Shannon Development, local authority and local tourism interests. A representative of the Department of Tourism and Trade is also on the board of Kilrush Creek Marina Ltd.</P>
    <P>In March 1992, revised Government guidelines were issued to all State-sponsored bodies, including Shannon Development. These guidelines set the underlying principles that should govern relationships between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis. These guidelines are equally pertinent to subsidiary and associated entities of State bodies. They advise written codes of conduct for directors, including disclosure of interests, and they express the necessity of securing ministerial approval before subsidiaries are established or acquired. There is also a requirement to comply with Government policy on remuneration of chief executive and directors. The chairman of each State body is <Col N="327" /> required to furnish the Minister with a detailed statement of compliance with the above guidelines when the annual report and accounts of the State body are submitted to the appropriate Minister. Shannon Development has given a written undertaking to comply with these guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has taken careful note of the concerns expressed by the committee about the control of salaries of chief executives, the role of civil servants as board members and the duties of accounting officers appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>As regards the guidelines on salaries, the Committee of Public Accounts has concluded that the remuneration limits and guidelines applying to salaries of chief executives in the State sector were ignored in agreeing the remuneration of the chief executive of SMDL. The Minister for Tourism and Trade has noted the request of the committee that the Department of Finance issue clearer guidelines in respect of pay, conditions and contracts of employment in relation to semi-State bodies and in relation to the duties of the board of such companies to ensure that these guidelines are enforced.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, an assurance has been received from Shannon Development that no other management or staff member of the parent board or of SMDL received any additional payment or benefit over and above the salary as provided for under the Government pay policy for the State sector.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts raised a very important issue of wider relevance in the public sector &mdash; the proper role of civil servants appointed to State boards by Ministers. The Minister for Tourism and Trade has noted in this regard that the Committee of Public Accounts recommended new guidelines be issued by the Department of Finance, which address clearly the role of departmental representatives on State boards and the reporting duties to their parent Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> He also noted the committee's request for clear guidelines as to what is expected of accounting officers appearing before the committee. The recommendations of the committee in these areas will be the subject of a formal response by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed about the conclusion of the committee that the Department's involved in processing the application for European Regional Development Fund for this project encouraged Shannon Development to understate the cost of Phase I so as to keep it artificially low for European Regional Development Fund approval purposes. The Minister for Tourism and Trade is advised that there is no evidence to support this conclusion. It is understood that the only advantage to be gained in the processing of projects below a threshold of 5 million ECU was a timing one as approval did not have to wait a decision of the European Regional Development Fund committee which met on an infrequent basis. Projects falling below the 5 million ECU threshold were not subject to any less rigorous appraisal than ones above the threshold. Meanwhile the Kilrush Creek Marina is open for business and is bringing benefits to West Clare.</P>
    <P>The marina project had a successful third season in 1993 on both the marina and boatyard fronts. Almost 4,000 berth nights were sold for the first four months of the 1993 season. Boats from 11 countries used the marina facilities in addition to many boating enthusiasts from all parts of Ireland. Marina income has shown a good increase and the overall operating deficit continued to fall as budgeted for in the projections for the start-up period.</P>
    <P>The boatyard, which operates on a year-round basis, is widely used by leisure and in-shore commercial craft operators along the West of Ireland for the construction, repair, servicing and storage of all types of boat.</P>
    <P>The marina has had a major impact on the economic and community life of Kilrush and West Clare. The project has been the catalyst which prompted the development of several tourism related <Col N="329" /> projects, involving an overall investment of over £2 million in the area, including a major urban renewal programme spearheaded by Kilrush UDC; the development of a local heritage centre theme on landlordism in the area; the granting of national heritage town status; the provision of yacht chartering and sea angling holidays from the marina by a private sector company, Atlantic Adventures Ltd., which has expanded its fleet from six boats initially to 11 today, representing an investment of over £0.5 million; the building of an 18 unit holiday home complex, Cappa Holiday Village, on a site overlooking the marina by a private developer which cost over £1.2 million; considerable private sector investment in the upgrading of existing tourism plant in Kilrush and the Office of Public Works has purchased two pontoon berths at the marina and built Scattery Island visitor centre adjoining the marina to cater for visitors to the island.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Kilrush marina project has been less than satisfactory and has again raised a number of important issues in regard to control of public expenditure. Lessons have been learned and steps taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the specific measures taken by Shannon Development which included revised structures, amended memorandum and articles of association, increased internal financial and secretarial controls and enhancement of subsidiary board expertise, the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance in March 1992, set the framework for the governance of semi-State bodies including subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade is applying the full rigour of the guidelines. While we cannot say with certainty that mistakes will never be made in subsidiaries of semi-State bodies, we now have a control system in place which should help to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 24, 37 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, drawn up by the Labour <Col N="331" /> Relations Commission and published in January 1992 aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action, by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes. Particular emphasis is placed on the avoidance of disputes in essential services, with additional safeguards set out for inclusion in employer-trade union agreements in such services. The code states that its principles are appropriate for employments in the public and private sectors of the economy irrespective of their function, nature and size.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the code of practice is primarily a matter for negotiation and agreement between employers and trade unions in accordance with the voluntary nature of our free collective bargaining system. Regrettably, developments in this regard have been very disappointing and not one employment has yet adopted the code. In the light of this lack of substantive progress, the code of practice was tabled for discussion with the social partners in the talks which led to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> My intention was that a specific agreement at national level with the social partners would have given additional impetus to the code's adoption at an early date in a range of employments, particularly those providing essential services. It is a matter of regret that such an agreement could not be reached with the social partners.</P>
    <P>However, I would invite the attention of the House to the industrial peace clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work's</i> draft agreement on pay, conditions of employment and co-operation at the level of enterprise between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employer organisations, which commits employers, trade unions and employees to promoting industrial harmony. The clause goes on to state that where the parties cannot reach agreement through negotiation on any matter covered by the agreement they shall jointly refer the matter to the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court <Col N="332" /> or, where appropriate, to other agreed machinery. Additionally, and very significantly, the clause provides that the agreement precludes strikes or any other form of industrial action by trade unions, employers or employees in respect of any matter covered by the agreement where the employer or trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. I therefore expect that the parties to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will comply fully with the provisions of the industrial peace clause with a view to the avoidance of industrial action, especially in essential services.</P>
    <P>I am, nevertheless, still anxious that employer and trade union organisations, as well as individual employers and trade unions, redouble their efforts in seeking to negotiate agreements on the code's early adoption and I will be pursuing this issue over the coming months in an effort to obtain a widespread adoption of the code's provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his words of consolation ring rather hollow today when we are facing a possible rail dispute which will immobilise 60,000 Dublin commuters, 20,000 mainline rail passengers and 17,000 tonnes of freight each day? Will he agree that it is not good enough for the Government to say that it tried to negotiate the adoption of the code but failed, and that is the end of the story? Is it not the case that since the code of practice was seen by the trade unions and employers before it was published it was not a surprise? Will he agree that something has gone radically wrong in the negotiations between his Department and the social partners which has led to a refusal to adopt the code of practice? As a result we are on the brink of a strike in one of the essential services recognised in the code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the general thrust of the Deputy's question, my words are certainly not intended to ring hollow. If anything, they should register a degree of anger as I believe both sides should adopt the code of practice. My Department does not have direct negotiations with the social partners on the adoption of the code. This is a matter for the unions in a particular sector providing essential services for the employers. We will continue vigorously to promote the adoption of the code of practice which was drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission in full consultation with the social partners. I very much regret that the code of practice has not been adopted and was not regarded as a code which could be adopted by both sides in the completion of the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was effectively the high noon for the adoption of the code and that the Government has thrown in the towel on having a code of practice on strikes in essential services? The Minister's predecessor said that he would consider legal measures to deal with strikes in essential services if the voluntary code was not accepted. Is that the policy of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. I do not propose to compel with the backing of law workers, whose basic fundamental right it is to withdraw their labour, to adopt the code of practice. A code of practice is precisely that &mdash; it is based on the principle of voluntarism in regard to free collective bargaining between both sides. I strongly urge the adoption of the code of practice by individual unions and the trade union movement in general, particularly in the case of essential services as strike action by one group of <Col N="334" /> workers in a key service can endanger the livelihood and work prospects of many other trade unionists. That argument is broadly accepted by the trade unions. We are dealing with a history and legacy of industrial relations which will not be easily changed. We must, therefore, continue to argue for the adoption of the code of practice which, by its nature, has to be freely accepted by both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Culliton-Moriarty group recommended that my Department should bring forward a programme of proposals to increase the efficiency and operation of market forces through the relaxation of controls, restrictions, licences and other limitations, whether official or private, that operate to restrict entry of suitably qualified people or firms into trades, professions and services.</P>
      <P>During 1993 my Department conducted a wide review of regulations and restrictions which operate to restrict competition. Government Departments were requested to identify in their respective areas of responsibility where official controls or licensing systems may have the effect of limiting the beneficial effects of competition and to consider their operation in the context of improving the competitive climate, more efficient allocation of resources and increasing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the following areas; the legal profession, <Col N="335" /> opticians, public utilities, specifically electricity, telecommunications, oil, gas, air transport, bus transport, broadcasting, taxi-hackney licensing, ports-harbours and casual trading licences.</P>
    <P>I should add that the proposed amendment to the Competition Act, 1991, will provide the Competition Authority with additional powers of enforcement to tackle anti-competitive activity in all economic sectors. It is proposed that the Authority will be empowered to conduct investigations on its own initiative where it believes that competition is being damaged. The Authority will also be able to take court actions against firms or organisations for breaches of competition law. In this respect an inventory of complaints of anti-competitive activity has been compiled from information gathered in the course of the Culliton review and from other sources which may be appropriate to the proposed enforcement bureau of the Competition Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fudging this issue since it was made quite clear that by the end of 1993, his Department would bring forward a programme of proposals to deregulate, whereas no such programme has been brought forward? Furthermore, will he agree that listing various measures is not an acceptable response to a solemn Government commitment to bring forward proposals? Why was the deadline of the end of 1993 not honoured? Does it not make little of the Moriarty report if in this area, as in so many others, training and so on, deadlines are not met? Surely the Minister agrees that these deadlines were solid commitments and that it is not acceptable to let them slip by without any proper announcement?</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that a business survival plan for Irish Steel can be negotiated, agreed and adopted before the end of June 1994.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my press statement of 26 April 1994 when I announced that the Government, at its meeting on that date, considered the survival plan for Irish Steel Ltd., and approved the opening of negotiations to achieve the levels of costs and of efficiencies needed to enable the company to continue in business as a viable commercial entity. The plan, which identifies cost savings of at least £8.4 million per annum, was submitted to me by Mr. Diarmuid Quirke, chairman of the company. While some details of the plan for commercial reasons, must remain confidential a briefing summary of the report has been made available to management and unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised that the negotiations between the unions and the new executive chairman, Mr. P.J. Dineen, <Col N="337" /> whose appointment I also announced on 26 April and who begins work in the company today, may identify some other areas where costs are under the control of the company and where reductions can be achieved. Nonetheless, the cost reductions identified in the plan are those areas identified in the Simpson Xavier report. It is likely that the adjustments will have to include them. However, I have also emphasised that the savings, whatever their source, must reach at least £8.4 million per annum as, unless savings of that order are achieved, there can be no Government investment in Irish Steel and, consequently, no future for the company. I should add, of course, that approval of State investment to underpin restructuring of a steel company is subject to the unanimous approval of the European Union and member states, represented on the Industry Council.</P>
    <P>The plant at Haulbowline continues to make losses at the rate of £1 million per month on average. Therefore it is urgent that a resolution be found as quickly as possible. Accordingly, the Government has set a deadline of the end of June for the conclusion of negotiations with unions. As this deadline must be strictly adhered to it is vital for negotiations to start as soon as possible but at any rate by early May. It is now a matter for the company and its unions to negotiate and agree within this time frame the cost structure and flexible operating practices of a modern steel plant. This is vital if there is to be any prospect of securing a strategic partner for the company. Such a partnership is essential for the long term future of the plant. If unions and management cannot collectively agree to the changes needed to make the company viable and attractive to a partner Irish Steel will condemn itself to closure.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my appreciation and that of the Government of Diarmuid Quirke's commitment to Irish Steel and my regret at his resignation as chairman of the board to allow for his replacement by an executive chairman. Finally, I would like to wish the executive chairman, Mr. Pat Dineen, every success in the very difficult task that lies ahead.</P>

      <P>I endorse what the Minister said in relation to Mr. Diarmuid Quirke and offer my best wishes to Mr. Pat Dineen, who took over this morning. This company has a very troubled history and has been losing £1 million a month for a considerable time. Does the Minister consider it realistic to expect it to effect savings of £8.4 million and have a plan in place within a timescale of two months? Is it the Minister's understanding that this saving will be borne by the workforce? Is there any possibility of effecting a substantial reduction in energy costs, as predicted by the Taoiseach when he addressed the Irish Management Institute Conference in Killarney recently and promised that Russian experts would visit the plant and put in place a scheme affecting a substantial change in energy costs? Does the Minister anticipate that that change will be effected in time to incorporate the £8.4 million saving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Simpson Xavier, consultants appointed by me at the end of last year, at the request of the unions, identified areas directly under the control of the company in which savings could be achieved. The then chairman of the company, Mr. Diarmuid Quirke, with the help of outside assistance, investigated that report and applied its recommendations to the operations of the steel plant in its present form. Based on the Simpson Xavier report and its analysis, they identified the precise manner in which £8.4 million cost savings could be effected under the present operational control of the company. Therefore, those savings&mdash;which are to be effected largely from the entire operating costs of the company, excluding cost of raw materials and of energy &mdash; are within the immediate control of the company and can be implemented while maintaining the present output of steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any future changes in the cost of energy, or its more efficient utilisation&mdash; which I think was the idea behind some of the Taoiseach's comments&mdash;will be matters for the future and, I understand, could involve additional capital expenditure <Col N="339" /> before their benefits are reaped. That would be a matter for management and the new executive chairman of the company. However, it would be misleading to advance such energy savings as a substitute for or replacement of the requisite savings of £8.4 million which must be found before the company's future can be clearly guaranteed, including the more efficient use of energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification. Is he satisfied that no difficulty will be encountered within the European Union in regard to the promised £25 million if these savings are implemented within the timescale suggested in the plan? What are the Minister's hopes for finding a strategic partner to guarantee the long term commercial viability of Irish Steel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that we will not encounter difficulty with the Commission or, more particularly, the other 11 member states in which steel industries may be located, some of which are in direct competition with Irish Steel. We cannot presume that we will automatically have the unanimous approval of the other 11 member states. Certainly we will not get their approval if they believe that the changes to be effected in Irish Steel are insufficient to ensure that the company can function as a viable entity in the marketplace without recourse to additional subsidies. In relation to the Deputy's second question, I am satisfied that this company has a future and can prosper.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 27 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the social partners committed themselves to full co-operation and flexibility both at national and local levels in the operation of employment programmes, including programmes within all parts of the public sector, so as to ensure the successful operation of employment initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, confident that community employment will operate in those areas of the public service, notably the local authorities, where blockages on the operation of the social employment scheme has existed in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's confidence based on an actual discussion with the unions and the prospective employers and, if so, will he indicate whether he has secured that agreement? Is he aware of considerable concern that the community employment project is not the best model by which to proceed to tackle the needs of the long term unemployed and that alternatives are being canvassed much closer to the model promoted by the CMRS and others? Would he agree that there must be flexibility in the use of this scheme so that he could adapt if better models are more appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident, based on conversations I have had with management and trade union representatives, that some of the local authorities&mdash; including the local authority of which the Deputy is a member &mdash; if properly <Col N="341" /> approached by both sides, particularly management, will be able to participate in this programme. I envisaged that Dublin Corporation could have as many as 600 people employed doing very useful work that is not being done at present. That is a matter for management and unions. Underpinning that confidence, we have a clear commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> from the unions at national level. I urge the elected members of Dublin Corporation to ensure that that opportunity is available as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's second question as to whether there are better models, we are negotiating with the CMRS, as announced at the launch of the Community employment programme and during the course of the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, concerning a pilot project within the overall framework of the budget allocation for the community employment programme. That is not the end of alternative models. We are open to and are exploring other suggestions not only in this context but in the context of the Green Paper which Commissioner Flynn is debating with member states. We have to explore different models to address what is now a major problem within the European Union. We do not claim a monopoly of wisdom in this area nor are we closed to any new ideas that may address, in a productive way, the dreadful problem of long term unemployment.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for an overall review of schemes for the long term unemployed in view of the findings of a report prepared for the National Economic and Social Forum which showed that two-thirds of participants failed to secure employment at the end of their term of such schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The various programmes and schemes, operated by FÁS under the <Col N="342" /> auspices of my Department, are subject to onging review and adaptation with a view to improving their effectiveness. For example, the main programmes for the long term unemployed, namely the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme, have been reviewed over the last number of months and together with Teamwork have been replaced by Community Employment.</P>
      <P>The new programme will build on the strengths and experience of the earlier programmes. One of the criticisms directed at the social employment scheme was the lack of training and this has been taken on board under community employment which will provide a development module for all participants and which will be phased in over the next 12 months. This module will focus on the development of personal/employment skills, technical skills relating to project work and support for own time development. I am confident that developments of this nature together with the work experience gained through participation on the programme should improve the chances for participants of obtaining employment when opportunities become available. However, I am aware that even when employment opportunities are available the long term unemployed experience particular difficulty in obtaining employment. We must seek to break down prejudices of this nature by persuading employers to examine their recruitment and selection practices to remove any vestige of bias against the long term unemployed and in particular to look upon participation in community employment and other FÁS programmes as practical evidence of the desire and fitness of unemployed people for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment specifically on the report prepared by consultants for the National Economic and Social Forum? Is he aware that that report concluded that 66 per cent or two thirds of those participating in schemes were back on the dole after one year? Does the Minister accept that that is an indictment of what the forum report <Col N="343" /> described as poor quality schemes, that in effect too many of these schemes are going nowhere and are merely recycling human beings back on the dole? I accept there is some merit in the schemes but the fact that they are not facilitating people to re-enter the workforce is their major weakness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the concerns expressed by the Deputy but I disagree fundamentally with both the analysis and the conclusions of the WRC report. The substance of that report was published in a national newspaper recently. There was a substantial riposte from FÁS to many of the conclusions, which were based on very simplistic arithmetic. I hope the National Economic and Social Forum, for whom the report was commissioned will invite representatives of FÁS to enter into dialogue on their analysis, in contrast to the WRC analysis, of the value for money criteria and the statistics used to arrive at conclusions.</P>
      <P>I was responsible for introducing the social employment scheme. That scheme was designed to provide employment and work experience for a year. It did not attempt to hold out prospects of a progression from participation in that scheme to employment. The rate of people who went on to find employment, not necessarily immediately, is 30 per cent or 33 per cent but it varies depending on the nature of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the benefit of ten years operational experience we recognise that the lack of training and guidance is a deficiency. For that reason a training component, along the lines referred to, has been introduced. It would be misleading to say this will automatically guarantee full time employment for those who participate in it. It will not, but I hope it will help individuals to develop and improve their employment prospects and, in a statistical sense that it will improve the rate of entry into the active labour market. These programmes are not alternatives to full time employment. They have never been promoted, nor are they considered as such; they are simply <Col N="344" /> a way of ensuring that the long term unemployed are given a path back to the prospect of sustained employment. Part of that path includes a component designed to promote personal development and training and some degree of progression which we have structured into the new programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says about the training factor and so on. Does he not accept that our failure rate &mdash; two out of three people finding themselves back in a cul-de-sac of despair and hopelessness &mdash; is a long way from a guarantee and is a marked indictment of the schemes? The Minister referred to the simplistic calculations of some of the conclusions of that report. I did not adduce those calculations. I accept that you cannot divide the allocation by the number of successful applicants and say that it cost that much to create a job. I did not adduce that. Does the Minister agree that the major defect of the scheme is that there is very little real training as most schemes provide basic routine exercises without an element of self development? Is he aware that many of those involved in putting the CEDP in place believe that the provision for the training component is inadequate and that at the end of the day many of the participants will not go on to develop the skills that might make them more marketable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respects to the Deputy, he is falling into the false intellectual trap set by the consultants when they measured the success of schemes by the subsequent participation of trainees in the labour market. If one starts with that analysis as the criteria of success inevitably one arrives at the results the consultants got. The matter was highlighted in the media but, I hasten to add, not by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes were evaluated in the first instance by the contribution they made to the stock of wealth in local communities. Members will be well aware of the marvellous work that has been done for communities <Col N="345" /> using community resources. That does not figure in the consultants' study. Many individuals, having had the opportunity to participate in work, in some cases having been unemployed for three years or more, have benefited and in some cases, but not in the number required, have succeeded in finding work of a satisfactory kind.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that what is lacking in SES and to a lesser extent in the CEDP is a good and significant training element. We are in the process of developing the training element in the community employment scheme. I would not for one moment say we have the design of the training element right. We will monitor its effectiveness throughout the year and, in particular, we will see if it provides what the European Commission, the Government and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed want, a path of progression to enable people at the end of a year or two to identify what they want to do. In some cases that may involve participating in a further full-time course which will lead to enhanced employment prospects. A training module is being designed. This morning in my constituency I launched a training manual for such participants. It is recognised by everybody that we are developing. We are among the most advanced in the European Union in this area of third sector employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 63 together. I am aware of the positive welcome which the Task Force on Small Business has given to the potential of the county enterprise boards to encourage and assist local enterprise. I have also noted its concerns regarding the provision for the county enterprise boards in the 1994 Estimates.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the commentary in the report of the task force that it was primarily concerned to highlight the substantial addition to State spending on small business represented by the funding envisaged for county enterprise boards under the <i>National Development Plan, 1994 to 1999.</i> The task force noted the disparity, however, between the projected levels of programme expenditure under the plan and the provision made for county enterprise boards in the Vote for my Department this year. The provision in the 1994 Estimates was framed in the context of the establishment of the county enterprise boards on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to operate an interim grants scheme. It relates to anticipated expenditure rather than the grand total of financial support for projects likely to be approved in the current year. The Estimates provision will need to be reviewed following the completion of negotiations with the European Commission on the novel Operational Programme for Local Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the analysis of the Task Force on Small Business was inaccurate that they mistook what was happening with regard to funding? Is he suggesting they are arithmetically wrong? They state clearly that the £21 million originally earmarked in 1994 for the county enterprise boards should not have been reduced to £9 million. Is it correct to say they missed out on a technicality? Is it not the case that if they were properly advised by the Department they would not have made that error? Would he agree that when £9 million is divided among 36 county enterprise boards the result is that each receives a paltry sum with which it is expected to establish new employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="347" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness the Task Force on Small Business came to the wrong conclusion, albeit in an understandable manner. The method of grant payment as distinct from grant approval is in line with the old western development model, which we are replacing. The amount of approvals since October 1993 was of the order of £7 million although only £330,000 was drawn down. As the Deputy will be well aware the grant will not be paid until all the other components of the project have been put in place. This is the case likewise with IDA Ireland and Forbairt.</P>
      <P>We have written to the 35 county enterprise boards stating that their initial allocation will be £500,000 for this year and if having approved projects for this amount they have subsequent projects which merit aid, they can submit them for approval and subsequent grant payment. There is a time lag between the approval process and the date of payment. The Estimates procedure makes provision for moneys that have been paid out. The allocation is in the region of £9 million and it will be revised in the Estimates to make up the arithmetic shortfall that the task force spoke about in the Estimates at the beginning of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no employment targets because we simply do not know as the 35 county enterprise boards do not have a track record to enable us to establish a reasonable target. I can assure the Deputy that there will be no budgetary constraints. In other words, if the boards bring forward proposals for job creation that meet the criteria of the evaluation process, I have been assured that extra moneys will be made available to meet approved applications.</P>

      <P>Did I misunderstand or mishear the Minister say that it depends on the &ldquo;novel operational local development programme&rdquo;? I am not sure what the connection is.</P>
      <P>On the question of the timelag can anything be done about the interference of bureaucracy? As I recall in 1993 there was £17 million allocated to the county enterprise boards which was subsequently reduced to £11 million and £9 million but only £330,000 has been paid out. Despite the great number of projects approved it is difficult to get the cheque. Having regard to the type of small enterprise we are trying to assist where the speed of delivery of the cheque is almost as important as its value, does the Minister acknowledge that this delay becomes the pattern it may well undermine an otherwise valuable contribution to the development of local enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The county enterprise boards will be established as limited liability companies in the middle of May. The legal documentation necessary has been cleared by the Department of Finance following considerable discussion. The delay was not a source of comfort for me or any of the members of the 35 county enterprise boards. The original structure, inherited from the Department of Finance, was the County Western structure which tended to have a slow and bureaucratic way of processing, approving and releasing funding for projects. These difficulties have been addressed and this structure will be replaced by boards established as limited liability companies and given a block financial allocation which they will be able to pay out directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This principle is not applied only in the case of county enterprise boards but to all grants. As Deputies will recall, in the case of home improvement grants, while approval was issued the grant was not paid until the work had been carried out and until two thirds of the cost has been met by the applicant. It is not the fault of the officials responsible for administering the scheme that only £300,000 of the total of £7 million has been paid out, as applicants <Col N="349" /> have a responsibility to provide the balance of the finance for the project. The county enterprise boards will not provide all the finance required. When the boards are established as limited liability companies no later than the end of May applications will be processed more speedily. I am not satisfied with the present system which is too bureaucratic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am anxious to ensure that they will be able to use some of the money to underwrite loans as distinct from offering a grant. We have to move away from the provision of grants towards investment in enterprise which could take many forms: a loan, a small equity participation, a subsidised loan or preferential shares as recommended by the Culliton report. It will be hard to do this in the international sector as we are competing with other countries but there is no such competition in the domestic sector.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, there was <Col N="350" /> a realisation by people in Merrion Street, of the great work being done by the Department and the undertaking that it would not impose any restrictions on money for projects capable of generating employment. The original allocation was based on the assessment of the Department of Finance of how much finance would be drawn down. As the local board will issue approval we expect a greater amount of money to be spent in a given year. The advice given to the task force in late autumn has been superseded by the discussions we had with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that action on a number of the recommendations in question is essentially ongoing, I am satisfied that the relevant deadlines have either been met or that satisfactory progress is being made on them.</P>
      <P>Specifically the position in relation to the various recommendations is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. Greater social partnership representation on Higher Education Authority when next appointed: Although this is a matter for the Minister for Education, it remains the intention to improve the balance of such representation when the Higher Education Authority falls due for <Col N="351" /> its next appointment. Already under the 1992 Regional Technical Colleges Act and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, such representation has been provided for.</P>
    <P>2. Action Group on roles of FAS-Education sector in relation to apprenticeship and pre-work education and training: The respective roles of FÁS-Education sector in relation to apprenticeship have been defined in the context of the phased introduction last September of the new standards-based apprenticeship system. Progress is being made in relation to the pre-work education and training spheres.</P>
    <P>3. New FAS Industry Division: the new division has been established.</P>
    <P>4. Formulation of proposals for greater level of training by industrial firms: While implementation of this recommendation remains ongoing, proposals in this regard have already been published in the National Development Plan and in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>5. Establishment of NETCB: Proposals are under consideration and it is hoped to finalise them in the near future.</P>
    <P>6. Transition to higher skill-knowledge standards of certification: This is linked to the establishment of the NETCB which will be a catalyst for the development of a certification system based on international &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; skills and knowledge.</P>
    <P>7. Co-ordination Group on training needs for industry to be established: This group has been established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State disappointed that several deadlines have not been met? The National Education and Training Certification Board due to be in operation by October 1993 has not been established while the report of the action group on the roles of FÁS and the education sector due by July of 1993 has not materialised. It appears that the Departments involved have only been able to come to grips with the question of apprenticeship training. Does the Minister of State agree that there have not been proposals from the Department <Col N="352" /> of Education to encourage industrial firms to provide training? While there has been much talk, I have not seen firm proposals which were expected by July 1993. Does the Minister of State agree that the deadlines set must be met and that there is no point in producing report after report on services and small businesses if we do not meet deadlines where Government decisions have been made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disappointed, I am heartened at the progress we have made. There is ongoing action on a number of the recommendations. The Deputy focused on the establishment of the National Education and Training Certification Board. Advanced proposals are to hand on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we hope to have it established within a very short period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about training for industry. Major sectoral studies have now been published and launched in the initial phase of targeting industrial training for the various sectors. If FÁS has not already sent them to the Deputy I will be happy to arrange to do so. Subsequently voluntary committees, comprising prominent people within the various sectors of industry, published their reports. We are now proceeding to devise a strategy for the training which will evolve from the recommendations in those reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Minister's ability to feint and weave about these questions. However, it was not the job of FÁS to produce studies, the Department of Enterprise and Employment was supposed to produce proposals by July 1993 and the certification board was to have been in place in October 1993. Why does the Minister commit herself to deadlines and then not honour them? She is letting down those who put so much effort into putting these reports together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy prefer a rushed formulation of a proposal which could not stand up to scrutiny? There is a need for a proper consultation. We had a very good debate in the House on apprenticeships and I look forward to further debates as we develop our ideas for training in industry and other sectors of employment. The sectoral studies have been initiated and launched and matters are moving ahead satisfactorily. The Deputy asks why we set objectives and do not meet them. Objectives are set as desirable target dates towards which to work. Without objectives there would be no agenda for work. I am satisfied, but not complacent, that progress is being made and that we need to build on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> A detailed study of the impact of employers' PRSI on low-paid labour intensive sectors of manufacturing industry was undertaken by an inter-departmental group in late 1993 which concluded that a reduction in the overall burden of PRSI would help maintain existing employment and also assist in the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the recommendations of this group, the Government decided to introduce a tiered system of employers' PRSI with a reduced rate of 9 per cent applying to incomes up to £173 per week equivalent to £9,000 per annum. The cost impact of this adjustment will be very favourable in the case of firms employing significant numbers of employees in that income category. Such firms will benefit from a 26 per cent reduction in employers' PRSI for all workers earning less than £173 per week. In the case of low-paid labour intensive industries such as clothing, footwear and leather, textiles, timber and furniture, this reduced rate will provide a significant boost to the competitiveness of these sectors, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK.</P>
    <P>To help fund this concessionary rate and the normal indexation of payments from the social insurance fund, the budgetary adjustment to PRSI also involved an increase in the ceiling from £21,200 per annum to the equivalent of £25,800 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is the view of my Department that the reduction in employers' PRSI will have a positive impact on job maintenance in the low-paid labour intensive sectors. It will also act as a means of encouraging employment opportunities for the young and low-paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that while the reduction at one level is welcome, it should not be accompanied by an increase at the other end? That is not the way to tackle labour costs unless it is Government policy to create a low skill, low pay economy. The increase to £25,000 in employers' PRSI had already led to hefty additional payroll costs that will impact on the competitiveness of a number of companies, particularly those <Col N="355" /> with big export markets. That will, inevitably, be a powerful disincentive to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should proceed by way of supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister studied the impact of this increase on chemical and pharmaceutical companies, co-operatives and companies with a high export content&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is imparting a lot of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a labour force with a high content of skilled graduates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in employers' PRSI and the introduction of a two-tiered system followed numerous representations by employers particularly in the areas of low skill and low pay which were highly exposed to negative competition, particularly from the United Kingdom. We need a regime that will ensure that maintenance of such jobs until such time as we can move the skills base and the remuneration level up.</P>
      <P>The full cost of the reduction in employers' PRSI has not been transferred to the other end of the equation. The Exchequer absorbed quite an amount of that cost. There would, anyway, have been an increase in the ceiling by way of indexation, although nothing like what was added. I have received representations from some employers to the effect that it has had an adverse effect on their labour cost base. However, the overall cost of output in manufacturing companies with highly paid and highly skilled workers tends to be less significant than in companies where the labour cost of low paid workers is much more critical to the profit level. In general &mdash; and there will be exceptions &mdash; industry would be capable of carrying that extra cost, albeit with a certain degree of pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="356" />
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Guinness said that this increase in the ceiling for employers' PRSI would add £1 million a year to their payroll costs. Has the Minister done an analysis and could it lead to an adjustment in the next budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things add to the costs of a company in any economy. The Deputy referred not just to Guinness but to the chemical industry and the co-operatives. The ratio of labour costs to overall production costs and, consequently, to the profit levels of those companies is much lower than in low labour industries like the textile and garment industry where the profit margin is small and where the component cost of labour as a percentage of the total amount of capital or operating costs is much higher. There is greater capacity within the chemical and other industries to absorb that cost. We will monitor its adverse effects, but many of the companies to which the Deputy referred have been reporting fairly healthy profit balances and, in the light of the present upturn in the economy, are looking forward to prosperous balance sheets in the future. Therefore, they can absorb, if not all of it, at least a substantial part of the cost, but we will keep the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House why the Government appears to be attached to the figure of £173? That was the cut-off point for the infamous 1 per cent levy, but it is far from the average industrial wage. Does the Minister not believe that could have an impact on the maintenance of low pay in some of the industries to which he referred? Has he put in place mechanisms to monitor or assess whether a two-tiered system of PRSI will contribute to job creation in those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £9,000 was arrived at following negotiation with the Department of Finance and, as the Deputy is aware, the officials of that Department are imbued with a wisdom that none of us fully understands. In reply to his second question, the emphasis on <Col N="357" /> reduction of employer costs was in many cases driven by the need to maintain existing employment, particularly employment in a negative competitive position relative to the United Kingdom. In Wales labour costs in the sectors to which we are referring are in some cases 35 per cent lower than equivalent costs here. That is a matter of concern. We are in close contact with IBEC at national level and the Department of Social Welfare to monitor the effects of this measure.</P>
      <P>There are a number of arguments against introducing a tiered system of PRSI because of the difficulties associated with creating traps and gaps. Its operation will have to be monitored over time. Having regard to the difficulties experienced in the low paid labour intensive sectors during the currency crisis in the early part of 1993 there was an obvious need to protect that employment base. That was the driving motivation behind the proposal to reduce employers' PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that following the introduction of the tiered system the lower end of PRSI is 100 per cent higher and the top end is 20 per cent higher than that of the UK? Will he agree that if competitiveness with the UK is a major factor for vulnerable industries a pathetic effort is being made to deal with it? Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach refused to endorse the EU proposal that national governments should reduce the burden of taxes on employment by 1 to 2 per cent of GDP? Evidence from the EU is that this could reduce unemployment by 4 per cent. Will he agree that this area of policy is poorly addressed by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the matter is poorly addressed by the Government. The two-tiered system of PRSI was introduced specifically at the request of business, but it has not met all the requirements. That is not possible because of their diversity. However, at the time it was considered essential to maintain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I am aware that relative to the United Kingdom our PRSI costs across the entire spectrum are higher because our tax base and the amount of money we spend as a Government within the economy are different from the United Kingdom, but that is a wider and deeper issue. We are examining our relative competitiveness in the context of the United Kingdom which is a major market for many of our companies, particularly indigenous ones. We are also examining other sectors because at least 50 per cent of our exports go to other countries where employers PRSI and social insurance costs are infinitely higher than ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a question which was asked by another Member to which the Minister did not respond in detail. What mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of this measure, particularly in regard to protecting jobs? Many jobs have been lost in my constituency and I intend carrying out a study on those losses. What systems are in place with a view to modifying, developing or changing this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the commitment in the Programme for Government we have established in the Department a competitiveness and employment protection unit. I have given details of the work carried out by that unit in reply to a question tabled by Deputy John Bruton. That unit is the first port of call for companies experiencing difficulties in maintaining employment or economic viability and it is in contact with industries throughout the country. I welcome this opportunity to highlight the existence of the unit.</P>
      <P>We receive notification from Forbairt on a regular basis about industries which have received financial or technical assistance from the IDA and are experiencing employment difficulties. The reasons for those difficulties are cited in weekly and monthly reports which are submitted to us by Forbairt. A group was also established to liaise with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I have not received any such notification.</P>
      <P>Merger control in Ireland is governed by the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, as amended by the Competition Act, 1991. Any proposed merger or take-over involving enterprises at least one of which is engaged in the printing or publication of a newspaper must be notified to me under this legislation and in accordance with the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a proposal I have the power under the legislation either to approve the proposal, refer the proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation, on receipt of the report of the Competition Authority, either allow the proposal to proceed, or, if I think the exigencies of the common good so warrant, may make an order prohibiting the proposal either absolutely or except on conditions.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991 states that any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in trade for any goods or services in the State is prohibited. Any person aggrieved as a consequence of an abuse of a dominant position has a right of action in the courts including damages.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will shortly be introducing a Bill in the Oireachtas to amend the Competition Act to provide the Competition Authority with additional powers of enforcement.</P>

I do not want to answer a hypothetical question and as I would have to make the final judgment I do not wish to give an indication in respect of a specific proposal that might come before me. Regarding the principle in the question, anyone in my position or in this House would want to ensure we have free and independent media and that no one person or group of people would have dominant control of ownership, notwithstanding undertakings given about editorial freedom and diversity. I believe owners dictate or have the power to dictate editorial policy in the newspapers or publications which they control. I would be anxious to ensure that no group or combination of peoples would be in a position to obtain effective dominant ownership of the print media which could <Col N="362" /> in turn lead to exploitation that would not be healthy in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Because of differing definitions and differing levels of compliance, there is, at present, no accurate basis of comparing levels of occupational accidents, including fatalities, in member states.</P>
      <P>The Deputies' questions relate specifically to Ireland and the United Kingdom. Here again exact comparison is difficult. For example, as well as fatal accidents and three day plus absence accidents, the UK also has notification requirements relating to certain non-fatal major injury accidents. However, sea fishing accidents are notifiable in Ireland but are not notifiable in the UK. In addition there is the differing levels of under-reporting in both countries.</P>
      <P>A rough comparison of the latest occupational injury data available for 1993 in respect of Ireland and for 1992-93 in respect of the United Kingdom would indicate a higher level of employee fatalities per 100,000 persons employed in Ireland, 2.4 per 100,000 employees as against 1.2 per 100,000 employees in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently at a conference of the Health and Safety Authority, I highlighted these <Col N="363" /> differences regarding occupational accidents here and in Britain. While direct comparisons of the levels of occupational accidents are not possible, my point was that we must identify the causes which led to over 60 deaths last year and payment of occupational injury benefit in 16,000 cases. Having identified the causes, we must take action. Our aim must be the elimination of all accidents, in so far as that is possible, and ill health arising from the workplace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to follow the many reasons for the differences in the forms of recording accidents. The Minister referred to the number of fatalities. I am sure she is not suggesting that the matter is merely one of noting the difficulties or differences in the means of recording. Will she accept a significant gap must be bridged and much work needs to be done to improve safety in Irish industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fatalities at sea from fishing boats in the commercial sector are not reported to the equivalent Health and Safety Authority in the UK. One fatality at work is one too many. Much work needs to be done in this area. The Health and Safety Authority has received permission from the Department of Finance for the recruitment of additional staff and that is in the process. There is a cavalier, happy go lucky attitude about safety at work. People believe that others have accidents but do not believe that they will have one. Sometimes it is difficult to get the message across that where necessary people should wear protective clothing and head gear and so on. The Health and Safety Authority is steadily working to get that message through to all industrial sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flaherty that there is a considerable gap to be bridged. I know from working with the Health and Safety Authority that it is going about its business in a professional way. The wearing of protective clothing is the responsibility of the employer and employee and they should work together <Col N="364" /> to create an awareness of safety procedures when going about one's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the additional staff recruitment to the Health and Safety Authority, which was announced when I was absent. It was badly needed because of the increasing demands on the authority and number of directives that will be implemented this year. There have been many problems in the chemical industry. Has the survey of that industry which the Minister asked the Health and Safety Authority to undertake been completed and, if so, will she outline its findings and if changes have been made as a result of them? An accident in that area can result in wider public health risks and implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey has not been completed. Because it is a comprehensive study the Health and Safety Authority has set the end of 1994 as the time for its completion. That is one of the reasons we sought and obtained permission to recruit additional staff. When the report is completed we will be able to debate the matter in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not alarmed about the extent of industrial accidents reported by the authority last year when almost 13,000 people were injured or suffered illness at work? Is there not a wider gap between 13,000 accidents in a small workforce and 38 prosecutions? Will she agree there are insufficient prosecutions for carelessness in the work environment in many workplaces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of reported accidents at work is too high. The happy go lucky attitude is not one sided; employers and employees believe accidents will not happen to them. The Health and Safety Authority seeks to do its work by implementing regulations, giving instructions and advice and promoting an awareness of health and safety at work. In tandem with that, it will ensure that the regulations are properly <Col N="365" /> monitored and enforced. That is a matter for judgment on each case.</P>

    <Title>Kilrush Creek Marina &mdash; Interim Report: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Mitchell on Thursday, 28 April 1994:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts on Kilrush Creek Marina.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister for <Col N="418" /> the Environment is present, but neither he nor his Department has responsibility for this matter. The Department principally responsible no longer exists and that is a convenient way out for everybody concerned. The personnel in the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications certainly had nothing to do with any aspect of this matter and it would be very unfair to blame them. Substantial blame is attributed to different people.</P>
      <P>This report of the Committee of Public Accounts is deserving of more attention than it received. Since its publication some weeks ago I have seen only one press article on it, other than reports of what is in it. Only one effort was made to analyse it and that was from an unlikely source, Ms Nuala Ó Faoláin of <i>The Irish Times</i> who normally does not concern herself with matters of this kind. In fairness to her, while she got some of the facts and nuances wrong, she understands and fully articulates proper concern for what this report has brought to light. She underlines the importance of what is at issue here &mdash; I wish more people did so because it is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has been in existence since shortly after the establishment of this House, since the early 1920s, and I do not think it ever produced a report that expresses such a degree of criticism of public bodies and officials as this one &mdash; perhaps there is such a report of which I am unaware. It makes very disturbing reading. I became a member of the Committee of Public Accounts only in recent months. I was not a member of the committee that investigated this matter, nor had I any part in drawing up the original draft report. I had some input to considering the draft but no material changes were made. There were additions and omissions but I heard none of the evidence in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have good knowledge, from my previous position as Minister for Industry and Commerce, of what happened and while this report is accurate, it does not tell the whole story. There is more to it <Col N="419" /> than has been outlined in the report. In particular it does not deal with the genesis of this project. It gives the impression that it was simply a brainchild of Shannon Development, but that is not the case. It has a different genesis.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the report, I disagree with paragraph 21 which should not be in it &mdash; I did not advert to it fully when the committee was looking at the final draft &mdash; in which it incredibly, seeks to attribute a degree of culpability to the European Commission for allowing this to happen. The last organisation who should be blamed is the European Commission. It had nothing to do with the project apart from providing the money. If the European Commission has to oversee each and every project it would be tied down for all time. That is why the insertion of paragraph 21 is a serious error, and I take my share of responsibility for allowing it to be included. I did not appreciate its significance when the final draft was considered. The Commission has no responsibility in this matter and it would be crazy for the committee, this House or anyone else to seek to give it responsibility for overseeing the detail of projects. In any given year the Commission probably provides funding for 1,000 or more projects in this country and if it was to become involved in the monitoring of each one and take responsibility in the event of something going wrong, we would get nowhere, the Commission would simply withdraw from funding these projects. In future the report should be read disregarding paragraph 21.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, almost every paragraph of the report is critical of somebody, mostly of Shannon Development and its subsidiaries. There are many criticisms of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications as it was then, and to a more limited extent, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance. Virtually every paragraph is critical and the language used is much stronger than usual in documents of this kind, which shows the strong feeling of the committee about these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> I cannot go through the entire report in 20 minutes but I will make some general points. From my experience of trying to cope with this mess when I discovered it in 1991 I am a great believer in the importance of developing regional activity and have tried to do that for years. The principal institutional body we have had over the years is SFADCo and if regional development, as opposed to central development or purely local authority type development, was to succeed here, it would have had to succeed in the first instance through Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>Having been in Government for many years I know that this concept has never been accepted in the Department of Finance. The concept was pressed on the Department from time to time by members of the Government, but it has always been resisted. When this mess came to light, mainly in 1991, the people who celebrated, although quietly, were those in the Department of Finance because they would have looked at it as an example of people in regional development being given a certain autonomy which was abused. This will be thrown back at the present and future Governments and it is regrettable that should be the case, and that an opportunity to do down the regional concept was given to those who wished to do it down, because the over-centralisation of our Administration is a great mistake.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of this report the committee issues a range of suggestions as to how the Department of Finance should lay down guidelines on this, that and the other, that the duties of a departmental representative on a State board should be clearly defined, that everything should be set out in writing and that the Department of Finance is in some way deficient because all of these matters were not set out in great detail for the guidance of board members and, in particular, of departmental representatives. Such advice is misplaced. Board members, whether from the private sector or the Department must exercise common sense. If common sense had been exercised, the type of mess that occurred <Col N="421" /> here and the huge loss of public funds would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Approximately a year after I last became Minister for Industry and Commerce, I first heard about this problem through rumours in the mid-west region that something extraordinary was going on in Kilrush. I could not pin down those rumours to any great extent. A representative from the Department of Industry and Commerce was appointed to the board of Shannon Development and within a short time of his appointment he suddenly became aware of what was happening there. He came to my office and told me about the problem. He expressed great shock as did I and I asked him to investigate the matter further, which he did. The more he investigated it the worse it seemed to be and we found that the problems extended beyond Kilrush. That representative was only exercising common sense which was to inform the Minister and the Secretary of the Department that something was seriously wrong. I cannot understand why common sense was not exercised before and why it was not exercised in the Department principally involved, because the Department of Industry and Commerce was not principally involved.</P>
    <P>There are substantial gaps in this report in terms of where certain blame could lie for the difficulties experienced by the committee in investigating the matter. I can only conclude that the establishment was ensuring that not too much embarrassment was caused. If a publicly elected person was responsible for a quarter of what has happened here, all hell would break loose but because elected people are not responsible, no media commentator, apart from Ms Ó Faoláín ín her article, has seen it worth his or her while to comment on this serious matter.</P>
    <P>As soon as I and the Department became aware of the seriousness of what was happening, various steps were taken to correct it. While this report is critical of Shannon Development, and with very good reason because of the way it conducted its affairs, the position today in Shannon Development is quite different <Col N="422" /> as a result of personnel and other changes at different levels.</P>
    <P>It is only right that tributes should be paid to the present chairman of Shannon Development for the extraordinary efforts he has made to turn around a company which was in such dire straits when he took over that office. I emphasised that because I noticed in the article to which I referred, the chairman and the chief executive were referred to as if they were the people who were chairman and chief executive when these events happened. They were not, and credit is due to the present incumbents for the steps they have taken because the company appears to be a great deal healthier. The position has been made healthier not by the Department of Finance making up new rules and so on but by people exercising common sense and prudence. Neither common sense nor prudence was exercised in this case.</P>
    <P>Lest people think that the Kilrush fiasco was the only one at that time, I would refer the House to the Minister's speech, because for some reason he refers, out of the blue, to something quite extraneous to Kilrush, but that is typical of what was happening at that time. He said: &ldquo;With the assistance of SFADCo [which I do not understand] SMDL managed to wipe out the debt completely by the end of 1992 including £393,000 for the sale of SFADCo's shares in Rent an Irish Cottage&rdquo;. That is laughable; whoever wrote the Minister's speech, in taking the PR brief given out by SFADCo, confused matters a little and stated it incorrectly. It is interesting, for whatever reason, that the Minister should bring up the question of the sale of SFADCo's shares in Rent an Irish Cottage. It had nothing to do with Kilrush.</P>
    <P>That is an example of what was going on at the time. Those shares made something in the region of £400,000 about six months after Shannon Development informed my Department they had sold the shares for less than half that figure. The shares were not put up for public tender nor were any steps taken to get a good return on them. They made a private deal with one individual and told <Col N="423" /> nobody about it. When I heard about what had happened I said I thoroughly disapproved and would not stand for it. I said I thought the shares were worth a great deal more but, irrespective of that, they should have been offered for public tender. When they were offered for public sale they made more than twice what Shannon Development were prepared to take for them in a private deal which no one would have known about.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Shannon Development resorted to a practice that was not publicly visible of utilising funds voted by this House for industrial development for tourism related and other projects. Substantial money was used in a way which had not been voted by the House. In 1991 I laid down strictures and questioned whether the money which had been improperly applied would be repaid. It was obvious that it would be impossible to repay it from the tourism side to the industrial development side. That issue had to be left but it is indicative of what was happening at the time.</P>
    <P>Another incident I heard about on the streets of Limerick, which was denied when I queried it but later discovered to be true, was that half a million pounds was paid by the company for a public house in the extremities of disrepair in Limerick city. They still own it. It has four walls but little else.</P>

      <P>No beer, no roof, no counter, no chairs, nothing. I expressed deep concern at the time and was accused of being antagonistic towards Shannon Development but that will always happen in a local or regional context. My concerns were well founded. It should be clearly understood that the present chairman and chief executive of Shannon Development have sought to ensure that these episodes have been put behind the company. It is my hope that the company will, from now on, get back on a successful path and achieve worthwhile goals for the benefit of the region it serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period in the late eighties and early nineties was a black one in the history of <Col N="424" /> the company and I am glad it is over. I wish the company well for the future. However, it is disturbing that such events should occur and in particular that the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications as it was then, should have ignored all the warning signs. This strongly worded report which contains so many disturbing and important factors has received a relatively low degree of publicity. I do not say it should be publicised for the sake of it but rather to ensure that something like this could not happen again. The public could express its disapproval at what happened. It was indefensible. I am glad the committee produced a report which draws attention to this. Let us hope that it will draw attention &mdash; and not just in theory &mdash; to these kinds of practices and ensure they will never be repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is an example of the valuable work done by the Committee of Public Accounts at minimum cost to the taxpayer. It was triggered by the vigilance of the Comptroller and Auditor General in making his routine annual report. It could be said that because the committee is an all party one it is less incisive than might otherwise be the case in identifying the author of this sorry mess. Otherwise the report is a significant contribution to how we ought to evaluate public sector investment projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report deals in trenchant language with how the State ended up paying twice the original estimate for half a project at the end of the day. As someone committed to the development of a genuine regional policy, not least in the interest of economic development, the case of Kilrush marina gives serious cause for thought. It is likely that it will provide ammunition for many years ahead to those who believe the political culture of this country is such that local people cannot be trusted with any significant degree of regional autonomy. One almost has the impression that there was a local conspiracy of silence about the costly mire into which this project was sinking deeper every day. This local complacency <Col N="425" /> was facilitated by the apparent collusion of several Departments whose key personnel seemed relatively undisturbed by local happenings because the lion's share of the funding was coming from Europe.</P>
    <P>The findings of the committee's report are a serious indictment of the sloppy and careless performance of SFADCo as it was then known. The extraordinary latitude given to the SFADCo subsidiary, SMDL, is tantamount to negligence on the part of the parent company. The handling of the remuneration package for the chief executive of SMDL adds an element of farce to the entire Kilrush marina saga.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the intervention by Deputies and the Minister. Paragraph 10 of the report states:</P>
      <P>Remuneration limits and guidelines applying to the salaries of Chief Executives in the State sector were ignored in agreeing the remuneration of the Chief Executive of SMDL. After the Board of the parent company had agreed the basis for the secondment of one of its Group Directors to SMDL as Chief Executive, the Board of the subsidiary unanimously approved further terms in addition to those agreed by the Board of SFADCo. These latter terms included a substantial initial lump-sum payment and other benefits. In the view of the Committee, both the lump-sum payment and the other benefits were inappropriate and excessive. Bearing in mind that the SMDL Board was made up of a combination of SFADCo Board members and staff, [this is important] SFADCo must stand indicted for its role in knowingly ignoring Government pay policy for the State sector. The Committee urges that the Department of Finance should, as soon as possible, lay down clearer guidelines in respect of pay . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister, and what was said at the committee, that this is being done. It is very difficult to avoid referring to something which is as central to the report as this. I was trying to point out that the Kilrush Creek Marina saga is an indictment of the careless and sloppy procedures allowed by SFADCo, that the <Col N="428" /> latitude SFADCo gave its subsidiary was tantamount to negligence, that the handling of the remuneration package was farcical, that the vigilance of the then Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications leaves much to be desired and that confidence in the Department as it was then constituted was not boosted by the uneven quality of evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>One wonders if this carelessness with public money could have proceeded unhindered if the political climate of the day was not conducive to turning a blind eye as the mistakes unravelled. Mistakes were made, for which the public purse paid dearly, but remarkably the proposed private sector involvement escaped virtually unscathed. There was inadequate planning by SFADCo and inadequate control and supervision. There appears to have been an element of sharp practice in the application for European Regional Development Fund funding, the necessary vigilance by Government Departments was absent, SFADCo did not control its subsidiary, SMDL, and there was, to put it mildly, a lack of candour on the part of SMDL. I fear the report's indictment of the commercial judgement of SMDL in paying £560,000 for a timber yard worth £200,000 may not be the full judgement. There was a lack of clear guidelines for civil servants on State company boards. Some salutary lessons can be learned from the Kilrush Marina saga in the context of anticipated public sector investment projects under the new Community Support Framework. This saga is a disturbing indictment of a number of public bodies and officials.</P>
    <P>I recall as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts visiting the then unfinished marina at Dingle a few years ago. Similar questions were raised about the use of public money in building that marina and the reasons the initial estimate for the work was very seriously exceeded. The Committee of Public Accounts visited Dingle to look at the work carried out on the marina and to find out why the eventual cost of the project would exceed the original estimate <Col N="429" /> by so many millions of pounds. The view of the committee at that time was that the cost of the marina exceeded the original estimate for some extraordinary reasons, which I will not go into, but that the end product was good value for money; that notwithstanding the extraordinary disregard for normal procedures the project made a valuable contribution to the local tourism and fishing industries, enabling greater catches and creating more employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts let the matter rest there. I was unable to attend Kilrush on the day Deputy Jim Mitchell led his men down there but my understanding is that there has been no comparable contribution to the local economy there resulting from this investment. I know Deputies from the area will probably feel compelled to say that it adds enormously to the tourism infrastructure in Kilrush and so on and I hope it does, but I am advised, within the context of the money spent, we got a poor return for public money.</P>
    <P>I might now refer to the recent legislative changes put through this House in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This report is a very good example of the kind of report and evaluation that can be undertaken of the expenditure of public moneys at minimum cost to the taxpayer. We now have a greater facility to undertake value-for-money audits, a facility I should like to see used more widely because it can be a very valuable instrument in assessing whether we receive value for money.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the report does not get to the bottom of who was the author of this sorry mess. As Deputy O'Malley commented, it is referred to as the brainchild of SFADCo. I am not sure that is the case. It is perhaps a weakness of the report that it did not identify who had the bright idea in the first place, who pushed it and continued to push it notwithstanding the extraordinary mistakes made along the way. It is also a matter of concern that it ended up as an indictment of the only element of regional government nationwide &mdash;<Col N="430" /> SFADCo &mdash; which is about the closest one can get to the type of regional concept I should like to see developed in other regions. I am afraid it will be argued that, because of what happened in the case of Kilrush regional bodies cannot be trusted to spend public money.</P>

      <P>Once upon a time I represented the workers in SFADCo and I acknowledge that there are indeed some good developments but this is an extraordinary saga. It is unsatisfactory that, because of the absence of the Minister responsible, I presume on Government business, and because of the reconstruction of the Department, we do not have anybody in the House who can be made accountable for some of the more difficult questions that arise from this report. I agree with Deputy O'Malley it is extraordinary that this amount of public money could be misspent in the fashion detailed in this report, accompanied by such little public comment or analysis. The coherence of the report, the amount of work that went into its production, its speedy production under the guidance of the chairman, warranted more serious analysis than it has received to date. It contains a number of paragraphs which time does not allow me to deal with in greater detail but certainly they should be salutary lessons for the future. Whether we learn the lessons from this report is something that only time and experience will tell.</P>

      <P>We are moving to proper controls over State expenditure, an innovation to be greatly welcomed. This debate affords Members an opportunity to articulate their views on the role of accountability they would like Ministers, Departments and semi-State bodies to fulfil in that there has been a rather cavalier attitude to date to the expenditure of public moneys. After all, abuse of public moneys amounts to abuse of taxpayers' <Col N="431" /> money, yet there does not appear to be any accountability by politicians about the abuse of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is not talking merely about politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen this abuse in many facets of national life and we are responsible for taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Of course, similar difficulties have been experienced in other semi-State companies, the problems of Aer Lingus arose through lack of accountability by its subsidiary companies. In the case of Shannon Free Airport Development Company a similar difficulty arose. As Deputy O'Malley said, at one time there were enormous problems in the mid-west region with regard to sweetheart deals and Rent-An-Irish-Cottage. Eventually, when proper tenders were sought taxpayers and investors received their due reward. I am not saying that even the excessive investment in the Kilrush Creek Marina will not yield a good return for the area in the long term. The overall development is extensive and warrants further investment now. Indeed one aspect of the report not dealt with was that of the future of the marina with recommendations for its further development, ascertaining how such future investment could be protected. There is a need for additional enterprise in the adjacent area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that when SFADCo drew up the original plan it was for a staged development and to date there has not been the huge private investment expected. This will lead to additional appeals for investment by SFADCo. In this respect I hope the Minister present will encourage his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, to ensure that some joint ventures are entered into, leading to additional development in Kilrush, including tax breaks. When introducing this debate earlier I thought the Minister for the Environment might have said that he intended applying the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act to Kilrush or that he <Col N="432" /> would do so in the very near future, thus making the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, a native of Kilrush, very happy; no doubt he would like to see the town developed further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard rumours to the effect that the Minister does not propose to apply the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act to Kilrush, that he will resort to some other legislation that might be of assistance to them. I urge the Minister to reconsider that decision, when he would have a ready response. For example, people interested in yachting who might be encouraged to visit Kilrush could avail of tax breaks for that purpose. They need not necessarily be Irish citizens, they could be European citizens who have an interest in yachting. It is advantageous to have a marina situated in Kilrush. It is part of the necklace of marinas established on the west coast. For that reason I urge the Minister for Tourism and Trade to establish joint ventures in the area. On the other hand I am concerned about accountability as there must be some recognition of honesty. I am concerned at Deputy O'Malley's comments regarding common sense. I know that common sense is a slogan of the Fianna Fáil Party and that their members must have a strong Fianna Fáil background. This common sense approach has led to huge overruns.</P>

      <P>In having this debate <Col N="433" /> today we have set a precedent under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1993. A feature of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, following its reorganisation, is that we will have short debates in the House on reports of the committee. Heretofore the committee reported only once a year. There will be a series of interim reports on matters of importance.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the debate and some good points made by the Minister, nobody has been held to account. Politicians were not responsible for this overrun, as suggested by Deputy Carey, but rather paid officials. I do not want to appear merciless but we have to get to a stage, if we are to have accountability, where people in the public sector are held to account. If projects are as badly controlled as the Kilrush marina somebody will be held to account in the future. It is important to establish that principle, otherwise there will be similar overruns. In this case there will be some exposure and some embarrassment but no effective action.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that a number of things have already happened including extending to subsidiaries of semi-State bodies the same controls as apply to State bodies. I note that he said the Minister for Finance will reply formally to other points made in the report and I look forward to that.</P>
      <P>Our objective is not to witchhunt or to criticise those in Kilrush but to learn from this venture so that public projects in the future are better controlled and that we get more value for public money. A huge amount of work remains to be done in this area both in terms of national money, lottery money and EU money.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the improvements brought about in Kilrush, even though they cost much more than they expected, will be of lasting benefit to the Kilrush community and the surrounding district and I wish them every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue. I am glad the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, is here to respond. The Government should intervene in the rail dispute. While I realise the unions have been balloting during recent days on the Labour Court decision it is unthinkable that disruption of the rail system should take place after this busy bank holiday weekend. All available industrial relations procedures have been exhausted. While the problems associated with this dispute are complex, it is worth nothing that the work practices which have built up over the years are archaic and totally out of date in a modern transport company.</P>
      <P>It is essential that management and unions work together to streamline the company and maintain competitiveness. Accordingly, it would be commercial lunacy to have a prolonged industrial dispute. Sooner or later a decision will have to be made by management and unions on the future of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the Government has starved rail transport of investment in the past while other European countries have been more progressive in improving this mode of transport. Iarnród Éireann can abandon its Cinderella image and win back passengers and freight if common sense prevails in this dispute and if the Government takes action to prevent an escalation of the dispute and undertakes a major programme of investment, with EU assistance, to modernise the railways. I would be happy to hear what plans the Government has to ensure that the public are not thrown to the winds in respect of public transport and that they will be able to use this essential public service after the weekend.</P>

      <P>The productivity proposals in the dispute at Irish Rail have been the subject of intensive negotiations involving both the Labour Relations <Col N="435" /> Commission and the Labour Court over a considerable period. Both bodies have made strenuous efforts to assist the parties in reaching agreement. This process has not yet come to finality. It is still ongoing in that the Labour Court has issued its recommendations and the result of the ballot by the workers is not yet completed.</P>
      <P>I am aware that neither of the unions involved has recommended acceptance of the recommendation. However, the court has recommended certain adjustments to the productivity proposals which would be of benefit to the workers if accepted. Among the changes to the proposals recommended by the court are: first, drivers will be compensated for the removal of mileage payments by a lump sum of £1,000 for each driver, an increase in pay of £5.77 per week and compensation of two and a half times their 1993 mileage allowance; second, drivers will have a mileage limit of 360 miles per day and guarantee that the proposed scheme for direct recruitment to DART will not interfere with existing drivers' rights; third, that the increase in the ticket machine allowance from £7 to £12 be accepted; fourth, the lump sum payments offered to train drivers to be increased by 20 per cent; fifth, freight guards, who are not required to move at this time, to receive a payment of £600 and a further £600 when they come off freight train working for one person operation. The court also recommended that the operation of the agreement be continuously monitored and provision has been made for a review of the agreement 12 months after its implementation. In the circumstances, I am of the view that it would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of this vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital for the future of the company and its workforce that agreement is reached on new work practices. Having regard to the implications that rejection of these proposals would have for all concerned, especially as the State's disputes settling services have been fully utilised, I hope all parties will adopt a <Col N="436" /> positive attitude to the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
    <P>In accordance with my practice established when I was Minister for Labour, I am not disposed to intervene personally. I stated previously my views on ministerial intervention in individual disputes both in this House and elsewhere. As matters have now reached a delicate stage, I do not propose to make any further comments at this time.</P>

      <P>I raise a very serious abuse of his position by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I hope I have done him a favour by highlighting this abuse and that the practice has now ceased. I was pleased to facilitate the Minister by agreeing to postpone the matter until he could be present.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought to my attention by a number of alert constituents in the Gaeltacht area of west Galway.</P>
      <P>Is é seo an saghas litir a bhfuil an tAire ag seoladh amach gach seachtain go mhuintir Gaeltacht Chonamara.</P>
      <P>I will read a translation of the letter:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>About your application for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Act, you will be glad to hear that a grant of £2,300 is granted in your case.</P>
      <P>My Department will send you an official letter shortly.</P>
      <P>Sincerely,</P>
      <P>Michael D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary aspect of the letter is that the Minister sent it to people who never contacted him in the first place. It is obvious he uses inside information to write to people whom he feels might be convinced he is in some way influential in getting them a grant. It is incomprehensible that he would send out in the same prepaid envelope an accompanying slip asking the people to vote for a Labour candidate in the European elections. This states &ldquo;Please Vote &mdash; No. 1 GALLAGHER, Ann&rdquo;. So much for the <Col N="437" /> candidature of his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, who is also a candidate in Connacht-Ulster for the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should engage in this and similar tactics on joining Fianna Fáil in Government. In Opposition he strongly condemned such practices and often castigated politicans engaged in lesser types of clientelism or gombeen politics. He has surpassed Fianna Fáil in his practice of attempted deception of the electorate.</P>
    <P>Where are the ethics in government of the Labour Party? Where is the Deputy Michael D. whom we all knew, and some loved? Where is the Michael D. who wrote the pamphlet on &ldquo;Clientelism in Irish Politics&rdquo;? I read a copy of his booklet and it is unbelievable that one who so abhorred and condemned such practices should now become a master of the art. He should read again his own publication. I have found many suitable quotations from his work which would condemn his present pursuit of gombeenism in Irish politics. There are many notable quotations one could use from the Minister's own publication, if time permitted. I will make it available to any interested students of political clientelism but I will quote only two small passages. On page 121 he states:</P>
    <P>Clientelist politicians in the opinion of the author rarely objectively influence a decision. They create the illusion of assistance however.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph on page 138 he says:</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the clientelist approach seriously sells as short and distracts attention from the real basis of economic exploitation, political domination and ideological manipulation in Irish society.</P>
    <P>This flowery language is a direct quotation from <i>The Limits of Clientelism &mdash; towards an assessment of Irish Politics</i> by Michael D. Higgins.</P>
    <P>Those were the days my friend, I thought they would never end. I hope I <Col N="438" /> have achieved some good in correcting the Minister in the error of his ways and perhaps nipped this serious matter in the bud.</P>

      <P>As I stated then arrangements are in place in my Department whereby individuals, committees or organisations are informed of decisions in regard to grants which have been approved as a result of applications submitted by them. I have made inquiries with regard to the reference the Deputy has made to canvassing material for the European elections and I communicated this to him in the reply to his parliamentary question, which he now chooses to ignore. It appears that during Easter when I was absent from my office due to illness, a member of my staff inadvertently included in a small number of letters referring to departmental matters a canvassing card for Ann Gallagher. A small number of letters were inadvertently placed with letters addressed to members of the Labour Party and as I was absent she signed them on my behalf.</P>

      <P>I have explained this to the Deputy. Let me assure him once more that this was done in error. The member of my staff correctly pointed out her error to me and I apologised for it. I understand that there may have been five or perhaps six letters involved. I regret that the Deputy has chosen to seek to sensationalise what appears to amount to, in fact, a clerical error. If he had contacted me directly on the matter, the facts of the situation would have been explained to him fully and indeed to his informant. I am sure the people of Galway West, whom we both have the honour of representing, would prefer to <Col N="439" /> see matters of greater import being raised in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCormack referred to my previous writing and work as a political scientist of over 20 years. I have never published a pamphlet unless the pages from the book to which he refers have been torn or reproduced. I have contributed chapter V1 to a book on European politics. It is one of a number of contributions I was proud to make during my time as a political scientist in the employment of University College Galway. The book, edited by Christopher Clapham and published by the Cambridge University Press about 1982 has references to the Irish political system where I point out that communications have less effect than many people think. Later works, following my own research, took a different view.</P>
      <P>An error was made by a member of my staff, for which I apologised when she pointed it out to me, involving five or perhaps six letters. This has been magnified out of all proportion by a Deputy who chooses to concentrate on this kind of thing rather than the significant achievements we are able to make in Galway West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of communications from my office, if the Deputy writes to me on behalf of any person who has made an application to my Department he will be courteously informed in exactly the same way. No letter has ever issued from my Department which suggests that a person's entitlement under a scheme has been due to me and I have never asked for political loyalty. I make this point because it is very important. When I became an tAire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta I defended and kept scéim na tithe in the Gaeltachts. I later was privileged to be able to increase it. I am anxious also that it be operated efficiently in the administrative sense. People frequently write to me about delays in the allocation of grants. All communications from my Department are proper; an error was made in five or six for which I apologise. A member of my staff has also <Col N="440" /> apologised. I would have much preferred if the person involved had communicated either through Deputy McCormack who is a member of his party or directly to me and I would have arranged for an apology to be issued directly. In the absence of any other efficacious item to report in the local newspapers Deputy McCormack chose to sensationalise this matter out of all proportion. Our constituents can judge at the appropriate time which of us has been using the time of the Dáil best.</P>

      <P>I have received the permission of the family in this regard. Mrs. Mary Ellen Butler, Clogher, Hollymount, County Mayo was taken by a health board ambulance to Castlebar General Hospital, on 18 February 1992 with what seemed like a routine 'flu. She had never been in hospital before and all her life enjoyed robust good health. She was visited in unit C in the hospital by her son, Michael, and his wife, Julia, at approximately 7.30 p.m. that evening. The Butlers were alarmed that her condition had deteriorated considerably from the time she left home by ambulance earlier that day. Mr. Butler's brother, P.J. and his wife, Tina, were also present. The Butlers allege that on examination of the chart at the end of the late Mrs. Butler's bed they noticed that the name on the chart was Mary Butler, not Mary Ellen Butler. They also allege that the chart stated that she had received insulin and morphine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following day, 19 February 1992, the late Mrs. Butler's daughter-in-law, Tina, went to the hospital at approximately 11 a.m. to discover that the patient had been transferred to the intensive care unit. Mrs. Tina Butler met with a <Col N="441" /> nurse and stated that the patient had been receiving insulin and that this was recorded on the chart at the end of the bed. According to Mrs. Tina Butler the nurse responded that there was no need to worry, that &ldquo;Mary was on insulin before&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Butler and his wife, Julia, visited the hospital at 7.30 p.m. where they met the other members of the family who relayed what the nurse had said about the insulin. They went to the intensive care unit to ask if a mistake had been made in the patient's name. They were asked to wait outside the door of the intensive care unit and were told eventually by a nurse that a mistake had been made. They were ushered to a waiting room where they were visited eventually by a doctor who assured them that the patient had not been given insulin, that she had a minor heart problem and that everything would be okay.</P>
    <P>The following morning, 20 February 1992, Mr. Michael Butler went to the hospital again where he eventually met the hospital administrator to whom he relayed the full details of what he had seen on his mother's chart on the night of admission. He also met the matron and discussed the matter with a hospital doctor. According to Mr. Butler at 7 p.m. that evening the family GP came to the Butler home and remonstrated with Mr. Butler insisting that he refrain from making any further allegations about what he had seen in the hospital. The family members went to the hospital again that night to find that the patient's condition had worsened. The Butlers allege that they sought but were refused access to a doctor.</P>
    <P>On 21 February 1992 Mr. Michael Butler met the hospital administrator again and demanded to know what had happened in terms of the treatment and identification of his mother. He then consulted his solicitor who wrote to the Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, demanding that the matter be investigated. Dr. O'Connell asked Mr. William Moran, programme manager, general hospital care, Western Health Board, to investigate the complaints.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran wrote to the Butlers' solicitor <Col N="442" /> on 13 April 1992 stating that he had investigated the matter and that the late patient &ldquo;did not require or receive insulin at any time during her hospital stay&rdquo;. Mr. Moran acknowledged in his letter that &ldquo;it is correct that the records of another patient were referred to but within a short period the mistake was recognised and immediately rectified&rdquo;. According to the Butlers the so called &ldquo;short period&rdquo; was from 3 p.m. on 18 February 1992 to 8 p.m. on 19 February 1992 &mdash; a timespan of 29 hours. The Butlers maintain that the mistake was only discovered because of the persistence and questioning of the family members.</P>
    <P>Because of his anxiety and because of what he had seen and the hospital's admission Mr. Butler insisted on seeing the charts and notes relating to his mother's hospitalisation. In July 1992 Mr. Michael Butler with his general practioner visited the hospital to inspect his late mother's hospital charts and records. In his reply to the question I tabled for a written reply on Tuesday, 19 April the Minister stated that &ldquo;the medical officer was satisfied with the inspection&rdquo;. Whatever about the general practitioner, Mr. Michael Butler was far from satisfied. His solicitor wrote to the health board on 24 July 1992 stating &ldquo;our client is quite satisfied that all the charts were not produced and in particular that one chart which is the subject matter of the entire correspondence was not produced&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister admitted &ldquo;there was a mix-up of notes between the patient in question and another similarly named patient&rdquo;. This is a serious admission. With whose notes were they &ldquo;mixed up&rdquo;? The Butler family believe that they were mixed up with those of another Mary Butler, who is a diabetic, who had been hospitalised previously at Castlebar Hospital, who was not a patient in the hospital at that time, who was on daily doses of insulin and who is happily still alive. This allegation has been made by the Butlers. Neither the Minister nor the health board have denied or refuted this. If the Butlers' assertion is correct and Mary Ellen Butler, so far as the hospital authorities are concerned, for the first 29 hours of her hospitalisation was not Mary Ellen Butler but Mary Butler, a diabetic <Col N="443" /> on daily doses of insulin, then she must have been given insulin. To have omitted giving her insulin would have constituted an omission of treatment essential to her condition. If Mary Ellen Butler was treated, as the Butlers allege, as Mary Butler, in other words, if she was treated for something she did not have, this is an extremely serious matter.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Mary Ellen Butler died on 8 August 1992 having spent further weeks hospitalised at University College Hospital, Galway and the Western Health Board hospital in Ballina. According to the death certificate she died from pneumonia, brain failure and para-thyroidism. It is not sufficient or acceptable that the serious complaints made by the Butler family should be examined by a serving official of the Western Health Board against whom the complaints have been made.</P>
    <P>I want a full and detailed inquiry &mdash; the family are entitled to this &mdash; to be carried out by a competent and independent person into all aspects of the case. That investigation should determine and disclose the identity of the person whose notes were substituted for a 29 hour period for those of the late Mary Ellen Butler. It must then establish the medication which was appropriate to the patient whose notes were being used for Mrs. Butler and the precise medication used. It must also establish the number of hours which elapsed from the time of the late Mary Ellen Butler's admission to the General Hospital, Castlebar, the precise date and time the error of mistaken identity was discovered and the circumstances surrounding the discovery. Each official and medical individual who came into contact with the late Mrs. Butler from the time of her admission to the time she died must be interviewed.</P>
    <P>I am not pointing the finger of blame at the medical and nursing staff at the hospital who are working in extremely overcrowded conditions and under <Col N="444" /> severe pressure. However, mistakes occur and did in this case. The family are not interested in revenge or retribution; they want the truth and that is the least to which they are entitled.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made in developing new sources of funding for business as outlined in the Government's response to the Moriarty report; and whether the Government is willing to underwrite some or all investment risks involved in high risk small ventures which have in the past prevented more widespread allocation of funds by investment institutions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations of the Moriarty Group in this area relate mainly to the provision of more equity and other similar forms of capital for smaller Irish firms and for greater involvement of the financial institutions in the funding and development of indigenous industries.</P>
      <P>A number of steps have been taken to give practical effect to these recommendations. Following consultations between my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and representatives of the Irish pensions industry, a report was commissioned to assess the potential for venture capital investment by the pensions industry. This report has now been completed and recommends investment of between £10 million and £15 million per annum by pension funds in commercial, venture type enterprises. I understand that there is a widespread commitment to this initiative and that steps are being taken to give practical effect to this new source of venture funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the coming into being last year of the Smurfit job creation enterprise fund. This £10 million fund is directed at firms with the potential for <Col N="369" /> increasing employment and which are seeking equity injections of between £100,000 and £500,000. I also note that the AIB Group is reportedly launching a new venture capital fund with funding of about £30 million. Such a development would represent a positive contribution to increased funding for growth orientated companies.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the scheme of preferential loans to small industry operated by the main banking institutions. In excess of £90 million in loan finance has to date been committed by the banking institutions to these loans, whose main feature is that personal security is not required. I am also pleased to note that the two biggest banking groups have recently introduced loan schemes whereby loans to qualfying businesses can be made available at an interest rate significantly below the normal business lending rate.</P>
    <P>Within the public sector, the creation of Forbairt provides the appropriate vehicle for the development of policies to give effect to the Moriarty recommendation that a decisive shift from grants to equity and other similar forms of support takes place. Within the public sector also, the creation of county enterprise boards will provide new sources of funding for small enterprises at local level and, with their wide geographic spread, should assist in creating the type of enterprise culture which we aspire to.</P>
    <P>The business innovation fund has been operational since January 1992 and its remit is to provide seed capital for enterprises at the earliest stage of business development. This fund is a partnership between the public and private sectors and represents an example of where public authorities in Ireland are willing to play their part in facilitating risk capital in small ventures.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware the funding of Irish industry has been enhanced by the constructive amendments to the business expansion scheme contained in the 1993 Finance Act and will be further enhanced by the BES proposals in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to the fact <Col N="370" /> that, within the context of the National Plan, provision has been made within the operational programme for industry for the co-funding, through the Structural Funds, of seed/venture capital activities. Any such funding would be dependent on the availability of matching private sector funds. This initiative is also in line with the thrust of the Moriarty recommendations.</P>
    <P>In response to the second part of the Deputy's question the primary responsibility for the provision of equity capital to Irish industry rests with the private sector, but where high risks are involved the State is willing to consider the sharing of that risk. For example, I have already mentioned the Government's initiatives in relation to the business expansion scheme. Since its inception and up to April 1993, the State has invested £140 million in underwriting business risk through the BES in the form of tax refunds. Through the proposed co-financing of eligible venture capital activities using Structural Fund support the State is showing its willingness to share the risk. In relation to high rish investment by investment institutions I would add that some of these institutions, and particularly pension funds, currently benefit from a very favourable tax regime.</P>
    <P>A major need identified by the task force on small business was access to capital at competitive and affordable interest rates and recognition of this was reflected in the announcement in the budget of £100 million small business expansion loan scheme being made available in long term loans at low fixed interest rates, already some £15 million of loans for manufacturing companies is committed at this stage.</P>

      <P>The two main sources of statistics in this area are the OECD and the European Commission. Figures for the former are shown in national currencies while the latter are denominated in MECUs which facilitates comparison. I propose to circulate the EU table in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There can be variations between OECD-EU and other tables due to different classification systems and Irish figures will always seem small by international comparison because of our small size. However, the fact of the matter is that even when expressed as a percentage of GDP, Ireland historically has been near the bottom of the EU league table. This is something which successive Governments have been aware of and have sought to address. As a percentage of GDP Ireland's gross expenditure was 1.1 in 1992, estimated, as against an EU average of 1.89 but it has shown a modest rise in recent years from 0.87 in 1987 to 1.1 in 1992.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the importance of science and technology as a key underpinning for growth, competitiveness and national economic development.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment within the Department of Enterprise and Employment, under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Competitiveness and Employment Protection Unit has dealt with 85 companies, employing nearly 4,500 persons. The scale of the unit's activities has involved the provision of the full support and advice available under the whole range of State programmes for industry and business.</P>
      <P>The unit has also, in the context of confidentiality, advised and directed individual firms with difficulties in the areas of capital funding, financial control and management. These problems are common to many firms in the indigenous manufacturing sector, from where the majority of inquiries come.</P>
      <P>At the establishment of a unit, I noted that:</P>
      <P>The early notification of difficulties will be important for helping in overcoming them. Efforts are being made by me and my Department to encourage and assist the early identification of problems.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the main thrust of the unit's interaction with firms is toward early and timely contact with a company, in order to overcome anticipated difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases, where a threat to employment was cited, it was possible to resolve the threat through addressing the underlying causes. In the remaining cases where redundancies may have been implemented, the notification to the unit was either insufficiently timely or beyond the scope of the unit, or my Department, to produce solutions. I am satisfied, therefore, that the majority of cases where companies have been in contact with the unit, the outcome for the company concerned was positive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>FÁS training programmes are funded by the Exchequer, the European Social Fund and a levy collected from certain sectors of Irish industry. The effectiveness of FÁS training programmes is the subject of continuous evaluation and assessment by FÁS relative to skills needs of the economy, the needs of the trainees themselves and in the context of certification and standards. In my Department a dedicated EC funded evaluation unit has now been established. The function of this unit is to evaluate the effectiveness of all human resource development measures supported by the European Social Fund. These include most of the programmes administered by FÁS. I have indicated my commitment to this process of evaluation and to the implementation of recommendations made to improve the effectiveness of expenditure.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland does not make greater use of the financing for research and development projects currently available from EUREKA; the number of projects which have applied for grant-aid over the past two years; the number of projects that have been successful; his views on whether the existence and availability of such financial help and technical assistance is well known in Ireland; and, if not, the steps, if any, he intends taking to create a greater awareness of such a facility, particularly for small and medium sized firms.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>EUREKA provides a mechanism to facilitate the coming together of industrial and research concerns to undertake commercially <Col N="376" /> oriented collaborative R&amp;D projects. EUREKA itself does not provide funding for such projects. Participating concerns must meet costs out of their own resources or any available national funding schemes.</P>
      <P>Irish industry did not participate in EUREKA to any great extent over the period 1985-93. This was probably attributable to an unwillingness to collaborate in R&amp;D, to the absence of a specific source of State funding and to a lack of awareness of the initiative.</P>
      <P>To remedy the situation, I launched a new promotional effort in June 1993, making provision for a specific fund to grant-aid Irish firms interested in initiating or participating in EUREKA projects. At the same time, I set up a network of State agencies and industry associations to ensure the widest possible circulation of information on projects and opportunities for Irish firms, particularly for small and medium-sized firms.</P>
      <P>I hope these measures will significantly improve the level of Irish participation. In fact, there are already signs of increased interest, with 12 companies having applied for grant assistance under the new Irish scheme since June 1993. I intend to ensure that the momentum now built up will be sustained through steady processing of the expressions of interest already received, and through regular circulation of information.</P>

    <P>As a result of the shortfall in EU funding it will be necessary to modify expenditure on the measures proposed in the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i> on the programmes for industry and human resources development. The precise implications of the modifications necessary are currently being worked through in consultation with the various interests involved. This exercise will take some time to complete and the outcome will be reflected in the revised operational programmes which will be agreed with the European Commission in the near future. However, I am satisfied that the effects of the modifications will not be significant and that the original targets <Col N="378" /> set in the plan will be achieved before the end of the period of the plan in 1999.</P>

      <P>A number of initiatives have been established within my Department for the purposes of developing Irish economic activity and, consequently, increasing the attractiveness for employers to take on more employees. Such initiatives have been developed in <Col N="379" /> the spirit of the Culliton report's findings, i.e. that of improving industrial performance, as a means to creating additional job opportunities. Some of these initiatives have been relatively recent developments. The following paragraphs indicate measures which are in place and which, amongst other objectives, are intended to have the effect of increasing the numbers of job opportunities in Irish business.</P>
      <P>PRSI</P>
      <P>In his 1994 Budget Statement the Minister for Finance announced a re-structured system of PRSI which included reductions of employers' contribution rates for lower paid employees. It is anticipated that this measure will assist in both the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs in labour-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>Task Force on Small Business</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Small Business was a Government initiative to see what measures were needed to develop the full potential for small businesses to create additional job opportunities. This task force reported on its findings in March 1994, and this report included many recommendations which would have the effect of increasing the job creation incentive for small Irish businesses.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of this report and its recommendations, I am at the moment establishing a small business/service unit within my Department which will be responsible for developing the ideas which have been identified in this report, and promoting job creation in the small business/service sectors generally.</P>
      <P>Finance for Business/Industry</P>
      <P>One of the principal constraints on the development of Irish indigenous industry and consequently employment has been identified as the difficulty of obtaining adequate development funding. In order to provide greater access to development funding in future a number of developments have taken place:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> A. £100 Million Preferential Loan Scheme</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government established a loan scheme which provides low interest rate long term loans to small industries. I understand that applications for such facilities already substantially exceed the £100 million arranged.</P>
    <P>B. County Enterprise Boards</P>
    <P>The County Enterprise Development Board scheme will provide start up/development funding to many Irish businesses and consequently is expected to increase the number of job opportunities in the business sector for the future.</P>
    <P>C. Venture Capital</P>
    <P>Within the Operational Programme for Industry provision has been made for an allocation of EC Structural Fund resources for the promotion of venture/seed capital initiatives over the period of the operational programme. Such resources will be allocated to qualifying seed/venture capital funds and will increase the flow of seed/venture capital funding to projects which have the potential for further development and consequently additional job creation in the future.</P>
    <P>The above initiatives are perhaps the principal initiatives which are now in place and which increase the incentives for employers to create more job opportunities in Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that the creation of a positive business environment that is conducive to the expansion of job opportunities in the Irish economy is a constant priority, both for myself as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and officials in my Department.</P>

      <P>The principal guidelines governing grants to indigenous industry are contained in the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1993. Since its establishment on 1 January 1994 these guidelines have applied to Forbairt.</P>
      <P>In addition to the legislative guidelines referred to, negotiating guidelines exist, the purpose of which is to assist project officers in evaluating and giving grant indications on specific projects. These guidelines, which are reviewed annually, reflect the legislative guidelines and policy changes made from time to time and, in order to facilitate a smooth transition to the new agency, Forbairt has been operating under the 1993 guidelines pending their detailed consideration by the new board.</P>
      <P>New guidelines will require the approval of my Department and, of course, are strictly confidential.</P>

      <P>The following are eligible to participate in community employment, which has replaced the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme: Persons 21 years or over in receipt of unemployment assistance, all persons in receipt of unemployment benefit for over a year, all persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance for over one year and other special categories e.g. referrals by the NRB and persons combining a period on the live register with a period on a recognised programme.</P>
      <P>Women, including deserted wives and widows who come under any of the above categories are eligible to participate.</P>
      <P>Due to limited resources, it is not possible to provide employment scheme opportunities for all unemployed persons and as such the available opportunities are targeted at particular categories.</P>
      <P>The details of the pilot programme based on the CMRS concept are being finalised at present in consultation with representatives of the CMRS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Wage subsidies can be a legitimate element in the menu of active labour market measures engaged in by Government with a view to influencing the market &mdash; determined level or distribution of employment. Research suggests, however, that it is an instrument which must be used with caution because of the potential deadweight costs that can arise from the fact that the employment may have occurred in any event, and also because of the potential it can have to lead to employment substitution and displacement. Consequently, it is best used as a closely focused and targeted instrument aimed at overcoming particular difficulties or indeed prejudices that some groups such as the long term unemployment may face in accessing the labour market. FÁS currently operates the employment incentive scheme (EIS) which aims to encourage employers recruit additional employees from among long term unemployed persons, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons. This scheme is operating at capacity level relative to the budgetary provisions for it this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I told the House last month, in response to another parliamentary question, the continued value of the EIS and indeed to somewhat comparable enterprise scheme is being assessed in the light of developments and initiatives in the sphere of enterprise promotion and support currently being put into place including the county enterprise boards, the extended area partnership arrangements, Leader II and the social welfare back to work allowance scheme which, to an extent, overlaps with the EIS and the enterprise scheme. In that context my concern will be to ensure that measures remain in place to assist and encourage <Col N="384" /> unemployed people to secure employment or to start their own business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period after I took up office last year, I arranged for a review to be undertaken of the decision of the then Government in October 1992 to establish county enterprise boards. Arising from that review, I secured the approval of the Government to a refocusing of the objectives and operational structure of these boards so as to ensure that they would have a specific enterprise development mandate. There are now 35 boards in existence operating on a nationwide basis.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the review exercise undertaken at my request, I decided that county enterprise boards should not assume responsibility for certain other local initiatives to which reference had been made in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993 to 1997.</i> The employment, training, education and community development needs of disadvantaged areas, including the deployment of community employment schemes, are more appropriately the responsibility of area partnership companies, which operate as a parallel measure under the local development programme.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of each county enterprise board are to focus, develop and support local entrepreneurship and enterprise within the framework of a coherent, integrated county enterprise action plan so as to build a local economy of real strength and permanence which will give jobs and wealth sufficient to its needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards can have an important role <Col N="385" /> to play in tourism promotion at county level. They will be able to draw upon the expertise within the regional tourism organisations in an appropriate and effective manner when individual tourism projects are being evaluated. The boards will also liaise with the new county tourism committees, announced last year by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, in formulating the tourism component of the county enterprise action plan which each board is required to draw up.</P>

      <P>I understand from Forfás that the grant cost per job created and sustained in companies grant aided by the former IDA in the period 1987-93 was £12,783. This figure is based on the sum of all IDA grant payments over a seven year period, divided by the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of that period.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of this calculation, a first time job is defined as the increase in employment in a company over and above the peak employment level in the previous five years and related to a specific investment programme agreed with the IDA, or Forbairt and IDA Ireland as it is now.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the motion adopted by the Women's Conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which was held on 4-5 March 1994. I am anxious that any differential in wage rates between males and females, based on gender discrimination, should be eliminated. However, I am not certain that this would necessarily be achieved by the imposition of a statutory minimum wage. Research on the experience of the introduction of a statutory minimum wage in other countries has shown that it can have a negative impact on employment levels. In this light and having regard to the current high levels of unemployment, I consider that it would be unwise to introduce any measures of this nature which could affect the prospects of those in or seeking employment, whether men or women.</P>
      <P>Recent research, conducted under the auspices of the ERSI, has shown that the existence of a wage differential between men and women can be attributed to a number of reasons, not all of which are based on discriminatory practices. In contemplating the reasons for the existence of a differential, factors such as age, labour market experience and hours of work must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have approached the question of an improvement in the position of the low paid, a considerable proportion of whom are women, through supporting the free collective bargaining system, operating in conjunction with joint labour committees. The pay terms of recent national programmes, including those of the <i>Programme <Col N="387" /> for Competitiveness and Work,</i> were specifically weighted in favour of those on low incomes. These, when taken together with the measures brought forward in this year's budget, have resulted in an appreciable improvement in the relative position of the low paid.</P>
    <P>In addition, the joint labour committee system, which covers sectors employing considerable numbers of women, has been significantly extended in recent years. The system now covers employees in the retail grocery and allied trades throughout the country and in the catering industry in the greater Dublin area. This means that a considerable number of women who previously had been excluded from the system will now enjoy its benefits.</P>

      <P>There were general elections in El Salvador on 20 March and voting for the presidential elections on both 20 March and 24 April. The Republican National Alliance, ARENA, emerged as the victor in both the general and presidential elections over a left-wing coalition including the FMLN.</P>
      <P>There are over 1,500 co-operatives in El Salvador, benefiting some 300,000 of the country's poorest people. Most of them were established during the long civil war in areas under FMLN control.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas has been working in El Salvador for many years. Working with community-based non-governmental organisations and co-operatives is the cornerstone of its work.</P>
      <P>APSO has recently agreed to provide three trainers to an autonomous State institute, INSAFOCOOP, which provides basic training to co-operative workers. APSO consulted the leaders of the co-operative movement, COASES and CONFRAS, and received their full backing before agreeing to the request. The FMLN, which still maintains close links with the co-operatives, has written to me as recently as this month strongly supporting the technical assistance offered by APSO to INSAFOCOOP. I am, therefore, satisfied that APSO's role does not call into question the principles underlying our relations with El Salvador or the objectives of our official aid programme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent concerns expressed by trade unions as outlined by the Deputy. Forms C45 are completed by principal contractors on making payment to uncertified sub-contractors. Where such payments are made the principal contractor must deduct tax at 35 per cent on the gross amount of the payment without making any deductions for expenses or personal allowances. The C45 system should not be availed of in situations where the employer-employee rules should apply. As part of their audit programmes the Revenue Commissioners seek to ensure that the C45 system is not used inappropriately. Since the trade union concerns came to light the Revenue Commissioners have been more vigilant to ensure that there is no abuse of the system.</P>
      <P>Arising from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> two reviews of the C45 system are currently taking place. Firstly, I have asked the monitoring group on the black economy to carry out a thorough review and to make recommendations on action to curb abuse and to improve the system generally. As part of this review the group will be looking at the adequacy of the current tax enforcement arrangements for the industry.</P>
      <P>A second review is being carried out within the Revenue Commissioners, to check the extent and reality of any movement from employment to sub-contracting. In view of the concerns which have been raised in relation to the C45 system the Revenue Commissioners have been asked to take measures to ensure that the system is applied only to genuine sub-contract situations and are having discussions with the Department of Social Welfare to see if procedures can be strengthened further.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of crimes being committed against motorists in Seville Place, Dublin 1. They are taking special measures in the area to combat this type of crime. These measures include the operation of special additional mobile patrols, particularly at the times of greatest risk, and the targeting of those persons suspected of being involved in this type of crime. The Divisional Task Force together with dog patrols are available as back up if considered necessary.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are confident that these measures, along with the increased powers now available to gardaí under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 to deal with this type of situation, will lead to an improvement in the level of crime in the vicinity of Seville Place.</P>

      <P>The report is at present being considered by my Department in conjunction with the industrial development agencies and other institutions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the report, the cost of developing such a park would be a minimum of £20 million. The report does not envisage any participation by the private sector in establishing such a project but recommends that it be entirely funded by the national Exchequer and EU Structural Funds. The proposal would, therefore, have to be examined against the background of the limited resources <Col N="395" /> available to the Exchequer and, in particular, the amount of co-financing which will be available for R&amp;D/industrial development under the European Regional Development Fund in the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of science parks and our national policy in respect of such developments is one of the issues which will be examined by the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council which has been set up by the Minister with responsibility for commerce and technology and which has been asked to report by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Where a redundancy, as defined in the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-91 has taken place, an eligible employee must be given notice in writing of the proposed dismissal. Form RP1 must be used for this purpose. A duplicate copy of the notice, fully completed, must be sent to my Department at the same time as it is given to the employee. These are legal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has no record of such notice having been received in respect of the person on whose behalf the Deputy inquires. Neither does my Department have any record of an application by the person concerned for payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund on the basis that her employer refused to pay a statutory redundancy entitlement. <Col N="397" /> Under the Redundancy Payments Act, responsibility for the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement rests in the first instance with the employer. Accordingly, if the person concerned considers that she is entitled to a statutory redundancy payment which she has not received, she should approach her former employer with a view to obtaining this entitlement. If the former employer refused or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, the employee can then apply to my Department for payment from the Social Insurance Fund. Such an application must be supported by evidence of entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a Redundancy Certificate (Form RP2) issued by the former employer or, where entitlement is contested by the former employer, a decision from the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 7, 10, 32, 72 and 77 on 30 March 1994, the changes in arrangements for distribution and delivery of mail in the Dublin area which were introduced in January 1994 gave rise to two main problems &mdash; the question of next day deliveries and the timing of deliveries in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available to An Post from the Market Research Bureau of Ireland for the week commencing 11 April 1994 show that overall 91 per cent of correctly addressed mail was delivered the next working day. This is the second month in a row where overall deliveries have exceeded 90 per cent and the company is now confident that by and large it has resolved this particular problem.</P>
      <P>In relation to the time of delivery the principal problem was in the Dublin 2 area which has the highest concentration of businesses in the country. An Post made some further changes in this area recently and the service has improved considerably since then. Surveys of customers in the area now indicate that 94 per cent of business customers are satisfied with the time their mail is delivered compared to 22 per cent in March. Some 60 per cent of customers surveyed are getting letters delivered before 9.30 a.m. with only 13 per cent getting deliveries after 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>An Post is continuing to monitor the position in this and other postal areas of Dublin and will endeavour to resolve any problems that arise to the satisfaction of their customers.</P>

      <P>The management, organisation and provision of services in the health board geriatric hospitals are the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. This necessarily involves the identification of staffing requirements and deployment of staff having regard to the particular service needs of the geriatric hospitals within the overall context of the budgetary and employment constraints which apply.</P>
      <P>Under existing procedures, it is a matter for each health board to identify and submit to my Department on a monthly basis prioritised applications for the filling on a permanent basis of all new and replacement posts. My Department's review of the proposals is undertaken bearing in mind the service and personnel criteria and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to private nursing homes, <Col N="413" /> the Deputy will be aware I commenced the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September 1993. The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, also came into effect on the same date. Under the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the nursing home must ensure that a medical practitioner of the dependent person's choice or acceptable to that person is available to ensure that he or she receives appropriate medical care; a medical practitioner is available to attend the person in the nursing home and to be on call for emergencies; a nurse is on duty at all times; and a sufficient number of competent staff are on duty at all times having regard to the number of persons maintained therein and the nature and extent of their dependency.</P>
    <P>A guide to the nursing homes legislation is in preparation which will provide health boards and nursing home proprietors with advice in deciding whether the numbers and type of staff on duty are adequate to meet the needs of residents of a home.</P>

Additional funding of £1.7 million has been provided to the South Eastern Health Board for the development of various mental handicap services in 1994. Discussions are in progress between my Department and the health board concerning the precise services to be put in place. I have been assured by the South Eastern Health Board that the person referred to will be provided with a residential place as soon as possible. Home support services will be provided, if the family so wish, in the interim period. I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <P>Plays are set only in English, although the reading of Greek in translation may form part of classical studies.</P>
      <P>At junior certificate there will not be a prescribed play in 1995. Only at the higher level examination will it be necessary to answer questions on drama. Candidates will be given two unseen extracts from plays, one from a Shakespearean play and one from a non-Shakespearean play. They will have to answer on one or other. There will also be general questions on drama and candidates may use their knowledge of any play or plays in their answering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At leaving certificate in 1995 higher level candidates will have three sections on their literature paper &mdash; drama, poetry, fiction. They will have to answer one question from each section and one other question of their choice. In 1995 they will have to answer one question on <i>Macbeth</i> (Shakespeare). Then if they so choose they may answer as their fourth question a question on <i>Murder In The Cathedral</i> (T. S. Eliot) or <i>Philadelphia Here I Come</i> (Brian Friel) or <i>St. Joan</i> (G. B. Shaw). At ordinary level candi <Col N="416" /> dates will be required to deal with one play only from the three plays <i>Macbeth, Philadelphia Here I Come and Arms and the Man</i> (Shaw).</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the choice prevailing at each level. I am of course open to considering whatever recommendations for reform of the leaving certificate English courses may be made by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
